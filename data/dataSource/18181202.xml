            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, the 25th of May, about half-past five o'clock, I was passing the prosecutor's house - the kitchen window was then fast. I saw through the railings that there were two silver spoons, in some dirty dishes there; about a quarter of an hour after, I found the staple drawn, and the window forced open - the spoons were gone. Before this I had met the prisoner and another boy coming down the lane, about twenty paces from the prosecutor's house - coming towards it - I said nothing to them. When I found the window broken open, I suspected them. I went in pursuit, and overtook the prisoner in Golden-square, I took him to the watch-house, and found two silver table-spoons on him, which were delivered to Needham.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How did you see the spoons - A. It is a wooden flap with bars to it - I saw them through the bars.</p>

I heard glass break, and saw the prisoner run-across the road, from the spot, with something white in his hand - I endeavoured to stop him, but did not succeed till he got into Exeter-street, I then caught hold of his coat; he fell down, and I fell over him. I took six forks from under him, and gave them to Mr. Debney immediately before I got up - it was quite dark, with assistance I took him back to Mr. Needham - Debney went with us, and took the forks - I did not see the prisoner break the glass, but he ran from where it was broken.</p>

I have two little dogs, they barked violently about three o'clock in the morning - it did not alarm me, as they often bark. I have found none of my property, except two paintings.</p>

I left the shop immediately after, and in about five minutes, my servant came, and said a person had offered a picture, answering the description in the bill, which she had given me. I went into the shop, and found Corderoy there - he produced the picture, and asked four or five shillings on it. I stooped down to take up the printed bill, as soon as he saw me rise with it in my hand, and begin to read it, he ran away. I sent two of my young men to pursue him, in about a quarter of an hour they brought him back. I then sent for an officer - he was searched by Attfield, in my presence, and in the lining of his pantaloons were found, two duplicates of three shift, among others. The picture was two cows, and a milkmaid.</p>

I turned my head, and saw the prisoner Corderoy, running by my house - several people were pursuing him. I ran out, and took him in Willow-walk. He said it was only a fight, and asked me to let him go - I refused. A mob of about twenty men interrupted us - I secured him - the prisoner Wood was one of them. Some people came to my assistance - I kept hold of him. I am certain Wood was one of them, by his voice, dress and size. I was struck by three or four different people - I believe he was one who struck me. I took Corderoy to Walker's, and gave him in charge of Attfield.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of October, the morning of the robbery, I went to Thorley's house, and examined it. I found the outside window shutter in the parlour had twenty or thirty holes bored with a gimblet - a piece was taken out, large enough for me to get my hand in - there was a broken square of glass, through which they might undo the catch, and open the window - Reeves gave me a hat, which they had left behind them. I have no doubt but it belonged to Corderoy - I used to see him every day, and believe it to be his. She also gave me the burner of a lamp, it appeared to have been burning that night. It was taken out of a lamp, at the door of the King's Head public-house, near the prosecutor's house. She also gave me a chisel, and two phosphorus matches, one of which had been lit. On Friday, October the 29th, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner Corderoy, close to my house, with a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020005"/>bundle under his arm. I went into a public-house to deliver a parcel which I had, when I came out he was gone. In about half an hour I went to the office, and found him in the custody of Attfield. I then went to a house in Greengate-garden, Hackney-road, where both the prisoners lived together - I knew Corderoy lived there. I knocked at the door, but nobody was at home. I broke it open, and found a gimblet in the cupboard, which fitted the holes in the shutter. I found five skelleton, one picklock, and one droplatch key. I also found a piece of painting, of some shipping, cut to pieces, which the prosecutor claimed. Also part of a gilt frame, three napkins, a shirt, a handkerchief, the knob of a brass fender, a pair of drawers, and twelve plaited buttons. As I returned, I met the prisoner Wood, going towards the house. I stopped him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Your name is George". He said it was not. I said, I was sure it was, and asked him where he lived?. He said, in Wentworth-street. I asked him if he knew

On the 6th of October the prisoner was brought to my house, by a man named Smith, to buy my mare - he offered me a 10 l. note for it; he agreed to give me 11 l. for it if I would grant him three days trial; he said it was for his father, who lived at Whitford, near Ware, in Hertfordshire. I agreed to let him have three days trial if he would let me have 11 l. He requested me to lend him the bridle and saddle, which he was to return in three days. When I expected the money he gave me a bill for 20 l.; I expressed a doubt about it, upon which he referred me to Mr. Kell, who lived a few doors off. My stable is contiguous to the house. I called out of the window to the servant to put on the saddle and bridle, and told the prisoner to go round to the stable; in the intermediate time I went to Mr. Kell to make inquiry about the bill, which was not satisfactory; on my return I found the prisoner gone with the horse, saddle, and bridle. I gave him no authority whatever to take it away.</p>

               <p>Q. If you had got the money for the bill, you would have been content to part with the horse - A. I was aware I could not get the money, the bill was not endorsed. I found that out afterwards. I was not gone above three minutes to Mr. Kell's. I intended when I returned, to tell the prisoner whether I would take the bill or not.</p>
               <p>Q. On his giving you the bill, you told the servant to saddle the mare, and told the prisoner to go round to the stable - A. I did. The bill was due on the 20th of November, I did not present it - the money was offered to me before it was due, but after the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. When was he apprehended - A. Near a month after - he never called for the change. I met him in the Old Bailey, and asked him if his name was not Mason - he said it was. I had an officer with me, and gave him in charge for felony. He said,</p>
               <p>"Felony! what felony?" and asked who I was. I said you remember having a horse of me, I live in the Strand. He said he remembered buying it. I told him he would find it something besides buying. My saddle and bridle were sent to me after his apprehension. I have since seen the mare.</p>

            . I am a ward-beadle. On the 1st of June, 1812, I found the last witness with a cask of mustard under his arm, and a little boy, about eleven years old, in his custody, who was crying. Rowland said he had stolen the mustard; the child said he had not, and asked me to fetch his father, who was the prisoner, and that he lived in Still-alley. I went there, and found the prisoner standing by the fire. I asked him where his son was, he said he had just sent him out to Mr. Vincent's with a barrel of mustard. I told him the mustard had been stolen within the last half hour; he said that was a lie, for he had had it in his house ever since Monday. I said he must go with me. As we went along, he said he could not think why I had such a spite against him. I told him he knew why; he said,</p>
               <p>"don't you think I am a better judge than to send it out if it was not all right." I took him to my house, where the boy was. The prisoner asked leave to go into the yard; he passed through my back parlour, where the cask was, he took it up, and said if they will swear to this, they will swear to anything. The officer took him away; he afterwards absconded, and was never heard of. I have been looking for him several times, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has not the prisoner been about the town for the last three years - A. I believe he has; when I went to his house he did not appear ill. He had his shoes and hat on.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The charge is entirely false. Davis asked if my boy was at school, I said I hoped he was - I found he was in custody, and told them to let him go, and take me; he told me to attend before the magistrate. A Jew, who owes me a spite, told Davis to do his duty, and take me, as I was indicted; hearing this I surrendered.</p>

The prisoner, Brown, passed me on the outside. I found my handkerchief safe, I took no notice of him, but walked on - I kept feeling if my handkerchief was safe. When I came within a few yards of Giltspur-street, by St. Sepulchre's church, I felt something touch my pocket again - I felt, and missed my handkerchief. I immediately turned round, and saw the prisoner Brown, close to me, and two men close to him, covering him - all three were in motion, with their hands moving. I seized all three, and said,</p>
               <p>"one or the other of you has got my handkerchief, give it to me". They all denied it - I said I would take them to the watch-house, and give them all in charge, as I was certain one of them had it. The two men became violent, and said they would not go to the watch-house, as they knew nothing about it. I looked on the ground, and saw my handkerchief lying there - there was nobody but the prisoners and myself near. The two men got from me - I kept hold of Brown, and picked up my handkerchief - I tried to take hold of the two men, but they retreated. One or two persons came up, I asked their assistance - they got as far as Giltspur-street. I called out Stop thief! and saw one of them stopped, about fifty or sixty yards off, on the pavement - it was Swain - the other kept in the middle of the road, and got away. I went up to Swain, and found a man lying on the ground, and Swain holding him, and saying,</p>
               <p>"This is him, I have got him" - he was holding Attfield, and said he was the man. I took him to the Compter with Brown.</p>

He said he had been at a farm of Mr. Preston's, about three or four miles from Sewardstone, but as Mr. Preston had nineteen sheep stolen, he was taken to the other farm to look after them, and that he was going home to Sewardstone with a load of dung, and the other carter was going home empty - that he could not get home till he returned, as he had one of his horses. He and I went to the corner of the Old Bailey together, to meet the carter. He said the carter had ordered him to stop there till he came, and he would send him to me. I left him there, and in about an hour the carter came to say the things were gone from the George, and that the girl had delivered them to the man, who brought the gin with me. I said it was his fellow-servant. He said he had never seen him before. I said they were concerned together, and if they were not found, he should pay for them - I have never found them.</p>

            , ESQ. I live at Uxbridge. On Wednesday, the 4th of November, about twelve o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020013"/>at noon, I met the prisoner at Uxbridge, at this end of the town, which is in Middlesex. I was in my gig with Mr. Norton - the prisoner was riding a brown gelding, and leading a roan gelding - each of them were in halter, and not saddled. I wanted to buy a roan horse, and asked if they were for sale? he said Yes. The roan horse was too small for me, and I declined buying it. He said the price of the brown horse, was 25 guineas, or 40 l. for the two. I said to Mr. Norton, in the prisoner's presence, that the brown horse was worth all the money. Mr. Norton asked where he brought them from? He said from Tilekiln Farm, near Oxford, and that he was taking them to London to sell, but to no particular place. From the price he asked, and his general conduct, Mr. Norton immediately charged him with stealing them; the prisoner said if he thought so, he was willing to leave them with him. He said he had been detained at Beaconsfield the night before on suspicion, but was released by the magistrate. Mr. Norton offered to give him the price for the horses, and lodge the money in the Bank, and if he found his story correct, he would pay him. He followed us to Mr. Norton's house - as soon as he got there, he loosed the roan horse, and gallopped away on the brown one. We pursued, and took him - he was stopped in a lane which he ran down, at the gate, which was locked. He got off the horse then, and ran over two fields - I got on the horse, overtook him, and brought him back to Uxbridge. I neither promised or threatened him - I asked him whom the horses belonged to?. He said,</p>
               <p>"As soon as I get out of the croud, I will tell you." I took him to Mr. Norton's house. He then said the brown horse belonged to Mr. Brown, of Chesrelton, and the roan horse to Mr. Washbourne, of Overton - I gave him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the horses - A. They were put in Mr. Norton's stables, and sworn to by the prosecutors, and their servants.</p>

            , and the prisoner both there together - I went out of the taproom, and Dye followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anything pass between you and Dye before you saw the prisoner - A. No, Dye followed me out - the prisoner was not present. I afterwards told him what Dye had said.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you may tell us what you told the prisoner, that Dye had told you - A I asked Dye if he had seen Jolly, meaning, 
               <persName id="t18181202-24-person321">
                  Joseph

             said No, he was sure he was done, and if you want any at any time, we will serve you. I understood him to mean, the prisoner and he would serve me. Dye told me to call 
               <persName id="t18181202-24-person322">

             out, which I did, and Dye went away,</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner - A. The first that I said to him, was, that I had agreed with Dye to take one at 7 s. 6 d. He said very well. I gave him 7 s. 6 d. He then told me to meet him at Blackfriars-bridge, at three o'clock - we separated. I met him at three o'clock on the middle of Blackfriars-bridge - on the right hand side going from the City.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed - A. He said I could not have it till five o'clock, and to meet him under the dead wall of Waterloo-bridge. I went there at five o'clock - he came about half-past five - he put a note towards me, and said, catch hold - I took it. He then asked if I should want any more that night. I said No, but I would take five 1 l. notes, on Monday, and I would be at the Coach and Horses about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020014"/>ten or eleven o'clock on Monday. We parted. I went home, and opened the parcel which he gave me, it contained a 1 l. bank note. I marked it that night, and took it to Sellers next morning. He and I went to the Bank to Mr. Rooker on Monday, and I believe Sellers gave it to him (looks at one), this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. You was to meet him on Monday; before you met him was any more money given you - A. Yes. Sellers gave me 1 l. 15 s., about an hour before I met him, to purchase five 1 l. forged notes of Williams - I had been informed that if I took five, I could have them at 7 s. each. I went to the Coach and Horses - in about half an hour Dye came in - I gave him the money which I had received of Sellers - about ten minutes after I saw the prisoner there. He and Dye went out of the taproom together, and I followed them - Dye said to the prisoner, he wants five 1 l. notes, (meaning me) - that it was all right, and he had got the money. The prisoner then told me to go on Waterloo-bridge, and he would follow me. I went out and saw the prisoner almost directly as I got into Drury-lane. We walked a little way together, and then he stopped talking to somebody. I went on into the Strand - he then overtook me, and we went over Waterloo-bridge together - we went to a public-house, called the Hero of Waterloo. He said I had better wait there while he fetched them, and he should be gone about half an hour - he did not go into the house with me. I went in and waited about half an hour, and he returned - I was sitting in the taproom, having a pint of beer. He sat down a few minutes, and then asked if I would walk - I said Yes - we walked into the Waterloo-road. He then asked when I should want any more. I said I would take ten 1 l. notes on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any reason for it - A. I told him I was going to Kingston on Friday, where I thought I could pass them; he them told me to meet him at the Green Man, Kent-street, Borough, at nine o'clock on Thursday morning, and he would have them there. He then put five 1 l. notes into my hand - we were then in the Waterloo road; we parted. I took the notes to the Woolpack, in Gravel-lane, to Mr. Freeman, the bank inspector. I had appointed to meet him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark the five 1 l. notes - A. Yes, in about twenty minutes after I had them (looks at five), these are them; this was on the 9th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. You was to meet him at nine o'clock in the morning on Thursday the 12th, did you receive any money from anybody - A. Yes; on Thursday morning Sellers gave me 2 l. 10 s. in silver, and a 1 l. note, to buy ten forged 1 l. notes of the prisoner. I had told him that I had agreed to meet the prisoner. At nine o'clock on Thursday morning, I went to the Green Man, into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody there - A. Yes, 
               <persName id="t18181202-24-person323">

            , the son of the constable; in a few minutes the prisoner came in and sat down by me - Coates was almost facing us; the prisoner asked me if I had got the money, he spoke in a very low voice. I said, Yes. He said he wanted it. I gave him the 1 l. note first, and the 50 s. afterwards - he put it into his pocket without counting it; he then said I could not have them until six o'clock at night, in Monument-yard. I said very well. He went away directly. I went and told the three constables.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Monument-yard that evening - A. Yes, about five minutes before six, the prisoner came to me as the clock struck; he spoke first, and said come on, and asked if I had any one with me? I said, No, not a soul. He then asked when I should want any more? I said I should want five on the Monday. We walked out of Monument-yard, up Pudding-lane, through George-lane, into Botolph-lane, he there put ten 1 l. notes into my hand, and wished me a good night - we parted; he ran up towards Little Eastcheap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then see anybody - A. Yes, I met Sellers and Furzeman, just at the corner of George-lane - I had not then received the notes a minute - the constables pursued the prisoner. I went immediately to the Bank, and marked the notes at the solicitor's office there, in the presence of Mr. Jeffries, who is one of the clerks (looks at ten), these are the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Nobody was present that knew anything of it but you - A. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been a witness before in a case of this kind - A. Never in my life, not in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been a witness before in any case of this kind - A. I have twice, and not more; it was against Edwards and a woman who lived with him; they are not tried.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you a witness before the justice against Cashman - A. No, I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you left off calico printing - A. About seven months; I have been a porter in Thames-street, and worked in different calico grounds. I was in the coal trade about three months ago; I worked for my cousin, who was master, and had a shop in Northampton-street, Clerkenwell; he also carried on business in Gravel-lane - nowhere else that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he never carried on business elsewhere, and you with him - A. I think I can; not in the coal trade; he was once a lawyer's clerk, in the Temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any warrants out against you for poaching - A. Not that I know. I live at No. 17, Pitt's-place, Maid-lane, Bankside, and have lived there nearly three months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you taken up this trade that you are in to day - A. The 28th of October was the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, you have only met the prisoner, and Edwards and his wife - A. There was another man, named Strandley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody present, the first time you met the prisoner - A. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time were any present - A. Only two I believe - I did not know them, but I heard them call the prisoner by name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Coates hear what passed at the Green Man - A. He was in one corner of the room, and we in another. When the prisoner came in, I said,</p>
               <p>"How are you, my bonny." I do not think he could hear anything else.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Did the two persons at the public-house appear to know the prisoner - A. Yes - they spoke to him, and called him by his name.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes, and have been so upwards of twenty-five years. I am enabled to judge of the character of notes (looks at the note set forth in the indictment, uttered with others on the 12th), it is forged in every respect, paper, plate, and signature; it is not C. Tabor's signature, nor is it signed by any person authorized to sign bank notes; the other nine uttered at the same time, are all forged, and of the same description, struck from the same plate, and filled up alike - they are the same manufacture throughout (looks at five sold to Underwood on the 9th of November), they are all forged, and the same in every respect. (Looks at the one sold on the 7th) It is forged, and of the same description and plate as the others. The one uttered to Mr. Chalmers is also forged, and of the same description as the other sixteen in every respect; I mean they are the same plate and paper, and signed by the same person, but not the same signature.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. Used you to be longer at first in examining notes than now - A. It certainly wants experience. I was never mistaken in a note.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read. See Indictment.)</p>
               <p>MR. GLOVER re-examined. The water-mark in bank notes is made at the time the paper is made, but this note has a representation of a water-mark, which is made afterwards by pressure.

On the 19th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, I was writing at the desk in the counting-house, the shopman was serving. I thought the prisoner came in a curious kind of way, he appeared very careless, and, as I thought intoxicated. He said,</p>
               <p>"Will you let me have two pounds of cheese, and one pound of bacon." I came into the shop, by that time my man had cut him two pounds of cheese, he threw down a 1 l. note; I took it up, and immediately knew it to be forged, and asked his name, he said</p>
               <p>"Walker." I asked his master's name, he said it was Matthews, who lived at 35, Sutton-street. I told him I thought it was not a good note, and I could not give him change, and asked if he knew where he got it; he said of his master; I said I would go with him to his master. I wrote his name and his master's name and address upon the note - (looks at one.) - This is it. He said he would go with me. We went out immediately. I kept the note in my hand. We went to 35, Sutton-street. He wished me to walk first; I would not, but said I would walk behind. As we went along I communicated my suspicions to a watchman who stood in the street. I still kept the prisoner in sight; he was walking on before. When we got to 35, Sutton-street, he knocked at the door, a little girl opened it, he went in first, I followed; he went up to Mr. Matthews and spoke to him. I could not hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Matthews say anything to him - A. Nothing that I could hear. He saw me behind the prisoner, turned round, and asked my business. I asked if he knew that young man; he said he did. I asked if the man's name was Walker? He said No, it was

            , and he had been apprenticed to him. I asked if he had sent him to my shop for anything? He said No, he had not. I produced the note, and said I believed it was forged, and I would not give change for it, but if Matthews sent him for the goods, I would send them home, I told him that the prisoner said he took the note of his master. The prisoner heard all that passed. Matthews said, you had better go to his present master. I told the prisoner it was great impudence to bring me into a strange house, where he did not live. I turned round, saying</p>
               <p>"It is of no use stopping here," when Matthews's daughter called out</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! he has got a knife, and is going to stab you." I turned round, and seized him by the the right hand, his left was then under his apron; we were looking for the knife, and he struck me a violent blow on my head. The girl said she saw the knife glitter in his hand. I got behind him, threw him on the stairs, and said I would not leave him till I got the knife. The constables came in at that time. I told them what had happened. They were going to search him. He fought desperately, but was secured at last. Bell found the knife in his breeches. It was a clasp knife, open.</p>

Hutchinson produced a bank note, which I returned to him, and said that he was not my servant, but he was articled to Mr. Knight, of Gee-street, and he should go there, and not come to me.

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 19th of November I was on duty in St. John-street, about a quarter past eight o'clock. Mr. Hutchinson came by with the prisoner. Hutchinson held his hand out, and said to me,</p>
               <p>"I have got a smasher," which means a passer of bad money. I and Warner followed him to No. 35, Sutton-street. He and the prisoner went in. We staid rather behind, and listened at the parlour window, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020017"/>street door. I heard a faint scream, and something about stabbing, but could not tell what it was. We knocked at the door, were let in, and found Hutchinson standing in the passage, very much agitated, with the prisoner. We began to search the prisoner; they held his hands. I found the knife in the left thigh of his breeches, inside; it was open. We were going to secure his hands. He started back, and struck me a violent blow in the face. I collared him. He began kicking, striking, and beating me, and made a great resistance, and said, no b - y watchman should ever take him. We secured and took him to the watch-house. Immediately as we got out, we were assailed by a mob, who came out of a public-house opposite, and began to kick and strike us, to rescue him. He was resisting at the time himself. After a resistance of an hour and a half, we at last got him to the watch-house. Warner was present all the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not cut me with a cutlass, which made me strike you - A. No. I broke a stick about him in the street, as he resisted very much.</p>
               <p>- WARNER. I have heard Bell give his evidence. It is very correct. He did not use any violence to him until the attempt was made to rescue him. The prisoner hit him first. This was in the street.</p>

I asked him who he took it of? He said he had just took it of his employer. I gave him a pen and ink, and desired him to put the name on it, which he did in my presence.

             re-examined. (Looking at the notes.) I know Tabor's hand-writing well. I have been acquainted with it several years. I have often seen him write, and can take upon myself to say, on my belief, it is not his hand-writing; it is something like it; but it is not his. That uttered to Todd has Clough's name to it. I have known his writing several years. I have often seen him write and sign notes, and can judge well of it. I have not the least doubt of its not being his writing. That uttered to Hill and Mrs. Todd are signed A. Consett. I have frequently seen him write, and have often seen notes signed by him. It is not his hand-writing. Here is another, signed Pearson; he has been a long time a signing clerk in the Bank. I know his writing well. It is not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any clerk in the Bank authorized to sign notes on such paper as this - A. I know the Bank paper; they never use such paper as this. It has the water-mark put in afterwards. The Bank notes have the water-mark in the regular manufacture of the paper. The clerks have no authority to sign anything but genuine paper.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have there not been instances where the inspectors<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020018"/>of the Bank have differed in opinion respecting good or bad notes - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

I was close to him; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with taking his snuff-box, which he denied, and then produced it - the prosecutor claimed it; I took him into custody, and found four handkerchiefs, two in his waistcoat pocket, and several duplicates, a 1 l. note, two sixpences, and a bad shilling on him.

I turned round, and saw the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, and looked under her cloak, but did not see my handkerchief - nobody else being near, I suspected, and followed her towards the Bank, and saw by the motion of her arms that she was putting something into her pocket. At the corner of Bartholomew-lane, I saw her draw her hand from her cloak - I thought she was making a motion to somebody, a boy came to her, but did not speak to her. She went about half way down the lane, crossed over, and looked round. I went to her, and said, My good woman, you have got my handkerchief, and you had better give it back to me. She said she had not got it, and I might search her. I said I was sure of it, and if she gave it up, I would take no further notice. She still denied it, and said I was welcome to search. I said I had no power to search her myself, but I should send for an officer. She said I was welcome. I ordered her to walk before me to the Rose and Crown, Broad-street - I followed very close; when she got in, I begged of her to give it up to prevent any further trouble - she still denied it. I sent for an officer, he took her into a room up one pair of stairs, while he was searching her right hand pocket, I saw it fall from her petticoats, half of it was still in her clothes, she still denied it - it was mine.</p>

            . I live in Ropemaker-street, Moorfields about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw a man drive the horse and cart into my street, the man took two hind-quarters of an ox out, I do not know who he was, he took them into Scott's shop, in Type-street, and the cart drove away. I suspected something, and sent my son to see what name was on the cart, and I informed the prosecutor - I did not see the name on it myself.</p>

            . My father keeps a green-grocer's shop in Type-street. On the 10th of November, about eight o'clock in the morning, a man brought some meat there - I believe it was the prisoner, he asked if he might leave it there, I called up stairs to my mother, she did not object, and he left it. He called again between twelve and one o'clock for it.</p>

            . I am private watchman of the Adelphi. I heard a great noise coming down Durham-street, leading from the Strand, between six and seven o'clock in the morning. I went to the archway, and saw three men coming with a cart without a horse, I asked one of them who it belonged to, the prisoner said it belonged to Jones, and he was going to call him up. I said I should take them into custody; the men immediately ran up the street, the prisoner and another man ran towards the wharfs - I could not see them till I got to the water-side. I then struck at them, and the prisoner fell - I took him, the other got away. The prisoner said the men asked him to push the cart.</p>

On the 25th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, and bought two pair of worsted stockings, which came to 4 s.; he tendered me a 1 l. note, I thought it was not good, and kept it in my hand, I sent a little boy, named Newman, with it, to ask the opinion of Mr. Frost, next door, he brought it back to me - I do not know whether the prisoner heard him tell me that Mr. Frost thought it was not good. I then asked the prisoner where he took the note? He said he had it from his master. I did not like to give him change, or let him have the goods, and sent Newman into Mr. Berrie's with it, to inquire his opinion - he lives six or seven doors from me. While the boy was gone the prisoner said it was detaining him strangely. He went towards the door, staid there a minute or two, and then went away, saying he would return in two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he left did Newman return - A. In about five minutes, with the note - Berrie and Gill, the officer, came in with him, or immediately after, Newman gave me the note. The prisoner was brought back to the shop. I then marked the note in his presence, before I parted with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any mark on it when it was given to you - A. Yes, I observed the names of</p>
               <p>"Jones, Aldersgate-street," and</p>
               <p>"Glover, Bull-and-Mouth-street," on it, when he gave it to me, before I had parted with it (looks at one); I am sure it is the same note that he gave me, and the one Newman brought back. I marked D M 25-11-18, on it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the prisoner left was he brought back - A. In about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He waited till the boy returned from Frost's - A. Yes; he was at the counter, near enough to hear the boy say Frost thought it was bad - he did not speak very loud.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. After the note was first sent out, did you not return it to me, and asked if I wished it to be sent out again, and I said I did - A. Yes.</p>

On the 25th of November the prisoner came to the shop, my mistress gave me a note, which I took to Frost, he looked at it and returned it to me; I brought it back to my mistress, and told her what Frost said. It was never out of my sight. The prisoner was still there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think he could hear what you said - A. I do not know, I was on the other side of the counter, and he was opposite to me; I neither spoke very low nor very loud. My mistress sent me out again, I went and shewed it to Mr. Berrie's shopman, he gave it to Mr. Berrie - I did not lose sight of it; Mr. Berrie kept it in his hand, came out with me, and went to Mr. Payne's, he gave me the note there, and I returned it to my mistress.</p>

Newman brought a note to me between six and seven o'clock in the evening, on the 25th of November, I looked at it, and returned it to him again (looks at one), this is it. About five minutes after I went to Macpherson's, the prisoner was there, leaning on the counter. I said to Mrs. Macpherson, that I hoped she had not taken the note, as in my opinion, it was forged. The prisoner could hear it - no other person was present, the boy was not in the shop - the prisoner said it was his note, and that he had it of his master. I told him my opinion was, that it was bad. I went home, leaving him and Mrs. Macpherson in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing - A. In a few minutes I went to the shop again, and found Gill and Berrie there, but not the prisoner. I went home, returned again in a few minutes, and saw the prisoner crossing from a bookseller's shop on the opposite side of the way; he looked into the shop, and as soon as he saw Gill and Berrie he ran away as hard as he could - I pursued, and gave the alarm; he turned down St. Martin's-le-grand, and I lost him.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live in Newgate-street. On the evening of the 25th of November, Newman came to my shop with a note, he handed it to my man, who handed it to me, to know if it was good. I gave my opinion that it was bad. I noticed</p>
               <p>"Glover, Bull-and-Mouth-street," and</p>
               <p>"Jones, Aldersgate-street," on it (looks at it), this is it. I returned it to Newman, and took him next door to Mr. Payne's, he sent for an officer. I left Newman at Payne's, and went myself to see if I could see the person who had offered the note - I saw nobody but Mrs. Macpherson in the shop, and returned to Payne's - Gill, the officer, came, and we went back with the boy to Macpherson's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the shop, did anybody look in at the window - A. A short time after we got in, Frost said</p>
               <p>"there is the man looking in at the door." I then saw the prisoner at the door, which was open - he ran off. I, Frost, and Gill, pursued him. He ran down Saint Martin's-le-grand, up Queen's Head-passage, and was there taken. On coming up to him, after he was taken, he said</p>
               <p>"What do you want with me?" I do not know who took him. I believe I came up to him as soon as any one. I took him to Macpherson's. He was asked there who he took the note of - he said he knew the person who he took it of. I then asked him to put his name and address on it, and I believe Mrs. Macpherson handed him a pen and ink for that purpose. He said, why did I ask that question, that was nothing to me, and he should not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020021"/>write his name and address on it. I believe Mrs. Macpherson had also asked him to do it - the officer searched him, and found one shilling on him. He was asked where he lived, and refused to say - he was taken to the Compter, he gave the name of Jones there - I think he said

I said why don't you give your right name - He then said it was Howard.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes, (looks at the note,) it is forged - it is not impressed on Bank paper - such paper is never used by the Bank. This has the appearance of a water-mark, which is produced after the paper is made, which is not the case with the Bank paper, the engraving is not off any plate used by the Bank. The line with London and the date, appears to be engraved; in a genuine note it is printed in stereotype. It purports to be signed by N. Stock, but it is not his signature, as I have been acquainted with it for years.</p>

I asked him where, he said at Bath - I said I had been at Bath about four years ago, but I never recollected seeing him before. I said I was a servant, he said, he was also a servant out of place, and asked me to give him something to drink. I called for a pot of ale and paid for it - we drank it, and I left him there. The next time that I saw him, was about three months after, I met him accidentally in Bond-street, he asked me if I would give him anything to drink; I told him he was already tipsy, and did not want any more. He said he was in great need of something, and I gave him a glass of gin. I saw no more of him until the 17th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. State distinctly what passed then - A. On the 17th of November, about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, I was shutting up my master's dining-room shutters, and two men passed the door with the prisoner - I did not know that he knew where I lived. The prisoner returned, and rang at the door, I suppose he must have seen me - I went to the door. He asked if a person of the name of Randall lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know your name before - A. Not that I know; I had not told him, I said there was; he asked if I was the person. I said I was the person; he said then he wanted 5 l. of me - I asked him what demand he had on me for 5 l. He said he was in great distress, and money he wanted, and money he would have, and that of me. I said I had not got 5 l., or half that sum - he desired me then to get him 1 l. I said I had not got 1 l., he said if I had not got the money, I had the means to raise it. I told him I had no means to raise it. He then called me a b - y thundering b - g - r, and said if I did not instantly get it him, he would instantly dish me. He said that he would go in to my master, and ruin my character, and that he would swear to my master that I wanted to take diabolical liberties with him. I told him I had nothing but my character to depend upon for my living. He said that he knew, and if I valued my character more than a 1 l. note, I must stand by consequence. I again said I had no money to give him. He then hit my breeches-pocket, and said he heard money gingle there, and desired me to give him what I had got, which I did - it was 1 s., and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it induced you to give him that money - A. Under the idea of being charged with a diabolical act, which I feared would ruin my character - I was afraid of losing my character.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any fear of your person - A. No. I was afraid of losing my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any fear that he would go in to your master, and make the charge against you if you did not give it him - A. Yes - I was not afraid of being taken up for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did he say - A. On my giving him the money, he said you have got a watch - I said if I had, I should not give it to him - I had not got it about me. He desired me to go down and get some of my master's plate. I said I should not make away with my master's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020022"/>property. He said he knew I had some clothes - I said I had only one suit out of livery. He said he did not care what I had got, but money he would have or the value of it before he left the house, I then went down, and got him a blue frock-coat, which I gave him and he went away with it.</p>

               <p>Q. What induced you to give him the coat - A. The same cause I stated before - I was down stairs about five minutes getting the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of your fellow-servants during that time - A. No - I did not go to consult them, I was so agitated at the time, and a party of gentlemen were coming to dinner - I had not a minute to spare, when I took him the coat. He said he would pawn it, and return me the duplicate, nothing more passed - he went away, and was joined by his two companions, who were in Manchester-street.</p>
               <p>Q. On the following evening, while you was waiting at dinner, was there a ring at the bell - A. Yes, I was called out, and saw one of the people who accompanied the prisoner the night before. He said something to me - I answered him. I went outside the door, and saw the prisoner - in about a minute he said he had brought the duplicate of my coat, but he should not leave it until he had got a 1 l. note. I told him I had no money, and I should charge the first watchman who came by, with him. He said he did not care a d - n for the watchman or me either, and he was not going to be frightened. He then entered the door, and said he would be d - d if he would not remain there until I got him some money. I shut the inner door, and left him in the hall, between the street, and the inner door - the street door was open. I returned, and waited at dinner - in about an hour after, I went up and found him still there in the hall - he asked if I had got the money, I told him No. He said he was not going to be humbugged. I said if he would go out with me, I would see if I could get some for him. I then went out, and saw two persons standing at the corner of Manchester-street - my master's house is at the corner of the street. On my coming out, they went one way, and the prisoner, and I went together to Marshall-street, Carnaby-market. Not finding my acquaintance at home, I called upon Harrison, in Shepherd's-court, Brook-street, I saw him - I left the prisoner at the door. I came out in about two minutes, and found him waiting at the door - he asked me if I had got the money. I said, I had not got it, I could not, nor would not get it. When we got into Brook-street, he put himself in a posture before me, and said, d - n me, if you move until you have given me the money, and that he would go home to the house and blow up, if I did not instantly give him the money - I thought he meant he would go to my master's house. He said if he did not go himself, he would send one of his companions.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time were any persons at hand - A. Two soldiers were passing at the time. They stopped, and asked what he wanted with me. I said he wanted money - one of them said something to him, which I did not hear - one went and got a watchman, and advised me to have him taken up - the prisoner said something, which I did not hear, and the watchman took him. I went to the watch-house, in Mount-street, with him.</p>
               <p>Q. In going from Brook-street to Mount-street, did he say anything - A. I could not hear. A great mob were collected, and they were some way before me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What did you go so far with him for - A. To consult some person what I had better do. I saw Harrison who advised me to have him taken up, which I did immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you ever seen him before you met him at the public-house - A. Never. I am quite certain I never had any communication, or spoke to him before; nor have I had any communication whatever with him of any kind, except what I have mentioned; nor have I seen him at any other times. His threat was falsely to charge me with what I have stated.</p>

            . I am a private in the second regiment of Guards. On the 18th of November, about ten minutes after eight o'clock in the evening, I was passing at the corner of Brook-street, leading into Grosvenor-square, and heard the prisoner making use of very improper words to Randall. Nobody else was within hearing at that time. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Is that the way you speak to any person in the street?". He said,</p>
               <p>"Go along. I want to have nothing to say to you." I told him if that was the case, if he was speaking to me in that manner, I would take other methods with him. I told Randall he had better go along with me, as I was going towards Knightsbridge barracks; he appeared willing to go, and came a few paces with me, the prisoner immediately stopped him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are not going to go off in that manner, Randall. I want some money; I know you have some money, and a 1 l. note I must have." Randall said he had no 1 l. note to give him. The prisoner said he knew where Randall lived, and he would go and blow up there. I turned round and saw a watchman coming, with a gentleman, towards me. I gave him in charge. He went on towards Grosvenor-square, in the custody of myself and the watchman, a little way, when the prisoner said to the watchman,</p>
               <p>"This is not the man I have demanded the money of (meaning me); it is the other man. Let me go." Randall was following. I suppose he meant Randall, nobody else was by. I said,</p>
               <p>"No; watchman do your duty, and I will go with you to the watch-house." We took him there. When we got there, the prosecutor said the prisoner had pledged a coat of his; he heard it, and produced the duplicate, and offered it to Randall. I said</p>
               <p>"Do not take it. Give it to the constable," which was done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not come out of the house in the court, with Randall, in coloured clothes - A. No; I came quite accidentally. I did not know the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in your regimentals - A. No. I had every thing on, except my regimental coat and hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words you heard at first - A. He was only swearing at him.</p>

            . I am in the third regiment of Guards. On the 18th of November, a little after eight o'clock, I came across Grosvenor-square by accident. I heard a noise, and found the prisoner speaking to the prosecutor. They were strangers to me. I heard the prisoner say to the prosecutor,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, give me some money, for I am not going to stand here all day. I know where you live, and I will follow you home, if you do not give it to me now, and then I shall get it." I said to him,</p>
               <p>"That is very rough usage to give to a gentleman in the street;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020023"/>and told the prosecutor, if I was him, I would give him in charge of a watchman. There was none by at the time. The prisoner stood with his arms before him, and put himself in a posture. I thought he was going to strike me or the prosecutor. I put my hand up and pushed him back. He said he had nothing to do with such a blackguard as me. The watchman came directly and I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you dressed - A. I had white trowsers and my drill jacket on.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Wednesday night, the 18th of November, a little after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner nearly at the corner of Upper Brook-street and Grosvenor-square, the prosecutor and two soldiers were there also, and some more persons round.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner doing - A. He stood with his back against the railing. I heard one of the people say,</p>
               <p>"You are a d - d scoundrel, and ought to be given in charge of the watch." As soon as I got up, I asked what was the matter? Nabb, I believe, who was one of the soldiers, ordered me take him in charge. I laid hold of his arm. He went on with me towards Mount-street watch-house. As we went along the square he said</p>
               <p>"What business have you with me? I did not ask you for anything, nor demand any thing of you." That was all he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not somebody make an answer to it - A. Not that I heard. The prosecutor gave him in charge at the watch-house, for wanting to extort money from him, by pretending to lay a diabolical charge against him. The prisoner produced a duplicate to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody say anything to induce him to give it - A. Not that I know. I heard nothing said. It was given to the constable of the night by request of the prosecutor, and some other people that were present.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor met me in Covent-Garden, and asked if I had not been at Bath? I said I left there in February last, and had lived with Mrs. Jackson there. He said he knew her very well. He took me to a public-house. We came out at one o'clock. He asked me to walk down the Strand with him. I said I should be locked out if I did. He took me to Manchester-square, where he lived. I slept there in the servants' hall till the morning, and breakfasted with him and the cook. It rained, and I stopped there till one o'clock. He invited me to drink tea with him. I met him again in Fitzroy-square; after that in Bond-street, and, about two months ago I met him in Oxford-street. He said if I wanted 10 s. at any time he would give it to me. I went to him on this evening, and asked him to lend me a 1 l. note. He said he had not got it, but he should have it in a few days, as he was going to leave his place, which he has. He lent me his coat to pledge. I was to return him the ticket. Another person pledged it, and I took him the duplicate. He said if I would wait till he had done dinner, he would get me the remainder of the 1 l, I walked to a house with him, he went in and returned out of the house with the soldier. He said he wanted to go home. I asked him for the note he promised me. He called the watch, and gave me in charge. I never charged him with anything like what he has said.</p>

On the 8th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I discharged him for getting drunk with my other men. I had no words with him. My men usually leave work at six o'clock in the evening. About an hour after the prisoner was discharged I saw my trees all standing and safe. I have three or four thousand fruit trees growing there for profit.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discover anything wrong - A. Between eight and nine the next morning I went into the ground and found about fifty apple and pear trees cut down in one place; they were cut within a foot of the ground, apparently with a billhook.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any opinion whether they had been recently cut - A. They appeared to have been cut six or seven hours. Next day I found seventy more in another part of the garden, cut down in the same way. They all laid on the ground as they had fell, and were quite destroyed - they would not grow again. The trees were my own - I had planted most of them myself. I gave information, and had another man apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you plant any of those trees that were cut down - A. No, my brother did. I took the ground and bought the stock of him. All the property was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ARABIN. Q. The prisoner worked for you and your brother upwards of forty years - A. No. I believe he has been in the family twenty-five years. I turned him off for getting drunk two days before - he was not drunk at the time I turned him off.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not let a malicious and ill-disposed person be in his situation - A. Not if I had known it. He bore the character of a quiet man. My brother has no interest in the ground; I grow the trees to produce fruit, I do not sell the young trees.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they cut above the graft - A. Most of them were cut below the graft. They were from four to six feet high in the stem.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you particularly examine them, so as to able to swear whether they were cut above or below the graft - A. I will swear that forty of the apple trees were cut below the graft - I buy them ready grafted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the trees to see where they were grafted - A. These particular apple trees I had examined in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020024"/>Q. If they were cut above the graft, would they not, in the course of time, break out and bear fruit - A. I cannot say; I doubt whether they would, as I have cut them above the graft, and they did not bear. If the trees bear fruit again, they will not be quite destroyed, certainly, but they will be destroyed for many years. Some trees will break out again and bear fruit, and some may not.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose they are cut below the graft, will not the plumb stalk, or whatever they are grafted in, break out - A. If they do not get the canker they would be more likely to break out than before. If they were grafted on wild stocks they will break out again and flourish.</p>
               <p>Q. These wild stocks growing up and flourishing, can be again grafted - A. Yes, if they shoot.</p>
               <p>Q. You can use those trees again which were cut down, as grafts - A. If they live I can.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is it your opinion that they will or will not shoot - A. I have no doubt but some of them will shoot, but I have great doubts whether they will all shoot.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing they can be made productive, what time will it be before they can return you any profit - A. Five or six years - they produced profit before they were cut down. Some were cut below and some above the graft - part of them were the choicest apples; these were cut below the graft, as they were double grafted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you consider a fruit tree cut off below the graft, destroyed - A. The upper graft is quite destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of these cut below the first graft - A. I do not know, I am not confident; some of them have the stem of the graft, and some are wild.</p>
               <p>Q. If a tree is double grafted, and you cut the second graft and leave part of the first on the wild stock, will it not produce apples - A. Yes, if it should break out - some will break out, and some will not.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's gardener; the prisoner was discharged from his service. About seven o'clock the next morning I went into the grounds to work, and found a great many of the pear-trees cut down, some were haggled off, and some cut clear; they appeared to have been cut with a sharp instrument; two days after I found a great many apple trees cut down in the same way - I believe they were single grafted, but I do not know. Some were cut two feet from the ground, and some not above one. There were footmarks, as if somebody had got over the ditch - I do not know whether they were the marks of one or more persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think any of the trees will grow again, so as to produce fruit - A. They will grow again, but I think they will be longer coming than if new ones were planted.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Saturday evening, the 10th of October, I apprehended the prisoner near the Packhorse, at Turnham-green, within two hundred yards of his own house. I went to his house, and found an old billhook there; I searched further, and found another, concealed behind some firewood, by the side of the fireplace. I found another very good one, concealed under the staircase, among some more firewood. That found by the fire-place, appeared as if it had been cutting green wood - it was soiled with the sap of wood; the other two were very good and sharp. I was going to get a conveyance to take him to town, he asked me where I was going to take him? I said, to Clerkenwell. He said it was a bad job. I said it was. He said I acknowledge I was in the grounds that night, and took some greens, but I did not know what I did.</p>

I found two billhooks, one was very good, it was concealed in the chimney corner, with a sack, and a great deal of wood, over it - it appeared as if it had some sap or moisture on it. I produce it. I went on the Monday following, and found another. Just before I left the prisoner at the watch-house in town, I said to him,</p>
               <p>"Why you have admitted taking the greens out of the garden?" as I had been informed, he had - I asked him if he knew anything about the trees, and said it was a sad thing. I said nothing more - I neither threatened or promised him, he said No. I said</p>
               <p>"Why you have admitted taking the greens out of the same ground." He said, Yes, he did take them. I said</p>
               <p>"You got out of such a gap into such a lane." He said Yes, he did. I asked him if he remembered his foot slipping? he, said No. I asked him if he had not spilt some greens in getting over? He said he had. He then said he was not distressed, that he had got a good bit of money at home, and if I would make it right with Mr. Knevett, I should have the money. I told him if he would give me 100 l. I would not take it. Next morning he repeated what he had said about the money, but denied having taken the greens out of the ground.</p>

            . I am a labourer. In October, last I was out of employ - I met the prisoner on the 8th, near the Star and Garter, at Brentford, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon. I knew he worked for the prosecutor - I asked if he could tell me of any work. He said he could not, for he was after a job himself, that he and his partner were both discharged from Mr. Knevett's, for getting drunk, and he would be d - d if he would not be revenged, for he did not mind cutting every bl - dy tree about the place - I made him no answer - this was in the street.</p>

               <p>MR. ARABIN contended on the prisoner's behalf, that there was not that actual destruction of the trees, as came within the meaning of the Act; for an actual destruction of root and branch was necessary. That the words</p>
               <p>"Shall cut down, or otherwise destroy;" meant that there must be an actual destruction of the thing itself.</p>

He asked to look at some seals. I shewed him a tray of seals. He agreed to take two, which came to 7 l.; and they were laid aside for him. He took up another between his finger and thumb, and I saw him at the same time, with his little finger put one into the palm of his hand: he then had his right hand across his left arm, with the seal in his hand. The one which he took with his finger and thumb he gave to me, and asked the price of it, keeping the other concealed in his hand. He then said he would give me the 5 l. which he had agreed to leave as a deposit for the two seals, and put his hand into his breeches pocket. When I saw him do that, I removed the tray of seals away, and went round the counter, and told him, he had got a seal in his breeches pocket. He said, if he had, it must have dropped out of the sleeve of his coat. I said, I saw how it had been done, and desired he would deliver it up. He produced it, and laid it on the glass case, in the presence of Captain Baker, who had come in. I put it in the tray with the others, and said it was a fortunate thing for him that Mr. Jones was not in the way, or he would be prosecuted. In consequence of what Captain Baker said, I sent for an officer, gave him in charge, and gave him the same seal that he returned to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. POLLOCK. Q. How many seals were in the tray - A. Great many. I believe I gave the officer the same seal.</p>

            . I have been captain of an East India ship. I went to the prosecutor's shop, and heard Lindsay charge the prisoner with stealing the seal. The prisoner said, if he had got it, it must have gone into his pocket by the cuff of his coat. I advised him to feel for it; he did so, and drew it out. I saw Lindsay put it in the tray. I myself took it out, and gave it to the constable. It is the same. I had never lost sight of it.</p>

I heard one fall between her and the box; it must have fallen from her. I picked it up, and found a bundle on her arm, under her shawl; I found it was four pints and one quart pot, belonging to different persons. There was flannel between them to prevent their making a noise. I gave her in charge.</p>

Most of it was in a chest which had the key left in it; the things were worth 30 l. My husband came home first, and discovered the robbery. I have seen nothing since, except a handkerchief, which I found in a cradle in the prisoner Herbert's room, where the officer took him. The prisoner, Cunningham's, father lived in the room over me, he used to come to see him often. The morning we were robbed, Cunningham passed three or four times, while I was in the cellar, he was in the house, and asked me what o'clock it was. He passed me at the time I was locking my door. When he asked the time, I told him it was nine; he said,</p>

            . I live in Whitecross-street, Moorfields. On the 27th October I was coming out of Lion-court, Grubb-street, about five o'clock in the afternoon, it was near Nowland's house. I saw Herbert pass me with a great quantity of men and women's clothes hanging loose on his arm. He came in a direction from the prosecutor's. I followed him into Chiswell-street, I missed him for a moment, and caught sight of him again; Cunningham was then with him, helping him up with the clothes. I said to Cunningham, how careless that man has got the clothes, he said, Yes, and looked confused. I said, It is Mr. Cunningham, he said, Yes. Herbert crossed over, and endeavoured to put the things up himself. I said again, he is carrying them very careless; Cunningham said, he is just at home. Cunningham walked on by my side, I turned round and missed him, he was stooping down rubbing his legs. Herbert went up Whitecross-street. Cunningham staid and watched me, to see where I was going. I stood against a post to see if he followed Herbert, which he did; he kept a little distance behind him. I lost them in Whitecross-street, I saw the glimpse of a red cloak among the things. I also saw a piece of blue chequered cotton, and the knees of a pair of breeches among the things.</p>

On Thursday, the 19th of November, I came down stairs and found the prisoner in the shop, in my son's custody. I asked what was the matter? He said, in the prisoner's hearing, that two men came into the shop; one of them asked what he would charge for dressing an old hat. The prisoner stood behind his companion, where the bags of fur were. He concealed a bag of fur, and walked out of the shop with it. My son said he ran after him, and brought him in with the fur. The prisoner said nothing to it. I took him in charge, and sent my son for an officer, who took him to the watch-house. The bag was covered with dirt, as if it had fallen in the dirt. It was worth 3 l. 15 s. - I had paid that for it that morning. I knew the bag by the mark. They are all marked the same way.</p>

            . I live with my father. On the 19th of November, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop with another man, who pulled off his hat and asked what I should charge for dressing it? I said one shilling. He asked several questions. While we were in conversation the prisoner walked out of the shop. He had a loose great coat over his left arm. I missed the fur immediately. I saw it there when they came in. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner crossing the road; his companion ran to the door with me, and called out</p>

               <p>"Jem!" two or three times. I overtook the prisoner in the middle of the road, crossing towards a street nearly opposite. I collared him, and asked him for the fur. He said he had none. I said I was sure he had, and was going to lift up his coat, and he immediately dropped it. It was concealed under his coat. I picked it up and took it into the shop, with him. Nobody but him and his companion had been in the shop. I am certain he is the man. My father was called down. I told him what had passed. I sent for a constable, who took him.</p>

As soon as they turned the corner they set off running. They ran about two hundred yards, and met a tall boy, with a light rough great coat on, who took the coats of them. I believe it was Lowe, but am not certain. He buttoned them up in his coat, and they all ran into Lamb's-place together; two men were running after them. One man stopped the two who were pursuing and asked what they were running after those boys for, as they had got nothing of their's. The boys then run off different ways. I knew Belfour before, by sight, and am sure I saw him come out of the house.</p>

            . I was at No. 6, Harley-street, opposite the prosecutor's, looking out of the parlour window, about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw three boys sitting on the steps of No. 69. I believe Belfour to be one, the other I am not certain of. There was a larger boy with them, in a light rough great coat. He appeared about the size of Lowe. I saw Belfour and the other boy go down the area steps of No. 68. The tall boy got up and walked on, and stopped near No. 67. Immediately after that, Belfour and the other came up out of the area;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020029"/>Belfour had a brown paper parcel, and gave it to the tall boy. They all crossed the road together, and went down Queen Ann-street. Belfour and the other boy returned in about two minutes, on the other side of the way, without the parcel. I then came out and went up against them. I am sure Belfour was one. I had followed a woman, whom I had seen come out of No. 68, to tell her of it, but was obliged to go back. After that I saw them come out of the same house, with a large bundle; it was dark brown coats. The other boy carried them. A milkman and another man ran after them.</p>

On the 28th of November, I found a cap and frill folded up in paper and put in a closet, which created my suspicions. He slept in the premises to take care of them. The same evening, after the shop was shut, I looked through the shutter, and saw him go to the glass cases, and take the lace boxes. Next morning I got an officer, watched him out, and stopped him in Lincoln's-inn-fields, as he was going towards my other house, in the Strand. I asked him for the key of the shop, he gave it to me. I told him to wait till I returned. I went to the shop, and found the cap and frill were gone from the closet. I returned, and asked him what he had done with the cap and frill, he said he had got them. I asked what business he had with them, he said he was going to give them to his sister. I beckoned to the officer, who came and took him, and found the frill, cap, and nine yards of lace on him. He said, he was sorry for it, and he never took anything before.</p>

The prosecutor came up, and said he was the man who had robbed him of his seals and key - he was not above five or six yards behind the prisoner, when I took him. I found nothing on him. The prisoner said he had struck him, but did not take his seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did he own that he had struck him - A. Both at the watch-house, and at the office.</p>

             is the landlord of the house, and lives in it, we have the front-room on the ground floor - the prisoner lived in the front-room first floor, over me. On the 3d of November, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I put my watch safe in a little box, on the table by my bed side, and then went out, double-locked the door, and put a nail over the latch - my husband went out before me. I returned about a quarter after eight o'clock, and found the door locked, but the staple drawn out, and the nail also drawn out from over the latch - anybody could draw the nail out - it could not easily be seen - I could not find it. My husband had not come home. I found the staple lying on the ground, and the little box lying on the ground, and my husband's watch gone - it was silver. The prisoner had been in my room the day before, and asked what o'clock it was, I took the watch out of the box, and said it wanted a quarter to eight - she saw me put the watch back into the box. When I missed it, I ran up to her, and asked if she had heard anybody break into my room. She said</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Pelham-street, close to Allen. I am a weaver, and work for Messrs. Jeffreys and Cox, St. Paul's Church-yard. On the 3d of November, I went there, and found the prisoner at the scales, waiting for work. I had known her about seven months. She passed me and went to the door, returned and called me out, and said it would be a long while before it came to my turn to served, as several people were waiting. She desired I would ask what colour her cane was to be, as she wanted to go out for half a day's work, and asked me bring it home for her. I said I would. I went and had a pint of beer with her, at the Swan with Two Necks. She then said she had a watch which belonged to her first husband, and if I would buy it, I should have it for 30 s. I said I would give her 10 s. then, and 1 l. next week. She gave it to me. It was then half-past eleven o'clock. When I got home, I heard of the robbery. I shewed the prosecutor the watch, and he claimed it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 3d of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, I took the prisoner into custody, at her lodgings. I searched, and found 6 s. 2 d. on her. I asked how she got it, she said it was part of the money she sold the watch for. I asked how she got possession of the watch; she said she met an old woman picking up bones in the street, and she gave her the watch to pledge for her. I asked her why she did not pawn it; she said she went to one pawnbroker's, where she saw the prosecutor, and turned out again. I asked her what became of the old woman; she said, when she came out she was gone, and she saw no more of her.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the effect of the blow - A. It knocked me down. I immediately tried to raise myself up, and a person took my hat off with both hands, as I was getting up; I immediately caught hold of the coat of the person who took my hat off. I am sure it was the same person. I then saw another person standing by his side. I called out and they tried to escape. I kept hold of the coat, and the man dragged me along the pavement for six or seven yards, as I held the coat. He then got away, leaving part of his coat in my hands. I saw him and the other man turn down Baker's-row, and down two other turnings. I followed them all the way, calling</p>
               <p>"Stop thief! Watch!" and</p>
               <p>"Murder!" My handkerchief was in my hat. I still kept them in sight, except while they turned the corner. I ran against a post, which disabled me from following them so fast. They had got back into Whitechapel-road again. I thought I saw one of them run across, and I followed him across, and still pursued. He ran down a street close to the hospital. I thought they both ran down there. When I got about five yards down the street the watchman brought Lewis to me, and asked if that was the man I was pursuing? He was much out of breath. I had no opportunity of observing his features, but by his stature I judged him to be one of them. The watchman said he was running when he was stopped, and I gave him in charge. I entirely lost the other man. I went with Lewis and the watchman to Whitechapel watch-house, while he was being searched a watchman came in, and said there was a prisoner at Mile End watch-house, with his coat torn. I had kept the part of the coat in my hand all the time, and went to Mile End, New-town, watch-house, and found Baldock there. I did not know his face; his person corresponded in shape and size with the man; his coat was torn; it was the same colour as the piece. I did not compare it, as he acknowledged it was part of his coat. It was torn in the same place. I have the coat and piece here. He was taken to Whitechapel watch-house. My hat was found the next day, by Stephens. The blow did not hurt me much. They did not strike me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Was you quite sober - A. Quite. It was a dark night. I lost sight of them. I think they are the men by their stature. I felt both the man's hands on my head.</p>

             STEPHENS. I am a lamp-lighter. On the 3d of November, about a quarter before three o'clock, I was lighting some lamps nearly opposite the London Hospital, near the end of Baker's-row. I found a hat and a handkerchief on the ground, which I took to the watch-house. They told me to take it to Lambeth-street, which I did, two days after, and the prosecutor swore to it.</p>

               <p>"Stop thief!" he turned round and caught hold of my coat, it tore, he ran from me, and I followed him for the piece of my coat. I lost him, and ran against two watchman who took me.</p>

I questioned him to know if they were his own property. I suspected him, took him to Lambeth-street Office, and gave him in charge of Griffiths, who found five tea-spoons in his pocket. When he was before the magistrate he confessed to robbing the house, and said where it was.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. The prisoner was given into my charge by Lewis, on the 26th of November, in the morning. I searched him, and found five silver tea-spoons in his breeches-pocket. He was taken before the magistrate that day, and charged on suspicion of this robbery, and committed until the Thursday following. After he left the office he said, if I went with him, he would show me where all the property was, but he could not tell me without going with me. The magistrate gave me leave to put him in the watch-house that night. I put him in a coach next morning, he ordered it to drive to the Obelisk in St. George's-fields; when he got there he ordered it to drive on, and he would point out where it was to stop, and told him to turn to South-street, Lambeth; when we got there, he desired him to stop at the Marquis Wellesley public-house, kept by Cribb; we went in there. I took him into the passage, and asked the landlord if he knew him? He said Yes. I asked him to show me the room where he lodged. Before he took me up stairs, he produced a clock, which he said the prisoner had left in the bar; the prisoner acknowledged leaving it there. We went up two pair of stairs into his room, as soon as we got into the room the prisoner stooped down himself, and pulled a bundle from under the bed, and said that was part of the property, and if I would open the closet, I should see a box, where all the rest was. I found all the property stated in the indictment there. Three legs of pork were packed up with the clothes, which the prosecutor claimed. I took him to the office, with the property.</p>

On the 28th of November, at twelve o'clock in the forenoon, I told him that I could keep him no longer, and my wife gave him a few halfpence to leave the house, and take his things. The same evening, it being dusk, he came in and concealed himself, privately, in the backroom. I keep a green-shop. At twelve o'clock an alarm was given; I came down, and went into the shop, and found the shutter down, and missed a great coat, and 5 s. in halfpence. I found the coat at Shadwell office. I had seen it hanging on a nail, about half-past nine o'clock, before I went to bed, the door was then shut. I could find nobody in the house.</p>

I was called down by the female servant. When I got into the passage, Mr. Hewitt told me to go to my bureau and see if I missed anything. I had left the keys hanging in the lock of a cupboard, in the servant's hall. I took my key out of the cupboard, and went to my bureau, which stood in the back passage, not in the servant's hall. I put the key in the bureau, and found it was already unlocked. I immediately missed a 5 l. bank-note, which I had left laying open in the bureau, and a 1 l. note under it. I came back to Mr. Hewitt, and said I missed a 5 l. note. He immediately turned round to the prisoner, and said, he must insist on searching him. The prisoner began to pull his things out of his pockets. He at last pulled his hand out of his coat pocket, clenched. Mr. Hewitt laid hold of it, and said, I must see what you have got there. He opened his hand, and took a 5 l. note out of it. He looked at the back of the note, and read the name of</p>

There were marks of violence on the adjoining counting-house, which joins the same building, and is part of the warehouse. I found the drawer of the counting-house desk broken open. The money deposited there belonged to us. The prisoner was apprehended about a week after. I saw him at the Mansion-House. He begged to speak to me in private, and then said he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020036"/>the guilty person, and begged I would be lenient with him. I neither threatened or promised him. He said he wished to be sent to the Penitentiary, if he was cast for transportation, and that he would tell me how he did it. I told him he deserved no favour. He said, that on Saturday night, the 7th of November, after coming and talking to some workmen in the warehouse, he went into the front yard, and shut the warehouse door after him, and concealed himself among some piles of hats and puncheons in the yard; and when all was quiet, he got on the shed in the yard, and in at the dining-room window, walked down stairs into the kitchen, and took the keys of the warehouse and counting-house from where they hung in the kitchen, opened the doors, and went and broke open the desk, and took the money out, but did not count it; and that he got out the same way he went in. The yard is shut up at night. The money that was kept in the drawer, belongs to the firm, which is myself, William and

Borradaile, as he had been seen with a great deal of money lately, which rose the suspicion. He said he had received 15 l. 15 s., from a man, who owed it to him. I told him if he could account for it, I would not detain him, and I would go anywhere with him to find the man. He said he was gone to sea. I searched him at the Mansion House, and found eight 1 l. notes, and 17 s. in silver, on him. I then went to his lodgings, which he directed me to, and found a great many new clothes, which he told me he had bought with the money he took out of the desk.</p>

He wished to see two or three more; I handed him three or four more out of the window, one of them he appeared to like very much - it was capped and seconds - the price was eight guineas. After he had looked at it, he pointed to another in the window, and desired it might be taken down to look at saying, he thought it would do for his mate, if it came to 4 l. or 5 l. He said his ship was going to be paid at the sign of the Cape of Good Hope, in the Commercial-road, in about an hour, that two or three more of his shipmates wanted watches, and he would bring them. I took the watch down that he pointed at, and before I could put it on the counter with the rest, be pointed at my regular, in a very sharp way, saying,</p>
               <p>"It is not so late as that, is it?" He hurried out of the shop instantly. I then went to return the watches to the window, and missed the capped and jewelled one. I looked again in the window, as I thought it not possible that he could have taken it, as I only had my eye off him while I looked at the clock, I however I found it was gone, and another as well, which I had shewn him, worth three guineas. I told my son, he went out one way, and I the other. I went to the Cape of Good Hope, public-house, but found no ship was going to be paid there. I heard nothing more until Tuesday morning, December the 1st when I called on Edwards; he shewed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020038"/>me a watch, which I immediately recognized - it was the best watch. He said if I would call at three o'clock, the man who left it, would be there. I got an officer from Shadwell Office, and waited there until the prisoner came, we then seized him, and took him into the back-room. The officer searched, and found the duplicate of a watch on him, pledged in the Commercial-road for 15 s. - it was not mine, He had got the watch which he had left at Edwards, as he asked for it when he came. I have only recovered the best watch.</p>

He said it stopped, and wanted me to alter it. I said if he would bring it early the next morning, I would do it by three o'clock in the afternoon. He took it away, and brought it again next morning, and said he would call between three and four o'clock in the afternoon for it. Between eleven and twelve o'clock Mr. Leplastrier came to caution me against a man of colour, who had stolen two watches from him. I asked what sort of watches they were? He said one was stop and seconds, capped and jewelled. I took the watch out of my case and he claimed it. He came again in the afternoon with an officer, and waited for the prisoner, who came. I gave him the watch, and the officer took him.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Morgan. The window of the back warehouse looks into Helmet-court, which is at the back of the premises. On the 9th of November when the men left work, I fastened that window by an iron bar, outside - it had a pin through it, which was fastened with a key - I slept on the premises that night, but heard no alarm. Job Webster, went to the window the first, about five minutes before seven o'clock in the morning - it was not daylight. He called me to look at the window, I found a square of glass broken, and the shutter not quite close; the bar was broke at the staple end, and hung by the pin, there was a little iron poker laying inside the window, by which I suppose it must have been done - I had a candle with me - it was not light enough to see without.</p>
               <p>Q. When the pane of glass was removed, was there room enough for a man's body to have got in - A. There was. I missed two or three looking glasses, off a chest of drawers. I did not miss the tea-chests.</p>

On the 11th of November, about three o'clock, the prisoner called at my house with the watch and brooch, and asked if I would buy them - he wanted 2 l. 5 s. for them, together; I offered him 2 l. He went away, and returned in about five minutes, saying, he was going out of town, and I should have them for 2 l. I asked him if they were his own? he said they were. I also bought three live fowls of him - he said he would call for the money for the fowls next day, but he did not. On Friday I pledged the watch at Dobree's, for 30 s. On the 13th he came for the money for the fowls, and was taken.</p>

On the 14th of November, I took him to Mr. Wiggin's, public-house, where I changed a 5 l. note for a 2 l., and three 1 l. notes. I went into the tap-room and paid the prisoner his wages, which was 14 s. 2 d.; he asked me to lend him a 1 l. note, and to stop the remainder of the change the next week, which I did, and put the other notes into my pocket-book in his presence. We left there, and parted at the corner of High-street. I went to Mr. Sharpe's, the butcher, and changed a 1 l. note there. I am positive I then had a 2 l. and a 1 l. note in my pocket-book, which I put in my pocket, and went home. On the Sunday I only went out to the baker's, and had the same coat on, and my pocket-book in my pocket. Nobody could have taken it out then. On Monday the prisoner came to work. I did not go out that day till after dinner; we then both went to do a job in <placeName id="t18181202-84-crimeloc474">Park-street</placeName>

I went into the front area, leaving the prisoner alone in the kitchen. I then went on the roof of the house. We came home. I missed my notes, and my daughter gave me some information. I went to the manager, and found a bill there, which I had also lost out of my pocket-book. Next morning I went to the prisoner's lodgings. He was gone. I met him coming, and gave him in charge. He denied it. The constable was going to search him; he put his hand into his pocket and threw some paper like notes into the fire. The other part of the 2 l. note was found in his pocket.</p>

She went up; I heard her open the drawers. I shut the street-door, went up, and asked what she was doing? She said nothing particular.

I said she had better tell me who it was, and where they lived. She said if I would give her till the morning, they should be returned. In about ten minutes she said her mother had been and robbed the house. I went and told her mother she had been robbing Mr. Perkins. She denied any knowledge of it. She said they should be returned next day. She then asked if I would forgive her robbing the place if she told where the things were? I said I could make no promise of the kind. She said they were not in the house, she had given them to a man, but she did not know who he was, or where he lived, but she would find him to-morrow morning. She took me to Wapping, workhouse, and said a man in there, named Stevenson, had got them. I went in, the prisoner, Stevenson, was brought to me. On searching him I found the whole of the property, except the five gowns, and a snuffer-tray, about his person. He said he knew nothing about them, never had them, and persisted in it for half an hour. I said I must take him for the robbery. He then said he would show me where the rest of the things were. He took me to a man in East Smithfield, where I found them. He asked the man for the things he had left there.</p>

On the 20th of November, at half-past ten o'clock at night, I found he was gone to bed without laying the wood for the fire, which he ought to have done. In consequence of what I was told, I went to his bed; he slept in the shop. He appeared to be asleep. I found half a crown on the bed. I searched his pockets, and found another half-crown and a sixpenny pamphlet, which appeared to be new. I called to him, and asked him how he came by it. He said he bought it. I asked him how he came by the money. He said he found it on Westminster bridge. I gave him 2 s. per week for a quarter of a year. I had not paid him his wages. He told me a few nights before, that he was obliged to leave his hat at Waterloo bridge, as he had no money to pay the toll. He said he knew nothing of the half-crown which was on the bed. I asked him how he got the one in his pocket. He then said he took them both that day. I went up stairs to his trunk, which was open, and found, in his presence, fifteen more half-crowns, wraped in two rags. He begged forgiveness, and said he would never do so again, and that he took them out of the till last week. I had only missed one that night.</p>

I stopped in the street with her, and gave her 6 d. I then left her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any familiarity pass between you - A. No. She put her hand to my waistcoat pocket, and said I might as well give her a 1 s. I left her, suspecting nothing. I was going to sleep at the Hummums that night. When I got to the corner of Bond-street, I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my notes; this was on Saturday. I found her at Queen-square on Tuesday. I had described her to the watchman that night. I have since seen my notes, and know four of them which are marked. I am positive she is the woman.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody on the Monday, at her lodgings, in Duck-lane, Westminster, and asked her if she was not in Piccadilly on Saturday night. She said she was. I asked her for the 5 l. note she had taken from the gentleman. I understood it was a 5 l. note. She said she knew nothing of it. I made her get up, and I left the room. When she was dressed, I went in, and searched the room, but could find nothing. I took her and her mother to the office. I then said I was not satisfied. I took the key of the room from the mother, returned and searched again, - as I came out, I observed the screw of the lock to be loose. The lock fell off when I touched it, and I found the four 1 l. notes in it, wrapped in a silk handkerchief. I went to the office and told her I had found the notes. The mother then said, in her presence, that she had changed a 1 l. note at Hill's. I went there with the others. It was produced to me, and the prosecutor claimed it. It is not here. I have the other four.</p>

They asked me to go with them, but I refused. I thought they intended to rob me of my watch, and put my hand to my fob to hold it. My left hand was up and my right on my fob. I pushed them and endeavoured to get away, but they kept fast hold of me until I got near to an alley. I endeavoured to get away, and dragged them with me. I had spoke to no other woman that night. They drew me up the alley by force. A little way up, I found the hand of one of them (I do not know which) in that pocket which contained the notes. I put my hand down to prevent her, and said,</p>
               <p>"You wretches, you have robbed me;" they then dropped part of the notes. I picked them up, put them into my pocket, and caught hold of them; they began swearing, and endeavoured to get away. They tore my coat, shirt, and handkerchief. A watchman was coming, and I told him to take them in custody. He took them to the watch-house. When I got there, I desired a gentleman, whom I knew, and who came, seeing the bustle, to examine the notes. The 20 l. note was gone. I had given him the particulars of them. I returned to the alley, but could not find it there. Payment was stopped at the Bank. The number of the note was 15,968, and dated 31st of July, 1818.</p>

The stable is about five hundred yards from the dwelling-house. On the 12th more was taken, and more on the 22d. It was all taken from the same outhouse. I saw the last quantity on the day before. After we missed that stolen on the 12th, we thought proper to watch. On the morning of the 22d of November, between five and six o'clock, Wood was watching, and called me. I went round into the main road, and met the prisoner with the lead on his shoulder, about a quarter of a mile from the road. I laid hold of him, and told him to stop, or I would blow his brains back. He surrendered. We took him out. The lead produced was taken from the coach-house; it appeared fresh cut. We took him to the constable's.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Hobson. We were watching on the 22d of November, and about five o'clock I saw a man on the top of the stable, taking the lead off. I told my fellow-servant; he went into the main road, and came upon him close by it, with the lead on his shoulder. It was not light. He gave no account of himself. We had not seen him before.

            . I am a fishmonger, and live at Rumford. I became acquainted with two men, named Hanchett and Clarke. They made a communication to me, which I informed Mr. Wood, the overseer, of. I saw Mr. Storey. I went to town with Hanchett and Clarke, left Rumford on Sunday night, about eleven o'clock, and walked all the way. I arrived at the Green Man, and Bell, Darkhouse-lane, with them about three o'clock.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020045"/>We then went to Mr. Ford's, the Tiltboat, and remained there half an hour at breakfast - it was then near six o'clock. They accompanied me to the market, to buy some fish. I returned to the Green Man and Bell, and left my fish there about seven o'clock, then went with them to <placeName id="t18181202-100-crimeloc556">Petticoat-lane</placeName>

At eight o'clock I saw the prisoner standing outside a house in Petticoat-lane. He said to Hanchett, have you sold all your blackberries? He said Yes. Martin put his finger to his nose. Hanchett then put his finger across his mouth. The prisoner, and Hanchett crossed over, about twenty yards from me, and appeared in conversation. We crossed over, and all four went into a court, which Hanchett called the Gaff, The prisoner then asked me how much money I wanted? I said 2 l. worth. Clarke said he would have half a score. and Hanchett said, he would have a score - the prisoner went away. Hanchett said, he had made the agreement with him, and that I was to give 2 l. for 100, that is 5 s. for 20 s. The prisoner returned in about five minutes, with a great quantity of shillings, and gave me five score. I I gave him a 1 l. note. He said that was not enough by 5 s. I said I wanted some half-crowns, but he would have the 5 s. first. I then gave him a score of bad shillings back - I had then only four score. Clarke said he would have half a score - the prisoner said, why not have a score. Clarke said he had not money enough. I asked how much he wanted? He said 1 s. 6 d. Martin gave him 20 s. - He then gave Hanchett a score, he paid him 5 s. for them. The prisoner then went across the road to get some sixpences, and half crowns. He beckened to us, and we all went over into a court - he told us to stay there; he returned with the sixpences, and said he could not let us have the half crowns then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had finished dealing, where did you go to - A. Clarke, Hanchett, and I walked to Stratford, got on the Harwich coach, and went to Rumford - we got down at the Sun public-house. kept by Marshall, we went into the taproom, and called for a pot of egg-hot - I paid two bad shillings for it, I had informed Mr. Wood that we would call there. We called for another pot, for which I paid two more bad shillings. A woman tapped at the window, I went out to see what she wanted - she was gone - Hanchett and Clarke were alarmed, ran out, and said they were going to make away with the money. I laid hold of them, took them into the taproom, and made them sit down. Mr. Wood came in, followed by Turk, and Adams, who took them into custody. I gave Mr. Wood ninety-six shillings, and eighty-three sixpences.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. What part of Petticoat-lane, is the Gaff - A. It is in Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived at Rumford - A. Nine months - I knew Hanchett and Clarke, by seeing them about for three months, but have not been acquainted with them above a fortnight. I used to walk to town, to buy my fish, and have met them coming up with mushrooms, two or three times in the week - I do not expect to be paid for this.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and overseer of Rumford. Nicholls informed me of a proposal being made to him by Hanchett. I sent him to inform Mr. Story It was agreed he should go to town with Clark and Hanchett and to return to the Sun public-house. On the 23d I informed Marshall that they were coming, and told him to take what counterfeit money they offered to him, also to send and let us know when they came, which he did about eleven o'clock. I sent him to Mr. Story, and Adams. When I got to the Sun I saw a woman tapping at the window, saying something was the matter. I drove her away, went in, and found Nicholls standing over Clark and Hanchett, insisting that they should not leave. As soon as I saw Mr. Adams, I seized Hanchett by the wrist, and Adams took Clark. We took them both into the front parlour - Mr. Story came in, and they were searched. Nicholls gave me ninety-four shillings, and eighty-three sixpences, which I produce, with four shillings which Marshall gave me.</p>

            . The prisoner lives at Rumford. I got acquainted with him as I was coming to town. He said he could put me into a good thing, where I could pass money, and get a good bit of bread. He was to supply me with counterfeit money, to pass in the way of trade. I told Mr. Wood and Mr. Story. On the 22d of November I walked to town with him. We went to two public-houses, and then into Petticoat-lane. Martin then asked Hanchett<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020046"/>if he had sold all his blackberries? He had told me when he introduced me to the man, he should tell him I was his brother, and had just come out of Maidstone jail, and was coming the queer. Martin made a sign to him. I asked the prisoner the meaning of it? He said it was to know if I was a nose, and his answer meant that I was a good fellow. After this, he and Martin walked together in conversation. When I got to the Gaff, which is a court where the Jews meet, Martin asked how many I wanted. I said 2 l. He served me. I asked the prisoner what I was to pay. He said 5 s. a score, and afterwards served Clarke and the prisoner with a score. Martin went across, and beckoned to us. After that we went to Rumford, to the Sun public-house. I paid four bad shillings for two pots of egg-hot. They attempted to get away. I stopped them, and the constable took them.</p>

They took hold of me, and took me into a passage, and made signs that they wanted something to drink.

I went to pick it up; they knocked me down. Whilst I was down, I lost my hat. They ran off, one one way, and the other another. I pursued Price, and took her. I called for assistance; the watchman came and took her to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman; the prosecutor's house is opposite to one that I watch. About eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner, in company with another, going past the house No. 13, which I watch. The prisoner had three pieces of lead in an old basket. I asked what it was, he dropped it, and they ran away in different directions. I followed and took the prisoner, without losing sight of him - I picked up the lead.</p>

I took him to the watch-house, and asked him why he ran? He said he had knocked a man down in the lane - he afterwards said he pushed him down. I said there was no occasion to run for that - he said there was great occasion, and he had lost his own money by running so hard. I took him back, and Walker said he was the man who knocked her brother down, and took his watch; he made no answer. I went with King, and found the watch where he first caught him.</p>

Two or there months before I had him taken up, I spoke to him particularly about a book of prints, which cost me 8 l., I told him I had been robbed; he said somebody must have come in at the door, and taken it out, or that some of the customers must have stolen it, as a gentleman had examined them a short time before, other books were taken afterwards. I then had new locks put on my shop door - the prisoner slept at his sister's. I told him I suspected the maid-servant, and set him to watch. I locked the shop, and fastened every thing up myself at night, and every morning before, I came down, I gave him the key to open it. I lost those things after I made this regulation. The prisoner represented to me that he thought the shop had been opened by a false key in the night, and property taken. He took me to the back shelves, and shewed me the books in a deranged state, and said he left them in perfect order the night before - this continued till he was apprehended. About the 12th of August I told him that I suspected him, and I was convinced that nobody but one who was well acquainted with my property could have done it, and he was the thief, for it could be nobody else. He strongly denied it, but afterwards burst into tears, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have been tempted to rob you, but never did." He named two persons, who he said had threatened his life if he did not rob me, that they came to the private door, and would not go away until he gave them property, that he did give them property, and they sold it - he received only 8 s. as his part of the booty, and said he was compelled to do it from fear, there being above forty in the gang, that he had fought with them to prevent their forcing him to rob me, but his honest disposition had so triumphed over their temptations, as they wanted him to part with my money, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you discover these books - A. About three weeks after he was taken, I went to Mr. Shirly's, by accident, and found them there - I am certain they are mine - they have my private mark on them.</p>

She said she would have none of the books there, and then my brother burnt them - there were six books, she asked him to burn them - an alarm was made in the court by the fire; the people asked what was blazing in the room. My sister said she was warming a bit of meat - it was not so.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of the directions I received, I went to search the prisoner's house, in Burton-crescent, Lambeth-road, on the 26th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon - there was no appearance of a sadler's shop outside. His wife came down, and denied him to me; I went into the back room on the same floor, and saw him; he denied having three sets of harness and seven collars; which I was sent to search for. Parker went with me, and found the harness produced, in different parts of his shop, just in the same state as now - the collars hung up; he was behind the door which, being shut, concealed him. He then asked me to let him put on a clean shirt; I told him I must go with him; he then said he would be d - d if I did - I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was a small room, and looked like a harness shop; he never told me who sold it him, nor did he refer me to any house in Whitechapel-road.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>PARKER. There is an addition to the materials which was not there when stolen. The harness which was found in the prisoner's house was cut in pieces - they were nearly new when I lost them - they wanted no repairs - Wilford made them for my master. They were two sets of harness stolen, and part of another which are now made three.</p>

They were in pieces when I bought them. I made them up, and sold them to Smith, a servant of Mr. Dixon's, which I should not have done, had I known them to be stolen.</p>

               <p>"Your work comes in by horse-loads." It was a short dark man who brought it - it was several bits of harness like those produced.

            . In November last I worked for the prisoner - I took work home to do. One Monday morning I saw a man come for money for harness, which then laid about the room; he asked for 5 l., which was paid in my presence; he was a short dark man - I was employed to make them into sets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you present when it was bought - A. No; it is nearly two mile from his house to mine - I often go three or four times a day. I then came for materials to complete a back-band - I then saw the man - I wanted nothing else. I stopped half an hour, but sometimes I stopped an hour - my master had nothing to do but to give it me. The man was there when I got in - he only wanted the 5 l. - I cannot tell what kept him. He signed in my master's book for 5 l., having previously signed in it for 1 l. I saw him put his mark in my master's book - I should know his mark - I have never seen the book since. I never attended his examination, but should if I had been required. I did attend, but was not called.</p>

I have not been there, because I thought nothing of it; I cannot say whether my master keeps one book or more; it was a long narrow book - my work was not entered there. I lived at No. 23, Upper Marsh, Lambeth, then, and live there still, I did not observe the leather in pieces, nor whether they were good or bad. The leather put to it was nearly as good as the original part, I do not think it was quite so good. I was there half an hour, and saw the money paid - he came for it; all this passed, while I was there.

On the 22d of November, which was Sunday, I found a sack of wheat, laying in a ditch, a little way from where he had been working - it was tied up, with some bushes and an oak bough put over it - I examined it, and it appeared to be my wheat - I took some of it to compare with the bulk, and covered the rest over as before. About five o'clock I and my son went to watch who would come for it. In about an hour the prisoner and another man came; the other man took it out of the ditch, and threw it over the hedge to the prisoner, who carried it across the field to the road; we followed them near the hedge, to avoid being seen, they went down the road for a quarter of a mile. When we got to the bridge we were obliged to go on the gravel; I suppose they heard us, for the man threw the wheat off his shoulder; I walked up to them, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo! my lads;" the other man said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo!" and ran on the other side of the prisoner, and got away. I then said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo! Potter," he said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo! master;" I then said, you are a pretty sort of a fellow, are you not, he said, how? I said, what did you do down in my field just now, he said, I was not in your field, I lit on this young man in the road, and he went off, leaving the sack - I was afraid to take them. Next morning the prisoner came to the door to work, and said, Master, do you not mean to give us any more for threshing that wheat, I said, No, I think it is as much as any one gives; he then went to work. I sent for a constable, he was taken, and ran away. I fetched him back. Before the constable came he appeared very uneasy, and kept looking out. I went into the barn and talked to him to engage his attention. I have compared the wheat in the sack with the bulk, and am certain it is mine. There is some foreign barley, and black and white oats in it that agrees with mine.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on another charge, and asked her for the duplicates. She said she had some in her bureau, and she had no others. I found a great quantity there. I searched her person, saw her hand in her pocket-hole, and between her stays and her body I found a glove containing forty-eight duplicates, four of which related to these table-cloths. She said they belonged to a kept woman, in Mortimer-street, who gave them to her to pledge. I detained them for her to bring the woman, to say they were her property, between the Saturday and Monday she absconded. On the 15th of November I took her at Battersea. She said they were the prosecutor's.</p>

The prisoner was looking down several areas; I saw him go down an area, and return - they went further; his companion sat on the step, and the prisoner went down the area of No. 27; I crossed the road, and got assistance; he came up with the box under his arm; I laid hold of him, and asked what he had got, he said he had got them from his mother; the other got away. A gentleman who assisted me, took him down the area; while he was looking for the person, the prisoner came up again; I pursued, and took him. I also took the other boy, but let him go to secure the prisoner.</p>

I followed him through Blackhorse-yard, into Tottenham-court-road, but lost sight of him there; he afterwards was taken. I am certain he is the man, I have known him for many years.</p>

(looks at the note) This is it - it has my writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the scuffle hard - A. Yes, it drew blood from my chin, and tore my shirt and handkerchief.</p>

They then went away, as I understood to search his lodgings - I remained at the door till they returned. Furzeman, and I went in, Newport went away - the prisoner had been locked in the watch-house. We went in, and Furzeman asked him where he got the note? He said he knew where he got it, but he would not bring four or five more people into it, for he knew it was a bad one, and he must be punished for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say anything about going for life - A. No. I went out soon after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say you are a milkman - you are Furzeman's cadee, and go about to swear men's lives away - A. I am a milkman.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes, at the Bank of England, and have been so above twenty years (examining the note uttered to Mr. Hankes.) it is forged, the paper is not that used by the bank. The water-mark is put on after the paper is made, the Bank water-mark is made with the paper. It is not the Bank plate, the line with the date appears to be engraved, in a genuine note it stereotype. It purports to be signed C. Tabor. I have known him ever since I have been in the Bank, and believe it not to be his writing. I have no doubt of its being forged. (looks at that uttered to Eddels), it is forged in every respect like the other, and is not R. Clough's hand-writing, he did not sign small notes at this period. The notes are both off the same plate.</p>
               <p>Examined by a JUROR. Q. Are there any other means of knowing a forged note, besides those you have expressed - A. There is another particular in this note, the letters No, before the number, is engraved in the plate, which is not the case in a genuine note; there are no other means which I have of proving it to be forged to the jury, except from my general knowledge. It is forged from what I have stated, and from having seen a great many of these notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible for other people besides the Bank, to use stereotype - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020057"/>Q. You say in a genuine note the water-mark is made in the paper, have you ever seen it made - A. I have seen the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen a bank note made from the first process - A. I have seen the paper before and after it was impressed, and before it was filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not inspectors, and other clerks of the Bank, received forged notes, and paid them, being deceived by them - A. Yes; that has happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they not also rejected genuine notes as forged - A. There was one instance of the kind in my recollection, and I am not positive as to another; it was a very old note, in a very mutilated state, with a quantity of paper pasted on the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the Bank ever alter their plates - A. They have altered them several times.</p>
               <p>Q. When the paper is delivered out to the work people to be printed, is it counted out to them - A. I cannot tell, nor do I know whether the work people are searched after it is printed.</p>

On the 6th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our shop, and said he wanted a little tea and sugar, as his wife had been put to bed that morning, and could not come herself, but she dealt at my shop, and asked him to come, as she thought I would give him change, knowing her to deal with me. I served him with the tea sugar, and other things amounting to about 2 s. He then gave me a 1 l. bank note.

On the 4th or 5th of November the prisoner came to our shop, and bought half an ounce of tobacco, for which he paid twopence-halfpenny. While I was weighing it, he looked at a hock of bacon, and asked the price; he said his wife had been looking at it the night before, but she had no money, and he was come to fetch it. I said I thought it was wrong, for I had no hock cut out of the side, and I refused to cut it. He said he thought he was right, that it was a hind hock, and he was to give sixpence halfpenny a pound for it. He said his wife was ill, and could not come out for it, and that it was too late for him to come that night when he came home. He then bought some tea and sugar, which came to between two and three shillings, and gave me a 1 l. note. I asked his name and address? He said

I am an inspector of bank notes, and have been so above twenty years (looks at the note uttered to Macklin), it is forged in every respect, and is not bank paper; the bank notes have the water-mark made in the paper while it is in a liquid state, this paper is not so; it is not the bank plate, nor is it the signature of E. Staple. I have known his writing for many years. The line with the date appears to be engraved, in a genuine note it is printed in stereotype. That uttered to Pemberton is also forged in every respect - it is a different note from the other; there is the remains of the name of

The note is torn and dirty; is it not possible that a note may be so torn, dirted, written upon, and blotted, and perhaps chemical stuff dropped on it, so as for you not to see the characteristic features - A. This note is not so torn as to prevent my seeing that it is not bank paper.</p>

On the 26th of November, he came to me, and said he was in great distress, and had nothing to eat for four or five days; he said he would be glad if I would get him employment, and that he would work a few days for his victuals. The captain refused to take him, but at last, by my pleading hard for him, he did take him; I had before told him to go to work, and that I would pay him if the captain would not; in the evening I told the boy to shew him his bed, which he did, and I went ashore and left him there. In the morning, I returned, and found my chest broken open, my clothes were taken out and he gone; he had left his old jacket, shoes and stockings behind. I went ashore to look for him, but could not find him. On the 4th of December, I met him in Ratcliffe highway, he hung his head on seeing me; I collared him, and asked what he had done with my property? he said he had sold them in Rosemary-lane, except the trowsers, jacket, shoes, and stockings, which were on his back; I gave him in charge at the watch-house - I knew the things to be mine.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live opposite to Crane. I was at my window, and saw Hardy go into the shop, and take some snuff-boxes, Platt was walking about, but as soon as Hardy came out, he went in. I ran down stairs, but they both got out of sight before I could get out. I told Crane what I had seen, I pursued, and caught sight of them in Marylebone-street, they were then together. I collared Hardy, and Platt ran off; I asked Hardy for the boxes - he had two in his hand; Crane came up, and claimed them; he said he was going to sell one to his friend, which was Platt. Haig pursued, and took Platt; at the time he ran away I picked up three more boxes by the side of Hardy.</p>

On the 10th of November, about nine o'clock, the porter of the New Hummums came over and desired I would send some fine cotton, and black and white silk stockings, to a gentleman there. I took them myself; the porter showed me into a bed-room, where I found the prisoner; he ordered a pair of cotton, at 4 s. 6 d. and a pair of black silk, at 15 s.; he did not approve of the white silk stockings. I said I had more. He desired I would bring them, with some drawers. I went home, returned with them, and sold him a pair of drawers, at 4 s., and a pair of white silk stockings, at 13 s. He asked for change for a 20 l. note. I went home for change, returned with it and some handkerchiefs, which he ordered. I knocked at his bed-room door, which he opened. I gave him in fifteen 1 l. notes, and 18 s. which, with the things, would make the amount. He said he was dressing, and I must wait for the note. I waited close outside the door for five minutes, he then asked me to walk in, and told me to wait a moment while he stepped to the water-closet. He had neither hat nor coat on. He did not return. The same night I saw him in company with two women and took him in the passage of the Sans Pareil Theatre. He was searched at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020061"/>the watch-house, and a pair of stockings and 7 l. found on him, which I knew to be mine. I never found the rest.</p>

He returned to the other two, they walked on about 200 yards, following the cart; the prisoner then went behind the cart and lifted something over the tail-board; I could not see what it was; he returned to his companions with it under his arm. Wright and I went up, laid hold of him, and found the cheese under his arm. The others immediately ran away. He dropped the cheese and resisted very much. I lost the cart, and do not know who it belonged to.</p>

He said that he was a hackney coachman, and it was a common rule to pay him for getting the things off the coach. The coach was full of my shipmates. There were nine of us. I gave him 8 s. for us all. I said I was thirsty, and wished I had some beer. He showed me where I could get some. I parted with my shipmates, I do not know where he took me. I am a stranger in town. He said he wanted a supper; I treated him, and gave him more beer and a glass of gin. I took a bag of silver out of my pocket, to pay for the gin. There was about 4 l. in it; the reckoning came to 18 d. He then took me to another place; we sat very close together. I put my hand to my pocket, and pulled out my notes, and counted them; there were two 5 l. and seven 1 l. bank notes. I rolled them up in a piece of canvas, and put them into my left-hand waistcoat pocket. I asked him for some tobacco. He said he had none. I bought 6 d. worth, and put it in my pocket, on the top of my money. A woman who sat on the opposite side, told me to look in my pocket, and see if I had lost anything. I then missed my money, and said I was ruined. I looked round and missed him and the women who were there. I went out with the woman to look for him, and found him at a house and asked how he could leave me in a strange place? I sent for a watchman. Two women were with him when he was with me, they were stooping down. I asked Avery for a glass of gin; he immediately ran into the street. I followed, calling out Stop thief! and came up to him. He was stopped by the watchman. I gave him in charge. The money was not found. I was neither drunk nor sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been with him - A. I met him at ten o'clock, he left me at twelve. I am sure he is the man. He sat on my left side. The two women sat close to him; 23 s. was found on him. I do not know where we met the women. The prisoner Soccart was one of them, and sat next to him.</p>
               <p>SCOCART. Q. Were any women with him when you met him - A. At the second public-house; and I found the same women with him when we took him. My tobacco was found on him.</p>

            . I saw the prosecutor and Avery come into the Black Dog, and call for a pint of beer. I sat opposite to them. They called for another pint. Avery told me that the black man had plenty of money. The prosecutor then took his notes out, counted them, wrapped them in canvas, and put them in his inside jacket-pocket. Avery said, if I would get them from the man, I should share them with him. I said I did not understand him. He then crossed from the side where I was and sat by the prosecutor, and appeared whispering to him. He put his hand into his pocket, took the notes out, and put them into his own great-coat pocket. I told the prosecutor he was robbed, and he fell into a passion with me for saying so, and would not look into his pockets. He went out with Avery, the two women, and me to a cook-shop; we then went to Long-acre, and had something to drink. The prosecutor had his silver then. I told him he was robbed, and if he did not take care the man would be gone. Avery immediately called him down Hanway-street and spoke to him, we walked on. Avery and the two women left. I said to the prosecutor,</p>
               <p>"If you feel in your pockets, you may depend upon it, you have no money." He put his hand into his pocket and missed his notes and silver, and said he was ruined. I said I would assist him. The watchman hearing him say he was robbed, took me into custody to the Coal-yard watch-house, as being concerned with them. I am sure I saw Avery put his hand into his pocket. Seocart was in his company; I did not see her do anything.</p>

We had a glass of gin. The prosecutor asked Freeman to look for a watchman; while she was gone, he ran away, and the two girls ran another way. I saw them dividing the money at the Ship.

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I was sent for and took the prisoner and another, who were coming out of the next house, which was a public-house. I went on the roof of the next house, and got on the prosecutor's roof through the loft. I found a small axe in the loft, which appeared muddy, and four pieces of lead, rolled up in a corner; the edges were bright, as if it was fresh cut; it fitted the gutter.</p>

A few nights before the robbery, at a quarter after one o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and two more near the prosecutor's house, Edward's was one, they had two large dogs with them. I heard the leaves rustle by the place where the cellar was afterwards broken. I went on the terrace steps and found Edwards there apparently asleep - the prisoner was with him. I asked them what business they had there? He said they had been to Mr. Tulford's, I said they had never knocked or rang, for if they had I must have heard them - he said they had been there.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and live at No. 194, Strand. On Saturday the 9th of September, about eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came into my auction-room, dressed in fireman's clothes - the sale was going on; he bought sportman's knife with eight instruments, for 3 s. 6 d. - he was with another man; the prisoner tendered me a 1 l. note; I looked at it, and rather suspected it I addressed myself to them both, and said put your name and address on it; I thought the prisoner endorsed it, but am rather doubtful which of them it was - I gave the note to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a name and address put on it - A. Yes. Not by the prisoner, but by the other man, who was dressed in waterman's clothes, and came in with the prisoner, and was with him all the time, and went out with him.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did the you give the note - A. I presented it to the prisoner, but the other took it out of my hand, and put the name and address on it, and said they were well known in the neighbourhood, that they (speaking of both) belonged to the Hand-in-Hand fire-office, and had taken the note there; the prisoner said nothing - he did not have the note in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. It was given to you by the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the other man giving this account, did the prisoner make any answer or observation - A. Not any. The other man wrote on the note; (looks at one) this is it, it has Hand-in-Hand Fire-office, Mr. Kingston, Lombard-street, Fleet-street, on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you selling yourself - A. No, I was taking money; it is not uncommon for people to come in together; I make every person sign their names on the note they pay - I paid this note away.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected it - A. Yes; I could not tell whether it was good or not - it was refused. I paid it that evening to Hooper, in the Strand, who keeps an eating-house - did not tell him I suspected it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did you take that night - A. Eight or nine. I always make everybody put their address on it; I saw the prisoner about seven weeks after, in custody. I am sure he is the man.</p>


               <p>Q. I presume you was told the man was in custody, who paid you the note - A. Nothing of the kind was said.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to you to go to the office - A. I went to the Hand-in-Hand Fire-office; they told me to go to the firemen, which I did, and was told he was in custody; I went to the Bank, and found it was so. They told me to go to the office, and see if he was the man - I saw him at Marlborough-street, with others.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. You paid the note that night to Hooper - A. Yes, I had been in the habit of lunching there for a year before; he knew me perfectly well, and where I lived, and has changed upwards of twenty notes for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Hooper's name was on it - A. Yes, he put it on, and I wrote my name Romanel, 194, Strand; and wrote the address on it when I paid it to him, in his presence. I received no other note with this address on.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the change for the note - A. The prisoner. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. I understood you to say you knew the note had been refused, and yet you paid it away - A. Yes, I sent my man over to the baker's to get change, and they said they did not like the note; I did not know it was bad; he knew me, and could find me, which he did - I did not tell him I suspected it.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live at No. 61, Upper East Smithfield. On the 23d July, about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a piece of bacon, which came to about 2 s. 1 1/2 d.; he offered me a 1 l. note; I looked at it, and saw it was different from all other notes I had ever taken, and told him I had no change, and asked what I should do, he said he did not know. I had observed the name of Mackey on the right-hand side of the ONE, wrote very bad with a thick pen, which I should know again. I went out with it, under a pretence of getting change, and sent a neighbour's man for an officer. I shewed the note to a man named Moses, but it did not go out of my possession; his man, Haggerty, got an officer. He was standing at my door, and in the presence of the prisoner, I gave him the note, and told him to get change for it, but I had directed him to get an officer; the officer soon returned with the note in his hand, and took the prisoner. (looks at a note) This is it, it is marked Mackey, Baldwin-street, City-road, on it, which I particularly noticed. When it came back, I put my name on it; he was searched in my parlour, and some silver was found on him - more than sufficient to pay for the bacon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have often got change for a note, when you have had silver - A. Yes. I put a mark on the note, in my house - I had given it to Haggerty first.</p>

            . I am an officer of East Smithfield. Haggerty brought me a note, (looks at one) this is it. I went to Wakeley, and took the prisoner. I gave Wakeley the note, but kept my eye on it, while he put his mark on it - he returned it to me. I found 5 s. and some halfpence on the prisoner, and asked him where he got the note, he said he got the note from two sailors, whom he took from Gravesend, to carry on board an East Indiaman; I asked his name and residence, he said he had no residence, for he lived on board a barge, that he had no fixed barge, but used to lay on board barges.</p>

            . I am a lighterman, and live at Fulham. I have known the prisoner twenty-five years. About the middle of September, I saw him at the Bells, public-house, at Fulham - I was having some beer with some friends; he came up to me with another man, and said, will you give me some beer? I told him to drink; he said he had got a barge of coals lying at Wandsworth, and if I would come down, he would give me some coals; after that we went in doors, and he asked me to give him change for a 1 l. note - he gave me one; I went to the landlord and got change for it, which I gave to the prisoner. We then had half a pint of gin together; I frequented the house, but never changed a note there before nor since; the landlord returned me the note afterwards, and I gave it to Mr. Lees - I have not paid the landlord the value of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your oath do not you expect the bank will pay it for you on the conviction of this man - A. I expect they will pay me the 20 s.</p>
               <p>Q. If you do not fix it on somebody else, you must be responsible yourself - A. Yes. The men who were with me are not here. I have lived at Fulham thirty-five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been away from Fulham at any time - A. No. I was at sea six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go out of the way, being charged with stealing timber - A. No, no such charge was ever made against me, to my knowledge. I have lived at Fulham constantly for the last six years. The note was returned to me, by the landlord, six days after; I saw him write on it - I did not mark it; I believe he wrote my name on it.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. How long is it since you went to sea - A. Thirty-six years ago. I belonged to the waterman's company.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any promise made to you of being paid anything for this prosecution by the Bank - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect to be paid for anything but your attendance - A. I expect to be paid for the note.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you know Mr. Quintum - A. Yes, he lived at Fulham, and was a lighterman; I worked for him about eighteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you absent yourself from his service for eighteen months - No. I was absent about six months, and that was a year and an half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said you was never away from Fulham, except when you went to sea - A. I was still at Fulham, he and I felt out. On my oath it was not about stealing timber, there never was any charge against me about timber.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. After you left him, were you received back again - Yes, to work with the same craft, but with his servant.</p>

On the 3d of November, the prisoner came to the house with two others, they stood in the lobby of the bar; one of the other men had a glass of peppermint - they spoke together, the others had nothing. The other man tendered a 1 l. note, and the prisoner stood close to him at the time; the other man said he wished to have change, or he could not pay me; I said I could not give change, but would go and ask my husband if he had any. I went to him in the parlour, and Furzeman, the constable, was there; I took the note to him, he gave his opinion on it; I returned to the man who gave it to me - the prisoner and the others were still there.

            . I am an inspector of bank notes, and have been so above twenty years. (looks at the note uttered to R. Romanel.)</p>
               <p>Q. Does your experience enable you to say whether it is genuine or forged - A. It is forged; the paper is not used by the Bank, and it has not the Bank water-mark; there is an imitation of one, but it is not a water-mark, it has not got the waving lines, like the Bank paper; the words Bank of England, and One, are made in the fabric of the paper, but it is not so in this; there is an imitation of it, which is done, I believe, by pressure and composition - There are various ways by which it may be done. The line containing London and the date is engraved, and done with engraving ink; in a genuine note it is stereotyped, and with printing ink. It purports to be signed by P. Lister; we have a signing-clerk of that name, I have know him ever since I have been in the Bank, and know his hand-writing - it is not his signature. In this note the letters No before the number are engraved, but in a genuine note they are stereotyped. (looks at that paid to Wakeley) It is forged, and a very bad imitation; it is the name in every respect with the other, but not off the same plate; the paper, plate, and signature, are all forged. The plate line appears to have had something passed over it, to give it the appearance of stereotype. (looks at that changed by Hatch) It is forged in every respect, and of the same description as the last, and off the same plate; anybody may ascertain that. (looks at that offered to Harison) It is forged in every respect, and of the same description as the first note, off the same plate, and the numbers are also the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You have been twenty years an inspector, no doubt your experience is very great; I do not suppose you have ever met with any notes, in which you have been deceived - A. I have not. once did many years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. There have been a great many notes paid by the Bank within the last year, which have afterwards been discovered to be forged - A. There has been several.</p>
               <p>Q. Sixty or seventy - A. I do not know that. The bank-paper is made in Hampshire. There is nobody here from the manufactory. I was never there myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell how the water-mark is made, except what you hear from others - A. No. I speak from the inspection I have had. I see the paper at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it came from the manufactory - A. I have seen it delivered, and have seen the thing the water-mark is done with. I never saw it used.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever compare the note with the bank plate - A. No. They have many plates. I can safely say, from my experience, that it is not a water-mark. I am certain, as far as my judgment goes, that it is not the signature of Lister.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. You have been twenty years an inspector, during which time you have become well acquainted with the bank paper and plates - A. Yes, and am in the daily habit of seeing thousands of notes both before and after they are impressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at the notes, and bearing in your mind your recollection of the character of the paper and plates, have you the least doubt of their not being genuine - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. In the instances you have mentioned of forged notes having been paid at the Bank, have the attention of the inspectors been called to them, or is it from the neglect of their not being called to see them - A. Generally from neglect. If an inspector pays a forged note, he is obliged to lose it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any difficulty in distinguishing these notes from genuine ones - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your notes are made agreeable to Act of Parliament - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Suppose a good note was issued without a name to it; such things have been done - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. If you had seen this signature at the bottom of a letter, or anywhere else, should you have said it was not your hand-writing - A. I should have known it was not my hand-writing. I am certain it is not my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have known this if you had seen it on any other instrument - A. I think I should.</p>

               <p>A JUROR to MR. LEES. Q. Has an instance ever occurred that a genuine note has been rejected and stamped as forged - A. I told you, Sir, on Monday, that it had. It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020066"/>was a very old note, very much worn, and pasted at the back, as I stated before, and was rejected by a young inspector. If it had been properly looked at I think it would have been discovered.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you if you ever saw the water-mark made, and I think you said Yes - A. I never said so. I have seen the moulds from which they have been made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever a paper-maker, engraver, or worked on stereotype - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I think on Monday you admitted that there were private marks, and that the public would not be benefitted by their being known - A. There are private marks.</p>

On Tuesday the 3d of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to our shop, with Kingston and another. They came into the lobby of the bar; he asked me for a glass of peppermint. I served him; it came to 3 d. He laid a 1 l. bank note on the counter, and I said I had not got change, but would go and ask if my husband had any. He asked the others if they would have any thing; they gave no answer. I took the note into the parlour where my husband was with Furzeman and Hearn. I showed Furzeman the note; he gave his opinion about it. I returned to the bar, gave it to the prisoner, and told him I thought it was not good. He made no answer. Furzeman was then in the lobby, and took it out of his hand, and asked where he got it? He mentioned a name, which I do not recollect. Furzeman gave me the note, I gave it to my husband, who marked it in my presence - (looks at it.) - This is it.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles's. On the 3d of November I was in the parlour of the public-house, with Hearn and Harrison. Mrs. Harrison brought a 1 l. note to me; I examined it, gave my opinion on it, then went to the bar, found the prisoner, Kingston, and a man named Dent. I went up to the bar-door, Dent turned round and was going away rather quick; I stopped him, and told him to go back. Mrs. Harrison then returned the note to the prisoner, and told him it was a bad one. I asked him for it, he directly handed it to me; I then handed it to Harrison, and told him to mark it. I also marked it, and then asked the prisoner where he got it; he said he got it from his master, Mr. Pocock, Whitefriars. I searched him. He held his arms for me to search him - I found nothing on him; I also searched Dent, who had a bundle of paper under his arms, and found 5 l. 2 s. 6 d. in silver, on him, and a good 1 l. note. I asked where he lived, he said anywhere when he had got money; at that time Kingston was swearing he would not be searched by anybody; I reasoned with him for about a minute before I attempted to lay hold of him. I then held him down while Hearne searched him; he found 24 s. on him - we took him to the watch-house. I then asked the prisoner where he lived, he also said any where when he had got money. I asked Dent again where he lived, he said in West-street, West Smithfield, and that he had the silver from a gentleman named Donelly, who was gone to Ireland. I again asked the prisoner where he got the note, he said he took it of a gentlemen on the water, but mentioned no name.</p>

I asked him what address I should put on it? He said he worked for Mr. Rotten, but that he lived at No. 3, Baldwin's-gardens. I knew Mr. Rotten, of Mount Pleasant, he is a large iron-founder, and lives about four hundred yards from me. I told him so, but do not know that he said he lived there. I asked the prisoner his name? He said Smith, No. 3, Baldwin's-gardens, which I wrote on the note in his presence, (looks at one) this is it. I beckoned to my wife, as I intended to have the first man stopped, who came to change a note, as I did not know a good one from a bad one, I did not suspect the note. I sent for an officer, Read came, and found 12 s. 6 d. in silver on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say his master's name was Robson, not Rotten - A. He did not, I could not be mistaken, as I mentioned the name again to him. The door was open, and he might have ran away.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Had you ever intimated to him any doubt of the note - A. None whatever; I am certain he said Rotten. I knew Robson also, he lives in Little Sutton-street.</p>

On the 14th of April, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at a bull-bait; a man was talking with me, and said he had been attacked, and the person wanted to rob him; I said I would forgive anybody who robbed me, he said do not boast; I turned round, and was surrounded by a gang of about fifteen - they pushed me about; the prisoner came up, and asked the man what he was looking at, but he made no reply; the prisoner said he would fetch him a punch of the mouth. They knocked me down, beat me violently, and took my watch and half a crown from me. I am sure he is the man, I knew him before - one of his companions took it. The prisoner was the first that laid hold of me.</p>

            . I was at the bull-bait; I was on the roof of a house, and saw the prisoner with fourteen more, pushing the people about, and knocking them down; the prosecutor soon after informed me he was robbed, and mentioned the names of three of them, the prisoner was one; I took two, but the prisoner, seeing me go into a public-house, got away. I never saw him from that day till last Monday, when I took him, in consequence of an anonymous letter.</p>

            . I was at the bull-bait, and saw the prisoner there with several others, hustling the people, and turning their pockets inside out; I saw him go to the place where the robbery was committed. I afterwards saw him, about 100 yards from me; he saw me, and ran off, and has absconded ever since.</p>
