                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. On the 30th of May I was at Ponder's-end—my attention was drawn to a load of hay opposite the Goat—I saw Larman and Thorogood with it—they were drinking together—I hid myself, and I saw Larman come into the road—he looked towards the spot where I was concealed, and near where I had been standing before for a short</p>

               <p>time—he then returned to the front of the public—house, and shortly afterwards Thorogood came to the road—he looked in that direction, and returned, and they drank again, and afterwards one of them came out, but I cannot say which, and he looked towards the spot again, and returned—shortly after the third time of their coming into the road, the cart was driven off towards Mr. Knight's—the White Hart is between there and Mr. Knight's—I went on there, and I saw a man come out from the yard, and from noticing his manner I hurried on—when I came in front of the yard of the White Hart, I saw Hunt at the bottom of the yard with a truss of hay in his hand—he was just inside the door of the stable—I could not tell where the cart was then, but I hurried round to the other side of the house, and met Thorogood coming from where I afterwards found the cart, which was behind the public—house, within four or five yards of the stable—I then saw Hunt shutting the stable-door, and he walked away—Larman was on the wheel of the cart where the load of hay was, and I saw a quantity of hay was littered from the cart towards the stable—door—I opened the stable-door, and went in—I saw the three trusses of hay, which I afterwards produced to Mr. Knight—they were in one of the stands on the left-hand side of the stable—there was no other hay there besides those three trusses—I then said to Larman, "What are you about here, come down and take that hay out again?"—he did not make any answer—I repeated the question, and he said, "What hay do you mean?"—I said, "That hay that you put in the stable"—he said, "Well, don't be in a hurry"—he then went to the stable, took the three trusses of hay out, and put them down by the cart—it was put on the cart—I took it to the station, and the cart afterwards went back to Mr. Knight's—when Larman brought the hay out of the stable, I said to him, "Is that your hay?"—he said, "Yes, Mr. Knight's; I took it off the cart because it hung"—the White Hart is not a mile from Mr. Knight's—there is a ford which they must go through to go to the Goat and the White Hart—there is no ford the other way—I kept Lar<lb/>man in custody till I got assistance—I then took Hunt and the other matt who was discharged—Thorogood was brought to the station on the Monday morning—I told him I should detain him for being concerned with Larman in stealing that hay of Mr. Knight's—he said, "I was not there at all"—he was the man who was drinking with Larman at the Goat, and who was close to the cart at the White Hart—there is no doubt about that—Hunt is ostler at the White Hart—I was present when the trusses of hay were counted—there were thirty-one—I have compared the three trusses of hay I took with the hay on the cart—they appeared to agree—I know the writing of Mr. Williams the Magistrate—this is his writing to this deposition—it was read over to Tborogood.</p>

I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint—this is a counterfeit half-crown, cast in a mould—it is white Britannia metal—it hat been partly fused, but there is all the impression of a half-crown on it—it ii of the reign of Geo. III., 1819—putting it into hot liquid metal after leaving the mould would give it this appearance—it is the same metal as the spooni—(<hi rend="italic">examining the articles produced</hi>)—this is a piece of metal called a "get," which is attached to the coin, and subsequently separated—here is a piece of similar metal, which appears to have been in a state of fusion—here is similar sort of metal adhering to this piece of carpet—these are three white Britannia metal spoons, and an iron spoon, containing similar metal, which has been fused—a file, the teeth of which are full of similar metal, and it is used to remove the surplus metal off the coin after casting—here is another file, a galvanic battery, and another in a jar—they are used to electroplate coin or anything—they are Smee's batteries—this bottle produced by White contains a solution of salt of silver—another bottle with a weak dilution of sulphuric acid, used to excite the battery—these copper wires are to conduct the battery to the articles to be plated—here is another quantity of the same solution—toil plaster of Paris is what moulds are usually made of—there is no impression remaining on the pieces of the mould—they are made of plaster of Paris—the whole apparatus is what are used to make counterfeit coin, and a good half-crown is used to make an impression on the mould—here is a portion of a counterfeit shilling nearly fused—silver sand is used to polish the metal before tke galvanic operation.</p>

               <p>a little before ten—John Oddy was there when I first went in—I knew them both before—I have drank with Oddy several times—he is a shoe<lb/>maker or something in the leather line—the prisoner wanted to drink out of a pot of beer which stood on the counter, belonging to Oddy and his com<lb/>panions—he went to take it up—Oddy said he should not have it, and told him to go and work for it—he called him a <hi rend="italic">spunging beggar</hi>, and said he should have no beer from him—the prisoner appealed to a wooden-legged man, another shoemaker, to know whether he was a <hi rend="italic">spunging beggar</hi>—the man said, "I don't know, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, I never saw you spend much"—there was then a laugh and kind of ridicule—they stood talking and wrangling like together, the prisoner, Oddy and five or six more, in a cluster round the bar—I did not take particular notice what it was about—I did not hear any abusive language—it was <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> and wrangling mixed together—a few minutes after the first attempt the prisoner tried to take the pot up again—Oddy then took it up and held it at arm's-length with one hand, and kept the prisoner at a distance with the other, that he should not get bold of it—it was not done violently—I did not see him move out of the position he stood in—there were no blows—the prisoner stood a minute or two, then muttered something, gave his foot a bit of a stamp, then turned and went out—he came back again in I suppose ten minutes or a quarter of ar hour, as near as I can tell—he pushed the door open with his arm and looked in—the wooden-legged man who stood there went towards the door to him and said, "Do you want me, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>?"—the prisoner said something, I did not bear what, and nodded his head towards Oddy—Oddy then went towards him, and as he went a man standing at the side of the door said to Oddy, "Mind, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, what you are about, he has got a stick or a poker behind him"—the prisoner eould hear that—Oddy went on, and said, "I will stick him," meaning that be would take the stick from him—he then went out at the door—the people inside ran out at the other door—I followed Oddy out at the same door as he went out at—I do not think anybody else went out at that door—Oddy went towards the prisoner—in going out at the door the prisoner backtd away from the door till he got within a foot or two of the corner of the street, five or six yards from the door—when Oddy got to the prisoner he put his left hand on the prisoner's shoulder and the other behind him to feel what he had got under the tail of his coat, saying, "Give it us Joe," or something, "like a man"—I heard the words, "Like a man"—it was said quite in a calm manner—the prisoner then punched him, as I thought, two or three times in the stomach—I conld not say how many times—Oddy drew himself in and said he had a severe blow, he was stabbed—the prisoner was tripped up by a man, and as he went back a knife went out of his hand down a grating behind him—I could not see that it was a knife at the time, but I heard something fall—I put my arm down the area and got a knife up, which I gave to the policeman.</p>

               <p>This letter contained the following paragraph:—"The agreement is, that you shall be paid a commission of 3 per cent, on the net receipts from orders to the concern, not being from the Birmingham connection, or on account of orders for exportation, unless such orders for exportation were obtained from new customers expressly by you; but from this commission of 3 1/2 per cent. you are subject to a deduction of 3 1/2 per cent. for all bad debts arising to the concern from customers on whose payments you would have had a com<lb/>mission, but on the understanding that if your commission does not reach</p>

               <p>300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, that you shall be paid that sum, and that you shall be allowed to draw at that rate till the time of settlement."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These were the terms on which he was employed from 1842? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was agent in London—I have had frequent communi<lb/>cations with him, both verbal and otherwise—he was in the habit of receiving money on account of the firm—it was bis duty on receipt of them to transmit bills direct to Birmingham, and the cash to a banker's in London—he was constantly in the habit of transmitting sums that he so received, with the statement from whom he received them, immediately after the receipt of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is something said about a settlement in this letter, were you in the habit of settling with the prisoner, as to the amount of commission he was to receive for his orders? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on the 31st of March this letter—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb/>ing at it</hi>)—was received in the prisoner's handwriting—it is an account of his claim for service during the past twelve months, and a statement of the monies received in payment of that account—this is dated March 31, 1846—it was my habit to settle with him at that time—he here makes a statement of 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due to him from Gammon and Son—I have never received from him to the credit of Mr. Henry Wildman, 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was his duty to have remitted these sums immediately he received them, and he has not done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This man had been engaged in some capacity for eight or nine years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it may be more—he was what may be popu<lb/>larly termed a traveller—I have no recollection of there having been any negotiation on the subject of a partnership—I do not believe there ever was—he was entitled to a commission on the whole receipts of the concern, with the exception of the Birmingham trade, and that which was the subject of exportation—supposing the general receipts of the concern, except the Birm<lb/>ingham trade and the exportation, to amount to 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner was the immediate procurer of only 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would have been entitled to the commission on the whole 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he has applied for the balance on that return—I am not aware whether he has examined the books, but I know he applied to do so some two years ago, and I distinctly told him that the account as made out, did not show 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year due to him for commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the general returns, with the exception mentioned, were 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he were to procure 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other turned out to be bad debts, would he be subject to return 3 1/2 per cent.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as he had the profit on one side, he had the loss on the other—we had agreed that his salary should be 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we put on 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for expenses—I think that would do to cover his expenses—he was latterly out very little—I should think since this agreement, taking the average, he was not out of London one month in the year, or six weeks—he was discharged on the 11th of May—I am not aware whether he had been any part of this year out of London, or how much of last year he was out of London—I do not know whether he was obliged to have a horse and chaise—I have had conversation with him about his expenses—he has been allowed to remain with an arrear unsettled—not his account unsettled, but a balance in his hand, not paid ever since 1842—I should say it was from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you complained to him of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This was a balance of money actually handed to him—we never allowed him to keep money he received.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean that the balance he retained, and did not account for, was not money he received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There may have been an instance or two of money he received, but it has always been remonstrated</p>

               <p>against—those were of trifling amount—it waa distinctly stated that if he re<lb/>ceived any money which he did not pay over, it would be an offence against us, and any money he wanted, was to be sent him from Birmingham.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Birmingham—he has not put in any claim for money owing to him—he rendered an account, making himself a debtor to the amount of 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was principally a London traveller—the great majority of the accounts were London accounts—the country trade was so little that he was allowed to have t commission on the whole, that there might be no dispute about it.</p>

I have a saw-pit about ten or twelve yards from the side of my house, in a wheelwright's yard—on Friday, the 22nd of May, about a quarter after eleven, I went to bed—I think I was the last person up—I fastened the kitchen door—I swear it was fastened—my son got up first next morning—he is not here—when I got up the house was opened—I did not notice the kitchen window till we found we had been robbed—it was then unfastened—there was a broken square of glass the day before—a small wash-tub was moved, and placed under the window outside—a person could then put their hand in and undo the fastening—I missed the articles stated in the indictment—these now produced belong to me.</p>

On Wednesday night, the 8th of April, I went into the tap-room of the Box Tree public-house, Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, between ten and eleven o'clock—I was the worse for liquor—I saw the prisoner there—I have known him many years—I sat down on the same seat as him, and in two or three minutes he asked why I offended his wife, and called him an informer—I said I knew him to be the occasion of two men being taken up for desertion, and considered he was an informer—he directly struck me in the face—I stood, up to defend myself, to fight with him, intending to return his blow, and he knocked me down—we tustled to get the better of each other—he got me down—I got up again—we had another round—he knocked me down again—I fell convenient to the fire-place, and, to the best of my opinion, he caught me by my collar—I am sure he put his hand on my shoulder or collar—be knelt his knee on my body—I was lying on my back—I saw him put his hand to the boiler which was on the fire, and I believe on the cock—he certainly turned the cock, or spilt the water out of the boiler—it came over my belly and thighs immediately after, and scalded me very much—I tried to get up, and be kicked me on the face, and said he was sorry he did not scald the b----to death—the pot-boy assisted me home, and what took place after I do not know—I found myself in the London Hospital next morning—I remained there seven weeks and two or three days—I am much better now, but feel it very slightly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the presidents of the London district of the General Post-office. In consequence of circumstances which, occurred on the part of the Post-office, I made an arrangement for posting twd letters at the Aldgate receiving-office—on the 19th of May I made up twd letters—I put inside one, directed to Maty Donahue, a half-somelgw and a shilling, wrapped in a piece of brae paper—I marked both pieees of com hi two places—it was addressed to "Mary Donahue, at Mr. D.V public house, Sackwell-street, Dublin, Ireland"—I gave thctt letter to Welcome Cole, inspector of letter-carriers, and at the same time gave him another letter, ad<lb/>dressed to Miss Coventry, Upper Brixton—I gave him directions what to do with the letters—if they had been posted at the Aldgate district receiving-house before eight o'clock on the morning of the 20th, they ought to hare arrived at the General Post-office about twenty or five-and-twenty minute after eight—I was in attendance at that time, on the morning of the 20th of May, at the Post-office—I examined the letters which came from the Aldgate re<lb/>ceiving-house about half-past eight—the letter to Miss Coventry was among them, on the top of the bundle of paid letters—the paid and unpaid letters</p>

               <p>All Saints, Poplar. On Saturday, the 6th of Junt, I was on the pier about twenty minutes to five o'clock in the afternoon, altering a mooring-chain—the prisoner, Molloy and George Palmer passed me, and were blas<lb/>pheming together, using dreadful language—they were tipsy, and took their meats on the after-part of the dummy, where the steam-boats come to—they commenced quarrelling and blaspheming dreadfully—Palmer said, "You never gare it me"—I do set know what he meant—Molloy said, "I gave you one a-piece"—Palmer pulled both his trowsers' pockets out, and laid, "Have I anything there?"—he opened the lid of a small box, and said to me, H Is there anything in that?"—Palmer then left them on the pier, and had some conversation with some men on Garfield's-wharf—he returned in about a minute, in rather as excited manner, on the barge—there was a good deal of pushing each other—they began quarrelling again—he again went on Garfield's-wharf, and as he returned on the pier, be met a lady and child, and in order not to interrupt them, he leaped over on the outside dummy—Molloy tapped him on the cheek, and called him "George," in a friendly way—the prisoner took Palmer by the hand—he disengaged himself from tat prisoner—they stood in a fighting attitude, facing each other—Palmer liftsd up his hand as if he meant to make a blow—the prisoner said, "If you do, I will <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> you into the river"—the words were no sooner said, than he pushed Palmer headlong into the Thames, by <hi rend="italic">skoving</hi> him on the left breast—he went head-foremost into the mud, and never rose—there was about eight feet of water alongside the barge, and he stuck in the bottom—I leieated him with a staff in about a quarter of an hour—he was then dead—they tried to restore him for nearly an hour, but without success.</p>

On the 27th of May, about ten minutes after ten o'clock, I was at my mother's in East-row, Kensal New-town, next door to the prisoner's—I heard a violent screaming, and went to see what it was—I heard a violent noise in the passage against the prisoner's father's house—I went into the passage, and saw the prisoner fighting with these two girls—he had hold of both their heads pulling their hair—I parted him from Jane—he directly flew to Susan and was scuffling with her, trying to bite her—I went to part them—he then called to his little sister for the poker—she brought it, gave it to him—he struck Susan once on the head, and once on the arm with it—the blow stunned her for a few minutes—she fell on the window-sill—I took her into my mother's house—I took the poker from the prisoner—he said he would kill the first b----that came near him, and if he could not have the poker he would have a knife.</p>

I am a merchant, and have also land there as well as in England. I am well aware this is not the usual mode of addressing a lady on this subject, but I know no one hardly in London, and my time is very short here. Pray write without delay, and be assured this is no trifling hoax, to J. M.

In consequence of this letter I went to South-street, Grosvenor-square—I there met the prisoner—he said he was the person who had written to me, and he produced my answer—he represented himself as an American merchant, a man of good property—he said I should meet with a respectable man; and as 1 had no tie in England, I said I should have no objection—I was at that time lodging at No. 1, North-terrace—the prisoner called there the next day—I had several other interviews with him—the result was, we agreed to be married at St. George's, Hanover-square; but it being rumoured about that I was going to New York, I was arrested by somebody I owed a debt to, on the Tuesday as I was to have been married on the Thursday—I soon got out from the arrest, and the prisoner and I arranged that we would be married at Manchester—we did not wish to be married in London, as it would make him subject to the debt—that was about the middle of Jan.—I went to my lodging, and slept there one night—I afterwards removed to a coffee-house in the Commercial-road—the prisoner went there with me—we were not married—he lived there with me for a fortnight—we then went to Duke-street, Gosvenor-square, and then to another coffee-house—I then went to Paris, to receive some money—I was absent a fortnight—I then went to the Rainbow coffee-house wilh the prisoner—I paid the expenses all this time—he represented that his property was all in bond at Liverpool, and it would be attended with great loss to enforce the sale of his goods, by putting them in the hands of other parties—I had received 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Paris—I arranged with the prisoner to go to Liverpool—we were to go on the 10th of April, but on the day before that, the 9th of April, he went out and promised to be back at twelve o'clock, and 1 did not see him any more till the 18th of May—I advertised again on the 15th a May to get a situation, but I reversed my initials that time—I received this letter in answer—(<hi rend="italic">read.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I was cousin to the deceased, and live at No. 11, Rotherfield-street, Islington. He was forty-five years old—he was stout, rather strongly built, and a man capable of aadergoing consider<lb/>able fatigue, and a person of average health—I recollect bis having an attack of jaundice about two months ago—he had quite recovered from it, I think—I saw him last alive on the 28th of May—he was then complaining of rheumatic pains—I saw no more of him till I went down with Mrs. Dresser to Sad<lb/>brook-park on the Tuesday following—we got there about fow o'clock in the evening—I then saw his dead body there, at Dr. Ellis'g house—the body was swollen very much at the stomach, and the skin, under the eye, was discoloured, very dark indeed, and the ear and the back of the ear were nearly black, and there was a froth issuing from the nostrils and mouth* covering nearly the face—I did not see the discolouration of the eye at that time—they weie covered by the froth, but afterwards, when it was removed, I saw that they were both discoloured—I saw Dr. Ellis—I made some obser<lb/>vations as to his death from rheumatism,—the doctor said he did not die of rheumatism but from hepatitis—that had he known he had been suffering from that disease he would not have admitted biro—he stated that he admitted him on his own statement as suffering from rheumatism that afterwards he dis<lb/>covered, on examination, a disease of the liver; that he had a similar attack about five years ago, which the medical gentleman who attended him on that occasion treated as rheumatism—he said there was no imputation on the skill of the medical gentleman, for the disease (hepatitis) was of a very insidious character—it was frequently oaly discovered by the use of the knife, after death—on coming into the rocaa shortly after, I asked some questions as to the state of the liver, and he stated he would give me a brief diagnosis of the case, and handed me this paper—he expressed his readiness to assist at any post mortem examination, or to meet any medical man—he expressed great sympathy with the widow.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The following is the diagnosis.</hi>)</p>
               <p>"Mr. Richard Dresser came here on Friday last to seek relief from what he termed rheumatism iu the hip, (properly <hi rend="italic">sciatica</hi>,) giving no other par<lb/>ticulars—the case was thought admissible, but it soon appeared, that he had been suffering from hepatitis of the subacute character, giving rise to suppura<lb/>tion,</p>

               <p>occasioning exudations of lymph, and a rapid extension of the disease to the adjoining viscera—the symptoms were tympanitis, total inaction of the bowels, and sluggishness of the urinary organs; very severe pain in the left leg, from the groin along the thigh to the ankle; coldness of the extremities, and loss of power. He was treated as is usual to subdue the symptoms; the pain was soon suspended; the bowels, though stubborn, acted freely after the means had been tried, and continued to do so, and the urine either passed of itself, or was drawn off. The appetite allowed of his taking a little farinaceous nourishment; but the disease proceeded insidiously; the subacute inflammation advanced gradually, until there was no sign of active progress; the organ became very generally the seat of suppuration; the pulse became quicker and softer, with much perspiration; the countenance pale and sallow; there was tumefaction of the liver, with a doughy and dematous, or boggy fal of the hepatic region generally; the enlargement or bulging was very great about the false ribs; oppression, with dyspnœa, or short breathing, imme<lb/>diately preceded his decease, which took place at twenty minutes before eight o'clock this morning, June 2nd, without either a sigh or a struggle. In three or four hours after his decease the fluids filled the chest and throat, and oozed copiously out of the ears, nose, and mouth."</p>

               <p>that of tympanitis—I am not aware of any other—tympanitis means a flatu<lb/>lent state of the bowels—there was no appearance whatever of hepatitis, or of suppuration of the liver or viscera.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the presence of those circumstances stated in the paper, sup<lb/>posing them to have existed during life, be sufficiently indicated, to be judged of accurately by a person of competent skill in the medical profession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think sometimes it might be, but not generally—I confess it may be diffi<lb/>cult, but I think it might be judged of—I think it very difficult to ascertain suppuration of the liver, without a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—tympanitis of course could be judged of by distension of the bowels—hepatitis could not be ascertained from examination, except from the symptoms—I mean there may be fever with hepatitis—I think it might be told and judged of in the living subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming that diagnosis was accurate, that there was hepatitis, suppu<lb/>ration taking place, extending itself to the viscera as stated there, would the external application of wet cloths, and frequent bathing, be in your judg<lb/>ment a proper course of treatment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—a patient of his con<lb/>stitution, of feeble circulation, would unquestionably be more apt to become the subject of congestion by external applications of that kind, than persons of a more vigorous frame—I think I should be able to judge of that by the pulse—with a person of his constitution, I should certainly have objected to the application of a cloth dipped in water—to my mind, from the appearances I found, I should certainly say death was accelerated by the treatment described, at four o'clock on the Monday—or, at least that state of lungs and heart which I found, and to which I attribute the death.</p>

               <p>think such application injurious to any part when the circulation was to feeble, and the heart so feeble, and the extremities so cold, as I understand they were—I ascribe the coldness of the legs, and the other symptoms which Mrs. Dresser has spoken of, to loss of blood from congestion inwardly—they were deprived of blood internally—I think congestion was going on, which accounts for the symptoms which Mrs. Dresser states she saw on Monday evening—medical men are very often mistaken in these matters—I am frequently mistaken—it is impossible from mere observation of the symptoms, without a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, to ascertain beyond doubt the real nature of the disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Therefore you would hardly say that a man is to be judged, with refe<lb/>rence to his competence as to medical skill, or as to criminality if death should take place, you would be far from stating that he is to be judged, without a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination 1 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We find a man may mistake a minor complaint, certainly—he is to form a judgment of the disease; but, speaking criminally, we all probably apply in ignorance, therefore may come under the term of criminality, for applying what we suppose to be a remedy, and is afterwards proved to be injurious—I, in my judgment, think that the congestion which led to the death may have been accelerated by the appli<lb/>cation of wet bandages—I should say, having known him and his consti<lb/>tution seven years, it would have been very improper, at any time, to have applied water to the surface of his body—I was his medical attendant, and certainly had the advantage over one attending him for the first time—he was what we consider a healthy man, but I cannot say he had nothing the matter with him, because he had a feeble circulation, depending upon what we considered to be a feeble heart, but he had not disease—he might have gone on for very many years, perfectly well—I thought him a healthy man, but I think a medical man, judging from his pulse, at any time, even from the first illness, would see that he had a feeble circulation, and consequently that he must be careful in his mode of treatment—a good deal would depend on the temperature of the water applied—it would make a considerable difference whether the moisture was allowed to evaporate or not, and the length of time the application was continued is to be taken into consideration—there was con<lb/>gestion generally throughout the lungs, and the heart was considerably congested—the blood was in the cavity of the heart—I myself examined the heart, lungs, liver, viscera, and spleen, and then we were going on to the kidneys—I saw a part of the kidneys, but not enough to give a fair opinion—no ex<lb/>amination was made of the brain or spine—the head was not opened—we do riot always open the brain—probably, had I not examined the lungs, I might have been induced to look at the head, I do not know that I should—I saw quite sufficient to satisfy my own mind, and therefore did not prosecute it further—I believe a congested state of the brain might produce some con<lb/>gestion of the lungs—had such a state of the brain possibly existed, it might have produced the appearances about the lungs and heart, but from the in formation I had it could not have been the case.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTONE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a temperature of eighty-five degrees be proper to apply to a body of his description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I think it would be too cold, and casculated, generally, to produce the appearance which I saw is the lungs and liver, and with the symptoms that I have heard mentioned by Mrs. Dresser, I should think then very considerably so—I think that a bath at eighty-five degrees upon the constitution of the deceased would necessarily drive or propel the blood from the surface of the body to the internal organs, that is the lungs—I saw no trace whatever of any disease of the brain which would produce congestion of the pulmonary organs—I should say that the brain was not diseased, even without examining it—I think I could judge</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in partnership with Mr. Waterworth. I had not attended Mr. Dresser professionally myself—I made tht <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I believe it was on the Thursday after the death—Mr. Water<lb/>worth was with me part of the time, but was called away before I had com<lb/>pleted the whole examination—the body looked externally like a man that had been drowned, immersed in water, from bjs bloated countenance, and the bloody serum issuing from his mouth and hose—there was also a great deal of congestion throughout the whole of bis trunk—there was a great deal of congestion over the whole trunk posteriorally, which, might perhaps be the effect of gravitation—I proceeded to make an internal examination, and found the lungs and heart enormously congested or gorged with blood—ths heart was large and flabby, but otherwise healthy—the liver, I must say my<lb/>self, was, I thought, a little too much filled with blood, but in other respects perfectly healthy—the kidneys were slightly diseased—I ascribe the death to congestion of the lungs and heart, which might be produced cither from ex<lb/>exposure to cold, or cold applications of water, which would propel the blood from the surface of the body into the internal organs—I have been present while the evidence has been given, and have read the diagnosis—the symp<lb/>toms described in that do not agree with the opinion I formed from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I know of very few instances of suppuration of the liver—I should not think the application of cold water, or water at eighty-five, a proper course to adopt for a person suffering from suppuration of the liver—I should believe the system under such a state, would not have power to produce reaction; it would tend to lower him too much—I should not think the application of cold water, or water at eighty-five, would be a proper treatment for a person suffering from the symptoms described in that diagno<lb/>sis—I should not adopt it myself—I believe it is wrong, and it is considered so by the profession generally, nor was it proper in the state I discovered on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not, by the force of gravitation, descend as far as it can, from the relaxed state of the vessels, and concentrate itself around the internal organs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the lower parts of the body, but not particularly to the inter<lb/>nal organs—it goes to the lowest part it can get to, to the part nearest the surface of the ground—the lungs occupy the whole cavity of the chest, and lie as much anteriorally as posteriorally—the body was on its back—the con<lb/>gestion could not have been produced by gravitation, and I can hardly think it could be increased—I believe the lungs were so fully congested, that I doubt whether the congestion could be increased by the effect of motion—there was no decomposition, not sufficient to give rise to anything of that sort—if you examine a body next day, there is a slight degree of putrefaction—there was not sufficient in this case to give rise to any disorganization; I think, not sufficient to give rise to any descent from the lungs—I think there was not sufficient putrefaction to have caused congestion through gravitation—I do not think congestion tends to increase decomposition, and with that a relaxed state of the vessels—we did not examine the head or brain, because we thought we had found sufficient cause of death—the body looked as if it had been drowned—I connect that with the fact of congestion—the face wai bloated; I do not think that was the result of incipient decomposition—I will say it was not—the frothy appearance is all to be connected with the congested state of the lungs—there is always a certain quantity of air left in the lungs, which, acting on the fluids, where they exist, would tend to cause an oozing out after death—that is not the case with every man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What fluids are you speaking of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Blood—the lungs were so gorged with blood that it oozed into the tubes, as you may say, the air tubes of the lungs, even after death—it is impossible so to gorge the lungs but what you can get a certain quantity of air in, but air is a very different thing from blood—some part of the kidney was so diseased, that there was not enough of it to perform its functions—it prevented the secretion—that was certainly caleu<lb/>lated to produce very serious disease—it interferes with the blood, and I should think would generally disorder the whole system, but the amount of disease here was not sufficient for that—there was sufficient disease of the kidney here to interfere with the due exercise of its functions—a man may go on with such a state of kidneys for many years—I believe there are means of ascertaining that the kidneys are diseased long prior to death—we of course cannot ascertain the amount of disease before we see them, but can ascertain that they are considerably diseased—I think there was not sufficient disease in this man's kidneys to interfere very seriously with his general state of health—I believe they would secrete the urine properly—I have frequently examined bodies where persons have had a greater amount of disease of the kidneys, and yet not have suffered during life—there was no doubt here sufficient indication of disease—my partner did not want to see it, as he was called away on urgent business—I found it just as he was leaving, and called his attention to it—I do not think he said he could see no trace of disease, but that I might prosecute the inquiry if I liked—had I seen the individual with cold extremities, and the difficult breathing which has been spoken of, I should have thought him suffering, if not from congestion, at least from a great tendency to it—I think there may be other derangements which would lead to those symptoms—I know there are several—from other symptoms taken in connection with those two that have been named, I should have imagined that he was suffering from congestion of the lungs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had happened to know that just before, the bowels were in a very disordered state, that it was necessary to have recourse to artificial means for their relief, would all those things together have induced you to doubt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>

               <p>No, they would irot, certainly—had I seen an individual suffering as described by the widow, 1 should have considered he was suffering from congestion of the lungs, I mean the difficulty of breathing, the dark countenance, and the cold extremities—the darkness of countenance was connected with the con<lb/>gestion, by preventing the due circulation of the blood—there are diseases of the brain which cause congestion of the lungs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am "boots" at this establishment. There are two bathmen—I took up water for a bath for Mr. Dresser on the Monday morning—that was the first time I interfered, except that I sat up with him on Sunday night—Dr. Ellis slept in the adjoining room—he did not altogether sit up, but came into the room occasionally—Mr. Dresser was pat into a bath at five o'clock on Monday morning—I do not know the temperature—I do not understand that—there was some warm water in it—I do not know how long he was in it—I rubbed him all the time he was in the bath by the doctor's order—I should not like to say about how long it was—. I pay no attention to anything but what I am ordered to do—of course he was there more than one minute or one moment—I should not like to say about five minutes—I am still employed in the establishment—I assisted at another bath for him at half-past eight o'clock that morning, and rubbed him on that occasion—I do not recollect how long he was in it—we were so busy—there was a deal of work to do, and such confusion—after he was taken out of the bath he was put into the blankets on the bed, in a lying posture, and covered with them—I cannot recollect whether any bandages were put on him—I do not know whether he remained in blankets from five o'clock till the second bath at half-put eight—I was not present—I found him at half-past eight in blankets as I bsd left him at five—when he came out of the bath at half-past eight he was pat into blankets again—I saw Mrs. Dresser there that day—I saw Mr. Dresser again somewhere in the after part of the day, just alter dinner, which is about three o'clock—he then appeared very poorly—he was still wrapped in blankets—Dr. Ellis was with him, and ordered me to rub his feet with my hands—they were rather cold, not particularly, but rather cold—I was in the room ten minutes or a quarter of an boor—nothing else was done to him—I left Maynard, the bathman, with him—I did not see Mr. Dresser again till half-paat nine, when I was called in to remain up with him during the night—Mrs. Dresser had then gone—Dr. Ellis was in the adjoining room, but not so much as the night before, as he was more with Mr. Dresser than on the Sunday nigbt—I remained with him till half-past three in the morning—he was pretty comfortable—I think now and then he complained of a little pain in his left side—he was in bed in a lying posture—he had some tapioca once or twice—I gave him no medicine—when I left, at half-past three o'clock, Dr. Ellis was in the adjoining room—I left another person called Charles witb him, who was in the house—he was the door porter—his duties are to answer; the bell and introduce visitors—I saw no more of Mr. Dresser till about half-past ten—he was then dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I have one partner—we live at No. 38, Gutter-lane, Cheapside—the prisoner was in our service as a traveller—he was discharged on the 18th of Feb.—I had not missed anything myself when he was dis<lb/>charged, but I understood there had been some cambric missed on the 14th of Feb.—I did not know that when I discharged him—I keep a selling-boot:, in which entries are made of the sales of stock—on missing the cambric, the stock was taken all over again—I think that was on the day after the pri<lb/>soner left—it was taken by Hayter and Atkinson—a list was given to me of what was missing, amounting to 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards caused George</p>

               <p>Hayter, in consequence of something I heard from him, to purchase some cambric of the prisoner, who I understood had then become a partner with Mr. Murray, as commission agents, in Paternoster-row—the cambric was sent to us by Mr. Hayter, who had been in our employ, but was then in business—on the stock-taking at the end of Dec. we had two pieces of demi'-French cambric, No. 8286, and marked 46 in selling characters—it is the custom in France, I understand, to divide the cambric into demi's before they are sent to this country—sometimes the pieces run longer than two demi's, and then the remnant is torn off, and the piece divided—I examined the cambric brought to me by Hayter, and the remaining cambric in my stock—I compared a piece of cambric I had, No. 8286, with a piece found in possession of the prisoner—in my judgment they had been one piece—I made a com<lb/>parison between the remaining stock of our cambric handkerchiefs and some handkerchiefs purchased by Hayter, and brought to me—to the best of my belief, they had once been one—this is the demi'-cambric I had, No. 8286, and this is the cambric I got from the prisoner—they are manufactured in a length of from fifteen to sixteen yards and a half, and after cutting off the odd measure, they are then torn in half and called demi's, and the handkerchiefs the same—I saw the prisoner—I think it was on the 28th of May—ft wu after I had called in the assistance of Forrester—the prisoner came to our counting-house—he said, "This is a very unpleasant affair about the cam<lb/>brics"—I said I was ready to hear anything he had to say—he said that be bought them of a man named St. Croix, a little Frenchman, with a tuft on his chin, introduced to him by Mr. Bissori, of Jersey—I requested Mr. Leary to take down in writing what the prisoner said—Mr. Leary was in the counting-house—there was merely a glass between him and the prisoner—the door was open, but whether the prisoner saw Mr. Leary or not, I do not know—I think the prisoner said that the bargain for these goods was made at Kennan's hotel, or the transaction took place there—he said he bad an invoice of them, and he thought he could find it—he said it was made out in pencil, in French—I think he described it about the size of bis hand—he said if I would walk over to his place, he would endeavour to show me the invoice, or a copy of it in a book—I went over with him to his warehouse—I think he looked in his desk first of all for the invoice—he said he could not find it—he opened a book, and showed me the invoice in the book—I looked at it—it did not satisfy my mind—I came out—I went back again in about twenty minutes, with Mr. Leary—I did not find the prisoner there—I came out and met him at the corner of St. Paul's-churchyard—I went back with him to his warehouse—I asked him if he would show me the receipt for the money—he looked for the receipt, and could not lay his hand upon it—he said he had paid Mr. St. Croix 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, less ten per cent.—or whether the ten per cent, left the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, I do not know—I cannot identify the other goods Mr. Hayter bought of the prisoner, with the certainty that I can these before me—I never knew a person named St. Croix.</p>

               <p>whether he mentioned the sum of 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or only pointed to the book—Mr. James is my partner—I am not aware that he is here—he takes a part in the business—I do not think I ever saw him sell, unless it was to a private friend—we sell different articles to private friends—we should make no difference in selling to them and to another person—we had nine or ten persons in our employ from Jan. to Feb. the 18th, when the prisoner left—they had equal access to our stock—I do not think any of them had been dismissed——the prisoner came in Sept.—he was to have three months' notice previous to leaving—I paid him to the 1st of March—the time would have been up on the 11th of March—when we took stock on the 1st of Jan. we had 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock—we had the prisoner from Mr. Chippendale, at Manchester—when he left us I heard he was looking out for a situation—a card was one day shown to me—I was asked if I knew that firm, and I smiled—I suppose that was shortly after he commenced business, but it was so small a thing I did not notice—my suspicions were excited about three days after the prisoner left, and I had a doubt of his honesty.</p>

I called in the assistance of Forrester—I saw Mr. Bisson, in Jersey, on the Thursday before the prisoner was brought up—I did not tell him that the prisoner had been robbing me—I was very distant in what I said—Mr. Bisson came to London, I think, on the Wednesday following, and on that day I took him to my house in the evening—I said to him, "You had better not be going to Kennan's to be plagued by Sharpe's friends"—I thought Sharpe's friends would endeavour to prevent him from coming for<lb/>ward—I believe Mr. Bisson to be a respectable man.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in the prosecutor's employ, I now carry on business of my own at No. 49, Bow-lane. In consequence of a request made to me by the prosecutor, I became a purchaser of these goods of the prisoner—I saw the prisoner on the subject on the 22nd of May, at his own places—he said these were some samples left for him to sell, by Mr. St. Croix—that they were twenty or thirty per cent, under the regular prices—I said if they were so cheap as that, I thought I could sell them for him if be would allow roe to have samples of them—on looking at them they appeared to me to be cheap, and it was arranged that I was to call the next day for samples—I went next day, and received fourteen pieces of cambric and handkerchief together—he said Mr. Murray had made arrangements with Mr. St. Croix, from whom they expected to get an assignment of French waistcoating—I asked for the invoice—he said his card which he gave me was sufficient—he had given me a card with the memorandum of them—he asked me to whom I should sell—I said to the retail trade—he asked me if I could sell them for cash—I told him all my transactions were cash at the end of a month, at two and a-half per cent.—I took the cambrics to my own warehouse, and left them, and I went to Mr. Lewis—the prisoner came there, and beckoned me out—I found he had a person with him—we all three went to my warehouse, and the person with the prisoner bought one of the pieces—I then told the prisoner I did not think the goods were so cheap as he had represented, and in consequence of that he lowered the price of some of them from 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 48<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and from 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 52<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said if I could sell them for cash he would make a further deduction of five per cent.—on the 29th of May the prisoner came to my warehouse—he said it was an unpleasant business we bad got into—I said it was all right as far as I was concerned, I could show where I bought them—He said O yes, he could clear me, and show where he got them—he said he had bought them of a person he met at Kennan's, and previous to buying them, he had samples sent to Mr. Tilly's, in Friday-street—I said it was a different statement to what he had said before—he said it was unfortunate it was different—I believe that was all that passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Little Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and am employed as a private watchman. On the Friday afternoon, the 5th of June, I was opposite to the National Gallery, in Trafalgar-square, and saw the prisoner and two other persons—in consequence of what I observed I followed them to Panton-street, Haymarket—they all three stopped at Messrs. Garrard's, a sil<lb/>versmith's shop—I went into Mr. Brumby's, a bookseller's shop, and asked him to allow me to watch from his window what was going on—while I was looking out of the window, the prisoner came up to the prosecutor's window first—another came up close to him—one of them waited at the corner of Panton-street—I saw the prisoner run something along the glass—I did not see anything in his hand—after that the other held a handkerchief in front, where he had been drawing along the glass—a gentleman's servant came out of the shop—on that the prisoner and his companion walked away—I could not see whether they abstracted anything—I suffered them to go because I thought it had not been perfected, and that they would come back—the gen<lb/>tleman's servant pointed to the glass—I went out of the shop, and found the prisoner in a watering-place, in a court in the Haymarket—I had called the attention of the bookseller to what I saw—I called a policeman, and told him to take the prisoner to the silversmith's shop, on suspicion of felony—he did so—I do not know what became of the other two—I never saw them except at the corner of the street—I lost sight of the prisoner, but not for a minute—I am positive he is the same man—I found the glass had been out—I bad seen it perfect before they came to the window.</p>

I keep a bookseller's shop at the corner of Panton-street, opposite Mr. Garrard's—On Friday, the 5th of June, Hind asked me to allow him to come into my shop, and called my attention to what he saw—I saw the prisoner at Mr. Garrard's window, and a slim young man with him, who placed a red handkerchief at the corner of a square of glass-the prisoner immediately placed his hand under the handkerchief—I observed a motion of his hand, as if he used a screw-driver or gimlet—a livery servant came out of the shop, and the prisoner and his companion retired from the window for a few minutes, up to the Haymarket-they returned and made a second attack on the property of Mr. Garrard—I went out, and on my return home the prisoner was in custody—I have not a shadow of a doubt touching his identity.</p>

I joined the ship at New York on the 11th of May—I took on board six gold pieces, of the value of eight dollars each, one four-dollar piece, and one two-dollar piece, all in gold, a silver dollar, an English sovereign, and fifteen cents, American money, in silver—that money does not all pass in America, only the cents—I kept them in a trunk in the forecastle, and the key in my pocket—about an hour after I left New York I found the trunk was broken open, and missed my money—we had not then left the American coast—we were two or three miles from the coast—we had left the New York river, the Hudson—we were not within cannon-shot of the coast—I reported my loss to the first officer—I saw nothing of the money on the voyage—when 1 arrived I gave the prisoner into custody, on suspicion.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Poplar, On the 8th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prosecutor—he was very faint-the left side of his head and face were covered with blood-the back part of his head had an incised wound, penetrating to the bone, laying it bare—on the forehead was another wound an inch and a quarter long, merely dividing the skin—they were incised wounds—a clean cut done with a knife, I should say—they both bled—the one on the back of the head, considerably—they must have been made with a sharp instrument—the falling on the curb could not have done it.</p>

I was standing at the door of the house about ten o'clock, and saw the prisoners and two girls—they were kicking up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—Parocco struck one of the girls—she screamed—I laughed at Parocco—he immediately came up and struck me with his fist—I told him to go away, 1 could not understand his language—he drew off a bit, then drew a knife from the waistband of his trowsers, and rushed towards me—I put up my arm to keep him off, but with the force of his coming, he gave me a cut on the knuckle, and slightly fractured my thumb—if I had not put up my hand I should have got it in my chest—he struck at me with his arm extended, and I parrie off the blow, so he cut my knuckle—he was running towards me at the time with a knife, when I thrust my hand out, and cut my knuckle—he ran away—I heard a hallooing as I ran after him—I looked, and saw Monsco having hold of Smith—they had moved on a bit.</p>

On the 8th of June I was at my master's shop all day—I left at half-past nine o'clock—I went behind the window to have my tea, about half-past five o'clock, and left nobody outside the shop—I came back about half-past six, and was</p>

Previous to May, 1844, I had no knowledge of the existence of the prisoner, or of any sister of hers—in May, 1844, I re<lb/>ceived this letter—before that I had received a note, which I destroyed—it was to the effect that a report prejudicial to myself existed in the neighbour<lb/>hood, and if I would call upon the prisoner she would explain it to me—I simply replied, declining to call, and requesting she would state it in writing—I did not keep a copy of my letter.—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—</p>

Miss F. has now sufficient to last her till next Wednesday, and must then turn out into the street, as she will no longer have a house to cover her, and her unfortunate sister, who has been the innocent cause.

               <p>"Rev.

I intended to have been at your church on Sunday morning, but my sister was too ill to come to the service, so we went down after you had left; my present object in writing to you is to appeal to you as a Christian: can you possibly see us starve, and you give us neither advice, comfort or pecuniary relief?—it is the very last thing I would do if I was not obliged. I made some sacrifices to leave Brighton and return to town, as my sister has been suffering for some time with a very severe pain in her back; and I have written to Mr. Bowling, of Hammersmith, whom I expect to see to-day, but will not mention our unfor<lb/>tunate circumstances, as I would rather hear from you. I ask you now, will you lend me some pecuniary aid, and advise me what course I had better adopt for the time to come? I suppose it useless for me to ask for a seat in your church, as of course you would refuse, and also I do not wish to be seen in that neighbourhood, situated worse than heretofore. If you would see me I should be much obliged; I would meet you anywhere, and explain anything we may have done to offend you, as perhaps your mind has been prejudiced against us, and 1 know we have no friends.

We are strangers I find here for the present. I write this principally to inform you, that if you do not make us compensation, I will leave what to yourself, I must write to Archdeacon Sinclair, to lay the matter before the Bishop of Lon<lb/>don, as I am well provided with witnesses, and shall give the whole history of myself and sister during the last five years; and that to-morrow, Friday, Jan. 23rd, at one o'clock, I shall carry a letter to the residence of the Archdeacon, if I do not hear before that hour from you, offering to make some amicable arrangement, and that also some terms settled before Saturday, one o'clock, be offered to me for approval, as we cannot wait any longer, as we are driven to this by distress. I would much rather make terms of peace with you, as I do not write from any vindictive motive, and would agree to any terms to keep us from absolute want, as we have always studied your interest in preference to our own, as our present circumstances testify, but we cannot remain as we are any longer. My sister is much better than she has been, but is now a living skeleton, not being able to obtain that which would make her better, and is with myself exceedingly anxious not to do you any injury; but necessity has no law, and we cannot continue longer, it is impossible. I shall prepare my letter to Archdeacon Sinclair this evening, (not really expect<lb/>ing an answer from you,) as this is the eleventh letter, and three months since the first; and as sure as I expect protection from an all-seeing God, I shall carry it myself if I am spared till to-morrow, one o'clock.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> After that letter this one was sent to me by the Bishop of London—it is in the prisoner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)</p>
               <p>" My Lord,—I appeal to your lordship on behalf of myself aid sister, who have been brought to the greatest distress, in consequence of my sister having been slandered by the lady of the Rev. W. Niven, incumbent of St. Saviour's, Upper Chelsea, in whose church myself and sister have occupied sittings since Christmas, 1840; and, during that period, we resided at Brompton, and were, by profession, morning governesses. Mrs. Niven stated to various persons that my sister was enceinte by the Rev. W. Niven, and employed persons to watch the house we resided in; and, if we walked in the streets, set persons (chiefly her own relations) to follow us, and insult us; in fact, so much so, that we had been unable to leave our own apartment, except in a carriage, for more than a twelvemonth before we left Brompton, which we did last October. Last June my sister applied to an attorney we had known for some years, to commence an action against Mr. Niven, which he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150123"/>
               <p>did, and after keeping us in expectation of obtaining some satisfaction for several months, refused to proceed; in fact, I have no hesitation in saying, Mr. Niven bribed the lawyer, to prevent any proceeding. I have since written a great many letters to Mr. Niven, and appealed to him as a Christian minister to compensate us, as we are friendless orphans, but can get no answer. My sister's medical attendant, Mr. Bowling, of Hammersmith, has also written to him, and received an answer from Mr. Niven's solicitor, which, with other letters, I wish to lay before your lordship. We are now residing at Kensington, and I wrote last Friday week to Archdeacon Sinclair; but, receiving no answer, I wrote again on Monday last, but have not received an answer. My object in writing to Archdeacon Sinclair was, for him to lay the matter before your lordship; but, as I cannot get an answer, I suppose it is in consequence of Mr. Niven being acquainted with Archdeacon Sin<lb/>clair. We are suffering the greatest privations. Our clothes have been sent to the pawnbrokers; we are in debt, without any means of paying, and must be turned into the street, for we have no home—no friends who will even give us a night's lodging; and, unless we can obtain compensation from Mr. Niven for the injury Mrs. Niven has done us, there is nothing left us but a poor-house, as our characters have been destroyed, our connections lost, so that we could not earn anything unless our characters are restored, and some pecuniary relief afforded us. I beg leave to apologize for troubling your lordship, but I do it in hopes your lordship can compel Mr. Niven, who is wealthy, to compensate us, and that immediately, for the serious injuries we have sustained. We are fully prepared to prove the statement, and have no objection to appear before your lordship, with evidence, and that in Mr. Niven's presence; and, I can assure your lordship, that the circumstances are understated, both as regards slander; annoyance, and our present poverty. My sister has been seriously ill, and property we have had left us; has been spent in endeavouring to regain our professions, and also our characters, but without success, as the slander has been most industriously propagated.

               <p>" Dear Sir,—I again appeal to you, as I wish to know on what grounds we are situated to each other; if I had a friend who would speak to you upon this subject, or one whom I could trust, I would not out step the bounds of prudence, as I am about to do. I ask you calmly and dispassionately what were your intentions towards my sister five years ago, and <hi rend="italic">what are they now.</hi> I have always believed you were greatly attached to my sister, and your unfortunate position has been always looked upon by us as a great calamity, and one which we hoped would soon terminate; and 1 supposed, when it did terminate, you intended to marry my sister, who is sincerely attached to you, as you must be aware of; in fact, she has always stated to me, that from the first she would remain single for life unless she married you, and, I believe, such is her present determination, and from that cause we are reduced to our present painful situation—as I have encouraged that idea; if we have been deceived in our opinions, and you have no affection for my sister, perhaps you would have the kindness to make us acquainted with the fact as early as possible, as our present circumstances can then be exposed, or perhaps you would, through some kind friend of yours, afford some little pecuniary assistance, to save us from utter destruction; and, if you have intentions towards my sister, you will prevent any exposure of our pre<lb/>sent</p>

               <p>position, for your own sake as well as ours. Our present distress is more than you can think, or possibly be aware of; and oh! for the sake of two friendless beings, do something for us. We are willing to act under your advice, be it what it may. We have been here a fortnight. I took the apart<lb/>ments for one month, hoping and trusting that something would be done to relieve our present wretchedness in that time, and we are getting credit with the trades people of this neighbourhood, for we are not found anything here, and we have no money, no clothes, not a change of linen, and the enclosed notice was served here yesterday, though how we were found I do not know; and oh, for mercy's sake, do not let our little all be sacrificed for the sura named, although our clothes ami work-box and writing-desk, &amp;c., will not make the sum to sell; they are worth much more to us, and I sent for some clothes from the Pantechnicon about five weeks ago, and I paid her part with what I obtained upon them. In fact, our clothes are pawned for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; our books are at the Pantechnicon, where I cannot obtain them unless I pay two guineas, as they have been there near six months, and the remaining part are at Kensington, all dirty; and nothing but linen, and not another dresi besides the one we wear, and we cannot make ourselves decent any longer in this house. Apply to some person we must; but I hope you will not be so cruel as utterly to abandon us to such a fate, as we are willing; in fact, we have lost everything we possess, including our peace of mind for life, in serving you as we thought; and I am sure, both myself and sister, would make any sacrifice for you, but do in pity to our distress send me you advice, and whether you have any affection for my sister; and, if so, do not let us be disgraced for life in this way, and we would make you any promises, not to molest you in any way; and whatever course you wish us to adopt, it shall be done, as we have nobody to apply to but yourself, under whose ministry we have been so long, and under whom we have profited so much. I implore an answer, or, if not to me, perhaps Mr. Combe would do something in it; but I would rather receive advice from you, and, whatever you advise, shall be done.

About the 18th of March, after the date of the two last letters, the two young ladies called at my house—I requested them to leave—they declined—in consequence of that I took them before a Magistrate—they were held to bail for assaulting me, having previously at<lb/>tempted to assault my solicitor with a poker—I was not present; I only know it on his word—they came and claimed some compensation from me—I suppose it was to make me give them some money on the spot—the prisoner made a rush at my dining-room door, to push herself in; and since they have been held to bail they have molested me in the most extraordinary manner—I have bad nothing but annoyance from them ever since—I have received a writ from them since, and they have sent solicitor after solicitor, but they have not come or written to me at all, in any way, or personally annoyed me from that hour—there have been two writs served, one in December last, and the other was served upon my soli<lb/>citor for me; I cannot speak positively, but think it was about a week before I gave the prisoner into custody—I know that it has been served—the first time I knew it was at the police-court that day—I did not proceed upon these letters before, for I assure you, as a Clergyman, it is the greatest trial I ever met with to proceed against any human being—I have known Miss Richard<lb/>son, I think, between nine and ten years, as near as I can recollect—I do not think she ever was one of my congregation—my wife did not know her before she was married to me, nor subsequently, until I introduced her one day in the street, soon after the first letter was written—that was the only time they spoke, till they met in the police-office—I have not heard, since I received these letters, of there being any other reports from any other party—I did not offer, about six months ago, to abandon all proceedings if Miss Fountains would deny all the reports in circulation—I never instructed my sotaeitor to that effect—nor was such offer ever made to me if Mrs. Niven would give a denial to the reports—there was never any offer made me—an action was commenced in Dec., and abandoned, and another commenced a short time before the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Austin-street, Blackheath. On the 24th of May, about ten o'clock in the evening, or soon after, I was at New Cross—the prisoner came up to me and asked me whether I was going to Greenwich—I said, "Yes"—he said he was going there—on the way he said he ought to be in barracks by ten o'clock, but as he was over time and had a relation in Greenwich, he should sleep there—when we got to New-cross I was turn<lb/>ing down into Deptford—he pulled me out of the path, and said, "That is not your road to Greenwich"—he pressed me against a wall and took my watch, which was in my left-hand waistcoat pocket—he tore the pocket out altogether, took the watch, and ran away down a turning—I kept him in sight till we came to the bottom of the lane, where there is an elbow, and there I lost sight of him—I have seen the watch since—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not go into any public-house with him.</p>

On the 30th of May, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was walking along Church-street, Greenwich, and saw the prisoner with his back against a post, and two women near him—he ran up against me, and knocked me down—I got up and asked him what he did that for—he said he was a Spaniard, and would stab me—I saw a knife in his hand—it seemed a large one, with a large blade—he took an aim at my head—I put up my left arm and warded the blow off as well as I could, and it just grazea my face—when he found he could not do as he wished with the knife he struck me in the mouth, and I fell to the ground, I called for assistance, and Rees and the policeman came—my face bled very much—I saw him throw the knife away.</p>

I am not in partnership with her—the prisoner was in her employ, and had, access to the drawers—on the 4th of June I found a bunch of keys were left in the key-hole of the drawer in the back part of the shop where the prisoner worked—they ought not to have been there—I opened the drawers, and found some colours—I then put them back locked the drawers, and put the keys into my desk—I waited fcr the prisoner coming from his dinner at two o'clock—I then took the keys out of my desk, went to the prisoner, and said, "Philip, are these your keys?"—he said, "Yes they are"—I said, "Just open the drawer"—he did so—I took the colours, laid them before him, and asked him whose they were—he said, "They are mine"—I asked who gave them to him—he made no reply—my brother brought the colour drawer, which they are usually kept in, to. the back part of the shop to compare them with those in the prisoner's drawer—I found them exactly to correspond—I found a piece which exactly fits the fracture—that was one piece of chrome yellow—it fitted where it had been broken off—here is the piece that was broken off—after a little time I said, "Philip, I do not like these things—it is these petty things I cannot bear—I have missed several things out of the shop—it appears to me that it is something like you have done it"—he said, "Well Sir, if you think that, I had better look up my tools and go—we had a good deal of conversation about this and other matters—I then went to the front of the shop where my brother stood, and after that I went outside the shop, and the prisoner came to me and said he was very sorry for what he had done, and hoped I would overlook it, and allow him to remain—I told him if he would promise me to make amends for it I would overlook it, and he remained in my mother's service.</p>

On Sunday morning, near one o'clock, I was called into the prisoner's house, to see a little boy—I examined him, and found a severe contused wound on the right temple—the right eye was very much bloodshot—this instrument would produce such a wound—the child is now recovered—I did not see the prisoner at that time—I saw him on his way to the police-station—I asked him how he came to do such a foolish thing—he said he wished the poor boy was dead—he spoke affectionately of the child—he was in a very excited state, as a roan in liquor would be, and repeated similar words—his mind appeared to be in a very unsettled state—he appeared to know what he had done, but I can scarcely say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, and live in Ann-street, Coburg-road. I was at the Hop Pole at eleven o'clock in the evening, on the 29th of May—the two prisoners came in with the prosecutor—he was rather the worse for liquor—they bad two or three pots of ale—Seele sat on the left side of him, and Crawley opposite, on the other side of the table—the prosecutor had a parcel of butter tied up in a handkerchief, in a basket—I saw Crawley take it oat of the basket while he was asleep, and put it into his own basket—I saw Seele's hand in the prosecutor's left-hand breeches' pocket once or twice—his frock was up and her hand underneath—I went and spoke to Mr. Walker out in the skittle-ground, and when I came in again I saw Seele put her hand into the prosecutor's pocket again—Walker came in in consequence of what I told him, and he sat down—I then changed my seat—I came before the prisoners—I kept a look out—in consequence of that Crawley got up—he called me a piper and a noser, and said if I wanted anything I could take it out of him—he had not known me before—I went and spoke to the landlord, and when Crawley went to the bar the lundlprd spoke to him, but I did not hear what it was—I went into the tap-room with the landlord—we awoke the prosecutor, and asked him if he had lost anything—he said, "No"—we told him to feel, and he said he had lost his money, bag and all—he said he had bad 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I and two others went out, and saw the two prisoners, and stopped them till the policeman came—I asked Crawley what he had done with the butter, and he hove it out of his basket into the street—while the prisoners were in the public-house I saw Crawley make signs to Seele, and I saw she nodded her head.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at Bermondaey—on Tuesday, the 16th of June, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I saw the prisoner at the back of Mr. Pope's house, he had nothing with him—I saw him next day, and watched him; as soon as he saw me he ran away—I pursued and brought him back—I said I took him for Mr. Pope's coat—he said if he bad had a mind to be a thief he could have taken plenty of boots and shoes—I heard him say he pledged the coat—he did not say how he came by it.</p>

I took the prisoner—he said at first he had not been near the house, but said afterwards he had been to the house, knocked at the door and found Mrs. Pope was not at home—he wanted her to recommend him to a job to weed a garden—when I saw Mr. Pope he said, "Tell me where the coat is, I have been a good friend to you, and am a poor man that cannot afford to lose it"—the prisoner said, "I have pawned it, you bate been a good friend to me, do not hurt me"—he said he had pawned it at Mr. Griss's shop.</p>
