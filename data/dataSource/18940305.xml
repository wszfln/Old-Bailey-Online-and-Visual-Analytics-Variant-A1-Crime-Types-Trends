                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 88, Cirencester Street, Harrow Road—on the night my husband assaulted me I had been drinking, but I was a bit sober when he came home—I can't exactly remember what night it was; I think it was in the middle of last month, on a Thursday, I think—his tea was not ready, and he said I had been drinking—I said I had not—he said, "Don't irritate me"—I flew at him in a temper, and he deliberately took up my legs and threw me down on the floor, on the landing of the top floor—our room is the top back room of the fourth floor—I said, "Wait till I get up"—I got up; he went out, as I thought into the next room to get a hammer or Something, as when we are in a temper and have had drink we don't know what we do; I should hit him with the hammer as he would hit me—I was on the landing; the window is rather low, and as he pushed me and I went out at the back landing window—that window is very low from the floor on the inside—I am not sure that I said before the Magistrate, "He lifted me up and threw me through the landing window. I was in a temper at the time, he pushed me through the window"—I think that is a mistake—this is my deposition—I signed it—I did say that before the Magistate—I was never in such a place before—I don't know how much drink I had had on this day—my husband had never threatened me before this—when in drink he might say a word, but not when sober—after I got through the window I fell on to the cistern, the lid gave way, and I got into it, and I got out myself—my landlady, Mrs. Porter, and a man came across the road—Mrs. Porter did not see me in the cistern, I was leaning on a plank, and she opened the landing window and helped me to get out, and got a bit of rag and tied round my finger—I was not much hurt, only my finger was bleeding—the surgeon dressed it at the station—I told the Magistrate that the</p>

               <p>prisoner had frequently threatened to swing for me, and to throw me out of the window.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have said that this was an accident—I do not suggest that he deliberately threw me out of the window; the cut on my finger was done by the glass in trying to save myself—he was under the influence of drink or he would not have done it; I might have slipped—we' have been married eighteen years—when in drink we are both rather violent—I thought he went to fetch the hammer; if he had hit me with it I should have hit him back—I have said that it was a pure accident, through my having drink; but I leave it to you, gentlemen—in my temper I told the policeman to take him—we always lived happy and comfortable when he was a teetotaler, there could not be a better husband; I don't want to go on with the case.</p>

I am a cellarman, and live at 14, Senior Street, directly opposite the prisoner—on the evening of February 15th I heard a very loud smash, as if of glass—I went out on my leads and saw that the top landing window was smashed completely through, and the woman in the cistern—I went across and helped her out—Mrs. Porter went up with me—she was lying in a helpless state, half in and half out, and bleeding—she said, "My husband has thrown me through the window"—I did not see the prisoner—the cistern is about twelve feet from the window—the window was completely smashed out—I saw nothing about the woman to warrant me in saying she was intoxicated—she was very excited—I tied up her hand—the distance from the cistern to the ground was about twenty to twenty-two feet—at the bottom the ground is concrete.</p>

On the evening of the 15th February I was called to 88, Cirencester Street—I found Hawes holding the prisoner by the hand—he was binding it up—it was bleeding very much—from what I was told I went and saw the prisoner—he was up<lb/>stairs, about seven steps from the window—the prosecutrix requested me to take the prisoner into custody for wilfully throwing her through the window—he replied, "Yes, and I wish she had stopped there, the b—" he was sober—I should say the prosecutrix appeared to have been drinking, but at the station she seemed to have recovered from it—the window inside the landing is about two feet from the floor, and about twelve feet from the cistern.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was there with the inspector when he examined it—the woodwork was broken away—the cover of the cistern was broken in—the prosecutrix is a big, heavy woman—all the houses in the street are not kept in good repair—there are rotten cistern covers—I have known the prosecutrix nearly twenty years—I have never seen her drunk or the worse for drink.</p>

I am a waiter—I have known the prisoner for some time—in December last his wife was keeping a beer-house in Cambridge Heath Road—I was in the habit of going there from time to time as a customer—I have seen the prisoner there—I have seen him quarrel with his wife several times, and I tried to stop it; I interfered, rather, on behalf of the wife—on 8th December I was there, when she and the prisoner were there, and I was assaulted by the prisoner and four more men with quart pots, and I was sent to the hospital, and was there four weeks from the injury—it was the prisoner that struck me with the pot; they all set on me—he never said anything; the first intimation I had was being set upon—towards the end of December I was in the Gun and Tent public-house—I was assaulted there by a number of men—the prisoner was one of them—he had a large stick; I got it out of his hand</p>

               <p>—the police came, and he ran away—I was struck twice by the prisoner, and next day I complained to the Magistrate at the Thames Police-court—on 27th February, about half-past eleven, I was in the tap-room of the Lord Nelson—I was sitting watching them playing cards, and the prisoner jumped into the room and seized me, saying, "I have got you now," and with that I saw a flash and felt a stinging sensation in the jaw—I shut my eyes, and did not feel it take much effect on me at the time—I ran after him, and the prisoner, too—the bullet went through my jaw into my neck, and it has not come out—it is supposed to be embedded in the muscle of the neck—I should not think the pistol was more than four or five inches away from my flesh when he fired.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no situation at present—my last place was in Palatine Road, Stoke Newington—all last summer, until August, I lived at the place with my wife and two children—I did not know the prisoner then—I have known him since about October—I met him in the house that his wife kept, the British Crown, a small beer-house in Cambridge Heath Road—she held the license—I don't know what he did—I was not a regular customer there—I called in occasionally, sometimes two or three days running—I never took the wife out on Sundays, or talked familiarly to her over the bar—when she served me, I said "Thank you"—I was not attacked by the prisoner in October—the first attack was in December—I can't assign any reason for it, only that he had quarreled with his wife and I interfered between them—he was knocking her about in the house with his fist, and threw pots at her—she screamed out "Murder!" and other people did as I did, did the best to stop it—I did nothing to him, only kept him away from his wife—he calmed down then, and was quiet—I don't know where she was hit—he did not hit me on that occasion—I interfered because I did not like to see man and wife row—it was quite serious enough for any man of common-sense to interfere—the house was about two minutes' walk from where I was living—I work at the docks occasionally, or anywhere—it was on the 22nd December that he attacked me—I was walking in, and he made a hit at me with a big stick—I don't know whether his wife is still keeping a public-house—I saw her not long ago outside the Court—on 22nd February I was in the house about three hours—the prisoner sprang through the door, put up his hand, and I saw the flash of the pistol—I ran after him—I did not knock him down or kick him—I saw his wife just now outside—I never took her out for a walk.</p>

               <p>with his wife, and saw them both on the first floor—I said, "I am a police officer.

"Where?"—he said, "At Wynam's"—I said, "What is the name of the foreman?"—he asked his wife to leave the room, and then he said, "I was in a whore-shop; I do not want my wife to know"—I said, "I shall take you in custody"—he said, "I will make somebody pay for this, I had two winners; I gave my wife 5s."—he was taken to the station, and said, "I can prove my innocence"—I found only did. not him, but I did not look in his hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 37, Walbrook—I have been in practice since 1878—I have known the prisoner six or eight years—I have acted as his solicitor in several actions, and have received several sums of money for him—I conducted a case for him in June, in the Mayor's Court—he was managing the <hi rend="italic">Stock Exchange Times</hi>, and acting as an advertising agent, and I knew he must have been making £8 or</p>

               <p>£10 a week out of his agency—I thought he was in a fairly decent position; he has had up and downs—he has a large family living at Tavistock Terrace, Westbourne Park—the prosecutor called on me last September, and stopped in my office five or ten minutes—he did not show me an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, and I am pretty certain I did not know that the prisoner had advertised for a clerk with £50 security—the prosecutor said he thought of putting £50 into Emanuel's business, or was going to give him £50, and asked me if I considered him straightforward and honest—I said, "Yes," I had known him some years—he asked me about putting £50 into the business—I said, "Is it all the money you have got because if it is don't put it in, because it is only a speculation "—he did not mention the <hi rend="italic">Stock Exchange Time</hi>, but I have seen copies of it—he asked me what was Mr. Emuanel's position—I said, "I know some little time ago he was making £10 a week; he had a very good connection among brokers for advertising"—he said he had got a good deal more than that, and he did not mind going in for gambling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I had no idea that he only came there about an advertisement for a clerk—I believe I said before the Magistrate that he brought the advertisement, and showed it to me, but, on looking at the advertisement, I found that I had not seen it before—I defended the prisoner at the Police-court, but I was not there on the first occasion—the advertisement was handed up to the Court, and I looked at it—I understood that the money was to be paid to Emanuel to go into a partnership in the paper, or to put it down as security for his honesty, and I said, "Any money you give Emanuel he is sure to use in his business"—I told him it would not be put absolutely on a deposit account.</p>

When the prosecutor came to me I understood him to ask was Mr. Emanuel honest, and was he making any money—he said he was going to advance it, or give it to Emanuel—he did not tell me in what capacity, and I did not ask him, because I did not think he would do it—I did not approve of it—if people want a guarantee, they ought to go to the Guarantee Society.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know now that there is a County Court judgment out against him; I did not know it then—Rutherford said that he did not mind going in for a gamble—I did not use those words before the Magistrate, but the impression on my mind is that he said "gamble" or "speculation"—I have not a very clear remembrance—no one can remember Clearly what took place six months before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of Edinboro' Chambers, 9, Dorset Street, a common lodging-house—about 10.50 on Sunday, 18th February, I saw the prosecutor and a woman standing outside the Bluecoat Boy public-house, directly opposite to me—they were both drunk—they went to move, and both fell down in the gutter—the prosecutor struck the side of his head against the kerb as he fell—some men picked the woman up and put her on a doorstep, and they picked up the prosecutor—I called a friend to come and look at the scene, which is very often seen in that neighbourhood; there are plenty of drunken men there—the prosecutor was bleeding at the time—he reeled round, and stood against a wall for about ten minutes, and then came and asked me to let him have a bed—I knew him, as he had lodged with me on several occasions—I said, "No, you had better go to the hospital and have your head dressed; I cannot let you have a bed; you are saturated with blood"—he said, "Am I?"—I said, "Yes, I cannot let you have a bed"—he sat down on a form in the kitchen for about ten minutes, and then my watch<lb/>man led him out, and he left about 11.15—about twelve or 12.10 Dine and Smith, who lodged at my lodging-house, were larking in the kitchen, and I came to Dine and got hold of him, and said, "If you don't leave off larking I will put you outside," and I shoved him outside the door—Holland, who was outside the door, seized him, and said, "I think you are one of them"—and with that he used the boy something terrible for about ten minutes, hit him, and kicked him all over the road; he was all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189403050031"/>
               <p>over blood—he hit the boy about the face with his fist, and then he got hold of him by the back of his neck, <hi rend="italic">jobbing</hi> his head down, and lifting up his knee, so that his face was brought into violent contact with his knee, as his head was bent down, several times—the boy was saturated in blood from his nose; I mean, that his face was quite covered with blood from his nose—this continued for quite two or three minutes—I looked on—I kept on saying to the constable, "Now leave off; he has had enough"—Newman, a friend of mine, was looking on too, and I could have brought thirty witnesses who saw the assault, but no one else besides Newman is here—Holland kept loosing his hold, and the boy kept on saying, "I have done nothing"—if he had wanted to run away he had plenty of time—when the boy stood still, then Holland laid hold of him Again—I know Holland well—on Monday evening the prosecutor came to me, and I said, "How did the boys get on?"—I did not go to the Police-court to tell the Magistrate of this assault, because Monday is a busy day—Newman did not go to the Police-court, nor did any of the people who saw it—I never tried to persuade any of them to go—I thought the boys had done nothing, and would be discharged—I was shocked at seeing the way in which the boy was ill-used—when I asked the prosecutor on the Monday how the boys got on he said, "The little fools would not speak for themselves, or else they would have got off; I don't recollect anything myself"—I said, "No, certainly, you were too drank"—I never heard anything on the night of the assault and robbery—I first heard on the Sunday night from the constable (Holland) of the robbery—he said, "I think you are one of them who have been robbing and assaulting the man"—he did not say who the man was who was robbed, but I went out to look, and I saw the prosecutor standing up the street—I did not see him robbed—I never learnt from anyone on the Sunday night who it was who was robbed—I saw the prosecutor about twenty to twenty-five yards off, alone; he was too drunk to tell me—I saw the prosecutor on the Sunday night when he was going to the Police-station with the constables, after the boy was in custody—I did not then inquire whether he was the person who had been robbed; I guessed it was him because he was going with the con<lb/>stables—I did not go to the station and tell the inspector what I knew, because if I took notice of all I saw I should have enough to do—as I turned Dine out of the door Holland seized him—that was later than 11.10: it was 11.10 when the prosecutor fell.</p>

Massingham came into my house about three minutes after Holland had arrested Dine—he came in with Holland, and they went into the yard with Dine, and found Smith in the w.c. and took him to the station—I did not ask them what they were coming into my place for—I heard Dine say to the constable "The other one is in the yard"—Smith had done nothing that I know of—he had been in my house all the time—I did not see him to turn him out—I did not know he was in the yard—I said nothing about it to the policeman; I did not ask what other one it was—I had not the curiosity to ask what they were taking him for—I did not go to the station, nor to the Magistrate, and I never gave evidence about this till to-day—I put Dine outside about 12.10, but how long they had been larking or quiet in there I don't know.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Minerva Street, Hackney Road, and am a photographer—on February 18th I arrived at 9, Dorset Street, on a visit to my friend about eight p.m.—about five minutes to eleven Mr. Arundel said, "Look outside"—I did so, and saw the prosecutor and a woman lying drunk in the gutter—I walked over and helped to raise the prosecutor—I saw he had a large wound on the left side of his head, and was bleeding—I said, "Can you stand?"—he said, "I am all right"—directly I let go of him he reeled for about three yards, and then stood against a wall—I went inside, leaving him there—about a quarter-past eleven he came into my friend's house and asked him for a bed—Arundel said, "Do you know your head is cut?"—he said, "No"—Arundel Advised him to go to the hospital—he said, "I cannot let you have a bed in that state "—the prosecutor went away—that was a minute or two after 11.15—I did not see him again that night—at 12.15, I should say, there was a noise in the kitchen—Arundel went there to see what it was—I looked through the office door and saw him turning a lad out—I do not recognise that lad—in about or less than a minute I heard that lad screaming outside—I opened the door and looked outside, and stood on the doorstep, and there I saw Holland holding the boy by the left hand And thumping him with his right fist as hard as he could on the head—I should say he gave him atleast two dozen blows as hard as he could, and as he hit him at each blow he rose his right knee and hit him like that—he so arranged as to strike the boy in the face with his knee—that went on for one or two minutes, I should say—then he let him go—Holland was calling the boy all the foul and beastly names as I ever heard from a man's mouth in my life—he used filthy, disgusting, and profane language, the worst I ever heard—I never heard anything like it—the constable seized the boy again—just then Massingham came up—I had not seen him there before—the constables went through the lodging-house into the yard, taking Dine with them—they fetched another boy out—they did not treat him in the same way—they passed right through the kitchen, and went to the station—I did not notice if anyone accompanied them to the station—I said nothing to anyone—I did not ask the constable what he was ill-treating the boy for—I was ten or twelve feet from them—I ought to have interfered—I did not; I only looked on—no other persons than I and Arundel were in the office—I</p>

               <p>was on the doorstep of the office—I did not notice anyone in the street looking on—it was rather late in the evening—I am clear about it—with the exception of me, Arundel, the boy, and the policeman, I did not notice Anyone outside—if there had been anyone else there, I must have seen them, I should say—if there had been a crowd of persons looking on, you could have seen them plain—I did not go to the station—I next heard of this transaction when I read it in the paper—I did not know the boy's name—the next evening I went to Arundel's house and inquired, and he told me the boys were round that way on the Sunday evening, and that the prosecutor was in the vicinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not say which of the boys it was I saw turned out—he immediately began to scream, and I looked out and saw him in the constable's hands—the prosecutor was beastly drunk when I picked him up; he was helplessly drunk—I did not speak to him—I said "Can you stand?"—he said, "I am all right"—I don't know that he understood what was said to him in the kitchen afterwards—Arundel asked him if his head was cut, and he said, "No, my head is not cut"—I have not talked the matter over with Arundel—I go to see him three or four times a week, I daresay—I talked the matter over with him last Monday, and at other times—I talked it over with him on the evening after it happened, when I went to hear how the boys got on—I did not go to the Police-station, nor to the Police-court—I did not hear Arundel say anything to the constable—I cannot say which boy it was I saw knocked about, it was so dark—I should say it was that small one (<hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi>) by the look of his face from the violence—I do not know now that it was Dine who was turned out of the kitchen—I did not ask what the constable was taking him for—it was rumoured they were going to take the boy for robbing the man—that was the talk after the constables had gone—I could not say they had done nothing of the kind—I am here to prove that the prosecutor inflicted that wound himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer in the employ of the District Railway Company—on 20th February, just before six, I was at the Mansion House Station—I saw the prisoners on the platform acting suspiciously, and watched them—when a Whitechapel train came in they walked up and down, looking into various compartments; they entered one in which were several women, the prosecutrix being one—I followed them—Goldman sat down next to the prosecutrix, and on her right-hand side—Dorset sat next to Goldman on his right—Dorset put his left hand and Arm behind Goldman, leaning slightly towards him—I kept observation, And saw a movement by the prosecutrix's dress pocket, on the right-hand Said of her dress—the prosecutrix's hands were in her lap—she was holding a bag—the movement in the pocket continued to about Mark Lane Station—when the train pulled up there the prisoners got out—I at once made a communication to the prosecutrix, and in consequence of what she told me, I got up, but I could not get out of the train, as it was moving out too quickly—at the next station, Aldgate, I and the prosecutrix got out, and went back to Mark Lane—I looked there and at other stations, but could not see the prisoners—the following Friday, 23rd, I saw the prisoners alight from a Whitechapel train at the Mansion House Station about 5.30 p.m.—they walked down the train towards the engine, and then back again, looking into various, compartments—they entered a compart<lb/>ment in which were several women—I got into the next compartment—at Cannon Street, the next station, I got out, and entered the compart<lb/>ment they were in—when the train reached Mark Lane I alighted—I caught hold of the prisoners, and said I should take them into custody for stealing a purse from a person on Tuesday night—they said nothing—they were removed from the train—they were taken to the station inspector's room, where Goldman asked me what the charge was—I repeated it to him—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—a City</p>

               <p>constable was called in, and the prisoners were taken to the Police-station—on the way Dorset made a violent attempt to escape from custody—in answer to the charge, they said, "We don't know anything about it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Victoria is my chief station, but I frequent all the stations—the performance at Constantinople is over about 5.30, and if the prisoners had caught a train at that time they would be at the Man<lb/>sion House by about six; they would have to change there for a train to Whitechapel—there were three women, including the prosecutrix, in the compartment; one next to her and one on the opposite side—I sat exactly opposite to Goldman, and almost in the middle of the seat—Mrs. Powell sat almost in the centre—there were eight or nine persons in the compartment—I did not watch the other two women; they were in the compartment before I got in—I know it was the pocket that I saw the movement at, because when I spoke to Mrs. Powell she put her hand to the same spot—it moved about half a foot; it was very noticeable—it was extremely apparent what he was doing—I have had eight years' experience as a detective—the prisoners had not been drinking—as they came to each station they said, "Let me see, two more stations, the next is ours"—Mrs. Powell was in a very deep study, and was not paying attention to anyone; I should think it was very easy to take her purse—Goldman had a cigarette on the platform, which he threw away when he got into the compartment—they had passed a smoking carriage—Gold<lb/>man's hands were on his knees, and one of Dorset's hands was on his knees, and they played their hands about very cleverly; I had to look twice to make sure there were not four hands there—on the Friday they got into the same train they had got out of after looking into various com<lb/>partments—they were arrested in the train, and when they were searched they had no tickets.</p>

I am the wife of Richard Powell—I live at Trafalgar Square, Stepney—on Tuesday, 20th February, I was on the underground railway—Austen got into the same carriage, and sat opposite to me—two lads came and sat by my side, but I did not look at their faces—they had just passed me to leave the train when Austen asked me if I had lost any<lb/>thing—I put my hand in my pocket and said "No," and I then pulled out my purse and glasses and handkerchief, and I found my purse had been emptied and put back—I opened it and showed it to Austen—I had last looked into my purse when I went into Charing Cross Station and took out my return half ticket—there was then 10s. in silver and 1d. or 1 1/2 d.—I put the purse back into my pocket—my pocket was on my right side, on which the lads were sitting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Ravenscroft, Hills and Woodward, of 15, John Street, Bedford Row—we have acted as solicitors for the first mortgage of 101, West End Lane, Hampstead, and also for the mortgage of Nos. 105 and 109—the first mortgage of No. 101 was sold—the sale was complete on February 10th, 1893, and realised enough to leave in their hands a balance of £132 10s. 5d.—up to that time we had no notice of any second or third mortgage being created—notice ought to have been sent to us; any solicitors who had been consulted about a second mortgage would send notice to the first mortgagees—on March 18th I received this undated letter from 49, Baker Road Plaistow, signed p.p. J. Daniels, W. L. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he field a second and third mortgage on the property, and inquired whether Messrs. Ravens-croft had any surplus funds to meet his claims for interest</hi>)—I answered that on March 20th. (<hi rend="italic">This requested full particulars of the mortgage, and Hated that No.</hi> 101 <hi rend="italic">was sold, and there was a balance in hand</hi>)—I next received a letter dated March 25th. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed p.p. J. Daniels, and requested to know why they had sold No.</hi> 101 <hi rend="italic">without foreclosing, and requesting to know the amount obtained for it, and offering to produce the mortgage deed</hi>)—on March 27th I replied. (<hi rend="italic">This letter requested to see the securities, and offered to make an appointment for the following Thursday</hi>) the second letter I received from Daniels was dated from Baker Street, and the first from Baker Row—I had had no answer—I then wrote, "We want a copy of a letter which was returned from the Dead Letter Office," etc.—that is a fact; it was returned—in answer to that I got this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 44, <hi rend="italic">Grange Road, Balaam Street, Plaistow, April</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1893, <hi rend="italic">and stating that he had omitted to give the postal authorities his change of address—Signed J.

(<hi rend="italic">From Daniels, dated April 13th, regretting that he was unable to keep the appointment, but would call next day, Friday, at noon</hi>)—he did not keep that appointment, nor was any deed produced, and on 18th April I wrote this letter to Daniels. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that a copy of the deed sent had not been called for, and giving him formal notice to produce the original deed in the course of the week</hi>)—I dictated to my shorthand clerk, a summary of what had taken place—between April 13th and 18th this deed was brought to the office, but not handed to me personally—it purports to be an attested copy of an alleged mortgage by Beach to James Daniels, on August 19th, 1891, and is certified to be correct by Paget, a law stationer, pro. John Douglas, his clerk—the certificate is dated April 17th, 1893—I perused it, and then wrote the letter of 18th April—no deed was produced by Daniels at that time—on 18th April I communicated with the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy, and so got into communication</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MARSHALL</hi>. I do not remember any occasion where we have not received notice of a second mortgage—if a man has a second mortgage it is to his interest to let the first mortgagee know—I should expect a solicitor to serve notice of a second mortgage on me, but not if he is not familiar with mortgage deeds—the letter of March 18th was from 49, Baker Street—I naturally directed my reply to Baker Street, and it came back—my letter of April 4th reached him though directed to 49, Baker Street—that was a registered letter—the letter of March 7th was not returned by the Dead Letter Office, but my letter of March 27th was—I got the attested copy on the 17th, and I saw the original deed, of which it is a copy, on May 11th—I dictated to my clerk: "27th April, long attendance of Messrs. Marshall on their calling; they did not produce their client's original security, although we pressed for it"—I asked them to produce it, they did not do so, and I told them my suspicions had been aroused, and I did not think it was a genuine deed—Mr. Marshall said he thought it was perfectly genuine—I said, "Well, why don't you produce it?"—I do not remember his answer—a client of mine had advanced £700 on No. 101; G. M. Hill and George Love were the trustees—I should not advance more than what I considered one-third of the value—I do not know that the rent was £70 a year—it is a freehold house—the quarter's rent was £17 10s.—it was sold for £900 to George Seymour, the tenant, and then there was the mortgage—I think there was an advertisement of the sale. (<hi rend="italic">Reading the items of expenses, insurance premiums, interest, fees, and commission for collecting rent, leaving a balance of</hi> £132 15s.)—No. 105 appears to be let to a yearly tenant at £65, and No. 109 to Dr. Mill under a repairing lease for seven years.</p>

               <p>solicitors, 4, Fenchurch Street—they were solicitors to William Beach, a bankrupt—about April 18th, 1893, I had a communication from the Official Receiver, and at the end of April or the beginning of May a cor<lb/>respondence was entered into which I have sent for—on May 11th I accom<lb/>panied Mr. Paget, a law stationer of Chancery Lane, to Messrs. Marshall and Marshall's—a deed of August 19th, 1891, was produced—we both examined it—that was the first time any original deed had been produced to the trustee after the service of motion to set the deed aside—the motion came on before Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams alone, who said that h wished a jury to hear it, and it was adjourned to November, and heard before a jury, and the deed was set aside and ordered to be impounded—my firm continued to act as solicitors for the trustees—my attention was called to the draft, and to the attested copy and the deed itself—I have compared them with each other—the attested copy and the deed are identical, with three or four exceptions—the word "situate" in one is "situated" in the other, and one has Beacks Road or Blacks Road; it is difficult to say which it is—so far as the attestation clause is concerned the name of James Daniels is omitted; one has "Whereas by an indenture," and the other has, "By another indenture."</p>

Mr. Paget told us that he had engrossed the deed, and on April 26th, when this letter was written, my principals and myself believed that the deed had been engrossed by Mr. Paget; but afterwards Mr. Paget said that that was not the deed which he engrossed—we had never seen the second, and I do not believe it was in existence at that time—we say in our letter, "We could mention many other facts"—we did not mention them; we thought it best not, because the notice of motion had been served—in consequence of receiving a letter on the morning of May 11th I went down to inspect the docu<lb/>ment—in our letter of April 26th we mention Mr. Paget's name for the first time; we could not mention it before—I have a letter of 18th November, 1893, to us stating that they had heard that our client con<lb/>templated taking proceedings against Daniels—the taking of proceedings was left to the Treasury solicitor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law stationer, of Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane—on 8th March, 1893, William Beach, who I knew, brought me a mortgage from Beach to Daniels, and a sheet of demy paper with a 10s. stamp impressed on it, and gave me instructions to engross it—it was an old stamp of 1891—I had the engrossing done on the sheet of paper, on which I noticed the stationer's name, Bedford, Chancery Lane—Beach called for it the same day, and took it away, and the draft—there were blanks in it for the titles and the amount—the names of the parties, Beach and Daniels, were in—Beach brought the engrossment back a few days afterwards to have the blanks, which he had inserted in pencil, filled in in ink, and two or three days afterwards, on April 17th, he brought it back to have an attested copy made—it was signed by Daniels, and wit<lb/>nessed by Henry Hand, solicitor—I made the attested copy produced, and handed it to Mr. Beal, and the deed—I have never seen the deed since—on May 11th I went to Messrs. Marshall's office to inspect a deed, and there saw the document "C," which is certainly the document I wrote—this one bears a stamp of July 18th, 1891, but the engrossment is in the writing of one of my clerks—there is no stationer's name on this one—I have known the prisoner Hand as a solicitor for five or six years—I have seen Beach half a dozen times in four or five years—I never saw Beach and Hand together till I saw them at the trial before Justice Williams—I do not think I said at the Police-court that I had seen them together; it was knowing Mr. Hand that made me take such particular notice of the deed—about a week afterwards, Messrs. Cave's clerk, the solicitors to the trustees, called on me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I remember that there was a stamp on the deed at that time—I am sure it was 1891, and that I noticed the name of Bedford—Douglas engrossed it, and he and I certified it—there was no attestation clause to this deed, so we should simply put, "Signed, sealed, and delivered by the above named," and there we should stop—a person might put an attestation clause leaving out the names, and they would not be filled in in the draft.</p>

On January 28th, about four o'clock, I went to Seaborne Park, and found Daniels—I had had a warrant about three weeks for his apprehension, which I read to him—he aid, "It is a nice thing; I have been swindled out of £400, and am</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On the afternoon of January 15th I arrested Hand outside a public-house in Chancery Lane—I said, "I am a police officer, and hold a warrant for your arrest"—he said, "Yes, I did attest that deed, but I did not know it was a forged one"—on the way to the station he said, "If I had known there was a warrant against me I would have surrendered"—he took this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his pocket with the name of Hird on it, and said, "You see, I did know there was a warrant against me"—I do not know who the writer of the card, John Calverly, is—the warrant was applied for on January 11th.

I live at East Ham—I formerly lived at 360, Bark<lb/>ing Road—I am a pawnbroker's manager—I have known Daniels sixteen years, ten years intimately—he was a stevedore—he lived next door to me for live years—I always found him a very abstemious man, and a very good character—he got up very early in the morning and went to bed early—I have seen a safe in his bedroom; I remember his buying it—i remained there till he left—he lent me from time to time sums of money to carry on my employer's pawnbroking business, Mr. Hammoth—the loans begun in July, 1889, with £23—this book shows altogether £1, 500 down to December, 1891—one page is advances and the other repayments—</p>

               <p>this is only a rough book—the last payment was £25 on December 8th, 1891—I think all the entries are down here, but it is not a stock book—I paid him nothing for the accommodation, but if he bought anything of me I used to let him have it at cost price—the advances made in 1889 were eight sums of £20 each and two of £10—the repayments are on the other side—the last is December 21st—he lent me altogether £1,500, and it is in process of repayment—the last repayment was on July 27th—I have not put down the years—I might say independent of lump sums I have had as much as £50 at a time and paid him back £2 a week—I went to his house in October, 1889, between seven and eight p.m., and saw a quantity of gold on the table—I should say there was £600 or £700—he was counting it when I went in—he left Barking Road in 1889, and I remained and did not see so much of him, because I used to send instead of going myself—I remember his showing me a document towards Christmas, 1892, but I cannot say what it was—he asked me if I thought it was all right—I said I did not think it was—I had not seen many deeds, but I thought it ought to be on parchment, and this was only on paper—I did not read it; I gave it back to him—I have written a great many letters for Daniels, but none in connection with this matter—I never wrote to Beach—the letters I wrote were in connection with his business as a stevedore—he produced the document in my employer's shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was out of friendship to Daniels that I lent him £1,500, but I sold him furniture—I do not know much about his business—he kept it very much to himself—I lived next door to him four or five years—I never heard him mention Beach—I do not remember ever writ<lb/>ing a letter to Beach for him; I may have—anything that was not about his business as a stevedore would impress itself on me as something unusual—he knew I was a pawnbroker's manager; my principal, Mr. Hammoth, died in 1889, and the widow carried it on—I left last June—I was not present at the trial before Mr. Justice Williams—I have heard that on that trial Clark described me as managing clerk to a shipping firm—I was not clerk to a shipping firm—I saw him last year—I have never seen him at my present address, but I met him casually—I told him I had left Barking Road—he knew my address, and could have found me in an hour—I have heard his evidence read, in which he says he did not know where to find me—he never, after 1892, showed me any document, and asked me to compare it with another document, nor did I ever do so—I never saw a second document—I never sent any document enclosed in a letter to Mr. Beach, after having examined it—I have no doubt, having heard his evidence read at Bow Street, that he said all these things at the trial—I offered myself as bail for him, but the other bail was not forthcoming—when I heard the evidence read I refused to be bail for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a student of dental surgery, living at 21, New Cavendish Street—Hill came to me in August last, and asked me to cash this crossed cheque for £2 10s., drawn by Durham, and dated 19th August, for him—I had not the money in my pocket; I drew this open cheque on my own account, and gave it to him, as against this cheque on Durham's account—my cheque was paid at the bank—Hill was going to cash it, and he took this cheque of Durham to pay into my account at the same time—it came back marked "Refer to</p>

               <p>drawer"—it has never been paid—I saw Hill afterwards, and had some conversation with him, and after that I met Durham at the Castle Public-house—I told him I wanted a suit of clothes, and he said he would make them for me; he is a tailor—Hill said in Durham's presence about the cheque that Durham would see it was all right, and then Durham said he would see it was all right—I have not seen or had any communication with Durham since—he had paid no part of the £2 10s.—at the time I parted with my cheque I believed his cheque would be met on being paid into my bank, and it was on that understanding that I gave my cheque to Hill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was quite willing to give Durham an order for the clothes—I did not think then he was a fraudulent person, who should stand in the dock—I thought it would turn out all right—I put the matter into my solicitor's hands, and asked him whether he could do any<lb/>thing—I told the Magistrate I had no wish to prosecute—later on I knew that Hill was negotiating some property for Durham, and that Durham had to pay him commission—I did not know it at the time—I had known Hill about a year, I should think—I did not know at the time whether Durham's cheque was a good one—I called on Durham afterwards about the clothes, but Durham was out—I believe Hill got my cheque on 22nd August—he said nothing about holding it over—since then Hill has said he would see me all right—I did not think it worth the trouble—I did not prosecute for a long time; but I took a different view when I heard there were so many more cheques knocking about—I may have heard of New<lb/>man's, Sibley's, or Twitcher's—I know Sibley and Newman by going to their houses—we all went into the prosecution together; we arranged it between ourselves—I did not hear about any other cheques till many months afterwards—I was in the habit of going into Newman's house between August 22nd and Christmas—he did not know who I was, and I did not know he had anything to do with the matter—I came forward about the time that Newman took out a summons; I cannot remember the dates—I saw Newman's solicitor; he did not call on me—Newman asked me to go up with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to F. A. Wells and Co., corn and coal merchants, 20, High Street, Marylebone—on 15th September Hill came and ordered one ton of coals, and gave me in payment this cheque for £10, drawn by Durham in favour of Hill, and endorsed by him—I demurred to take the cheque, as I did not know Durham—Hill repre<lb/>sented Durham was in a good position as a master tailor in Margaret Street, and that the cheque was for work he had done for him, and I agreed to give him £5, and the balance after the cheque had passed through my bank—I took £1 8s. for the coals, and gave him £3 12s.—I paid the cheque in four days afterwards; before it came back from my bank I saw Hill, and he asked me if the cheque was all right—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189403050047"/>
               <p>I said, "I suppose so"—it was long enough for me to have heard, and I had not heard—I gave him £5, the balance—after that the cheque came back marked <hi rend="largeCaps">"N. S."</hi>—an hour or two after that I found Hill in Bland<lb/>ford Street, at the office of Baker, a builder, where he was employed—he said he had not got the money—I said, "It is very strange; you have not had it very long. You had tatter give me back the money, or get it back from Durham. I must have it"—he said he had paid the money over to Durham, and he must see Durham—I afterwards went to Durham, and told him I was very much surprised the cheque had come back, and that he had better give me an open cheque, so that I could go to the bank and draw the money—he said that would be no use at present; there was no money there—that would be about 19th September—I saw Hill after<lb/>wards, and he and Durham agreed to meet me at 20, High Street on the next morning; they met me there—they could not raise the money between them, but they said if they went down to the City they thought they could get it, and they went away and never turned up afterwards—I have never had any part of the £10 from Durham—Hill has repaid me £3 10s.—I have lost the coals and £5 2s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Hill told me the first time he came that Durham had paid this for commission—I delivered the coals to Hill—Durham told me he had not received the money—Hill said he had paid it to him—I knew nothing of Durham—I have never seen Mrs. Durham—there is a little brass plate on the door about a millinery business—he has a little tailor's shop, which is sometimes open and sometimes shut—it is in Margaret Street, Regent Street—I paid in the cheque the next day or so; and I paid it in a second time by Durham's orders, and the second time it was dishonoured—I do not know that he paid in £10 to meet it—I was not anxious to prosecute in the first place—I wanted the money—Hill promised on 10th November to pay £1 a fortnight—he did not keep his promise—I had no knowledge of the other cheques at that time—I should not have prosecuted if he had paid the money, no doubt—at first my only object was to get the money—Hill said that although the money was paid, the mortgage was not carried through—I heard several versions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Hill said in the first place he received the cheque of commission for getting the transfer of a mortgage on a house Durham owned in Thayre Street—afterwards Durham said the mortgage had fallen through for some reason, and he said he sometimes had large cheques from people abroad, which were paid into the bank directly, and did not come into his hands, and he thought the cheque would be met in that way—he did not mention the names of the persons abroad—I cannot recall anything more that was said about the mortgages—he said he was expecting a large cheque from Scotland; that was from the man who was going to take up the mortgage—I was led to prosecute by finding other people had had cheques and been done in the same way—I then deter<lb/>mined to join with them in prosecuting.</p>

I am a licensed victualler, at 37, Thayre Street—about 21st October my wife gave me this cheque for £2 4s., which went into my bank, and came back marked "Refer to drawer"—I then made inquiries and saw Hill—he asked me to keep the cheque for a week, and pay it in again—I did so—it came back again, "Refer to drawer"—I saw Hill about the second presentation—he said he would see Durham about it—I had seen Durham before that, but did not know him by name, and did not know he was the Durham to whom the cheque belonged—I saw Durham about ten days afterwards, about the beginning of November, and asked him about the cheque, and he said it was an old cheque—I asked him what the date of the cheque was—he said, "On the 21st I gave Hill a new cheque"—I said, "I have got the new one"—he said he could not make the matter right; I must see Hill, for whom I changed the cheque—I saw Hill again, and he said he would see Durham again—I saw Durham after that, and he said the same again, "I must see Hill"—I did not see Hill or Durham after that; I put the, matter into my solicitor's hands, Mr. Freke Palmer—I heard certain matters, and then determined to prosecute—I know Sibley and Twitcher.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Durham several times after the transaction—I ordered a pair of trousers from him—I have not paid for them; the price was 23s.—I had not had this cheque when I ordered the trousers; they were delivered on November 11th, but I gave the order for them about 13th October; he had a certain cloth to match, and it took him a fortnight or three weeks—during that time he brought the cloth for my approval—I might have had conversation with him then; that was all arranged before the cheque was dishonoured—I took my house on the 5th, and Durham came in as a regular customer—he gave me his card, and I knew he was a tailor in Margaret Street, and so I ordered the trousers of him—I did not know that he was the man who signed the cheque; he had my order for the trousers before I took the cheque—there is more than one E.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Hanover Square branch of the London and County Bank—this is the certificate of incorporation—Durham had an account there, which was closed about 17th January, 1893—Mrs. E. Durham has kept an account there since about 11th January, 1893—this is her pass-book—he had the right to operate on the account as well as his wife—every cheque written by Mrs. or Mr. Durham, the signature being E. Durham, was cashed if there was suffi<lb/>cient money at the bank—one of the regular books of the bank is the Returns book, in which are entered cheques presented and returned marked "N.S.," or "Refer to drawer"—I made this copy from that book of cheques drawn on Mrs. Durham's account—I have verified it—I find that forty<lb/>one cheques drawn on that account between 30th June, 1893, and Decem<lb/>ber 30th, 1893, were dishonoured, there not being sufficient at the time of the presentation of each of them to meet them, with the exception of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189403050049"/>
               <p>one cheque returned post dated and not paid—the forty-one cheques repre<lb/>sent about £165 altogether—on and after 3rd October there was eight shillings to the account in the bank, and twenty-three cheques amounting to £120 3s. 6d. were drawn on the account since October 3rd—the last amount paid in was on September 29th—sixteen of the forty-one cheques were drawn in favour of Hill and dishonoured, and about nine in favour of Dickens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the same cheque were paid in half a dozen times it would appear as six separate cheques—when a cheque is presented a second time it is equivalent to a new cheque—the forty-one cheques really mean forty-one presentations—Mrs. Durham paid in £10 on 29th September—of the forty-one cheques eight were presented twice, representing about £27 or £28; none three times; so that the number of cheques between the same dates was thirty-three, of about the value of £130—sometimes a customer takes up a dishonoured cheque privately without its going into the bank again—if any of these had been taken up privately our record would exist as if they were outstanding debts—it is not usual for a person to draw twenty-six cheques on an account when he has only eight shillings standing to his credit—I don't think Durham at any time had the right to overdraw this account—on June 7th his account was. £5 7s. overdrawn—he had no sanction for that, to my knowledge—I am a ledger keeper, and all ledger keepers are aware of accounts that may be overdrawn—the account was not closed till December 29th or 30th, because there were £2 or £3 at the end of September—I do not know that we called his attention to the fact that cheques were being written, and sent when he had no assets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I find no entry in the account of any large remittance from anybody abroad during the last six months of the year—we simply had cash amounts varying from £1 15s. to £10, with the exception of one amount of £53 paid in by Mrs. Durham, when she opened the account on January 11th—his account was closed in January, because he was an undischarged bankrupt.</p>

I wrote to Durham telling him so. Pending the matter being carried out, he (Durham) asked me to cash him one of his cheques, which I did at Sibley's, cornchandler High Street, for £10. It was returned, 'Refer to drawer.' I spoke to Durham about it. He gave me another cheque, I think about £2 10s., which I cashed, and paid to Mr. Sibley on account of the £16. I have since paid him £1 more. On 21st October I went to Mr. Newman, Thayre Street, and obtained a bottle of brandy."</p>

You have got the wrong man. You ought to have had the other man. He was the right one. I did not know there was anything wrong about them, though, till he told me you were following us. I met him by appointment at the Red Lion this morning, and he asked me to carry them for him. I suppose I am let in for it, and I must drop into it"—the handkerchiefs were shown to the prosecutor, and he identified them—other handkerchiefs have since been found pledged which the prosecutor has identified—the prisoner was taken to the Kentish Town Police-station and charged—I found 39s. in silver and 4 1/2 d., a knife, and a Waterbury watch on him—he made no reply to the charge.</p>

I am a solicitor, and acted for Mr. Anderson in relation to a deed of indemnity—he gave me instructions prepare it—it was arranged that a loan was to be made to him by the Eagle Insurance Company—Mr. Anderson and Mr. Paxton were to guarantee the loan, and the prisoner and his two brothers were to indemnify him—on June 14th the prisoner called on me, and asked me to prepare the deed at once, as his brother John was coming to town from Edinburgh, and he hoped to get payment from the insurance company the next day—in consequence of that I had the deed drawn and engrossed, and posted it to the prisoner on the 14th—there were no signatures to it then—he came again on the 15th, and it then had his signature and the other two—the signature "Stephen Ralli" purports to be done in the presence of a witness at White's Club, St. James's, and the signature "John Ralli" in the presence of H. Munro, 5, Wilton Place, S. W., and the prisoner's signature in the presence of J. Besson, 5, Pelham Place, South Kensington—the signature "H. Munro" appears to be in a different writing to the others—when he brought it he said he had got the deed executed, that he met his brother John at King's Cross, and they breakfasted together, and he got his signature at the station—he left the deed with me, and on June 18th the money was paid to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother, and am in the Army—the signa<lb/>ture, "John Ralli," on this deed is not mine—I do not recollect whether I was at 5, Wilton Place on the morning of June 15th, 1892; that is my brother's address—I cannot say whether I came up from Scotland on the night of June 14th, 1892; I came up several times—I know no person named H. Munro; my brother may have had some<lb/>body staying with him—I do not recollect his telling me so—I first knew of the existence of this deed about May, 1893, when I saw it at the office of Messrs. Ashurst, Morris, Crisp and Co.—at that time I was a bankrupt in Scotland—the sequestration of my affairs had taken</p>

               <p>place in September, 1892—in May, 1893, a claim had been made, I believe, upon my estate under this deed—I was in London, and went to Messrs. Ashurst's office to inspect the deed—I was afterwards examined in I bankruptcy, on oath, in reference to it, and said, "A deed of indemnity, I dated June 18th, 1892, purporting to be signed by myself and my brother, I was not mentioned in my statement of affairs, because I had no recollec<lb/>tion of it; the signature is not mine; I did not authorise my signature to be appended to that deed," or words like that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In the bankruptcy I was being examined as a witness—questions were asked me, and I answered them—a question was asked me by some person representing the creditors, whether I agreed to become security for my brother—it was objected to by the trustee, and I was not allowed to answer it—I was not seen by Mr. Anderson before I gave evidence at the Police-court—no statement was taken from me by a solicitor—I said at the Police-court, "I was always on the very closest terms with my brother"—I was on the terms of closest friendship—my brother Stephen and the prisoner and I have always been most affect<lb/>tionate brothers—that has always been known and always will be—I also" said, "I was always prepared, as far as I could, to assist my brother; I never refused to sign any document for him"—that is absolutely true—and, "I have, in fact, frequently signed documents for him. I have given him authority to use my name. I had such confidence in him that I would have signed this deed or any document he asked me to sign "—I knew he was in financial difficulties, which he hoped to tide over—I was in Scotland during 1892—I came to town several times to see my brother, and to sign documents for him—there was a little difficulty sometimes as to getting home, and I incurred some expense in doing it—I spoke to my brother about it, and told him I would trust him with regard to any question of raising money—at that time the question of his having the use of my signature for raising money was discussed—I asked him I some arrangement could not be come to to save me the trouble and expense of coming up to town—he might have made me liable to the last penny if it had been useful to him—I had signed several bills on which money was realised—I had no knowledge at that time what my share of the reversion was—I knew Mr. Paxton well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The authority I gave my brother was without any limit—he was better acquainted with the condition of my affairs than I was "myself—I gave him leave to use my name just before this transaction——just before I became bankrupt my liabilities were about.£18,000; it might be more and it might be less—I was quite indifferent, and my brother too—I think I was in a position to indemnify anybody against a liability of £3,500—my assets were practically nil.</p>

Anderson and Paxton, which is in process; it is not admitted yet—I was present at the examination of John Ralli—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) contains a correct record of the questions, and of his answers—I am able to say nothing but what appears in this journal—the liabilities under the bankruptcy are £23,414 14s.—the assets of the reversionary interest are £5,380—there are also two horses, harness, and jewellery, valued at £120—the liabilities, all but about £100, were incurred on behalf of his brother—he has not benefited by it himself—in Scotland no examination is allowed as to the claim of any creditor, or as to knocking off of any claim—the value of a reversion is always an uncertain matter—a trustee in Scotland does not allow what we call deliverances till he is declaring a dividend.</p>

I keep the Pilgrim Public-house, at 47, Upper Kennington Lane—it is a fully-licensed house—I am also book-keeper in a merchant's office in the City, and have been so for twenty-eight years—on Sunday afternoon, 21st January, between one and two, Home came in—I have known him twenty-five years—I heard him openly, in the saloon</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Denmark Terrace, Brighton—I am a member of the Stock Exchange—Mrs. Ashby is my aunt; she is seventy-four years of age, and a widow with no children—I have known her all my life—in 1879 she was in a lunatic asylum, Woodend House, Hayes, Dr. Selworth's—she was afterwards transferred to Bishops Town House, Bedford; afterwards to Apsley House at Ealing, under Dr. McWinney—she left that place about April 13th, 1883—she was then practically well—she was discharged "Relieved"—a house was taken for her, and in 1885 the house, 25, Sunnyside Road, Ealing, was taken, when the old servant left, and the prisoner was engaged, so that she should be well looked after—I took the house in my name to save her all trouble—she was my mother's sister—she got tired of living with the old servant, who had a husband and child, and it was inconvenient to have these people in her house—the old servant died a month ago—Mrs. Ashby engaged the prisoner in 1885, and I was annoyed at her taking a girl of about fifteen—she had an allowance at Dr. McWinney's, and her relations, the com<lb/>mittee, agreed through me to let her have £150 a year—I paid her rent and sent her £5 a month, and also any taxes, clothes, or other extras that she wanted—the rent was £34 a year, afterwards £32—the money was generally sent by hand by the old servant, who had been in my service for the last fifty years—she was my old housekeeper—if I was at Brighton I sent it by post—latterly the maid acknowledged it by postcard—I cannot tell for how long she acknowledged it, but for more than a year—whatever money I was asked for I always sent—she was eccentric, and had delusions—she believed she suffered from stoppage of the bowels within the last year—these are two of the letters with which I have sent money.

               <p>—these were old delusions which I can remember she had as a child, and that was her condition when I last saw her—these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in her writing—she used to write to the servant—I went to see the place After the police got in—the place seemed to have been made a dust-bin so far as every kind of rubbish goes—she was removed on 19th January—I was ill then—these are photographs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) showing the condition of he rooms—at Christmas, 1892, I pressed her very hard to go back under medical care—I said, "It is very dull and miserable for you here. I don't think you can be happy," and I begged her to go—she was in a con<lb/>dition to consent, but she said, "Oh, no; nothing could induce me to part with Alice"—I had a cold, and did not notice the smell at the time I went—I went ten days afterwards—there was nothing about my aunt to make it impossible for one person to look after her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She engaged the prisoner of her own account, and always showed an affection for her—I believe the prisoner was sixteen, but I remonstrated against engaging one so young—I considered my aunt capable of looking after money matters, and in many things she was per<lb/>fectly sane—since this case I have heard she did not care about being washed.</p>

Will you go into your own room?"several times repeated, and "If you don't go into your own room I'll do it"—that was said in angry tones, and I heard it through the wall, so that I thought it was time to interfere, as I knew the old lady was by herself—I opened the door, and looked for a policeman—of course I could not find one, so I leaned over my porch and knocked at the door as loud as I could—the prisoner opened the door immediately—I said, "What is the meaning of all this row?"—she said, "There is no row"—I said, "Don't tell me that, I have heard every ward you said; you are quarrelling"—she said, "We are not quarrelling"—I told her I would go and inform the police—I had seen a woman go in on a Saturday a few weeks running, but not lately—I think that was in the summer—she did not look like a char<lb/>woman, but a person visiting the prisoner—that was the only person I have seen go into the house—I have seen persons ask admission, and not get in—as a rule the door was not opened, but when it was opened the prisoner said Mrs. Ashby was ill in bed, and could not see anybody—one lady came to me and asked if I knew anything.</p>

               <p>and all the blinds at the back of the house were drawn down—we went away for about five minutes, and returned with Inspector Newman, and decided to break into the house—we knocked, and received no reply—we made a pretence of breaking in, and in a few moments the back door opened, and the prisoner ran out—she was trembling, and hardly able to stand from agitation—I said, "Where is Mrs. Ashby?"—she said, "She is ill, you cannot see her"—I said, "We are determined to see her, and we shall see her"—we were in uniform—I went into the scullery, and there and in the kitchen found an accumulation of filth and decomposed food, things running with maggots, excrement about the floors, no water in the house, and quart milk cans full of decomposed milk—the stench was awful, and I became sick, and had to go into the open air—we went back again, and were compelled to smoke; we thought it was not safe to go in without—in the back parlour or dining-room there was an accumulation of leach, eggs, decomposed milk in cans looking like cotton wool, there was fungus on it; more eggs in bags, tied at the corners; in the fireplace there was a heap of ashes and a fire burning—we went upstairs, and on the landing there was a filthy mattress—the stench was worse there than downstairs—the w.c. upstairs was stopped, and there was no water in the house; the pipes had burst and had not been repaired—the bath had been used as a cesspool; there was excrement in it and a broken chamber—the rooms were in total darkness—I said to the prisoner, "Where is Mrs. Ashby?"—she pointed to the first floor back room, and said, "In there"—we went in, but were unable to remain, the stench was too awful—in a few minutes we went in again—the blinds were down—I said, "Where is the old lady?"—the prisoner said, "Lying there"—I pulled the blinds up, and saw Mrs. Ashby lying on a mattress on a bedstead near the door—she had a chemise on, and was covered by a thin, torn, dirty sheet, with blood on it, and part of a torn blanket over her feet—her age is seventy-four—there was no fire—close to the bed and immediately under her nose was a night-stool full of liquid excrement and urine—I said to her, "Do you know me?"—I found she was partially blind—she said, "Are you Dr. Hogg?"—I said "No; have you any complaint to make against your servant?"—she hesitated, and seemed very childish, and said, "No, no"—I said, "Has your servant at any time assaulted you?"—she said "No"—I noticed her emaciated condi<lb/>tion, and we left the room—did not tell her we were police officers; I thought it might upset her—I said to the prisoner, "Have you any cook<lb/>ing utensils in the place?"—she said, "Yes," and from the filth in the kitchen she produced one sauce pan, and said, "I sometimes cook in that"—she said she received money from Mr. Driver, of Brighton, to look after the old lady, but that none of the family had been near her since Novem<lb/>ber last—I called in Dr. Patten, the medical officer, the same morning—he came, and in the prisoner presence Mrs. Ashby said that in the bitter weather she had no fire in the room—the doctor mentioned the bitter weather; the prisoner said nothing—I examined the grate, and there certainly had been no fire for months—we then communicated with the relieving officer—I found the bundle of notes in the sideboard drawer in the dining-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Avenue Road, Kennington—in 1889 for six months I kept one of the bars at the Temperance Mission Hall, which, was open four days a week—I had a share in the profits of 2d. in the shilling—I suppose my average share of profit was about 4s. a week for my time and trouble, but I speak from memory; I had no books—I had the lower bar; not so much was done at the upstairs bar as I did—I had an offer to take the two bars on paying £20 a year for them—from my experience of what could be done I was not prepared to pay as much as that for them.</p>

This is the copy of Mr. Reichardt's account from 1863 to 1873—I find there no credit entry of the receipt of money from Germany, and no sum of £75 as coming from abroad, and no money at all from abroad—I do not find the name of Porson on the credit side of the account from beginning to end—we should call the account a small one—the principal source from which the credit side was made up is an entry of £75 within a few days of every quarter day, from the London Jewish Society—there are entries of what would appear to be interest on shares and stock, the London General Steam Navigation Company, and so on—after his death Mrs. Reichardt kept an account there, and this is the copy of the account from 1873 to 1887, which I described—I find no entry to the credit of the account of money coming from abroad, or foreign drafts or anything of the kind—I do not find the name of Porson on the credit side—there is no payment out of either Mr. or Mrs. Reichardt's account of the sum of £75 in one sum, or two in favour of anybody named Zierenberg—the name of Zierenberg does not appear in the account.</p>

Trim on 20th April, 1893, of the Stourbank Brick and Tile Co., Royal Mint Street, and 7, Kerfield Crescent, Grove Lane, Camberwell—I asked Bennett what Trim's financial position was, what he was, and whether he was good for the amount, and he said he was the manager of the Brick and Tile Co., and there was not the slightest doubt he was in a perfectly good financial position—I believed that, and parted with two cases of champagne on that understanding, in answer to a letter of 10th May from F. Trim—the first order he gave was not executed because we were short of pints—I never was paid for the two cases supplied—at the end of three months, when the amount was due, Bennett had left my service—I applied for it by letter, but did not receive any answer; then I sent my head clerk, ho found the man had gone—Bennett got orders to the amount of £658,</p>

How do you bring Garland into it?"—I said, "He had to make inquiries about your position financially, and so on"—he said, "Well, he knows me very well; but is there anything else?"—I said, "Yes; obtaining champagne from Duval's, in Mark Lane, in May and June last, to the value of £10 17s."—he said, "If they prove that, it is only a debt. Is there anything else?"—I said, "Yes; I have reason to believe there are several other charges"—he said, "All right, pile it on; I daresay I shall pull through it some day"—on the 12th or 13th I arrested Bennett—Arnot was then in custody on another charge—I showed Arnot document "K", and said "Soluman" was the name another witness, Fox, had given evidence about, and it was his writing—he looked at it, and said it was his, and that would not be denied—that document also had on it "7, Ker<lb/>field Crescent," Trim's address, and there was no such person as Soluman living there; but the witness Fox said he saw him at that time.</p>

To put it straight, I think if you would like to see me do well you must, who took me off the straight path, put me on it again. You cannot do less than pay a third-class passage to Philadelphia, where I can start a fresh life; otherwise it behaves me to use every means in my power to stop you from doing well.

                  </hi> I keep the Prince of Wales Public-house in Batter<lb/>sea Park Road—early in July, 1892, being in want of a barman, I advertised, and in consequence of this Ballard called upon me—he referred to Mr. Cooksey as to his character, and I went and saw Cooksey—he was landlord of the Collingwood Arms, Battersea—I asked him if he could recommend Ballard—he gave him an excellent character, he could trust him with untold gold, he said—he said, "He has been with me eighteen months, and is a first-class barman. I could leave my house in his charge"—Ballard was there at the time, working in the bar—he told me that he had been locked up for theft previously—he did not say when, or what for, but he was going to be decent for the future—I did not ask him any<lb/>thing about it—I said I was going to Folkestone, and would have to leave the house in charge of Ballard—he said, "You can trust him, and I will look into the house myself"—I believed his statement, and engaged Ballard—I afterwards went to Folkestone with my wife, leaving the house in Ballard's charge—before going there I received a telegram from Cooksey on Friday before the Bank holiday, and on the Saturday I went and saw Cooksey at the Collingwood Arms—he said he had had a man watching Ballard ever since he had been at my place, and that the man thought he saw him put a sixpence in his waistcoat pocket, but was not quite certain—I thanked him for the interest he took, and left, and com<lb/>municated</p>

I live at 24, Brook Road, Stoke Newington—in April, 1893, I kept the Foresters' Arms, South Road, Kensal New Town—just before that Cross was in my service as barman for about two months—I advertised for a new barman, and on or about 3rd April Ballard called on me, bringing with him this letter from Cooksey. (<hi rend="italic">This recommended Ballard as a good barman, sober, well used to a rough trade, and just the man for it</hi>)—Cross gave me notice and left; before he left I took stock and found it was about £40 short—I could not account of that deficiency in any way—Ballard said he had been employed by Cooksey two or three months—I engaged him before I saw Cooksey, on the strength of this letter, and Ballard's representations—Ballard did not tell me he had previously been at Mr. Rushen's—two or three days after I engaged Ballard I went and saw Cooksey, and asked him about Ballard's character, especially if he was honest—he said "Yes"—he entered my service on 3rd April; on 10th May I discharged him—I told him that I saw him on the Sunday before put a coin in his pocket, either a half-crown or a six<lb/>pence, I could not be sure which—he denied it—I told him I would not give him a character—I took stock immediately after I discharged him and found £27 short—the stock was taken every twenty-eight days—I had another barman, who stopped with me for ten months afterwards—I was perfectly satisfied with him.</p>

What have you got belonging to me?"—he said, "Nothing"—I pushed Cross down, and took the gin out of his pocket—I kept the gin—he had the money in his pocket—I asked Heywood, in the presence of Cross, what he meant by giving my goods away—Heywood said he had taken the money for it—I asked him how much he had taken—he said "Tenpence"—I said, "It comes to a shilling," and I asked him how he was paid—he said, "By coppers"—I said, "That could not have been;</p>
