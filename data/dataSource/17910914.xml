               <p>(The witnesses examined apart.)</p>
               <p>The case was opened by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship: Gentlemen of the Jury; you have collected already, from the indictment which has been read, that the crime imputed to the prisoner at the bar is that of the wilful murder of his wife: on the present occasion, very different feelings must be excited than what obtained on the last trial; for if the evidence be true in support of the present charge, it will exhibit to you a scene as shocking as ever attended the commission of the crime of murder: the circumstances are extremely short, and must necessarily be so, since the crime was committed when he, the prisoner at the bar, and his wife were alone in an apartment; however, we are able to lay before you some of those circumstances, as well from the examination of the woman taken before a magistrate, as from what she herself said to others on her death-bed: it appears that the prisoner at the bar and the woman deceased, his wife, were married, I think, in the year 1790, early in that year; they did not live together long, having lived most unhappily indeed from the commencement of their marriage: at the end of six months they parted; but soon after their separation the prisoner at the bar solicited her, over and over again, to return to him; she resisted all those applications, till very lately, before the day when this fatal circumstance took place, she was, in consequence of a visit of his, persuaded to go to his house; he lived in a place called <placeName id="t17910914-1-crimeloc5">Strutton-Ground</placeName>

             the attention of the neighbours; several people came round; and it will be proved, that he was seen in such a situation, so using the knife; and the immediate, the inevitable impression on your minds must be, that at that time he was in the perpetration of this murder; at first some women were afraid to go in, but other people came; then the man, alarmed from his savage purpose, he indeed had left off either stabbing or striking her; the woman had got from the floor, and had got, somehow or other, this knife in her hand, rushing out of the parlour, and saying that was the knife he had cut her with: one of the witnesses will tell you that she was driven to every sort of resort that a mind at such a time could enable her to lay hold off; she called out, Dear George, dear George, do not kill me! however, he went on in the completion of this purpose: when he was apprehended, the poor woman was sitting by him; she was taken for medical application, and conducted to the Westminster infirmary; the poor woman lived until the 28th; the medical assistance that she met with indeed turned out so successful, as to all the wounds that had been given by the knife, that several of those wounds were actually healed within that time; and the surgeons hardly attribute the cause of her death to any of those wounds, but to the violent contusion in consequence of the bruises on one of her breasts, which will be more properly described by them, having a sort of connection with the lobe of the lungs, was the cause of her death. Having stated the outline of the evidence, and which will be supplied by testimony that will leave no doubt on your minds, that your attention will be especially called to the particular circumstances of this case; Gentlemen, the crime of murder, in our law, must always have that constituent part, namely, a malice aforethought, and that malice must be either expressed, or implied from the circumstances of the case: whenever any human being comes to death by the hand of another, that homicide must always be accounted for by the person accused but, gentlemen, it sometimes happens, and the law indeed, always attentive to the nature of our being, admits, that circumstances may be of a kind to raise a sudden natural gust of passion where there has been no predetermined malice, nothing before harboured in the mind, and under the impulse of that passion a person even inflicting death on another, that by possibility may only amount to the crime of manslaughter; but, gentlemen, in the present case, under the circumstances I am instructed to state to you, that it appears to me the present case will preclude the prisoner at the bar from all such considerations; but if there should appear any cause, which I at present cannot think can appear; but if there should appear a possibility for his accounting for this horrid transaction, by any thing that can furnish the least degree of excuse, you will hear that excuse with wonderful satisfaction, because it will be for the honour of human nature: if there be any thing on the part of this woman, any thing on the part of this woman's behaviour, any thing that could induce a natural provocation, and that sudden gust of passion not originating from any preconceived malice in his mind, not originating from any circumstance, you will readily attend to it; on the contrary, if the behaviour at the time appears to be such as could not be called for by any provocation that the poor woman could have manifested, and therefore indicates a savage and brutal mind, there can be no doubt but that will come up to the crime of murder: Gentlemen, in common cases, between man and man, for indeed the distinction frequently occurs so as to be obvious, Judges always direct juries accordingly; where a blow has been given, as from man to man, that may easily, naturally, properly (I may almost say), occasion a gust of passion, that may amount to manslaughter; but, as between man and wife, nay, as between man and woman not with that connection, it appears to me that the distinction<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140005"/>of manslaughter can rarely ever arise where the crime has been attended with circumstances like those I have described to you: Gentlemen, on an occasion like the present, I should think myself extremely to blame, if I was to comment more on a case like the present: you shall hear the evidence; and I am sure, gentlemen, your determination will be as satisfactory to the Judge and Jury as any determination can possibly be.</p>

               <p>Do you live near the shop that was kept by the prisoner at the bar? - Next door to it.</p>
               <p>He kept a pork-shop there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On the 16th of August, about noon, did you observe any thing that took place in the shop of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell your own story, and let my Lord and these gentlemen hear you. - It was on a Tuesday, between the hours of twelve and one; I was sitting in our back parlour, and we heard a rumbling, and then something which fell with a considerable weight, which shook the room where I and Mrs. Gardner were; I was desired by her to go to the door; I went, and I saw many people standing round the door of the prisoner; I went into his house, and went half way up the passage from the street-door; the left hand is the shop; and I heard the cry of murder! very loudly, by a woman; I only heard it once; I went back to my own door, and Mrs. Gardner desired me to go a second time, and I met a woman who lodges in the house, I do not know her name; she took me by the left arm, and pushed me into the back parlour, where the prisoner was, and his wife; the fire-place was facing the door; the woman lay on the floor, on her right side, with her face towards the fire-place; the prisoner was kneeling on her left side with both his knees, between the arm-pit and hip; she was struggling, with both her arms up; she had no cap on, and he had hold of her neck-handkerchief with his left hand, and in his right he had something which appeared like a knife, striking at her with it; it appeared like a knife by the handle, I did not see the blade.</p>
               <p>In what manner was he using his hand? - I saw him use his hands once like a back stroke towards her throat, as it appeared to me; then I put my hands together, and ran out.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 64, in Strutton-Ground; my kitchen is directly opposite to the prisoner's; I was there, and heard the screams of murder! I went up stairs, to hear where the cries came from, and I saw Mrs. Spencer come out with her hands up, and from what she said I went in and looked into the parlour; I saw Mrs. Dingler laying on her right side, and Mr. Dingler kneeling on her left side, on both his knees, having hold of her neck-handkerchief with his left hand very bloody, and the knife in the right hand; he seemed to me, by the motion he had under her neck, as if he was attempting to cut her throat; I called to him, with my hands clasped together, for God's sake, Mr. Dingler, do not kill your wife! for God's sake, Mr. Dingler, do not murder your wife! he looked round to me with a sniggling grin, but did not speak; I went out of the room, and saw Mrs. Dingler lay bleeding on the room; then I went away, and called for assistance; I did not go in the house any more: I saw Mrs. Dingler after this; I found assistance was coming, and I returned back to the door; Mrs. Dingler was coming to the door.</p>
               <p>How long was this before the time you first left him? - Nearly about ten minutes; then, on returning, I saw Mrs. Dingler coming into the passage, with a knife in her right hand.</p>
               <p>Where was Dingler at that time? - About a yard behind, or he was coming after her.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Dingler say to you? - I came to the door, and I said, Dear me! what a distressed creature here is, murdered! and she held out the knife, and said this is the knife which I am murdered with.</p>
               <p>Describe a little the situation of this poor woman when you met her in the passage.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140006"/>- I saw her in the passage, with a knife in her hand, covered with blood from the head to the foot; she had no cap on at all; she delivered me the knife, and said this is what I am murdered with.</p>
               <p>When she said this to you, did Dingler say any thing to you? - He said nothing; he returned into the shop; he was coming after her, about a yard behind; he went into the shop, and looked through the glass of the shop-window at the people.</p>
               <p>Court. That was when his wife was gone into the street? - Yes; she fixed her hands, and rested herself on the top of the step, in a very weak condition; and at last she sat on the step of the street-door: I went to the next door but one, and I was shewing it to the people what a weapon it was, and Mr. Barrow came up and desired me to let him look at it; he put it into his pocket, and ran away with it, and I never saw it till I saw it before the justice; the knife was very bloody.</p>
               <p>Court. When he was kneeling on the deceased, can you describe what part of the body? - On the side.</p>
               <p>Was it on the front, or the back? - It was on the front.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of August did you receive any knife from Mrs. Gatenby? - Yes; (produces a knife, a large pork-knife, all over blood;) it was all over blood when I had it, wet at the time, handle and all.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of the situation of the poor woman? - Not when she was in the house; I saw her from our window; the people sent for me; I went, and the man refused to let her in the house; I immediately told him I would not do any thing till she was admitted; then he said she might come in, he cared nothing about her; she was not let in; I desired she might be taken to the Westminster hospital; I took the knife from Mrs. Gatenby, and put it into my pocket; I went to the hospital, but the woman was not come; I waited till she did come.</p>
               <p>Had you any further conversation with him or with her? - I had with her, but not with him; I think it was on the Thursday night; I went to see how she did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This transaction took place on Tuesday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The conversation you are now about to relate was on the subsequent Thursday? - Yes, or on the Wednesday evening.</p>
               <p>How long did the poor woman live after that? - I believe, twelve days.</p>
               <p>You are a medical man yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At that time, when you had that conversation with her, do you imagine she was in danger of death? - At first it was impossible to tell.</p>
               <p>But at that time were there hopes of recovery? - There were.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate those hopes to the patient? - I did not.</p>
               <p>But at that time you considered her not in a dying situation? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then you will not relate that conversation; Mr. Fielding agrees with me, that it being so long before her death, that it is not proper.</p>
               <p>Did you continue to visit the woman occasionally till her death? - Till within four or five days of her death.</p>
               <p>She had some very dangerous wounds? - There was one, the danger of which we could not at first ascertain; it was at the top of the breast bone; it appeared to be inflicted by a sharp, cutting instrument: there were several other wounds; one on her forehead, which appeared to be given by a stab, and two or three cuts on her face like chops.</p>
               <p>After this had taken place was her head opened? - I believe it was not.</p>
               <p>Therefore you cannot inform us whether there was any fracture of the skull? - No, I cannot; I fancy it was a very trivial wound.</p>
               <p>You do not know the state of the brain? - No.</p>
               <p>We all know very well a very small stab might occasion an exfoliation of the skull? - Not in this case; it did not appear so to me.</p>
               <p>In general that is an effect very likely to be produced by such a case? - It may.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140007"/>You have known, I dare say, instances in which a blow of the breast has produced that effect? - I never knew it.</p>
               <p>In the case of a fracture you do not think there are hopes till the 16th day? - No.</p>
               <p>This woman died on the 12th day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Injuries on the lungs are not in general so mortal as injuries on the brain? - That depends on circumstances.</p>
               <p>So does every thing; but the brain is of the more delicate texture? - Undoubtedly it is.</p>
               <p>Extravasation there does not easily get cured; a rupture of the vessels does not get easily cured? - It does not.</p>
               <p>However, there was no opening of the head? - There was not.</p>
               <p>From all these appearances, together with the degree of violence that has been described, do not you conceive those wounds, upon an irritable habit, a habit addicted to drinking, were the cause of her death? - No, Sir, I do not consider it from the wounds.</p>
               <p>From what cause? - From blows, pressure, or both.</p>
               <p>Was the body opened? - It was; I saw it.</p>

               <p>I was coming past this house on the 16th of August, Tuesday; I was coming down Strutton-Ground; I saw a great concourse of people at his door; two women came out, crying out, He is cutting her head off, Murder. I instantly made the best of my way for a constable. One Henderson said, he was a constable. I went in with him to take him; then Henderson said, he would have nothing to do with it. Then I went in again to take him. After that he took up a knife, and went backwards into a back room; then I followed him; I drew my sword; and Henderson and another gentleman followed me immediately, and we secured him.</p>
               <p>Had he a knife in his hand at that time? - He had a knife in his hand, his steel round his waist, and a bottle in his pocket, which was taken out afterwards. I desired him not to attempt to do any thing to himself, but to surrender himself up; it would be better for him; the case might not be so bad as he expected. The phial was a small bottle in his breeches pocket; I do not know what it was. Henderson took the phial out of pocket.</p>

               <p>I am a magistrate for Westminster.</p>
               <p>Did you visit this poor creature in the hospital? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you take her examination on oath? - I did, on the 17th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I object to that; I take it I need not state any objection to you. My learned friend does not offer this as the examination of a person deceased, under such imminent danger of immediate death as the law would justify in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140008"/>receiving without oath; this is an examination upon oath. I humbly submit, that the law is precisely the same, whether it be the examination of the person deceased, whose death is imputed to the person accused, or the examination of any other ordinary witness, who had known something of the transaction, who had died subsequent to that knowledge before the trial. I need not enlarge very much on the danger which would necessarily result from receiving such evidence, if a person in full health (for so I am inclined to state it) as this is, not under the pressure of appearing before a higher tribunal; it stands exactly as if Mr. Barrow, for instance, had gone before a magistrate, and there made an examination upon oath, either in the presence of the prisoner, or in his absence, without any cross examination; because you know it is the course of office of many magistrates, though certainly not very proper, to take just so much as is necessary for the conviction of the prisoner, reserving the rest for his defence on trial. Now, in order to put the argument more distinctly and plainly, taking this to be the deposition of any body else besides the woman deceased, and supposing Mr. Barrow had died since he was examined before Mr. Justice Abington, could his examination have been received as evidence? My Lord, if I am called upon to illustrate the mischiefs that must result from receiving this examination, to be sure the difficulty is not very considerable. It may and will happen, in consequence of death by duelling, for instance, that there is but one single witness; now suppose that witness goes before a magistrate, and there truly deposes that the party fell by my hands, that party who has given in his examination, and was the second, is dead before my trial can come on, and then, according to the argument, his examination not taken in my presence, and without the advantage of cross-examination, taken behind my back, not containing all the circumstances that he knows, but containing just so much as shall justify my commitment, shall be heard against me; suppose this same second to live till the trial, though he should depose on that trial that the deceased fell by my hands, yet suppose on the cross examination he deposed that the deceased assaulted me; that he called me to answer; that I was reluctant, and offered terms of reconciliation; and that I was obliged to discharge my pistol in my own defence; certainly, though I should be discharged, yet by this compendious mode of proceeding, supposing him to have died, I should stand at this bar accused by the testimony of a man who meant no wrong indeed, but who had disclosed so much as was necessary to criminate me. Only consider, my Lord, the situation in which I should stand; and permit me to ask, with great humility, whether this case does differ from that which I have been feebly representing? This woman might have recovered after the examination; the offence would have been a different offence; it is offered to you just as the examination in the case I have now stated; as the examination of a witness before a magistrate upon oath. As far as I have been able to tax my memory, I have not found one instance where such an examination has been received; and although my poor experience is so little, yet to be sure the knowledge and experience of your Lordships, particularly of one of the learned Judges on the bench, would furnish such precedents, if any there are; therefore, I submit that this evidence would be extremely dangerous, if received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. This is not the examination of a prisoner, but the examination of the deceased. It is an examination upon oath.</p>
               <p>Court. I have ruled against it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You attended at the hospital, Sir, when the poor woman was there? - I did, the next day after she was sent there.</p>
               <p>You took her examination upon oath? - I did.</p>
               <p>Have you that examination in writing? - I have. I took it myself; read it to her, signed it myself, and saw her mark it; which she did with great temper and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140009"/>great coolness. I recommended to her to be quiet and composed, and not to hurry herself, but to speak the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I beg pardon, this objection came by surprise; but there is certainly an authority of very considerable weight expressly in point, to shew that this examination under the circumstances cannot be read. I beg pardon for it; the answer to my objection, as it is understood at present, is, that the statute has authorized the magistrates to take the examination of the prisoner, and of the witnesses, to return them to the Court of Gaol Delivery; and if the witnesses should die in the mean time, these depositions should be read. Statute, the 2d and 3d of Philip and Mary, chap. 32, that applies to this question.</p>
               <p>The consequence of the law is, that if an examination has been taken pursuant to the directions of this statute, and certified here, that then, if occasion requires, and if the case is let in by the death of the party, it may be read; but I insist that this examination is not taken pursuant to the statute; that it is not one of those provided by the statute, which I shall prove, first, by the language of the statute, and then by the circumstances of the case. The statute says,</p>
               <p>"That every Justice or Justices,</p>
               <p>"before whom any person shall be</p>
               <p>"brought for manslaughter, or felony, or</p>
               <p>"suspicion thereof, shall take the information</p>
               <p>"of those persons, and of the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"of the fact and circumstances</p>
               <p>"thereof, and as much thereof as shall be</p>
               <p>"material to prove the felony shall be put</p>
               <p>"into writing within two days, and returned</p>
               <p>"to the sessions." The language of the statute is, that the Justice has nothing to do but with a man coming before him to be committed. This is an examination which Mr. Justice Abington certainly took, from very honourable and proper motives, from the deceased; but it was not in the course of a judicial examination; the prisoner was not present; the prisoner was not on his defence; and though I admit that there is no magic in a Justice's office, and though I admit that he might have held examination in the hospital, acting strictly in pursuance of the statute of Philip and Mary, that he might have thus brought the prisoner before him, and then I agree that this examination might have been read. I take the liberty of telling your Lordship, that this case has been very fully considered indeed in the year 1789, in this place. When I mention to you the authority of the Lord Chief Baron, who was the trying Judge, assisted by Mr. Justice Ashorst and Mr. Serjeant Adair, I shall have instant credit for the case being fully considered. It was a murder of a wife by a husband, of the most atrocious nature; it was a case as atrocious as that which is opened against the present defendant; more, certainly, it cannot be. He had invited his wife to go out in the fields, manifestly for the purpose of murder. A magistrate, of the name of Read, attended this poor woman in the poor-house; he found her a baptised mulatto, in a state of perfect recollection; he told her he was a magistrate come to take her examination. He admonished her to speak the truth; and as she appeared sensible of the importance and danger of falsehood, he administered an oath to her. He took her examination, read it over to her, and gave it to her to sign; she made her mark, and it was read in evidence. The Lord Chief Baron, in summing up the case, for there was no objection taken at the bar to receiving this in evidence, but after it had been read the learned Judges themselves upon consideration were of opinion that it ought not to have been received. It went to the Jury, but it went expressly, and in a marked manner, as an examination taken in extremis, when the poor creature considered herself near her end. The Judge laboriously stated to the Jury, that under all those circumstances it could not be received, in the only way in which the present examination is contended to be received. The Lord Chief Baron says thus:</p>
               <p>"If I was satisfied</p>
               <p>"that the case was quite full, without</p>
               <p>"this circumstance of her confession, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140010"/>" would not state these circumstances to</p>
               <p>"you at all, as I would not wish that they</p>
               <p>"should make any part of the consideration</p>
               <p>"now before you, because they come</p>
               <p>"under some difficulties. Great as this,</p>
               <p>"and every crime of this nature must always</p>
               <p>"appear to be, the conviction must</p>
               <p>"proceed on grounds of legal evidence;</p>
               <p>"and ordinarily legal evidence consists in</p>
               <p>"the deposition of witnesses, taken on</p>
               <p>"oath, before the jury, administered in the</p>
               <p>"face of the Court where the prisoner is</p>
               <p>"tried; and that evidence comes down to</p>
               <p>"the jury, under all the advantages which</p>
               <p>"examination and cross-examination can</p>
               <p>"give. There has been admitted beyond</p>
               <p>"that kind of evidence, two other species</p>
               <p>"of evidence; one is the declaration of</p>
               <p>"the dying person, who has been murdered;</p>
               <p>"and that has been admitted under</p>
               <p>"certain circumstances, to stand in the</p>
               <p>"place of evidence given before a jury on</p>
               <p>"oath. Another species of evidence has</p>
               <p>"been, that of examinations taken before a</p>
               <p>"Justice of Peace, having, under a particular</p>
               <p>"act of parliament, a justification to</p>
               <p>"take such examinations; and being called</p>
               <p>"upon to send such examinations afterwards</p>
               <p>"to the Court of Gaol Delivery,</p>
               <p>"where, if by accident, the party should</p>
               <p>"die before the trial of the prisoner, it</p>
               <p>"should be of necessity substituted in his</p>
               <p>"room." Here he comes to that which, I humbly apprehend, rules the present case.</p>
               <p>"A doubt has arisen among us, to which</p>
               <p>"doubt I subscribe, which is, whether the</p>
               <p>"examination taken by Mr. Read, is an</p>
               <p>"examination of that nature; for the examinations</p>
               <p>"directed to be taken by act of</p>
               <p>"parliament, are examinations taken where</p>
               <p>"persons are in custody, and when the justice</p>
               <p>"hears the examination of witnesses</p>
               <p>"against persons in custody, upon which</p>
               <p>"examination he is to do his duty, either</p>
               <p>"to commit, or to bail: such examinations</p>
               <p>"are allowed to be read after the death of</p>
               <p>"the party. It was a very proper and</p>
               <p>"prudent act of the Justice; but it was a</p>
               <p>"voluntary act of him, at the request of</p>
               <p>"the overseer. Now that voluntary examination</p>
               <p>"is like every other, not taken</p>
               <p>"before the jury who tried the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"and therefore not properly to be received</p>
               <p>"as an examination on oath; but though</p>
               <p>"we must strip it of that sort of sanction,</p>
               <p>"yet still it is the declaration of the party;</p>
               <p>"signed by herself; and you may class it</p>
               <p>"with all those other declarations which</p>
               <p>"this woman made after she was found,</p>
               <p>"and before she died. Now, with respect</p>
               <p>"to that, the general rule by which these</p>
               <p>"declarations is made evidence is this, they</p>
               <p>"are declarations made in extremis, when</p>
               <p>"the party is considered as at the point of</p>
               <p>"death, no hopes for this world, with</p>
               <p>"every obligation upon them therefore to</p>
               <p>"speak truth; and that situation being</p>
               <p>"considered as so solemn and so awful, as</p>
               <p>"to create an equal obligation to that of a</p>
               <p>"positive oath, judicially administered."</p>
               <p>My Lord, if one could trust one's self to say a word after this, it would be, that his authority grows out of the statute of Philip and Mary; it is commensurate with the terms of it, therefore it is utterly impossible, that unless the prisoner is present, as it seems on the authority and language of the statute, aided by this late case, your Lordship will be of opinion this examination cannot be read.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Mr. Abington. I understand you did not send for the man to be examined again? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you commit on the examination? - After I had committed him once, I sent for him again, that he might have all the advantage he could make of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had he the advantage of suggesting the questions to the woman? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. If your Lordship tells me, that you subscribe to the opinion as delivered in the case cited by Mr. Garrow, I confess it struck me at first as an objection not at all tenable on any possible ground; I should have argued it, setting the act of parliament out of our view; I should have bottomed myself in that first principle; I have reduced all my reasoning within the compass of that principle, that the best evidence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140011"/>is required that the nature of the case will afford.</p>

               <p>I am house-surgeon to the Westminster Infirmary. On the 16th day of August this poor woman was brought to the Infirmary between twelve and one; she was wounded in different parts of her body; her face wounded superficially in five or six different places; her hands wounded also superficially in four or five places; there was a deep gash on the upper and interior part of her chest on her breast; it appeared to have been made by some cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Were there any other wounds that appeared to have been made by a cutting instrument? - All of them.</p>
               <p>Were any of these wounds, according to their first appearance, dangerous in your opinion? - That on the breast-bone might be dangerous.</p>
               <p>What did you order to this poor woman when she was taken under your care? - The wounds were dressed. She complained of a pain in her right breast.</p>
               <p>From her complaint, and your inspection of the part, could you or could you not determine that there was any danger from that pain? - There were appearances the next day of discolouration of the skin.</p>
               <p>Were there any appearances of danger from that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I apprehend you dressed her wounds as soon as you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The second day, then, from the discolouration of the skin, and the complaint you had heard the day before, you conceived there was danger as well from that as from the wound in the breast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any other appearance arise from the course of the second day? - No, Sir, that pain began to increase, and she had difficulty of breathing. I am not able to speak any further, as she was taken under the care of the physicians the second day. I am not very sure whether she complained of this pain in her right breast on the first day, but she did the second.</p>
               <p>Did her wounds heal and get better? - They were nearly healed when she died.</p>
               <p>How long did the woman live? - Twelve days, I think.</p>
               <p>On the twelfth day she died? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Was the body opened after the death? - It was.</p>
               <p>Could you, before the opening of the body, determine to what cause that death was attributed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the body open? - I did, by the direction of Mr. Watson, the senior surgeon of the hospital.</p>
               <p>Upon opening the body, did any cause appear to your observation from whence you ascribe her death? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From what cause? - From a rupture of some blood vessel in the cavity of the thorax, as there were found two quarts of blood in the right cavity; the internal mischief corresponded with the external.</p>
               <p>Describe to the satisfaction of the Gentlemen of the Jury to what external appearance this was connected? - From the bruise received on the right breast.</p>
               <p>Then from the bruise that was received on the right breast, this which was the internal injury appeared? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you therefore think that the death of the woman was to be attributed to that injury, according to the best of your opinion and skill? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time communicate to the woman your opinion of her situation? - No, Sir, I did not; I gave her the best hopes.</p>
               <p>Was the head opened? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Having gone so far in your enquiry, were you satisfied that the injury you have described was the occasion of her death? - Yes, Sir, I am satisfied in my own mind that it was.</p>
               <p>Did any other surgeon attend your examination? - Mr. Watson, he is here, and the physicians were present.</p>
               <p>Did these dangerous symptoms increase on the woman? - They did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140012"/>At what time did you think there was imminent danger? - About three or four days before her death.</p>
               <p>Had the discolouration increased? - No, but the difficulty of breathing had become greater.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. On the first day, as far as as you recollect, she complained of the wounds? - She did.</p>
               <p>The wound on the breast bone was about an inch deep? - It was.</p>
               <p>How far removed from that part of the breast that was discoloured? - About two or three inches.</p>
               <p>When you speak of the breast, you mean the breast, properly so called? - I mean the sternon.</p>
               <p>Beyond all question, the discolouration of the breast might be occasioned by external violence offered to the breast? - It might.</p>
               <p>Might it not be the consequence of a wound on the sternon? - No, Sir, I do not think it could.</p>
               <p>Might it not be the consequence of the the extravasation of the blood under the sternon? - I think not.</p>
               <p>Was the discolouration on that part of the breast nearer to the sternon or further from it? - Further from it.</p>
               <p>Was there any spitting of blood? - I believe there was a little; the expectoration was chiefly blood.</p>
               <p>Was it the latter part of the attempt to cure, or the beginning? - I believe it was at the beginning, the discolouration got better.</p>
               <p>An injury on the breast must have been of a very violent sort indeed, to have affected the internal part so as to have produced a rupture of the blood vessels? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Is not it possible that that rupture was occasioned by the blow on the sternon? - No, Sir, I do not think it.</p>
               <p>Supposing so great a degree of violence to have been inflicted on the cavity of the thorax, to have occasioned a rupture of the blood vessels there (protected as that cavity of the thorax is by the ribs) would not the appearance of the breast have been much worse than it was in the present case? - I think so.</p>
               <p>If there had been a sufficient degreee of force applied to the external part of the body on the breast to occasion that extravasation of the blood, the appearance of the breast would have been more discoloured, in all probability, than it would have been on the present occasion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you mean, must have been, might have been, or would have been? - There was a greater mischief internally than there was externally.</p>
               <p>Was that wound, in your mind, at all the cause of this extravasation in the thorax? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Do you, or do you not, attribute that interior injury as arising from this contusion on the breast? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court. You say she complained of pain the second day? - She did.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any discolouration on that part where she complained of the pain? - Yes, I did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you superintend Mr. Scott when he opened this woman? - He opened her by my orders, and I was by when he opened her.</p>
               <p>Did you see her before her death? - Yes, almost every day I saw her, the very day she came in, the very hour.</p>
               <p>Most of her wounds were cutaneous, except the wound on the breast? - She had a wound between her finger and thumb, which seemed to be made by drawing a knife over her hand.</p>
               <p>Was the death of this poor woman occasioned by that wound, the most dangerous one on her breast? - There was a wound in the center of her body on the sternon.</p>
               <p>Was that wound which was given by a sharp instrument the occasion of her death? - It seemed to be given, not with a very sharp instrument, but like that knife; it was prevented from going very deep, it stuck in the bone of the sternon; I could not call<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140013"/>any of these external wounds mortal, not any of them, not even that on the sternon; I saw the body opened; she went on for about three days, very tolerably well, the fourth day, and complained of pain in that side of her chest, and difficulty of breathing; she complained a little from the very first day, but not of much consequence till the fourth day; then she began to be very uneasy in her chest, and difficulty of breathing; I examined the breast, there was the mark of bruises, a contusion in the skin, as if a person had been boxing, a little towards the sternon.</p>
               <p>Did this, from the fourth day, till the time of her death, alter its appearance? - Not a great deal, it grew rather stronger, the appearance grew rather stronger every day.</p>
               <p>When you saw Mr. Scott going through the operation of dissecting the body, did you discover the cause, according, to your opinion, of her death? - That I did very particularly discover; I imagine it was the extravasation of a great quantity of blood and serum in the cavity of the thorax, with a great discolouration of the lungs, which appeared very bad, and which extravasation was enough to have oppressed any body.</p>
               <p>What injury done to the body, either exterior or interior, according as you could collect, was the occasion of this? - Either some violent pressure or blows; violent blows on the body, or some great weight upon her of that kind; it had the appearance of pressing, she was a very corpulent woman, very fat, very relaxed, and weak fibres.</p>
               <p>Then this appeared to have arisen from some violent pressure on her body? - Yes, I only mention this circumstance of her being so very fat, having such relaxed fibres, that she was more liable to injury from pressure, than others not so corpulent.</p>
               <p>Was there any particular part of the body, the breast or any where else, that you derive this inward injury arose from? - From the appearance on the right side of the chest the injury seemed to have been done; she was very clear in her senses, and was very well, she had no pain or uneasiness in her head; we did not open the head, there was no necessity for it.</p>
               <p>Do you, on the whole, in the way in which you make up your mind, attribute that inside injury to that cause? - Yes I do, I do not think the wounds with a sharp instrument sufficient.</p>
               <p>To the wounds with a sharp instrument you do not attribute her death? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Excuse me doctor: to the wounds unconnected with the extravasation, you do not attribute the death? - No.</p>
               <p>When you describe her to be a corpulent fat woman, do you mean that she was large made? - Large made.</p>
               <p>Supposing a violent blow to have been given there, it would not be extraordinary that there should be a rupture of vessels in some adjacent parts? - That might take place, to be sure.</p>
               <p>After the disposition to the rupture of vessels, that appearance would continue to increase till you would not be surprised to find they had discharged two quarts of blood? - That is very certain, if numbers of vessels are broke they will continue to ooze so as to fill a large cavity.</p>
               <p>Might not an extravasation of blood be occasioned by the cutting the vessels, as well as by the contusion of them? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Then, supposing any of the vessels on the sternon of my body to be cut by such an instrument as this, a consequent extravasation might take place? - It might happen, and it might not, if a number of small vessels under the skin were cut, supposing the wound to go no deeper.</p>
               <p>The extravasation having taken place, from whatever cause, the difficulty of breathing would be occasioned by the cavity being filled, in which the lungs cannot operate? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Are not the vessels under the sternon, which, if ruptured, would discharge their contents into the cavity of the thorax, more exposed to the danger of rupture from the pressure of external violence, than those<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140014"/>vessels under the breast of a fat corpulent subject? - They certainly are; one reason is, they are larger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Does it appear, according to your best examination, that this wound on the sternon was occasioned by a sharp instrument, or otherwise? - Not from a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The fair question is this: Whether you can take upon yourself to say, in a case of life, on your oath, whether the cause of the death arose from the injury on the sternon, or from an internal injury? - Not from the injury on the sternon, nor by the injury on the breast externally, but from an internal injury.</p>
               <p>The question is, Whether you can venture to say, that that internal injury was not occasioned by the pressure, of which you observed that mark on the sternon? - It is necessary to enquire into what she might have suffered from pressure.</p>
               <p>But judging in the abstract, are you enabled to say, that that extravasation was not occasioned by the wound on the sternon? - I do not think it was; it was occasioned by the pressure.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say that it was not? - Yes, I am able to say that, because I did not observe any mark of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. A little beyond what might have been, are you enabled to say, according to the best of your opinion, whether it was owing to any pressure on the sternon, or to any other pressure on the body? - I believe it was owing to the pressure on the whole side of the chest, in which the sternon might have its part, but not singly on the sternon.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any of the vessels on the sternon appear to be cut? - No, Sir; it was owing to the external pressure of the sternon.</p>
               <p>There was no appearance of the knife going through? - No more than that the skin was cut.</p>
               <p>Did those vessels from whence the blood was supposed to extravasate appear to be cut? - No, only the vessels of the skin.</p>

               <p>Then it was not from these vessels that this blood could possibly extravasate? - No.</p>
               <p>Suppose the woman had made no complaint at all, and you had not seen any discolouration, of the breast, and you had seen that a blow had been given by a knife on the sternon, could you by that have accounted for the extravasation of the blood in the cavities? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Should you have attributed this extravasation to that blow given by the knife on the breast? - I certainly should not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Who was the physician that attended this poor woman? - Dr. Morris.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. You attended this poor woman in the hospital? - Not through the whole of her illness; she was admitted on the 9th, and I saw her for the first time on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>What was her situation? - I did not form any opinion of her at that time, because I considered her as a surgeon's patient merely; I could not attend her regularly till the Wednesday following; she appeared to be under considerable distress with respect to her breathing; she had a very bad pain in her side; she could not lay on the opposite side to that which was affected; she was extremely restless, and had a great deal of anxiety in her countenance: these symptoms appeared to me of a very dangerous tendency.</p>
               <p>Were her situations and symptoms such as to derive apprehensions in your mind for her situation? - She was very much afraid of dying; she thought she should die. I encouraged her, and gave her hopes; not from any conviction of her recovery, but merely to comfort her, from motives of humanity.</p>
               <p>Did you observe, during your continuance, whether the apprehensions you had discovered, were or were not removed from her mind? - I apprehend not entirely; but that is only apprehension; this was on the Wednesday preceding her death.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know his deceased wife? - I did not know a great deal of them.</p>
               <p>On the 16th of August was you at his house in Strutton Ground? - Yes, I lodged there.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing pass between the prisoner and his wife at that time? - I was come out of the country, and coming by the shop where they both stood, she had been abusing him, and cursing and swearing at him, and he said nothing at all; then there was a butcher's chopper laying on the window, she took that up, and made a full blow at his head he took the chopper out of her hand after she aimed a blow at him, and he laid the chopper down; I staid a little while afterwards, but there were words, and I went up stairs into my my apartment; I would not stay any longer. I had not been many minutes up stairs before I heard the cry of murder.</p>
               <p>How many minutes do you think it was? - Perhaps it might be six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>When you left them they were still quarrelling, and in six or seven minutes you heard the cry of murder? - I do not know what happened afterwards; I saw nothing more happen. I have known the prisoner since Midsummer-day; he is as good a natured man as ever took the house, and a sober man; I saw him three or four times a day.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. What day was this? - I believe it was the 16th of August.</p>
               <p>How long did you remain up stairs after you had heard any noise below? - Six or seven minutes before I heard a fresh noise again; then I came down stairs, and there were several people in the passage.</p>
               <p>When you first went into this shop, you heard them quarrelling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any of the words made use of? - No further than calling rascal and rogue, and such as that; I did not take any great account of what she said further than that; I did not expect any more should be of it.</p>
               <p>You did not interfere at all between man and wife? - Not at all; I did not expect any danger.</p>
               <p>So he took this knife out of her hand without any difficulty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called ten witnesses, who gave him a very good character for sobriety, humanity, good-nature, and tenderness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I fancy, as far as a good character goes, the jury do not wish for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140016"/>more satisfaction; there are a vast number more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, now the evidence is closed, I feel it my duty, as counsel for the unhappy man at the bar, to state to your Lordship two several objections on his behalf; the effect of one of which, if I succeed, will be, that your Lordship will be compelled in point of law to instruct the jury to acquit the prisoner altogether. If, however, I should fail in that, the remaining objection will have the effect of reducing the crime to manslaughter; and he must have been a very inattentive observer of all that has passed in this Court for some hours, that has not observed that mine is at this moment a very painful situation. To your Lordships, who know the legal constitution of the country, and to whom I may perhaps, without presumption, say, I have the honour to be known; to your Lordships and the Jury I am sure it is unnecessary for me to make the least apology. Let it be recollected, and when I say so I mean, let it be recollected by all the bystanders, (for you do not require to be reminded of it) that every man is presumed to be innocent till proved guilty; that every man who is indicted is entitled, God knows not to make an ample defence by counsel, but to the assistance of counsel; therefore, though the duty of a profession every now then imposes a painful task on an individual, every body must feel it is the duty of that individual to discharge that task manfully, and to the best of his power for the life of the man committed to his care. Nobody can therefore blame me for suggesting two objections to your Lordships. The first objection is that which goes to an acquittal, upon this ground, that the indictment imputes the death of this woman to have taken place by means, and under circumstances, which the evidence before your Lordship and the jury does not sustain. I am not uninformed that there may be modes of death, which, though not charged with perfect accuracy in the indictment, may be charged with something approaching to accuracy; but I take it to be clear, that if the death imputed in the indictment be different and variable in any essential degree, that then the defendant will be entitled to an acquittal. This has been long the law as laid down in the books; the distinction has been broadly marked, so that any man who runs may read. In the present case the indictment charges, that the death was occasioned by throwing the deceased to the ground, by bearing and pressing her with the hands and knees, and feet, and by that sort of pressure. I shall confine myself to my province, and I insist that the evidence proves a death by other and different means; by means so distinct, as to be within that distinction which the ancient wisdom of the law has laid down, and which entitles the defendant to his acquittal. I am aware that the surgeons have delivered their opinion that the death was occasioned by an extravasation of blood which filled the cavity of the thorax; that in their judgment that was occasioned by an external violence opposed to the breast, and not to the sternon. I think, in so stating it, I do ample justice to the force of the pressure of the argument against it; but although the jury are to form an opinion, that is to be an opinion grounded (I speak it with all the respect necessary) from the premises given in evidence; and that they have said, that the pressure of external violence on the sternon has in the present instance done, that which in the abstract it may do: Mr. Scott and Mr. Watson have told your lordships, that from the formation of the human body, from the anatomy of those parts, the probability was, that the extravasation should rather have been on the sternon, than from that part which is more protected from that injury. If the Jury are of opinion that that is so in point of fact, it becomes my duty to apply that in point of law. The indictment should have charged that he, with a certain instrument called a knife, which he had and held in his right hand, did, by one violent cut and blow, which he gave in and upon the sternon of the deceased, which ruptured the vessels, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140017"/>extravasation ensued, and the death came in consequence; and if that fact was so, then I contend that it is not well charged in the present indictment, that the death was occasioned, or the extravasation brought about by means of another species of force and violence, namely, the beating and bruising with the hands and feet of the prisoner. My Lords, the next objection is that, which if the former should fail, will not go to an acquittal, but will reduce the degree of the prisoner's offence; I mean that case which has been stated to you on the evidence of

The language of the law is, that in its wisdom, it attends to, and makes allowances for the frailties of human nature, as long as human nature shall continue to be what it is, as long as human nature shall have its frailties and passions, so long Courts of Justice, conversant on the transactions of human nature, must necessarily pay obedience to those passions, and to those frailties; therefore, if you believe the personal danger or violence threatened to the prisoner at the bar, at the time he committed it; then, though you should be of opinion, that he should not have the benefit of the first objection; yet, with great deference, I submit to the Court, that under this evidence, the offence can only be manslaughter. I only mean to shew how the law applies, as I am sure the Jury would not hear me, if I made any observations on the evidence; but the evidence is, that the husband and the wife being engaged in a furious quarrel, she took up a deadly weapon, and aimed a deadly blow at him: that the heat of blood had been increased by this violent act on her part, and still continued, and which still continued increasing, till the cry of murder was heard, and the fatal catastrophe was committed. My Lords, if in any heat of blood, the man has committed this action, under those circumstances, I submit to your Lordships, with all becoming humility, but with considerable confidence in the law, that he is intitled to be found guilty of no higher offence than manslaughter: upon principles so clear as these, recognized in every page of criminal law, from the first books to the last, it would be impertinent to mention precedents; but there is one so lately, and in the presence of the learned Judge, who tries this prisoner, which I dare say he will recollect, before Lord Kenyon, in the last session, he was here; which is so very much in point: it was the case of an indictment against a smith in the neighbourhood of Smithfield, for the murder of his wife by cruelty; the evidence was that in the course of the beating, which the witnesses heard, the woman had repeatedly said this, for God's sake do not kill me, indeed I do deserve it. This was a circumstance which the Judge left for the consideration of the Jury, that she frequently said, indeed I do deserve it. Now, said he, if from this you can collect, that at the time he gave the blows, which occasioned this death, he had received a resistance from this woman, which amounted to that degree of apology, which was sufficient to sustain the observation that the frailties of his nature were the cause of the beating, you may reduce the crime to manslaughter; now that direction his lordship gave, on no better evidence, than that in the course of a severe beating, the poor wretch, who would say any thing for her life, said, to be sure I deserve it. My Lords, I shall not be guilty of the impertinence of renewing an apology on the present occasion, but shall sit down perfectly satisfied that justice will be done to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. You have no occasion to trouble yourself, I shall leave it to the Jury, as to the points which have been very accurately stated by the Counsel.</p>
               <p>Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and the Jury immediately gave a verdict,</p>

            , hold up your hand; you stand attainted for the wilful murder of Jane your wife; what have you to say for yourself, why the Court should not give you judgement to die, according to law?</p>
               <p>(Proclamation made.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Prisoner at the bar, you have been tried and convicted of the very atrocious and cruel murder of your wife: you, by matrimony, had placed yourself in a situation the most likely in this world to afford you happiness and comfort; you had entered into a very solemn contract, for that consolation and comfort which you had a right to expect, to give protection to that woman so long as you both should live; you have, notwithanding that, aggravated your offence greatly, by the consideration that the person whom you have thought fit to murder, was a person whom, above all the world, you was bound by a most solemn contract, by every tie of religion, by every moral consideration, to assist, to countenance, and protect; you have had the good fortune, for this very atrocious offence, to be tried in a country where the administration of justice is a very mild one; and all who hear me can bear testimony, that all the ingenuity of a counsel, and all the patient hearing of a cause, could possibly do in your favour, has been done on the present occasion: the Jury, who upon their oaths are bound as much to protect the rights of the public as the injuries of the individual, after having given every weight that could possibly be given, even to a feather, that might have weighed in your case, have on a deliberate consideration decided against you, and I am under the necessity of telling you the dreadful news, that their decision has the full, complete approbation of the Court: though I have not long had the honour to sit in this situation, I have been called upon twice in the same day to pass the dreadful sentence of the law, which you are now to receive, on two persons who had committed the like offence under the most atrocious circumstances; I pray God, that though their examples have had no effect upon you, that the example which you are about to set, by your sufferings, may have a good effect on others, if there should be any found of a disposition (which God forbid) so brutal as yourself: you have endeavoured to excuse and palliate this offence; for one part of your defence was no alleviation, in point of morality, of your crime; it rested on a point of law, which as Judges we thought it justice to give you the benefit of, however brutal your offence has been; but you have attempted to mitigate that offence, by producing a witness to prove a circumstance of alleviation; and I must say, on that question also, the Court think the Jury have done right in deciding against you: by the sacred scriptures we learn, that whoever spills man's blood, his blood shall be spilled; you therefore, on a clear and satisfactory conviction, have nothing to expect from me but the sentence of the law: I hope you will make use of the very short space of time that is allowed to persons of your description to remain in this world, to the best advantage; and I hope that God Almighty, in his goodness, will at last pardon this very aggravated offence of yours, if you, as you ought, most sincerely repent of the crime which you have committed. Nothing remains therefore, now, but that I pass the dreadful sentence which the law compels me to do; which is, That you,

               <p>I am ward-beadle. I was sent for on the 26th of last month by the Deputy, and he gave me a report that he suspected the prisoner had robbed him; the prisoner was at his master's house, Mr. Deputy Brown, Leadenhall-street; he gave me charge of him for robbing him. I went up stairs with the prisoner and the Deputy, and searched his box; he unlocked it himself; and in the box I found this property I have here. (Produced.) It was tied up in his dirty shirt; with that, his master being there, he said he hoped his master would forgive him. I heard nothing more.</p>

My master being out, I went down and told my mistress, and then sent for my master; this was about five o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140023"/>in the afternoon. At eight, when he was leaving work, I stopped him going out, just off the step of the street door, and went and fetched Singleton the constable, and he searched him, and found pewter in every one of his pockets. While I went for the constable, he was in the kitchen with my mistress, and Mr. Bland with her, a next door neighbour.</p>

(Produced.) They weigh upwards of six pounds weight. The man said, he was very sorry for what he had done. I asked him, if ever he had been guilty of the like before? he said, he had not; he meant to sell it to an old iron shop in Shoe-lane.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. This silk had been dyed? - It had not.</p>

               <p>My brother called on Wednesday, the 10th of August, and told me his suspicions; I said I believed the prisoner was honest; I received some silk from my brother that morning, I do not know the quantity, it was sent to me to mark, it comes to me in small skains, that was in skains of different sizes; my brother's servant came for the silk, I gave him all the silk I received that day; the servant's name is Allen Murdoch, he and my brother came back with the same silk, and begged the prisoner might be called up and examined, she being the only one in the house that morning, except my mother; while I was marking the prisoner came in, and asked me if she should assist me, which she did for about ten minutes; there was a bonnet of mine which laid in the room; she said I had better put it by; I said for why? she said out of the dust; I said I will put it away; the silk was in the room at the time, I went out of the room with it, and left her in the room with the silk, I was absent about eight or ten minutes; when I returned I told her I did not want her any longer, and she went down stairs; that was about ten; my brother came about eleven, and sent for the silk, and told me his suspicions: then the silk I had on the Wednesday morning was taken away, and when he returned, the woman was taken up stairs; I went into the room with her, I searched her and found this quantity of silk, which she took out of her pocket, and owned; I begged her to own if she had any about her, she begged for mercy; I have had the silk ever since, (the silk produced) I received it on Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Should you have known the silk if you had been at York? - No, possibly I might not.</p>
               <p>Why then should you accuse the woman of having the same silk? - Because it was the silk that was in the bag, and she had it in her pocket, and she was left in the room.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing particular about the silk? - Nothing particular, there were three sorts of silk, these are two of them, one sort I had finished and put into skains, the other was not in the same sort of skains, none of that which I had finished was missing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The man who brought the silk to your house is not here to-day? - No.</p>
               <p>Is your mother here? - No.</p>
               <p>Your mother assisted you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you not call her to assist you that morning? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you never said so? - No, not that morning.</p>
               <p>Did you desire her to assist you occasionally? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could not finish all these by the time they were sent for to be dyed? - No, Sir, I could not have undertaken to have done it by that time.</p>
               <p>Did you expect these to be brought back to you marked for dying? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>This woman I believe was employed in cleaning the knives of the house? - She was.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire the prisoner to make as much haste as she could with this silk? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did she say at that time, that not being able to get through this business, she had taken it to do it at a time when she had more leisure? - No, Sir, she did not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, recollect yourself, that she did not tell you, you had pressed her to make haste, and she put it in her pocket, to do it at an after time? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>How long have you known this woman? - About seven months; she says she is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140027"/>widow woman with two children; one is seventeen years old, and is maimed; the other is eleven years old.</p>
               <p>In consequence of your mother enquiring into her character you employed her? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Desormeaux. On the Wednesday morning, 10th of August, I sent some silk to Miss Desormeaux to mark, and at the same time I received by a person who carried it, another parcel which she had the preceding day to mark; I weighed that parcel, and found it deficient, and informed Mr. Desormeaux; he went out, and returned, and sent me for the parcel I had sent out that morning; I did so, and received it from Miss Desormeaux, and brought it back, and we weighted it together, and found 1 lb. 8 oz. deficient, being 24 oz. It was not missing from that sort which was marked, but from two other sorts; I carried the silk back in the state it then was to Miss Desormeaux's house, with Mr. Desormeaux. The prisoner was then in the house; she was brought up, and Mr. Desormeaux desired she might be searched; and after that Miss Desormeaux produced this silk, to the best of my knowledge; yes, it is; I believe Miss Desormeaux had the care of it; I believe it to be the silk I sent in the morning; I compared it then, and it corresponded exactly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you first weighed it, did you make an entry of the weight of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You judged the deficiency from the entry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you that book with you? - No; there is such a deal of silk passes through my hands, it is impossible to recollect without the book.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say without the book, or referring to it, whether any of this silk was missing? - Before I brought the silk from Miss Desormeaux in those bundles that are done up, I saw some missing, and I mentioned it to Miss Desormeaux at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He did not mention that before, nor did Miss Desormeaux mention it at her examination.</p>
               <p>Have you not since you went down from the bar been talking with Mr. Desormeaux and Miss Desormeaux on this business? - No, I have not; not a word on this business. Miss Desormeaux has mentioned to me that she was exceedingly flurried when giving her evidence. I positively say that was all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who all gave her an exceeding good character.</p>

I got up, and waked Mr. Thomas between five and six in the morning; Mr. Thomas has the property. The prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140028"/>slept below stairs; I went into his room with the landlord, and the prisoner pulled the money out from under the bed upon the sacking, and put it on a table. I asked him if he had my handkerchief? he said, he knew nothing about it. I examined the bed, and shook the handkerchief out of the pillow-case.</p>
               <p>Was all the money that you lost in the purse when found? - Exactly the same. I gave these things to Mr. Thomas; he has kept them since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had you known the prisoner? - He lived at Otterspool a year before.</p>
               <p>You was friends with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You used to joke together? - No.</p>
               <p>You had not got tipsy this day? - No.</p>
               <p>Not a little? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you acknowledge in the morning that you did not think he meant to rob you, and that you would take your money, and would be contented? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you say so? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Should you have prosecuted him if Thomas had not forced you, and insisted on your prosecuting him? - Thomas did not insist.</p>
               <p>Who had him taken up? - Mr. Thomas.</p>
               <p>Did not Thomas insist that you should prosecute him? - Never.</p>
               <p>How long had you known the prisoner? - Three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner know you was in the house? - He spoke to me in the evening, and asked me how I did; that was all that passed.</p>

I went up into the room where the postboy slept, and brought a little cane down, and asked him if it was his? he said, yes; I pulled him out of bed, and I believe struck him; he begged for mercy, and said he had done wrong, and would give up the property; he searched his pockets, but could not find it, and then he went to the bed, and brought the purse out from under the bed, and laid it on the table. The prosecutor said, there was a handkerchief; the prisoner said, he knew nothing of it. The prosecutor took up the pillow-case, and shook it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was very angry? - Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>The postboy was willing to go, and take no more notice of it? - He was.</p>

I told him, I would go to Sir Sampson, and see if it was advertised, and if there was any reward, he should have it; and going through Broad-Court, he made a sudden stop, and said, he would go no further. I then suspected him, and took him to Bow-street; he said there, he had found it. I have known the man several years; he has worked for me; I had no suspicion he had stolen it at first.

This is the property we found on the prisoner; it was inside the bed, wrapped up in the blankets and sheets. This property dropped from the man who made his escape. I left the prisoner in custody of Mr. Story, who was with me, while I and Whitfield went after the other. The man that escaped had this long chisel, which matched with the place where the door was wrenched. I went to the house the Wednesday following; I did not hear of it before; the door of the house was wrenched in two or three different places, and the window broke open. It was between two and three in the morning when we met him; it was very dark that morning, I could not see the man that escaped; he got into a potatoe field.</p>

On Wednesday, the 20th of July, about nine in the evening, I was serving a person, and the prisoner at the bar was walking by the door in the street, upon the pavement, for some time, and when I had served the customer, he attempted to take a loaf of sugar that was standing on a chest of tea about two yards in the shop; after that, just as I had served the woman, he came and took it off the chest, and ran out, and I ran after him, and I apprehended him immediately. He just ran round the window, and got up a passage, and a person stopped him with the loaf, and he threw it down, and the person marked it in my presence; I saw the loaf of sugar on the ground close by, but it was rather dark in the passage; I did not see him drop it, it was about six yards from our shop, up Catherine-wheel-alley. I am certain to the boy.</p>

The prisoner turned round, and fronted me, and held me in his arms, while the other man put his arms round my waist, and got hold of my watch-string; the other man that pulled at my watch-string ran away; the chain broke; I lost a steel watch-chain, all the chain went, and a stone seal set in metal gilt, and a watch-key and hook. I held the prisoner till Mr. Hutchinson took him from me; I had not seen them converse together before, nor had I seen the prisoner before. I was particularly careful that evening in keeping my coat over my fob. The prisoner held me down quite fast with his two arms round my body; he endeavoured to put them over my arms as much as he could. I held him by the leg till Mr. Hutchinson came up. People were passing but no tried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140038"/>Nobody interfered; the place was remarkably clear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Did not you say at Bow-street, that it was in the Strand, opposite St. Clement's church? - It was opposite the church-yard.</p>
               <p>What you said at Bow-street was read over to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you signed it? - Yes. I might say St. Clement's church, being so very near the church; it was in the very narrowest part of the Strand.</p>
               <p>He could not well get out of your way when he turned round? - He might have got out of my way.</p>
               <p>He caught hold of you round the body? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That he might do to save himself from falling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was near falling, I believe? - Yes, he stooped a little; he did not fall; he was very near falling.</p>
               <p>At this instant, you say somebody made a pluck at your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The person that snatched at your watch offered you no violence at all? - None at all.</p>
               <p>This person was very near falling? - Yes, and he made me fall.</p>
               <p>You have seen persons fall in like manner? - I have seen them fasten upon one another.</p>

               <p>I am an oilman. I know the prosecutor. On Wednesday, the 27th of July, about nine in the evening, I was returning from Chelsea, and opposite St. Clement's church the prisoner was a little before this young man, and another behind him; this young man was in the middle, and another behind him; the prisoner turned round, and said, Bob, this is not our way home, we will go the other way; the prisoner turned round, and took hold of this young lad, and the other made a snatch at his watch. This young lad called out, my watch, my watch, murder, my watch. I tried to catch hold of the other, but he got away; then I took hold of the prisoner, while the prosecutor held him by the leg. While I was trying to catch the other, the prisoner begged hard to get away, and said, it was not him who robbed the lad. I at that time held him, and asked the churchwarden to go for a constable; he staid about half an hour, I held him all the time. The constable's name was Talboys. I went with them, and put the prisoner in the watch-house, and next morning he was taken before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Were there a great many persons passing at the time? - A great many.</p>
               <p>The lad was moving towards him? - He was two yards from him.</p>
               <p>The lad could hardly avoid running against him? - He could very easy avoid it.</p>
               <p>Have you not seen that accident frequently happen? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner at the bar almost fall? - No.</p>
               <p>Indeed? - Indeed, not to my knowledge. When the lad laid hold of his leg, he jostled him.</p>
               <p>Did you make any offer of this kind, the lad saying that he belonged to reputable connections, that you would discharge him if he could bring any reputable connections? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you know the other man again? - Why, I could not swear to him; he was a short man, with a round hat.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner, at the time this happened, give any account of the other man? - He called him by his name, which is in the indictment.</p>

He said, dead or alive, it would come to about 15 s. I went to acquaint our inspector of it; he was going out, he said, for a little way. Tristram and Berry came afterwards to me, at Sharp's-alley, between eight and nine in the evening, and they both asked 24 s. for it, and said they would come in about ten minutes after; Berry rode on the horse, the other walked. I detained them both, and the horse, at my stable, in Sharp's-alley. The prosecutor had the horse away with him before the magistrate; they were taken before magistrate that morning by ten o'clock. He said, it was his property. They desired the horse might be killed, and Tristram represented the prisoner as his cousin, and that the horse must be slaughtered. Then the men were fully committed.</p>

A man came, and said, he wanted something to drink; says Smith, if you will stick to me, and say, these two lads stole this horse, we will have plenty of drink.

They asked for two shillings worth of salmon, and had two or three pots of porter, and five slices of bread, a quartern of brandy, and sixpennyworth of rum and water; they said about twenty-five minutes, and paid their reckoning, and went away; they were gone before eleven, and might come about half after ten. I knew Clarke before, I never saw Robson, before, but I took particular notice of Robson, because he was a particularly likely young man. I am not positive to Robson.</p>

             The young man they call Robson had been there before that day, with two more, whom I do not know; I can swear positively to Robson. I kept the pocket book till a person called for it, I cannot say who it was. Nobody said any thing to me, but they all three went into the parlour, and I saw it there on the seat when I went in for the candle, about two minutes after they were gone; they staid about five minutes. I found it on the seat where the other two were sitting whom I did not know. I knew Robson before. The room had been empty an hour.</p>

               <p>I am a soldier in the first regiment of foot-guards. On Friday morning, August 19, I was coming past Johnsons-court, Charing-cross, Cope and Robson were getting out of a hackney coach; they asked me to go in and drink with them at the Mitre, which I did; during that time Cope pulled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140042"/>watch out of his pocket, and said they had made it last night, with a 10 l. Bank note, and nine guineas, among four of them, in the presence of Robson; and they asked me to ride with them to Tower-hill in a coach, and I rode with them to the Savoy, and Robson and Cope got out there, I thought myself in bad company, and went away. It was a green cased watch, and a dent on the inside; I think I should know it again, (looks at it) I really believe it is the same watch. They were both very much in liquor, but I will not positively swear to it; there was nobody in the coach but Robson, Cope, and me.</p>

I asked him to shew it me; he pulled it out of his waistcoat pocket. I asked him, if he had any more of it; he said, he had about 40 or 50 ounces more at home. I asked him where he lived; he said, he lived in Brick-lane, Piccadilly, at one Mr. Carter's. I was going along Duke's-place at this time, coming out of a place of worship. I asked him, how he came by it; he said, he brought it from Birmingham. I told him to stop a little there, and I would fetch a man that would come and buy it of him. He stopped there; and I went, and fetched a constable.</p>
               <p>What became of the silver? - He had it all the while himself. The constable's name is Davis; he took him into custody, and took him to the Compter.</p>

I was going home with him; and when I came to the Poultry, I put him into the compter. When I came to the Poultry, he said, for God's sake let me go, and take the property to yourself; and when he was at the compter, he said, he lodged in Whitecross-street; I forget the name of the court; I went to the house, and his wife was at home; and I asked her, if she knew any thing about her husband having any silver about him; and I learned from her, that he worked for Mr. Bateman, Bunhill-row.</p>

               <p>Last Saturday, the 10th of September, I was in the prisoner's lodging room, in <placeName id="t17910914-30-crimeloc185">Turnmill-street</placeName>

I agreed to go home along with her, to have a night's lodging. I went home with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140045"/>her. I felt my watch and my money in my pocket when I was in the room; I continued there, as long as I can guess at it, I might be there half an hour; and she asked me, whether I should be against giving her half a crown for the night's lodgings. I told her, I could not afford 2 s. 6 d. I thought 2 s. was enough. She got the money out of my pocket, and then went down stairs immediately.</p>
               <p>You felt it in your pocket just before? - I did.</p>
               <p>And you missed it directly afterwards? - I did. I had got my shoes off towards going to bed. I lost her for that night; I put my shoes on again, and went out of the room, and went out into the street, and I met with the watchman, and went to the watch-house, and there I staid all night. The next morning I went home, and put on a fresh coat, and about nine o'clock I saw her come out of the yard into another yard, and I followed her, and catched hold of her, and told her, I would swear she was the woman that robbed me; she said, she was not the woman; that she had a husband, and if he heard what I said, he would murder me. A mob came about, and I gave it up, and told her, if she was not the woman, she was very much like the woman; and presently she called me out of the company, and told me, she wanted to speak to me, and she told me, there was another woman in that neighbourhood very like she, and she would see what she could do in the course of the day, whether she could get my watch or not for me. She went round to a little public-house near Hicks's Hall, and there she told me, if I would meet her at seven o'clock in the evening, she would see what she could do in getting my watch again. She met me there according to her promise, and told me, if I could produce half a guinea, she could produce my watch. I told her, I could not then; but if she would give me liberty, I would try if I could make a friend, to let me have half a guinea, and she promised to meet me again at nine o'clock. I went to the beadle of the night-watch for advice what to do in it, and he told me, I had no occasion to give half a guinea, he would try and get my watch back, and it may be some of my money, for nothing. Presently the girl was in the street, at the beadle's door, and he took her up, and sent for a constable, and I swore to what I lay to her charge; and I am very sure that this is the girl.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you drunk or sober? - I was a little fresh in liquor, but not drunk.</p>
               <p>Had your ever seen her before? - I had not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How can you be sure to remember her person so well? - We had a candle all the time, and I was not drunk; I was with her in the room about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen your watch since? - Yes, she produced the watch that night after she was taken up, in a house where she was taken to; she either produced it, or ordered it to be produced. The man is here who brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you tell me, you was not sure I was the woman? - I always said, I was sure, my dear, you was the woman.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sober now? - Yes; I have had hardly enough to keep body and soul together; I have been obliged to pawn my coat off my back, and my working tools, for support.</p>

               <p>I am beadle of St. Sepulchre's Without; that night the last witness was robbed, he came into our watch-house, and staid all night. In consequence of his description of the woman, we went, I and the constable, and could not find her. About seven or eight in the evening of the next day he called again, and she came by, and I took her up. When she was in my custody, she desired to speak to a woman. I kept her there for three quarters of an hour. We thought it was time to take her to prison. I had occasion to go to the door, and there were two or three fellows about, and I thought that they wanted to pick my pocket, and they put the watch in my pocket, wrapped up in paper. The constable has it.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning I met this man in Cow-cross, in the open street; he tapped me on the shoulder, I turned about, and he said, that he believed he had been in liquor, and had been with me the over night, and he had missed his watch and some money, and that he believed it was me. I told him he was mistaken, I was not the person, and this brought a mob about us; and with that he was frightened, and walked off. He asked me to go a little way with him, and I did; and he said, if I could hear any thing of his watch he would give me half a guinea, and would make me a present for his money. He met me again at seven o'clock, and I told him I had heard nothing of it.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Clarke. On Thursday, the 28th of July, between the hours of seven and nine, Mr. and Mrs. Clarke, a shopman, another apprentice, and myself, were in the shop, a man came in, and said, shopman, your shop is robbed; I immediately jumped over the counter, and ran to the gateway, and perceived the prisoner at the bar walking up the middle of the gateway; our shop is one door from the gateway; our corner is the corner of High Holborn and the corner of Drury-lane. As soon as the prisoner at the bar perceived me following, he stept into a corner of the said gateway, and dropt the piece of printed callico from under his coat (it was out of paper, loose) on the pavement; I saw it fall from under his coat; I took it up, and have kept it ever since. I marked it in the shop D. J. T. 
               <persName id="t17910914-32-person337">
                  Boyd, D. J.<interp inst="t17910914-32-person337" type="given" value="Boyd"/>

             being the private mark what it cost. D. J. was on before, but not my writing; it is Mr. Clarke's own hand-writing. We had only a piece and a half in the house of this pattern, and this is the piece, and the half-piece we have left. I had seen it in the morning, and this happened between the hours of half past seven in the evening, or near eight, as near as I can guess. I am sure this was put up in the morning against the door; I did not put it up, but I saw it. He was committed the next day, as it was too late that day to be examined.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. On the next day, when he was committed, he was committed on suspicion, I observe? - I cannot really say what he was committed on.</p>
               <p>That is not what I ask you; I ask you, whether he was not committed on suspicion for stealing these goods? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>How many people serve in your shop? - Five of us.</p>
               <p>The last you had seen of this piece, was when you had made up your shop for shew in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So there had been twelve hours for these five persons to serve in the shop, and you had not missed any thing till the alarm was given you by the other man, and there is none of the other persons who served in the shop here? - None of them.</p>
               <p>I observe, that is not an uncommon pattern? - I never saw it before, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to stake your credit upon that? - Yes, I will, that I never saw the like pattern before nor since.</p>
               <p>Probably it might have been made on purpose? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Attend, young man; do you mean to say, that you have the smallest conception that that piece and a half was made for your master, and then the blocks were broke? - I do not think that; we had two pieces at first.</p>
               <p>Who had you it of? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>It is rather a favourite pattern for furniture? - It is a very pretty pattern.</p>
               <p>Do you mean then, Sir, now to repeat it, that you do not know there was any more than these two pieces made; would these two pieces be of any value to the manufacturer? - Most certainly not.</p>
               <p>Must you not be certain of that? - Yes, to be sure, I must.</p>
               <p>You have told the learned Judge at first, that the private mark was the hand-writing of your master; will you venture to swear it? - If you will give me leave to look at it, I will tell you. (Looks at it.) I will swear it to be my master's hand-writing. I am so accustomed to his hand, that I can swear it.</p>
               <p>Did you know this man before? - I nenever saw him before in my life, as I know of.</p>
               <p>You are the only person here from your shop? - I am.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Boyd. Which of your masters was it that made this mark? - I have only one master.</p>
               <p>What is his partner's name? - He has none.</p>

My Lord, I have a very good defence; the prosecutrix and I lived in a place together, and I told my mistress I would not live in one house with her; I said she was not a natural woman, and I would not sleep in one bed with her; and so it is through spite that my prosecutrix has taken me up, and brought me here.</p>

               <p>Before he confessed, did you make him any promise? - No, none, directly or indirectly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord hath taken the pains to ask you whether you made any promise to induce him to make this confession, but I being particularly instructed, must press that question at this time a little farther; at this time, a Mr. Carr and Mrs. Hughes were present? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>You believe they were! Did not you say that you went out and asked Mr. Carr to come in? - But then I have my doubts respecting the other person, Mrs. Hughes.</p>
               <p>Try to recollect yourself then, whether she was there? - She was.</p>
               <p>Was a man of the name of Hopkins present? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>I wish to know when you called him up, whether you did not say this to him: "I suppose Ross you know on what business I have called you, and the best recompence you can make is, that you discover the whole, that I may recover my property, and then I will not prosecute you?" - I did in part, but not in the whole.</p>
               <p>What part do you own? - I did not give him any promise that I would not prosecute him or take him up.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not make him the most unqualified promise that you would not prosecute or take him up? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Simpson, having set out that you did not promise directly or indirectly, be so good<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140051"/>to tell what profession you are? - A drawing-master.</p>
               <p>Be so good to recollect your own phrase, how you expressed yourself, the very words.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect, before he said any thing to you, what were the words you made use of to induce him to confess? - I told him, Ross, I hear that you have robbed me, I should be glad if you would let me know how much you have robbed me of; and I think he asked to be forgiven, and said if I would forgive him, he would never do the like again; I likewise asked him where my property was, and he told me.</p>
               <p>But before we get to this, he put one question to you, which was, what did you say to him, as an inducement? - I told him I would be as merciful to him as I could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. After we had got so far, Mr. Tomkins a schoolmaster might come in? - I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Was not this said by Mr. Tomkins to the prisoner, your master has promised exceeding fair, if you will tell what you have done, and where you have sold them, he will not take you up, it is your best way to tell every thing, and I will stand by you, and be your friend? - I believe he might say part, but I did not hear all.</p>
               <p>I will read it to you again, it is not any conjuration of mine, Mr. Simpson? - He did not say that all in my presence.</p>
               <p>What was not said? - He never said in my presence, he would not take him up.</p>
               <p>Well, I will read it to you with that part struck out (Reads it;) do you agree to it now? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court. After this do not tell us any more what the young man said.</p>
               <p>Simpson. I went with the prisoner to the place where he sold the things, apart; I went to St. Giles's, to Mr. Cox, a printseller and bookseller, and found I believe two prints, but I cannot say what they were, there was a drawing also in chalk; I left them there, the two prints, but I brought the chalk drawing away, because I paid for it; I left word also with Mrs. Cox, he being not at home, to desire her husband to lock up the prints he bought of the prisoner: accordingly the next day Mr. Cox came with sundry prints and drawings which he bought of the prisoner, which are in Court; I found they were my property, and sent for an officer, and took the prisoner up, and we went before my Lord Mayor, and there I swore to them.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any suspicion of him before? - No, I cannot say I had any well-grounded one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This lad was bound to you in a regular way, so as to be intitled to his freedom, and had served you between three and four years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He understood his business very well? - He did.</p>
               <p>Have you employed him since he was in custody? - I did since he was in custody, in order to employ his mind.</p>
               <p>I believe it was part of your contract to find the young man with clothes? - It was.</p>
               <p>You performed it, I take it for granted? - I hope I did.</p>
               <p>Then he did not want for any thing? - I do not know that ever he did.</p>
               <p>Had you never any complaints upon this head? - I had one complaint from his father.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - Not a great while ago, five, six, or seven months ago.</p>
               <p>The complaint was, I believe, that he would carry you before the Chamberlian, to make you perform your contract; his father said he wanted shoes and stockings and the like? - His father did, and I said to him, Mr. Ross, I am very sorry you should come to me to ask me for such things as these, when your son has bought himself better things than I wear myself, better hats, and boots he has bought himself at twenty-five shillings a pair.</p>
               <p>On your oath, did not you find that whatever he did take, was to provide himself with clothes? - I did not know it was.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that you always found him; hath any application been made to you to furnish us with the address of a witness present at a conversation in order that we might subpoena her? - Yes, an application<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140052"/>was made, but Mrs. Hughes had been out of town for some days.</p>
               <p>You did not tell where she might be found? - The person would not wait for an answer, but went away immediately.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that the person who brought the subpoena, and anxious for the attendance of the witness, and desirous to know where she might be found, went away without an answer? - He went away without furnishing me with an opportunity of saying where she lived.</p>
               <p>The person that brought the subpoena had two or three in his hand, and he asked for Mrs. Hughes; the reply was no, she does not live here; then he asked where did she live? - He did not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Nor where she was to be found? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you give any information? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you did not say she does not live here, but you may find her at such a place? I had not the least idea of a subpoena.</p>
               <p>She was one of the witnesses present at the no promise made either directly or indirectly.</p>
               <p>- COX sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in High-street, St. Giles's, I deal in prints and books; this young man brought these prints to me, and I bought them, about a fortnight or three weeks before they were found; I gave him about 52 s. for the whole. The first lot he brought he said he had more to sell; I asked him why he did not bring them altogether? He said, he would when he had copied them off; he said he lived in Holborn. I delivered the prints to Mr. Simpson; I attended before the Lord Mayor with the prints.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Bannister, of Bridges-street, salesman; the movement of this watch I received from the prisoner to make new cases, which watch Mr. Heaven's, the prosecutor, claimed. The prisoner gave me no case with it, it was agreed that I should make him a single metal gilt case to this movement, a new dial plate, and cleaning and repairing, all which came to 20 s. He brought it to me on the 10th or 11th, Wednesday or Thursday, and was to receive it on Saturday. He said very likely he should be on guard, and could not come for it. I took a bill of the shop and wrote upon it, the bearer hereof receives this watch by paying the money for it, which was 20 s. A soldier came for it, it was not done. On Monday morning the prisoner came for it himself, I saw him myself on Monday morning; in consequence of some information from Sir Sampson's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140053"/>men I kept the movement afterwards, and detained the prisoner.</p>

I went round to search for the watch, and found it at the house of this witness's master on the day after, which was the 18th, when the movement was produced by the pawnbroker. The prosecutor, in the presence of the prisoner, said, this was his watch, and not only that, but he sent down to Bath after the name and the number. The prosecutor saw these movements, and the prisoner said, when questioned about it at that time, not a single sentence to my knowledge; the prosecutor said, in the presence of the prisoner, it was his.</p>

            , London, No. 23626; I received this slip of paper inclosed in a letter from Bath. I have recovered nothing but the movement, I have no doubt but it is mine.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury, being quartered at Mrs. Watson's, the sister of Mr. Heaven, at the sign of the Angel Inn, my other comrade was getting up about eight on Thursday morning, the 4th of August last, we both came down stairs in the yard together; I said I must go up the yard, I should soon return; I went with intention to go into the common vault, I found it engaged, necessity obliged me to go into the gentleman's vault; upon entering it I perceived on the side a small parcel of fine paper, which contained the movements of a watch and a chain, without a glass or case; I put it in my pocket, having no time to make any enquiry after it, being almost too late for my duty. It continued in my quarters till Friday the 12th of August, no enquiry was made, I naturally imagined it belonged to some traveller that might have slept at the inn; it was not advertised, nor any enquiry made after it; I took it to Mr. Bannister, to have a case made for it, for my own use, and I agreed to give him 1 l. for repairing it; I went into the hospital, in a bad state of health, on Friday the 12th of August, where I continued till Monday the 15th of August, when I was surprized by the Serjeant Smith, belonging to the same company, who said I must get up and go with him to Sir Sampson's Wright's office in Bow-street immediately; I called at Mr. Bannister's, in Bridge-street, to see if the movement was repaired; it was not till the day following. I came strait to Sir Sampson's office, when I was charged with stealing a watch, the property of Mr. Heaven. I was examined, and sent down for further examination; I came up the second time, the movement was produced, which I had taken to Mr. Bannister, but my prosecutor could swear to neither the movement nor the number, till he should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140054"/>write down to Bath. I was five times examined before I was fully committed, and as Parker, the evidence against me, says, he saw me take the watch from one breeches pocket to another, which he was at some distance when he saw me do it; no words passed between us, I did not know he saw it; had I stolen it, or knew it to be stolen, I never would have gone to Mr. Bannister in the neighbourhood to have it repaired for my use. My Lord, I call God to witness what I have said is true.</p>
               <p>Court to prisoner. You found it without glass or case? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there no inside case? - No case at all.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. The chain of this watch I suppose was fixed to the outside case in the common way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And there was a glass I suppose to the outside case? - Yes, there was one case I did not lose; I used to leave it without the outside case.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was a watch with a case and a chain, without the outside case? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever been to this place? - Yes, but not that morning; I cannot recollect taking it out of my pocket, I very rarely did it.</p>
               <p>Might not you leave it there? - Not that I recollect; it is not my custom to do it; if I take it out I put it in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the watch? - Four guineas, or four guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>How long have you had it? - I believe ten years, it is quite an old watch.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Acorn-alley, Bishopsgate-street. I know the young man by sight nigh on two years; I heard the alarm of fire, and begged the prisoner at the bar to go to Taylor's house, and save what he could. Taylor's lodges up two pair of stairs in the same house; I told him. I told him, Bet Taylor's father, Colley's wife, who worked in the same shop with the prisoner at the time; I knew him; and by my mentioning her name, he knew whom I meant. I never heard any any harm by him, nor received any harm from him; he comes from the country; he has worked with my brother-in-law twice, who lives in Angel-alley, Smith's-buildings, No. 4.</p>
               <p>Court. You said, you knew the young man by sight? - Only by working at my brother-in-law's.</p>
               <p>You are sure you told him Taylor lived up two pair of stairs; you did not say the ground, nor the one-pair of stairs? - Neither.</p>
               <p>What time of day was this? - Between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that this was the time you saw him first, between four and five o'clock? - It was.</p>
               <p>But the constable saw him with the bed at three; how long have you known this man? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Then you know him more than by sight? - Yes; he used to come to my room to warp his ribbons.</p>
               <p>Are you particularly acquainted with him, then? - Yes, Sir, so far as that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140056"/>Court to Price. Do you know when the fire began? - About three o'clock, but it did not break out at Taylor's till between four and five.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that you saw him with the bed between three and four? - As near as I can tell, it was.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether it was before Taylor's house was on fire? - I cannot say positively, I was so much confused.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses, to his character, who gave him a very good one.</p>
               <p>The jury went out of Court for seventeen minutes, and returned with a verdict,</p>

On the 27th of July, about ten in the morning, I returned out of my shop into the back kitchen; in about ten minutes I was called out, to know if I had sold a looking-glass; in about two minutes I came out, and saw the prisoner at the bar with the looking-glass in his hand; I pursued him on the opposite side of the way, that he might have no suspicion of me, and that he might not throw the glass down, and break it. When I came level with him, I immediately ran across the way, and stopped him; he then threw down the glass against my legs; it being a gilt frame, and wire ornaments, and it pitching on the back, the glass did not break at all. I was obliged to let go my hold of him, or step through the glass; I let him go, and he ran about ten yards; I pursued him immediately, and called out, Stop thief; and then a man immediately ran before him, and stopped him; the man that stopped him the second time brought him back immediately. I never lost sight of him. He is the man, I can swear positively.</p>

He was to sleep in the one pair of stairs back room, and was to pay two shillings a week, furnished; I found sheets, and every thing. I asked him for a character; he said, he knew nobody in London, and nobody knew him. I said, you look like an honest countryman, I believe you must come. Going down stairs, I asked him his name; he said,

            . About eight o'clock he came to sleep; going up stairs, he asked me, which way he was to get out in the morning, as he should be out before four o'clock, as he had got work at Mr. Pinder's, the stone-mason's, the other side of Fleet-market. That rather surprized me; and I told him to tap at the wainscot, and I would let him out. We had a side door; but I thought it was best for him to tap, as he was a stranger. Between four and five we heard him getting up, as we lay under him. My husband got up to see if he went to Mr. Pinder's; and when he came down, finding he could not get out, he tapt at the wainscot, and my husband went and let him out, and looking after, found he went towards Holborn instead of going the other way. He ran up stairs, and finding the sheet was gone, pursued him.</p>

When the prisoner came down, he went backward to see if that was the way out into the street; but finding it was not, he came in, and tapped at the wainscot. When he tapped at the wainscot, I let him in, and I looked about him to see if I could see any thing that he might take with him; I did not perceive any thing about him, but I let him out. He went the wrong way for Mr. Pinder's; I suspected him by that, and immediately went up stairs, and missed the sheet. I came down, and looked out at the door, and saw him about seventy yards from the house, and I pursued; he did not see me, and he turned up Bagnio-court. I overtook him in about twenty yards up the court; I said, countryman, you have got my sheet; he immediately put his hand into his pocket to give it me; I told him, that would not do for me; he must come along with me; and I took him to the watch-house. Mr. Layton, the constable, searched him before me, and on him was found the sheet, and also a shirt, and a silk cloak.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness, I was left in care of the basket opposite the Talbot; I saw, about three minutes after my husband went, the prisoner at the bar come and look into it, and then for about half an hour walk backward and forward; at last he went to the basket, and took four quartern loaves, and came right across the street, running to the end of the court where I was standing; I had a little child in my hands about two years old, and I got hold of him by the other, and asked him what he was going to do with that bread; he said what was that to me: I told him my husband had given me the care of the basket, and they were my husband's property; with that he gave himself a fling out of my hands, and I ran after him, and cried out stop thief; and he came to the constable's door, and the constable took him into custody; he was never five yards from me, he carried two loaves under one arm, and the other two on the top of them, and his hands upon that.</p>

I went according to his directions, and found the goods pawned at four different pawnbrokers. An acquaintance of mine went with me, and found out three of them; but a fourth we should not have found out, if he had not gone with me, and shewed me the last pawnbroker's himself, or else I should not have found it. He said, he did not know they were my property; he thought they were her own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. How long had this woman been in your service? About fifteen months.</p>
               <p>You know that this case affects her life, if she was guilty, and above fifteen years of age? - She may be under the age of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stavers, I believe you made some offers to the father of this young woman, that if he would have paid you the loss, you would think no more of it? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person in Cree-church-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Hunter in Sugar-loaf-court? - I do.</p>
               <p>I would ask you, whether these persons, or either of them, were not authorized by you to mention to the father, that you would give up the prosecution if a certain sum of money was paid? - I was not seen in it.</p>
               <p>It certainly was most prudent of you not to be seen in it; but how happened it, that these two persons, or either of them, should apply to the father to make up the loss? - I do not know that any body applied.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140061"/>Have you never said on this sort to any body - I only said, it was hard I should lose my property.</p>
               <p>And in consequence of that, might it not happen that you might say, that if the loss was returned, you would think no more of the prosecution? - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>How often did you go to the father's house before she was taken up? - I was twice there.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer to the father, that if your goods were restored, you would not prosecute? - I did not, positively.</p>
               <p>What did you go for? - I only went to tell her father that my goods were lost, and that his daughter was missing.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I live in Northampton-street, Clerkenwell; on Friday the 15th of July I first saw the prisoner with this horse in Smithfield-market; I asked him the price of it, and we did not agree at that time; then on the 20th I saw him again at the Horseshoe-inn, Goswell-street; I bought the horse of him then, and I asked him where he lived; he told me he lived at Edmonton; I asked him how long he had had it, and he said, he had had it ever since May, he had had it for two months, and he had worked him.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him where he had got him? - He said he bought him at Godalmin fair, I gave him six pounds for it, after that I had some reason to suppose that it was a stolen one, and about two hours and an half after, a friend and I went with me to look for the man I had the gelding of; and after two or three hours search, I found him in Portpool-lane, he was just going into the Green man; I told him I was afraid he had not come honestly by the horse; he said he did: then we went to a public-house, and had a pot of beer together, and after some more talk, he would not confess but what he came honestly by it; so at length I charged the watch with him, and the next morning he was brought before Justice Clarke, the magistrate in Clerkenwell, and he was sent back again for re-examination.</p>
               <p>At the time you took him into custody, you had only a general suspicion? - No, only general; at length Mr. Wood came up and swore to the horse, and he was committed for trial.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw him in Smithfield-market.</p>

I had it booked at the toll-book at Godalmin, and I wrote a letter to the toll-keeper, and he sent me an answer, and I gave the letter to Sir Sampson Wright, before I ever opened it, and Sir Sampson Wright has kept it ever since; I sent my mother to Sir Sampson Wright for it yesterday, but she is not yet come back; I have now nobody here.</p>

               <p>Upon the 14th of May, I met Newbank and the prisoner coming from Waltham; I claimed the gelding in question, I was coming out of Smithfield-market on the 13th, on Friday, the day before, I saw the prisoner the top of Fleet-lane, with the gelding in question, he asked me eight guineas for it, I bid him six, but bought it for seven without the saddle or bridle; I had some reasons to suppose it was not found, and told him if he would go to Mr. Paterson's, Fleet-lane, I would pay him there; doubts arising about the soundness of it, I told him I would give him five that night, and two the next morning when he brought the vouchers that it was found; he said he was going to Waltham-abbey fair the next day; I told him I should see him in the morning, and would go with him; in the morning I saw him between seven and eight o'clock; I told him I would go for a hackney, and go and ride with him, and when I came back; he had rode away with the horse, he was not where I left him; at night the horse was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140066"/>put up in the New Inn at the Old Bailey; I had never the horse in my possession, not finding him there, I hired a horse, and went down to Waltham-abbey, and met them coming up to London, and I claimed the gelding, and I sold it at last to Newbank for six guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him where he got the gelding? - He said he lived on the western road, somewhere about Staines, that he had bought the gelding some time ago, and now he had no further use for it; he did not tell me how long before he had bought it, nor from whom.</p>
               <p>He had the five guineas? - He had.</p>
               <p>Was you to try the mare at the fair at Waltham-abbey, to see if it was found? - I was.</p>

               <p>For what purpose was you to go to the fair? - I had other business at the fair, in the horse-dealing line, and there I expected to find a voucher, and it was agreed that he was to go to the fair, when he had the five guineas.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you lost your gelding, why did not you go immediately to the fair? - I did, as soon as I could; I was down in the Old Bailey about eleven, and I met them coming home between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Court. That was late to go to the fair? - It was, but I had forty horses to look after first: I was then in business with Mr. Gregson, at the Bull and Gate Yard in Holborn, he keeps a repository.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear upon your oath that you went to have this gelding vouched? - I did; and I told him I would have nothing more to do with it except it was, and he said when he came there, he would vouch it to me.</p>
               <p>What is the nature of this vouching? - When a horse is sold and vouched, the voucher is taken to the toll-keeper to prove that the person who sells it came honestly by it.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Newbank. I took the gelding to Brentford fair; there it was stopped, and claimed as Mr. Smeath's property. I took it to Mr. Smeath's; I went upon the horse, and he took me home.</p>

               <p>I understood that Palmer bought stolen horses, and I knew that he had once before of another person, and I sold it to him as a stolen horse, and told him all the particulars, and where it came from; and he said, that the horse had got a ball eye, but he would put the eye out, and crop it, and dock it, so that it should not be known. He did not buy of me in Fleet-lane, but in a private stable. The next morning, I goes to him about seven in the morning, and told him, I was going to Waltham fair; says he, if you will take the horse to the fair, and get it booked, and made safe to me, I will give you half a guinea more. He was to give me seven guineas, and he had given me five guineas in part of payment of the horse, and he was to give me two more on Tuesday; with that I took the horse to the fair; he had his horse ready to go to the fair; and he said, he must go and get his horse shooed first, before he could go; and he sent me to the fair. With that I took the horse to the fair; and I suppose it was near to five o'clock before he came to the fair. As to how I came by the horse, I and another man stole it out of the stable.</p>

My sheep were marked with a P. round the face and down the back; I found five of the seven afterwards in Plata's flock, and in the evening I found the other two at the Green Man, in Portpool-lane; they were dressed ready for market, or ready for a butcher's shop to cut up. We found no skin there, I have seen a skin that was one of the two, which Mr. Reed shewed me. The head of one was not taken off, and upon one side the skin and the wool still remained, that was the side where the loop of the P. round the eye; the skin that Reed produced was fitted to it, and made up the whole of the P.</p>

There were a drove of sheep at the door. Colliss said he would toss him for a pint; Plata said he would have a glass of gin; he did so. Malpas and Colliss went out and pulled in two sheep into the passage, and put them backwards into a stable; Plata was in the house at that time; Malpas and Colliss said to Jackson, the landlord, are these the two sheep you bought at Smithfield-market today? Jackson made answer, yes; (I cannot tell whether Plata heard it,) Colliss said marked J. S. Jackson said, yes. I went and looked in backwards about twenty minutes afterwards, and Colliss and Malpas were dressing them. I had often seen Colliss at the Green Man, he was a drover. I saw Plata in the back kitchen, just in the place where they were dressing. Mr. Jackson and his wife are gone away. Plata staid about two minutes after the sheep were dragged in.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Plata. Did not I say you should have half a guinea as a reward that was offered? - No.</p>
               <p>To Pooley. When was he apprehended? - Not till the last day of July session; he surrendered himself.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you offer him half a guinea? - I told him I would satisfy him for his trouble: my sheep got into his drove at Charterhouse-square, I desired him to wait, and he said he would meet me at Clerkenwell-green; I met him there about an hour and an half afterwards, and there were but five instead of seven.</p>

               <p>I had got ninety-six sheep in a lot, and Mr. Pooley had five run into my drove; he came up, and I said if he would let his man go with me he should have them; his man went with me, and he met me in Clerkenwell-green, and he wanted to take one that was not his; I heard he had found his sheep, and I met Mr. Pooley in Newgate-street, and he said he was satisfied with my conduct; I saw bills up about me, and I surrendered myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. I met him in Newgate-street, and he jumped out of a cart, and asked me if I thought he was the man that stole the sheep; I went to the magistrate, and he granted me a warrant, and we could not find him afterwards.</p>

               <p>I work for Mr. Glynn, I never heard any harm of Plata in my life; I was coming out of Smithfield, and I met Mr. Pooley, I cannot tell the day of the month, it was on a Monday; he asked me if those sheep belonged to me; I told him some of them did: he asked me if I would stop them, and I told him I would: Mr. Pooley's man went with us to Clerkenwell-green, and we stopped there, and Mr. Pooley came, and three more people with him, and he took five out of Mr. Harwood's drove, and told them over, and said he was satisfied that there were no more of his sheep in our drove; and he said he would give us a pot of beer next market-day; the boy that was with us was to take Mr. Harwood's sheep to the Small-pox Hospital, Battle-bridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not you know that they are close together? - The boy had the care of the whole flock; the sheep were near Charter-house-square.</p>
               <p>How far was the Green Man in Portpool-lane from Back-hill, where you left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140069"/>the boy? - It might be about two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>How came Plata and you to separate? - I went to Smithfield directly.</p>
               <p>You and Plata, and the boy, went all together to Clerkenwell-green? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had not you been to Back hill before Mr. Pooley came to you at Clerkenwell? - No, we had not.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go? - Along Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>So then from Smithfield bars to Clerkenwell-green, Plata went strait without stopping any where but at the public-house at Clerkenwell-green? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had he never been at the Green Man? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have told us you have known him ten years, and never heard any harm of him before in your life? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He has attended Smithfield-market that time? - I do not know, he was on board a ship.</p>
               <p>He was a fellow servant, you knew him very well? - I never took notice about missing him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, that for the last ten years you have never missed him out of the service of Mr. Harwood, except when he was on board ship? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you never visit him in Newgate? - No, Sir, he might be there for what I know, but I do not know that he was.</p>
               <p>Do not you know, or have not you heard, that he was tried here? - I have heard he was tried here, but not for truth; I do not know when he went away, nor I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>Did you see him from the Wednesday till he surrendered in July? - I do not know what day it was he went away, it was the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Plata. Gentlemen, the day I went into the Green Man was the day before; please to examine the boy.</p>
               <p>Pooley. The man he mentions, my lad, was the person that the prisoner sent to me to tell me he would wait for me on Clerkenwell-green; I do not know where to find him, he has left my service three months.</p>

               <p>I am a sawyer, I came for both the prisoners; they are entire strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What do you shake so for? - I cannot help it; I was in a public-house in Leather-lane, last Monday evening; this woman and another man, Smith I believe he is, came in and told the landlord they had been to find a bill against the two prisoners; the woman asked the landlord if she was to have any reward for prosecuting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140070"/>the two prisoners; she was told that they thought she would, if they were prosecuted; but she said God forbid she should, for she knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Who told her so? - The landlord and the people of the house, and I might when she asked the question; she went towards the bar, and the man Smith came towards the box where I sat, and said, she be damned, she will swear black is white: about two or three minutes after that, I was by the woman herself, and she told me, that this man Smith, was keeping her, what she called in tow, that is, treating her, I suppose, on purpose to make her swear the same that he did; he said the prisoners were both of them dead men, and he would be damned but he would have the reward; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (Cross Examination.) This was last Tuesday? - Last Tuesday about four in the evening.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A sawyer, I work for Mr. Hobbs, right opposite to this public-house.</p>
               <p>You never was in this court before? - Not as a witness.</p>
               <p>No, a witness! no; how long was it since you was here? - Six years, eight years, I was tried here.</p>
               <p>God bless me! what for pray? - Tried, I was arraigned, there was no witness against me.</p>
               <p>What has you arranged for? - A charge of house-breaking.</p>
               <p>God bless me! house breaking! so you did not know either of the prisoners at the bar? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>You went into the house promiscuously? - Promiscuously, no; wilfully; it is a house I go into to get my beer.</p>
               <p>Who did they say they had been finding a bill against? - Plata and Collis, and another man, they mentioned their names.</p>
               <p>And when did you first mention this to any body? - I went to the gaol, and enquired for the prisoners directly, and told them this story.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the landlord? - His name is Bewitt, the sign of the Windmill, Leather-lane.</p>
               <p>Is six years ago the last time you was in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Never in custody since or before? - Not any where.</p>
               <p>Where have you been? - At work in different parts of the town; I have been on board a man of war some time, on board the Latona frigate, part of last summer, Albemarle Bertie was the commander.</p>
               <p>How long was you in Newgate at that time? - You ask me questions nothing tending to what I come upon.</p>
               <p>How long was you in Newgate? - Seven weeks.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - It was the long vacation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Smith. Now, upon the oath you have taken, is what this man has said, true? - No, and please you; it was half past five before I left the Crown Tavern on Clerkenwell-green; I was at that public-house he speaks of, but it was seven or eight, I did not see him there, I do not know the man, I have seen him in Leather-lane.</p>
               <p>Is the account that he has been giving true, in any one part of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Margaret Ford. Is this account, true? Nothing but a falsity, as if I was to say        .</p>
               <p>Did you say that this man was keeping you in       ? - No, Sir, I never saw the man before that I know of.</p>
               <p>Never you any body that you and God forbid you should do it for reward? - No, I never did it, what was said is absolutely false.</p>
               <p>Court to Arnett. You work for Mr. Hobbs now? - Yes, he is a wooder.</p>
               <p>How long is it since your mistress was prosecuted and transported? - It is not that Hobbs.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow (Cross Examination). Who did they talk about persecuting? - Why these here two prisoners.</p>
               <p>What did they call them? - They did not call them by any name, not to me; but they did before, in my hearing; not when he said he would persecute them.</p>

               <p>Do you think it may be Colliss? - It may; I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Who was there? - Mr. Arnett was there, and one Mr. Ball.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Arnett? - I believe about six weeks, to the best of my knowledge; he lodges at the Windmill, and saw for Mr. Hobbs; the landlord's name is Blewitt, or some such name; the landlord was not present then; Arnett and me, and Ball, were there.</p>
               <p>Pray, Mr. Gray, what way of life are you in, if it is not an impertinent question? - I am a porter there, at Mr. Hobbs's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow (Cross Examination). You work for Mr. Hobbs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was watering-time, so that you are sure to the time? - It might be a little before four, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Not a quarter of an hour either way; it is what you call watering-time? - Yes, what we call our tippling time.</p>
               <p>They did not mention the names of the prisoners? - After they mentioned the names of the people, that is, after we mentioned this story, we made it our business, that is, Arnett did, to go to the bar, and write down these names; their names were Plata, Colliss, I think, and Malpas.</p>
               <p>You did not ask the landlord to write it down for you? - No, Arnett wrote it himself at the bar.</p>
               <p>Have you seen that paper to-day? - Yes, I saw it this morning.</p>
               <p>Who shewed it you? - Arnett, of course.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Arnett. Let us look at it.</p>
               <p>(Handed to him.)</p>
               <p>Ball. I have worked for Mr. Hobbs five weeks last Monday; I have known Mr. Arnett, off and on, I suppose, these four years.</p>
               <p>You did not know him when he was in Newgate? - I never knew he was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Smith. Is there a word of truth in what this man has been swearing? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ford. There is no truth in it; for we were not from Hicks's-hall till half after five.</p>
               <p>Court to Pooley. You was with Smith and Ford at the Sessions-house? - To the best of my knowledge, it was past five.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave the Sessions-house? - A little after four; then we went to Mr. Bilson's, the Crown; there we continued, I suppose, till half after five; I am sure it was past five before I parted with these people.</p>
               <p>From the time that you left the Grand-Jury room, till you parted with them at half past five, had Smith and Ford been ever out of your company? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. If I understand you right, you do not deny that you was in the public-house that day? - I was in the public-house, at seven o'clock, which they mentioned, the Windmill.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, being at the public-house at seven o'clock, that none of those witnesses that have been speaking were in that room? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they were not in the room? - Yes, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear that no such people were in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you there any time before seven? - No, only once all the day.</p>
               <p>And you mean, as far as you can swear, that you have no recollection that any of those witnesses were in that house? - No, not that day; I have seen that man, Arnett, before, but not the rest; I have seen him in that public-house, the Windmill, but he never spoke two words to me.</p>
               <p>How far is the Windmill from Clerkenwell-green? - A quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you there before you went to Clerkenwell? - No, that was the first time I was in that house all that day.</p>
               <p>Was that the only time you was in the house that day? - Yes, that was seven o'clock.</p>


               <p>Court to Mrs. Ford. Was you with Smith at the public-house? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140073"/>Was Arnett, or any of the witnesses, there at that time? - Not to my knowledge; they were not in our company; there was no other person in our company; we might be there half an hour; we had a pint of beer, that was all; I do not recollect that any body else was there besides the landlord, or somebody belonging to the house; it was seven o'clock when we were there, and that was the only time we were there; I never was there, except that evening at seven, and since this affair happened: I have known the house a great while; it is not a great way from us.</p>
               <p>Did you see these witnesses in the house that day? - Not to my knowledge; I have seen Arnett backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him in that public-house? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you been at Hicks's-hall before you came to the Windmill? - Yes, we had been there, and staid there with Mr. Payne and Mr. Pooley; we had been examined, and then we went to the Windmill.</p>
               <p>Court to Payne. You attended on Tuesday, with these witnesses, before the Grand Jury? - I did.</p>
               <p>At what time was the bill presented? - I cannot recollect; but, to the best of my remembrance, it was about four o'clock; after I had been called in, I went to the Crown; we went together.</p>
               <p>Did these people continue with you while you were at the Crown? - I took no notice of them; I was the second person that was called, and these witnesses were to go in after me, and I waited for them; they were not out of my sight at all, except while I was in the Grand-Jury room.</p>

               <p>Where did you meet together before you went to Hicks's-hall? - At this public-house, at the Crown, Bilson's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Read. You went before the Grand Jury? - Yes, I met the other witnesses at the Crown.</p>
               <p>What time? - I do not know; about ten in the morning: it was past four when I was called in; I was the last but one that was called in.</p>
               <p>From ten, the time you went, till you was called to the Grand Jury, were Smith and Ford in your company? - Yes, they were, all the time; we went back to the Crown from the Grand Jury; I suppose they might continue in my company some time after.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure to the time? - It was certainly past five.</p>

               <p>Have you any porters employed in your shop? - Many: I went and examined the window; I found it covered with boards, which were quite loose; they could be removed very easily; there were two iron bars across the window; there was room for the prisoner to enter; I think some of the parcels must have been drawn through, as I discovered a rusty nail with a bit of brown paper on it.</p>

               <p>Davis. I think this parcel is the property of Mr. Cadell; I have no doubt of it myself; they were tied up precisely as they are now; they were not sold, on account of being stained.</p>

             are my partners. This man lived with us fifteen months, about two months prior to this, my partner was rendered uneasy. My partner was going out of town, I suspected the prisoner from his caution. I desired my apprentices to watch the prisoner; the 27th he stayed out all night; I went up to his box, and, with the constable, searched his box; we all went up stairs together; I desired the prisoner to open his box, it was locked; he opened it, and in taking it out we found several blocks, we found four parts of half pieces of ribbon, which he confessed were our property; I had not made him any promises. During the time he lived with us I had a very high opinion of him; he said they were our property, but he had never taken any thing else.</p>

            . On Thursday, the 1st of September, I saw his flock in the field safe at five in the afternoon. I went into the field to bring home some lame sheep to dress; I saw no person in the field at that time; I turned the sheep into the house, and dressed them in their feet, and drove them back to the field between five and six. To the best of my knowledge there were 43 in that lot; then I went into another field to look after the rest of the flock. As soon as I entered the second field, I discovered a man lying by the ditch side; I observed him; I went down half-way in the field to ask him what brought him there; when I got down about half the field, he arose from the ditch; there was a stile and a path; he appeared to avoid me; I took a short cut, and met him; when he could not avoid me, he asked which was his way to the Harp, a public house; I directed him to it; he went over the gate as I directed him, but turned, and took a direct contrary way; that man was the prisoner; I am sure of him; I have not the least doubt but that is the man. I saw no more of him that day; I believe it might be between five and six in the evening. About eight I counted my flock, and they were all safe. I saw them again about eight in the morning, I missed eight Lincolnshire wether sheep, marked J. S. the initial letters of Mr. Sellon's name; I marked them; it was a brand mark. I went to Bow-street on Saturday, and then with Crocker to the prisoner's house; I think it was about one, to the best of my knowledge; he lives in Sommers Town, and keeps a butcher's shop; it is about four miles or more from where the sheep were lost. The prisoner was not at home; we were waiting at the public-house; the prisoner passed by, and I shewed him to Crocker as the man that had been in the field, and that I suspected him taking the sheep; I immediately recollected him as such. The constable went out after him, and they two came down, and I saw them go into the prisoner's house, and I went with them to the prisoner's house. There we found a quantity of mutton; three legs, a loin, and a side, but no whole carcases; there were not so many joints as would make a carcase; that was all the mutton we could see. The constable shewed him the search warrant, and asked him where he got the mutton; he refused to tell him; he said, what odds does it make to you where I got it? The constable said, if he would not tell him where he got that mutton, he would take him into custody; that if he bought it at a fair market, he need not be ashamed to tell him; that if he would mention where, he would send a man to enquire. He said, it was nothing to him where he bought it. Then the constable called on me, and we went into his back yard; there we saw something like a sack with something under it; there were under it four paunches, and one skin under it; which skin I opened out, and it was branded with Mr. Sellon's brand; I am sure it was the skin of one of those that were taken away; I have not the least doubt. The constable searched for them. Then the constable opened a door out of the yard, like a little wash-house, there was a fifth paunch behind a tub, and in the tub four skins, making five paunches and five skins. I examined the marks of them; they were all the same marks; I am sure they were all Mr. Sellon's skins, I have not the least doubt. The constable noticed the back window of the parlour made fast, the shutters up, and I believe nailed; it was a very small yard. We came into the house, and demanded the key of the parlour of the prisoner, which we got with some difficulty; we asked him numbers of times; they said, both the prisoner and his wife, I will not give it; that the prisoner repeated more than once, and the wife in his presence. At length one of them gave the key, the constable unlocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140081"/>the door, I went in, and found three sheep alive, with the same brand mark; I can swear positively they were three that Mr. Sellon lost. I had a further mark on one that was alive; on the rump of it there was a large scab; it produces no wool, part on the rump, and part on the tail; that I observed at the time they were bought and brought home, I observed that particular mark.</p>
               <p>That applies only to one? - There were some bits of beef besides, and some lamb, but that I took very little notice of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. The man you believe to be the prisoner you saw between five and six? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you lost sight of him from that time? - I did.</p>
               <p>About eight you counted your flock, and they were all right? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was not till eight o'clock the next morning that you were enabled to ascertain whether you had lost any or not? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner keeps a butcher's shop? - He did then.</p>
               <p>The mutton you saw there was in a good state for butcher's meat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Such meat as butchers would buy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What condition were your sheep in? - Very good condition.</p>
               <p>They were in a condition that would very likely produce such mutton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>HENRY CROCKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the officers of Bow-street, and captain of one of the patroles; in consequence of a warrant from Bow-street, I went with the last witness, Mr. Bennett, to the public-house, and I saw a person pass me whom I did not know; Bennet pointed him out to me, or else it was another butcher said, that is the man: in consequence of that I followed him with another man up the street, I saw him go into another public-house; he was standing at a table, I called him out of the tap-room into a back parlour, I told him he must go home with me to his own house, he seemed to be very much astonished, he wanted to know for what; I did not say much, I did not tell him at that time, I said, I shall not expose you, go home with me, but go and drink your porter; he drank his porter, and came out with me and two others; going along he asked me what I wanted with him to go home; I then told him it was on suspicion of sheep-stealing; I cannot say what he said: when we came to the prisoner's house, Bennett followed me, and I saw some mutton hanging up in the shop; I asked him where he bought that mutton; I believe he said, am I obliged to tell you? I said no honest man, no tradesman would be ashamed to say where he bought his meat; will you, or will you not tell me? he said either, I will not, or I do not chuse; I saw a parlour-door, but would not open it, I demanded the key, that was before I went into the yard, I threatened to break it open, I did not get the key, I said to Sheppard, come with me; I ordered the man to be secured, and in the yard I found one sheepskin, I laid hold of it and spread it, there was a brand mark of J. S. Bennett said it was his master's; I then went into a little place like a washhouse, and in a tub there were four more skins, which Bennett said were his master's, and I believe there were five paunches; I saw a window, and I tried it, and it was fastened; I said immediately to Bennett, there is some of the live sheep here; I immediately went round into the house again, and demanded the key, or I would break open the door; the wife gave me the key; on opening that parlour-door I found three live sheep, they had the same brand mark, which made eight skins of that mark; I found no other live sheep there, nor any other skins; as soon as I went into the house again, to demand that key, I said I am sure there are some of the live sheep there; the prisoner said, yes, there are three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He had not given you that information before, that there were live sheep there? - No.</p>
               <p>Your observation was, there are some of the live sheep there? - Yes; he said there were three.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140082"/>You had called out to the man in whose custody you had left him, to take care of him, for you had found the skins? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The shop had the appearance of a butcher's shop? - Yes, there was mutton, and lamb, and beef.</p>
               <p>The mutton was such as a butcher might sell with credit? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The skins were not in a condition to be produced in court? - I brought them to Bow-street, and they were a nuisance.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am as innocent as any man in the world of depriving my prosecutor of his property, I knew not my way where that gentleman tells you he saw me, I was lost, I met the bailiff, and endeavoured to gain intelligence of him; I had business with Mr. Bell, who was not at home, I went to Hendon, to buy a cart for my use, but being full of customers I returned home, and about ten minutes past ten, a man that I had bought many pounds worth of goods from, came up and called me by my name; I thought I knew his face, I went down to the door, and it was a person that goes by the name of Joe, he fells a deal of goods in Smithfield, but does not employ a proper salesman, and always takes his money himself; he told me he had eight sheep, and would be glad I would buy them of him; I told him it was late in the evening, I could not think any thing about buying them, nor should I know the value; he called me by my name again, and said as they were lame with travelling, he would turn them into my premises, I might kill them at my leisure, he would leave the price entirely to me, and call again the first market-day he came to Smithfield; him and his boy went away, I had not the least idea in the world of their being stolen goods, I killed part of them, the skins were ready to go to the salesman when this gentleman came; Innocent as I was about the matter, I knew nothing about the business, I had not a better place to keep them in than in the little place, a place out of repair; the rest I meant to keep for a future time, for I had not the least idea in the world of their being stolen: I was taken into custody before the man came for the account.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses to his character.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 7th of August, she asked me where I was going; I told her, home; she said, as her husband was not at home I might lay in his bed; she brought me into the lodging, and I asked her what she would have for me to stretch on the bed; she asked me one shilling; I said, I thought sixpence was enough. I gave it her, and laid down on the bed; and the prisoner at the bar came to me, and took my money out of my pocket; I felt her taking the last, and caught hold her of her hand; she cut my pocket through my breeches, and drew my money out of the hole she cut. While I had hold of her, a man stepped into the room, and got hold of me by the collar, and gave her liberty to go off; I kept hold of my money as long as I could, till this man came in, and shoved me out.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes, I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>When she got away, this man pushed me back again, and went out and locked the door; and in about ten minutes he and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140084"/>another woman came and pushed me out. I returned about six in the morning with some other men, and seized the prisoner in bed.</p>

               <p>I am a silversmith and slop-seller. On Thursday evening, I believe three weeks to-morrow, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me to lend some money on the shirt; I told her, I took in no pledges, but I bought outright; with that she asked me, if I would buy it? On this, she took the shirt from under her arm, and opening it, I found it was wringing wet. I told her, it was not her's; she said, her husband was a rigger of a ship, and if I did not like to buy it, to give it her again. I asked her, what she asked for it; she said, three shillings. I told her, I should have liked it better if she had asked three crowns. So I sent out to a neighbour, who is an officer, and we took her to the magistrate's, and I have kept the shirt ever since.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never offered to pledge it; and because I would not take three shillings for it, she sent for a constable. And the way I came by the shirt, a young man met me, and asked me if I would go with him; and he had no money, but he said he would make me a present of that shirt.</p>
               <p>(The shirt deposed to.)</p>

               <p>You could not much doubt what she was? - No, not much; I asked her where she lived, and she said, just by; and being early in the morning, I went with her to a lodging, where the woman of the house asked me a shilling for the bed; I said I will give you a shilling; says I, I do not want any thing of this woman; if you can find her a lodging, I will pay you for it, and she shall have a lodging in any other part of the house; the woman did not seem to say much to what I said, but went up stairs with me; and I took out the money out of my breeches pocket, and put into my stocking, at my knee, and buttoned my breeches up tight, in the presence of the woman; and I took my coat and shoes off, and laid down myself; I fell asleep, and she was in the room; she did not attempt to lay down, or undress herself; I awaked, and I lay awake some time before she offered to go out of the room; I suppose this was in an hour after I had been in the room; seeing her going out of the room, I felt the knee of my breeches, and found the money gone, and my knee-buckle gone; I got up immediately, and laid hold of the woman as she just got the door open, and got out of the room, and calls immediately for a watch; and the landlord came up immediately, and asked what was the matter; and I said, this woman has robbed me, and I will not quit her till the watch comes and takes charge of her; the watchman came, and I gave her into his custody, and put on my coat and shoes to go along with him, and went to the watch-house, and gave charge to the constable: I lost two guineas in gold, and twelve shillings in silver, and my knee-buckle; the woman was searched, and her room, and the knee-buckle was found in her box, but no money.</p>
               <p>This was about two o'clock in the morning; where had you been spending your evening, was you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to go with this woman? - It was early in the morning, and I did not wish to go to disturb the lodging where I lodged.</p>
               <p>You told us you did not know whether she was a woman of the town, at this time; certainly you could have no doubt? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to say that you did not know it? - Because I had not any connexion with her; I went with her for no other view than to get a bed for a night.</p>
               <p>Have you lived in London long? - Yes, almost all my life-time.</p>
               <p>And you did not know where to get a lodging? - Not that time in the morning, at that part of the town.</p>
               <p>You live in Bloomsbury, and you met her in Holborn, therefore it was not a part of the town you did not know? - I did not know of a lodging to go to, without paying an extravagant price for it.</p>
               <p>You did not know what you was to pay for this? - If it had been extravagant, I should not have gone.</p>
               <p>You was perfectly sober, you had been drinking nothing at all? - No more than a pint or two of beer.</p>
               <p>This was past two o'clock? - About two, my lord.</p>
               <p>How long had you been drinking? - From six o'clock, and in that time I might have drank three pints of beer.</p>
               <p>All this at one public-house? - No, not at one; I was at two or three.</p>
               <p>Where was the first? - At six o'clock I went to Cow-lane.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - About an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>What did you drink there? - We drank some porter; there were seven in company, and I dare say we did not drink a pint a-piece: I went from thence to a house in Holborn, the Blue-Boar tap; there there were four or five in company, that were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140089"/>neighbours, and I staid there about the same time, about an hour and half: the next house we went to was the French-horn, in Holborn, a little higher up.</p>
               <p>And it was about nine o'clock when you got there? - About nine, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I did not stay there a vast while; I do not think I was there more than half an hour; that was the last house I was in before I met this woman: when I came out, I went along with a friend a little way up Holborn, and left him there in Holborn.</p>
               <p>You began at six in the evening, and staid an hour and half at the first place, and then got on for another hour and half, and then got to the French-horn, and staid there about half an hour; this brings the time, from when you first set out, to nine or ten o'clock; what did you do with yourself from nine or ten o'clock till two in the morning? - I must have staid a considerable time more than that, a considerable time.</p>
               <p>You must have been drinking much more than what you say? - I do not think I had.</p>
               <p>How came you to run from public-house to public-house? - They are customers of mine, and I called in to ask them how they did; I was not all the time in the public-house, because there was the ground of walking.</p>
               <p>The ground is not a great deal, it is only the length of Holborn; and it was past two in the morning? - Not quite two.</p>
               <p>Your information says past two, between two and three; I wonder how you, a decent man, should go so readily with a woman of that description, between two and three in the morning, and apply to her for a lodging? - It was very wrong, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You might have had a lodging at the Blue-boar, or at the French-horn? - I never lodged at the Boar, nor asked them for a lodging.</p>
               <p>Now recollect, do you mean to state to the jury, that, though you had been at these three houses, you was perfectly sober, and had not drank above three pints of beer? - I do.</p>
               <p>When you got to this lodging, you had some suspicion of this woman, and you put your money in that form because you had some suspicion of the person? - I suspected losing my money somehow or other, and I put it into my knee for safety.</p>
               <p>Where was this? - I believe it is called Church-lane, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>How came you to remain there, if you was sober? - Because I was too late to go home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not he swear at first it was three guineas? - I had three guineas in my pocket, but I found one on the top of the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she on the bed with you at any time? - She never was on the bed to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Are you a married man, or single? - Single.</p>

               <p>What people do you lodge with? - They keep a milk-shop.</p>
               <p>They are up early in the morning? - Yes, as early as four or five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then why did not you go and awake these people? - If I had waited for their hours, they would have been up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness insisted at the justice's that I went to bed with him, which I certainly did; and did not you say, first, that you had lost three guineas and fourteen shillings? - I did at first, but afterwards I did not like to charge her with any more than two guineas and twelve shillings.</p>

               <p>I live in Buckley-street; I am the watchman; I took charge of the woman, after four in the morning; it was to a common lodging-house; the watch-house keeper desired me to search the woman, and I found nothing upon her but a box, and I gave it to the watch-house keeper; the charge was for robbing him; I looked upon him he was sober.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE LUMBLY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am watch-house keeper: at past four o'clock these people were brought to the watch-house; the watchman searched the woman, and found a box, and gave it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140090"/>me; I opened the box with expectation of finding some money, but there was none in; the next morning I went to the justice's, and turned out all the things on a table, and there was a buckle which the prosecutor said was his, and he swore to it. (Produced.) It has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I insisted upon my box, and they put the buckle in; I know nothing about it. (Deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Perhaps this woman awaked you in unbuttoning your knees? - I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up Holborn exactly at four o'clock in the morning, and the prosecutor came by and asked me if I could get him a lodging; I told him I did not know where to get one, but he had better go to the French-horn; and he said he would not go there, it was so dear; and he took me to this house, because it was cheaper; and he paid a shilling for himself, and I asked him to make me a compliment; he said he would afterwards; I went to bed with him, and was about half an hour on the bed with him; and then I asked him again if he would make me a compliment; he said he would not; then I went down stairs, and told the gentleman down stairs I would not stay, because the man would not make me a compliment; he came down too, and said he had lost his coat; he went up stairs again; he came down again, and said he had found his coat; he went up stairs again, and said I had robbed him of his money; I was searched, and there was nothing found upon me but twopence halfpenny and my box of duplicates; and when I complained for want of my tobacco-box at the justice's, then Mr. Walker took that knee-buckle in his hand, and asked me if I knew that; I told him I did not; it was put into the box, but I know nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Do not you think this might be the effect of accident; how many people might be about you? - At least three; it appeared evident there was some such intention, I was very much alarmed; there was no carrriage-passing.</p>

               <p>I am fifteen the 3d of October. On Thursday the 18th of August last, I was at the corner of Rider's-court, Little Newport-street; I heard the cry of stop thief, I went down Newport-street, through Earl's-court, and across Cranbourn-street, into Cranbourn-alley, and not quite in the middle I kicked something before me; I picked it up, it was a watch, with only one case, my father has it, a great many people ran before me; this is the watch that I picked up in the court, and gave to my father; I shewed it to an acquaintance directly, it was between nine and ten at night.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I broke the chain some time before, and mended it with an iron ring; the other case was never found; the case was on in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. You saw this man run on the cry of stop thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to see him push,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140092"/>the prisoner? - No, I did not; when I first saw them the prisoner was, I believe, about two yards before the prosecutor; I did not see him push him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to see my brother, an ostler at the White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly; returning through Leicester-fields, I heard the cry of stop thief in Cranbourn-alley, and saw four men run down a court towards the King's Mews; I stopped, and them two young men came and laid hold of me, and said somebody was robbed, and the gentleman came and accused me, and said I took his watch; I said, young man, consider what you are about; I have no watch; he said you are not the man; I said young man consider you are in liquor; but they do do not speak as they did when before the Justice. I never let my friends know, being innocent.</p>

On the 30th of August I went to his apartment in Webb-square, a front-room, one pair of stairs; I went to shave him, and in the middle of shaving him, a woman came into the room, and said, Mr. Britt, I have a few things to dispose of. Says he, good woman, let me see them. She had a sort of box on her arm, with a string upon it; she asked two shillings; and he said, I will speak to you when the barber has done; and I saw him give her silver and some half-pence; there was a sort of wooden thing that I have seen, some article in the weaving branch; it was like this, but I will not say it is the same. I do not know the name of the woman; I never saw her before or since.</p>
