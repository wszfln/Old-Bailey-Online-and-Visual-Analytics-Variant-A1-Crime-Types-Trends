                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 133). In consequence of Instructions I received, I watched Taylor's house, No. 6, Milton-street, Cripplegate, on a Wednesday evening in Aug., about half past 7 o'clock; he keeps a marine store shop—while I was watching I saw Judge coming up the street, very bulky about his person; he went into Taylor's house; he remained two or three minutes, and then came out, and appeared to be counting some money; he threw up some coin, caught it, spat upon it, and then put it into his pocket—I followed him to No. 15, Bristow-street, Hoxton, where he lives, and next morning I watched him going from there to his employer's, N. 36, Newgate-street—(I was in plain clothes on both occasions)—on that day I saw him again, about a quarter after 1 o'clock, coming out of Taylor's shop again—there was another officer with me—on Thursday evening, about 7 o'clock, I saw Judge come out of Mr. Simcox's, his master's, with a fellow servant—Judge appeared very bulky—I followed them to Moor-lane, where my brother officer, Bull, who was hi plain clothes, joined me—the prisoner and his fellow servant parted company in Moor-lane; we both fol<lb/>lowed the prisoner to Taylor's shop again—he went in, we remained outside about two minutes and a half, and then we went into the shop and saw Judge and Taylor—there is no counter in the shop, but there is a small ledge which projects out about a foot square—Judge was in the act of but<lb/>toning up his trowsers' when we entered—I asked him what he had brought there to sell; he said he had brought nothing to sell, he came to see if he could get a door handle like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he produced to me—I told him that we were two police officers, and that we were convinced that he had come there to sell some carpet; he said he had not—I asked Taylor if he knew Judge, he said that he did not; then he hesitated, and after<lb/>wards said that he had seen him once or twice before; he seemed to study—I asked him, if he had purchased any carpeting of Judge, to produce it; he said that he had not, and that he had not got a bit of carpet in the house; upon that Bull directly went behind Taylor, where the small board projects out, picked up this piece of event (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said, "Here is a piece</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230010"/>
               <p>of carpet; how do you account for this?"—I do not know what Taylor's answer was, but I went round, and said, "You have got more than that?—Taylor said, "Yes; here is another piece," and picked it up himself—I said, "How do you account for this?"—he said, "I bought it of a dealer but I do not know who"—I then took Taylor and Judge into custody—when Judge went into the shop on the first occasion, he presented a bulky appearance, and when he came out he appeared much thinner round the lower part of the stomach.</p>

On Friday evening, 25th Aug., at a little after 7 o'clock, I was in Moor-lane, and received a commu<lb/>nication from Packman, in consequence of which we followed Judge into Milton-street—as he crossed over from a court, I saw that his appearance was very bulky, as if something was put between his trowsers and waistcoat; he went into Taylor's shop—we waited outside about two minutes, then went in and found Judge buttoning up his trowsers, which had what is called a fly front—Packman asked Judge what he had come there to sell; he said, "I have nothing to sell, I came to get a door knob like this"—Packman asked Taylor if he knew Judge; he said, "No," that he had never seen him before; he afterwards said, "I have seen him once or twice before"—Packman had said that we were two police officers—Packman said to Judge, "You have come in to sell some carpet?" he said, "No, I have not"—Packman then said to Taylor, "I want that carpet that you have bought of this man;" Taylor said, "I bought no carpet of him, I have not a bit of carpet in the house"—I said, "I am positive you have, and we must have it"—I then went round and picked this piece of paper up behind Taylor's heels; he was standing just by the doorway of the partition, with his back towards it; it was between the two shops; I could not see it while the conversation was going on, but I saw that Taylor was rather fidgetty and I went and found it, and said to him, "You said just now that you had no carpet in the house; how do you account for this piece?"—he said, "Oh! I bought that of a dealer, I can account for it another time"—</p>

               <p>he did not mention the name of the dealer, nor has he since—he said that he should not account for it any further—I saw Packman bring another piece of carpet from the inner shop—I found on Taylor 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Grove and Sons—I took in a list of goods of which we had warrants; I inquired for the goods which came by the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi>, and Maltby showed me into Grove's warehouse, and showed me some goods—I did not know at that time that it was Grove's warehouse, and not Maltby's; Maltby told me that all the goods in that warehouse were under his charge—I offered to pay the rent, and offered him Bank notes, which he refused to take—I made repeated appli<lb/>cations, unsuccessfully, for the delivery of those goods.</p>

Groves had warehouses on each side of Hagan's wharf—Maltby had the control over the goods in the lower floor of that warehouse where he showed me the goods; there was spelter there, and tin also—the spelter was not subsequently parted with; we have it now—I am quite sure that the spelter pointed out is not what we have our<lb/>selves sold since—there was 1,000 tons of spelter on the lower floor, but none on the wharf.</p>

I expected the money when he came home—he might have accounted to me for the money he received at the next convenient opportunity if I were in town—it has not happened that he has not accounted for several days—it may have been the next morning—he paid me this money when he came home on the Thursday—he said he made 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the hay, and he paid me that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was taken into custody on the Saturday—when I sent the prisoner with the hay I told him if he could not get more than 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, to take it, but not to take less—I did not say I should be satisfied if he brought me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not speak to him at all about the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was not spoken to at all till he was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Stephen Bishop, of No. 11, Red Lion-square; he is a draper and silk mercer. On Monday evening, 17th July, I went to bed about half-past 1 o'clock—I had seen the house fastened at half-past 11 or 12 o'clock—about 7 o'clock on the morning of the 18th my servant spoke to me, and I found that the shop door was open and the street door only on the latch—the back parlour window was open and the blind pinned up, not drawn—there is a door from the shop to the back parlour—the lock of that door had been forced, so that the thieves must have come in at the back window—I missed property to the amount of between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a large amount of silk handkerchiefs were missing—this is one (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>); this is one that I missed—I know it by the corner where the gum ticket was on, and that has been removed, and likewise by its being the outside handkerchief of the piece—the hand<lb/>kerchiefs were in a piece, and this was the outside one—I had folded that piece of handkerchiefs on the Saturday night, and there were two marks down the sides of this one, which I pointed out to the policeman—it was perfectly new, and the marks were fresh—I cannot distinguish those marks so plainly now—they were distinguishable when I saw this handkerchief at the station on the night of the 18th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness, and I live in the house. I have not the least doubt that this is one of my handkerchiefs—I always put a gum ticket on the side of the handkerchiefs, which is an unusual thing; and that has been removed—they are generally pinned on—here is where the ticket has been taken off—when I saw this handker<lb/>chief last it was in a drawer under the counter in my shop, with many others; I do not know how many, I think nearly a whole piece.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am an engraver, of No. 9, Austin-friars. I was at home on the evening of 27th Sept, and about half past 5 o'clock I went up to the third landing, where I saw the prisoner in the act of getting some things out of a box—there were two boxes; one covered with leather, and one tin box—the lid of the leather covered box was taken off and several articles taken out—the leather covered box was on the tin box—there were two bodies of dresses, three towels, a piece of crochet work, two curtains, a piece of needlework, and a silk waistcoat, and, I think, a cloak—they were the property of my father, William Bendall White—I saw the prisoner sitting upon the box; I asked him what he was doing—he said that he wanted Mr. Cook—I could not rightly understand the name—I asked him what he was doing with the box—I understood him to say, "What box?"—I came down stairs; he followed me—I called a young friend, sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—I had been up about thirty-five minutes before; the boxes were then safe—the house is let out in offices, so that any one can get in—there are no offices on the third floor, but a gentleman on the first floor has one of the rooms on that floor—my father is the housekeeper.</p>

I am a newsvendor, living in Cannon-street—the prisoner was in my service from the middle of July—I am not quite sure of the date—he was paid weekly—I remember his coming to me on 9th Sept., at my desk, in the counting house—he told me that his child had been ill, and had died; he wished to bury it well, but was in difficulties, and could not afford it—I knew that he had been out of employ—I then, on the next morning, stated that I would help him—I advanced him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was an arrangement for its repayment; I was to deduct it on Saturday nights—I had a paper, but it has been destroyed; it was an I O U for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be paid half a crown a week—he described the state of his family at that time—he said his wife was near her confinement; he was afraid that anxiety from the child's death would bring it on prematurely—I inquired from day to day for seven or eight days, or about a fortnight, about his wife; he told me that she had been exceedingly ill, and had been confined prematurely—on 28th Sept., he said his wife had died that morning of milk fever—I had previously given him half a sovereign to see Dr. Conquest—on his representation, I arranged for my own doctor to see her—on the morning on which he said she died, he said he did not know how he should bury her—I told him to go and inquire the expense of the funeral, and gave him a sovereign—he afterwards represented the expense—I am not quite sure what it was; I advanced him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to bury her—I advanced the several sums I have mentioned upon his representations, believing they were true—he said his wife was to be buried on the Sunday—I received a letter from the prisoner; I am not quite sure of the date—(<hi rend="italic">A letter, dated Oct.</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">was put in and read: it expressed regret that circumstances had induced the prisoner to tell so great a falsehood, but assured Mr. Dawson that it arose from the want of money; that having told one he, a thousand were obliged to be told to cover it, and that he should be most thankful to resume his duties, and pay his employers all they had advanced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister, practising in this Court, and on the Welsh Circuit. On 18th Sept. last, I was in this Court, in the discharge of my duty; I was sitting in the end seat of the Counsels' table; I had just concluded a case for the prosecution, and was reading another brief—my eyes were directed to the table—I think it was a little before 3 o'clock—the prisoner came up to me—I did not observe him until he was close to me, on the other side of the ledge that forms part of the door of the Counsels, table—he said, "Do you remember Cardiff?"—I then turned my face towards him, and he jerked up something which I after<lb/>wards ascertained to be a pistol, close to my cheek, and fired it—the explo<lb/>sion of the powder made me stagger back for a moment, and I felt a smart rap on the cheek, which I presume was the powder—I do not think there was any wadding—I think it was only the powder; a small circular hole was cut in my cheek by the explosion—the skin was broken.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was that occasioned by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe by the explosion of the powder; it was a hole burnt, as it were, on the right cheek.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230054"/>
               <p>was in court upon the occasion of any trial in which I was engaged, I had no communication with him, either directly or indirectly—I remember in a trial that occurred at those assizes, a person asking for air for a female whom I was examining, who was fainting in the court—Mr. Justice Wil<lb/>liams was presiding in the court at the time—I must slightly correct my last answer—a person suggested that the young woman was fainting; but she herself said that she was not, and did not require air—ray impression is (but I am not certain about that), that it was my learned friend Mr. Grove, who was conducting the case on the other side, who mode the request.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of any application, by whomsoever it was made, to the learned Judge, for air for the witness, did you turn round in an angry manner, either to Mr. Willoughby, or anybody else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; certainly not—I did not by any intimation, or sign, or motion of my body or hand, seek to intimate to the prisoner, or anybody else, any act of indecency on my part, or that of any one else.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here stated that he entirely repudiated the services of Mr. Clarkson, as his Counsel, and had done so before the Magistrate; the defence he was instructed to make being in direct opposition to his instructions. The</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">stated that a similar case had arisen some years since in this Court, where he had been retained by the friends of a prisoner, and in that instance he had been permitted to proceed with the case. The</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you not recollect, during the cross-examination of Miss Howells, when you saw what an interest a gentleman behind her took in the trial, turning round to him and saying, with a violent motion of your arm, "We shall soon come to the <hi rend="italic">rig</hi>?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not—I believe there was some question put, as to whether Miss Howells had slept in a public house, but I cannot now recollect the cross-examination—I think a chair was given to her, under the direction of the learned Judge—I think some gentleman present said, if gentlemen would go more back, it would be better for Miss Howells, or something of that sort—I conclude from what followed, that the persons coming round the witness box did retire, and it was in consequence of something that was said; but I did not hear what it was—I have never been a police reporter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, recollecting that your father-in-law, Mr. Humphreys, wag my legal adviser in 1843 and 1848, did you not about the time that the gentleman said, "If gentlemen would go more back, it would be better for Miss Howells," allude in the clearest manner possible to provocations which I had complained of receiving from my brother, Sir Henry Willoughby, to your father-in-law? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made no allusion to you at Cardiff; for I did not know there was such a person in existence—I did not leave my seat repeatedly during the trial, in order to confer with my attorney and wit<lb/>nesses; I believe I was engaged in the Court from 10 o'clock in the morning till 7 at night without leaving it—Mr. Owen was the attorney in the case, but as well as I remember he was sitting behind me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister. On the afternoon of 18th Sept. last, I was in this Court next to Mr. Giffard, close behind him—I had not observed the prisoner until I saw him close beside Mr. Giffard—I observed him place something by the side of Mr. Giffard's head, saying at the same time, "Do you remember Cardiff?"—I quickly rose from my seat, and I saw a pistol in the prisoner's hands—an explosion took place the instant it was placed at the head of Mr. Giffard, and at the same moment I felt something strike my right cheek, which was towards the prisoner—the prisoner was then laid hold of by some persons who sur<lb/>rounded him while I was stepping over the partition, and Mr. Barnett, the short hand writer, wrested the pistol from his right hand—I observed that Mr. Giffard's right cheek was very much blackened, and the akin was burnt about the size of a small pistol barrel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Will you swear that Mr. Giffard's face was blackened by gunpowder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared to be blackened by gunpowder; prior to the explosion there was no blackness on his cheek—it would depend upon cir<lb/>cumstances, whether the powder would follow the ball—I think it would not necessarily do so; there was something exploded undoubtedly—if the ball struck against the wall of the Court, of course Mr. Giffard's face could not have been pressed by the ball; it may have been pressed by the powder—if the muzzle of the pistol was held at a little distance from the face, I think it quite possible for the explosion to have burnt one side of the whisker.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, who had a number of papers, to which he constantly referred then delivered the following defence:</hi> Gentlemen of the Jury; it is now my painful duty, unassisted by counsel and without any legal help, to call your attention to the defence which I shall make to the charge for which I am indicted; namely, for feloniously and maliciously shooting at and discharging (<hi rend="italic">the primer here suddenly broke off and said, "people seem to be hissing me;" upon being assured that such was not the case, he proceeded</hi>) a loaded pistol at Hardinge Stanley Giffard, with intent to murder him; and before I do so, I implore you to dismiss from your minds whatever you may have heard out of doors, and to weigh carefully and dispassionately all the circumstances bearing upon the question which you are called upon to try, in order that you may arrive at a just and righteous conclusion, as to whether there was that malice prepense in this act which is necessary to constitute the offence of murder; I labour under every possible disadvantage, in as much as this question has been already disposed of within the walls of Newgate. When I first saw Mr. Clarkson on the 18th Sept., I said to him, "Mr. Giffard has invited me to commit, or has unjustly charged me with committing, an unnatural offence;" Mr. Clarkson replied, "It is a delusion, I cannot hear it;" I then observed that the pistols were bought in 1848, for Sir Henry Willoughby; alas, he is my brother (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner requested that ladies might withdraw</hi>), because Sir Henry Willoughby had shown to me * * * *, and I subsequently added that I had banished myself from my country for the last six years, in order to avoid those frightful exhibitions, and still more frightful consequences; not only has Mr. Clarkson treated these my assertions as a delusion, but Mr. Davis, the chaplain of the gaol, as soon as he saw me, insisted that the Court would not allow me to go into any pro<lb/>vocations that I might have received, and brought forward the case of Munro, and then stood behind me, and declared that Mr. Giffard was per<lb/>fectly harmless, holding his arm in a particular manner; he told me that no good could arise from my alluding in public to his provocations and beastialities; and when he left me he stood at the door of my chamber, holding his hand in this manner (<hi rend="italic">raising his arm</hi>), exclaiming two or three times, "<hi rend="italic">bum, bum,"</hi> not connecting the two words with any third; and will you believe it to be possible gentlemen, my case has been prejudged by Mr. Davis on more than one occasion, for on leaving chapel one morning a Fellow prisoner said to me, "Oh, how cruel; his lecture to-day was more like a condemned sermon;" and on that morning he used the word, "Mind," five times in five minutes, stating that murder had been committed by the vicious under a delusion of mind; not satisfied with these allusions, Mr. Davis and Mr. Cope (I blame them not, because they are employed in what they consider to be their duty) have seized the whole of my papers, papers relating to any boyhood, and to my most secret thoughts and most private affairs, those relating to my family as well as all the papers relating to my defence, and have withheld from me three documents, without giving me copies of the same, in order to produce them as evidence against me; and will you believe it possible, after I had subjoined my remarks to the depo<lb/>sitions which were taken before Sir Robert Carden, and placed them in my portmanteau, whilst I was walking in the yard, some one tampered with the lock, the first ward being pressed down upon the second and third; I</p>

               <p>showed it to Mr. Keating, a fellow prisoner, and to Gutteridge and another officer; on the following morning, when we were in chapel, the wards were filed and repaired, so that there was no difficulty in opening the lock; now gentlemen, such tyranny is unpardonable; such a system of espionage is far more suited to the atmosphere of St. Petersburg than to this land of free<lb/>dom to which we belong; and I protest, in the face of God and man, against such cruelties, cruelties which I am sure will not be sanctioned by a British jury, by their lordships, or by the highest personage in this realm; gentle<lb/>men, having premised so far, under the full expectation that you will not allow your better judgment to be biased by anything that may have been advanced by Mr. Clarkson, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Cope, the personal friends of Mr. Humphreys, the father-in-law of Mr. Giffard, I shall now, with the permission of their lordships, go into the circumstances which induced me, alas! to discharge a pistol at the person of Mr. Giffard; I left France this time last year, because I was affected with a chronic diarrhea which might have caused my death, and I was residing in the summer at Clifton for the benefit of my health; I crossed the Bristol Channel in the first week of August, with the intention of seeing the historic castle of Cardiff; upon my arrival in that town I heard that the Courts of Law were sitting, and being very fond of listening to counsel I went to the Town Hall; this was the first time I had appeared in public since my return to this country; the case of Miss Howells <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> Mr. Beynon, was about to commence; it was an action for libel, under the most distressing circumstances; Beynon published to the world that he had seduced Miss Howells, and thought by that publica<lb/>tion to prevent her being united in matrimony to the Rev. Mr. Hughes; Mr. Grove (and I wished much to retain him upon this occasion, but Mr. Sewell, my quondam schoolfellow, told me that he was not come<lb/>atable) was counsel for Miss Howells, Mr. Giffard for Mr. Beynon; during the cross-examination of Miss Howells, Mr. Giffard, seeing what an interest I took in the trial (I was sitting behind him) turned round to me and said, with a violent motion of his arm, "We shall soon come to the <hi rend="italic">rig;"</hi> and then turned abruptly to Miss Howells, and asked her whether she had never slept in a public house, cruelly, as it struck me, connecting that question with the motion of his arm; Miss Howells said, "Do not be so hard, I wish to speak the truth;" when I saw that she was fainting, I suggested that the windows might be opened, and a cup of water given to her; under the direction of the learned Judge, Mr. Justice Wil<lb/>liams, the windows were opened, and a chair was brought for her; a gentle<lb/>man who was standing behind her then said, "If gentlemen go more back, it will be better for Miss Howells," or words to that effect; from that mo<lb/>ment Mr. Giffard commenced every possible outrage against all public decency, and at that nick of time, when it was to be presumed that her "gem of gems" had fallen, Mr. Giffard having previously left the court to confer with the witness Pascoe or the attorney, falls down on the table, and after a short pause—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner here entered into details of alleged indecent gestures and motions on the part of Mr. Giffard and Pascoe</hi>)—I directed Mr. Giffard to state his case against me to the Court, and I appealed to his Lordship; Mr. Giffard continued grinning, and holding his hand in this manner (<hi rend="italic">raising his arm</hi>); and after a short time the black cap, that emblem of death; yes, gentlemen, two black caps, were brought forward; Mr. Gif<lb/>fard then implored my forgiveness, then that of the learned Judge, then that of the Jury, then that of the Magistrates, and then that of the public collectively, and myself individually; I nodded, and said, "No, no;" and I</p>

               <p>submit to you, gentlemen, supposing I state the facts correctly, but only upon that supposition, I submit to you, under the correction of their Lord<lb/>ships, that had I then taken the law into my own hands, this indictment would fall to the ground; I returned to Clifton, intending, if possible, to forget these unpardonable insults; I could not do so; I called upon the celebrated Dr. Simmonds; I told him what had occurred at Cardiff, and what had been the conduct of my eldest brother for many years; he gave me some composing draughts, but I felt as excited as ever, and I told my friends that I would not survive the disgrace that had been heaped upon me by Mr. Giffard; I then went to see the unfortunate Miss Howells, and I told her mother and brother how unwell I had been, and of course what had passed would never be obliterated, and I then left for Chester; the state of my mind in that city will be best described in a letter written by me to Mr. Justice Williams, enclosing certain papers—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner inquired whether h was permitted to read the letter, and was informed by the Lord Chief Baron that he could not</hi>)—his Lordship did not deny the facts to which I called his attention, but expressed his sorrow that he could not afford me any remedy—I therefore resolved to see Mr. Giffard as soon as I possibly could, and therefore I entered this justice hall, alas! with two loaded pistols; and as I informed Sir Robert Carden, the one intended for Mr. Giffard was loaded with a ball, which was too small to be screwed down, and which I thought might fall out, for the ball in another pistol was screwed down with such force as to require to be un keyed by a gunsmith's vice; that pistol, as I told Sir Robert Carden, was intended for another person; I have just observed, that I thought the ball which was in the pistol which was discharged at Mr. Giffard might fall out; that I submit to you did actually take place, if there be any truth in Mr. Giffard's evidence; for what does he say? Mr. Giffard says, "The prisoner pressed (I do not think it could be possible, for where is the ball?) or held close to my face, a pistol which he discharged;" the hand could not have been stained with blood, for the face was not stained; how could it have been? according to the evidence of George Russell, be<lb/>fore Mr. Alderman Finnis, the pistol was directed, and must have been directed, obliquely; the pistol was held some little distance from the face; it never could have burnt one side of the right whisker; he has very little hair on his face; how is it possible that the effect of the explosion was to burn "a small circular hole in the middle of his face, corresponding in size and shape with the calibre of the pistol;" I ask you how is it possible, there being no pressure? because I never could have pressed it against his face, otherwise the ball must have gone into his head; nor could the inside of the mouth have been lacerated; those facts, which are sworn to in order to show that some grievous bodily harm has been done to Mr. Giffard, are, I submit to you, not true, and have been bolstered up by the ingenuity of a very acute special pleader; the evidence of Mr. James Drover Barnett is im<lb/>portant, inasmuch as it goes to show that I did not intend to shoot at Mr. Giffard with the other pistol; "The prisoner," he says, "immediately stepped back," proving to demonstration that George Rutland's further evi<lb/>dence given on the Saturday, and not on the Monday, was not true; Mr. Barnett further says, that the ball was picked up on the floor of the Court, near where the prisoner had been standing, showing that the ball might have fallen from the pistol when jerked up by me, as sworn to by Mr. Giffard; and in that respect flatly contradicting Mr. Giffard's assertion (for no wad<lb/>ding whatever was used in the screw pistol), that his hand and face were stained with blood, and that a circular wound was burnt in the middle of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230062"/>
               <p>his face; does not Mr. Giffard swear to these untruths in order to excite your sympathies?—George Russell swears, "I did not hear what Mr. Clark<lb/>son said to you," and yet we were in a small room, say 15 ft. by 12ft.; "I did not hear him say, "It is a delusion, I cannot assist you;'" on Mon<lb/>day, Sept. 18th, he swore before the Magistrate, as he admitted in that box, "the pistol was held obliquely;" as for saying that I hoped no persons had been injured but Mr. Giffard, when I looked at Mr. Giffard, I saw that he had not been hurt in the least; and according to the evidence of Mr. Barnett I immediately stepped back. The evi<lb/>dence of Mr. Robert Marshall Straight goes to show that the charge of powder was small; I do not think it necessary to quote the passage; you heard him explain it; "I heard an explosion, not so loud as I should expect from a pistol loaded with ball, but certainly louder than an ordinary percussion cap;" if what he afterwards says be true, the evi<lb/>dence of Mr. Giffard falls to the ground; he says, "I distinctly heard some<lb/>thing strike and rattle against"—perhaps the floor; but he says, "Against one of the partitions of the Court;" he further observes, "The ball was not flattened"—another proof that the ball might have fallen out; "and the charge of powder was small." This evidence, coupled with Mr. Barnett's assertion, proves to demonstration that the prisoner did not intend to shoot at Mr. Giffard with the other pistol, as sworn to by that George Rutland; not, be it remembered, on Monday, 18th, but on Saturday, 23rd. Had he not been tampered with, gentlemen, by the family clique?—was it not an afterthought?—was it not a lie, <hi rend="italic">veritas est magna et proevalebit?</hi> Gentle<lb/>men, I have thus attempted to state, very imperfectly, the unhappy circum<lb/>stances which led me to discharge this pistol at Mr. Giffard; I apprehend, with the greatest deference, under the correction of their lordships, that the question in point of law for your consideration is simply this—Was a loaded pistol (recollecting that the ball might have fallen out) fired at Mr. Giffard with the felonious and malicious intent of murdering him, against the statute? I presume, in deep humility, that it will be for you to say—though, alas! I have no law books, nor any assistance whatever—whether that malice prepense, which is necessary to constitute the offence of murder, can be identified with that excited state of mind to which I was goaded on by the atrocious and the grossly beastly conduct of Mr. Giffard, in which excitement I unhappily continued until the pistol was discharged at or near the person of Mr. Giffard? His Lordship will probably say that it is no defence in law whatever the excited state of mind I might have been in, and whatever may have been the provocation; but perhaps there may be extenuating circumstances. If you are of opinion that there is the slightest untruthfulness in anything that I have advanced to-day, then let me be condemned, unpitied. I will say, if that great, that accomplished, that learned Judge, Mr. Justice Williams—if Mr. Grove, if Mr. Mills, if Mr. Llewellyn, will declare that there is the slightest false premise in any of the questions which I have put to-day to Mr. Giffard, then. commit me to Bedlam, that I may pass there the remainder of my days. To use a strong and energetic imprecation, may the flames which may now be burning on the unknown site of Sodom and of Gomorrah scorch me to a cinder, and may I fall, "like Lucifer, never to rise again," never to hope again, in the pit which is without a bottom If, on the other hand, you believe that it was an over-susceptibility of feeling—yes, rather the high-minded chivalry of a Picton, which induced the passing traveller in some poor way to take the part of a sinking maid, who was no less injured by Mr. Giffard than the</p>

               <p>prisoner; and if I endeavoured to exhibit, in the presence of my earthly Judge, a lamb like meekness, rather than the proud and noble bearing of the British lion, when Mr. Giffard attempted to stab his victim to the vitals by falsely insinuating to the Jury that I had been guilty of a crime that ought not to be mentioned—when his beastialities were so crying and so insulting to the Court, that he was summarily sentenced to die by a wise and good man, the learned Mr. Justice Williams; if you believe that, smarting under the greatest provocation that can be imagined, my mind was goaded on in a state of nervous irritability to load the pistol as it was loaded, and then to fire the pistol as it was fired at or near the person of Mr. Giffard; I call upon you, gentlemen, to restore me to my liberty, and to teach the family clique, Mr. Clarkson, Mr. Giffard, Mr. Humphreys (who must naturally feel for his son-in-law), and their personal friends, Mr. Davis and Mr. Cope—to teach Mr. Sewell, my quondam schoolfellow, who offi<lb/>ciously volunteered to serve me, who introduced to me his friend, Mr. Morris, with the repeatedly expressed intention of seeing Mr. Justice Williams and Mr. Groves, and yet who, <hi rend="italic">semper fidelis</hi>, has forsaken me and betrayed me—to teach, I say, this family clique—not forgetting the suborned and perjured witness, George Rutland—to know and to feel that the star of my destiny shall not wax pale, through their dark, their crafty, their tortuous, and their wicked machinations; that the day of his deliverance has arrived to the "prisoner of hope"—to him, who, as far as Cardiff is concerned, has been "more sinned against than sinning;" and that doubtless there is a God whose name is the Lord Jehovah, that judgeth iniquity.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Sailors, Home, in Wells-street, White-chapel. On Monday night, 9th Oct., about 20 minutes past 10 o'clock, I was at a public house in Wellclose-square—I saw the deceased, Tobias Johanneson, there—I knew him—there were between twenty and thirty persons there—they were chiefly foreigners—some of them were women—they were not dancing when I went up—I saw the deceased seated at the table—shortly afterwards I heard a noise and confusion in the room—I heard a cry of "Murder!" and some women's voices—I did not see Johanneson there—I did not see him at any time after that in the room—I saw him at the doctor's; he was then lying on the floor, bleeding—when I was up in the room I was knocked down by a blow at the side of my head, as I was going towards the people who were standing at the end of the room—that was not when I first went in, I had been there about half an hour—it was after I heard the cry of "Murder!"—I could not see what I was knocked down with—I was cut at the side of the head—I do not know whether it was done by a man or a woman—my shipmates came and took me away.</p>

               <p>foreign sailors standing together in the middle of the room—the deceased was one of them, and the prisoner another—the prisoner had been dancing before that, the deceased had not—when I first saw the men, they were talking in a foreign language in the middle of the room—there were six of them; five with the prisoner—after they had been talking together a little while, I saw the deceased strike the prisoner with his fist on the side of the face—the prisoner struck him again—he then stepped two or three steps away from the deceased, went behind a table, and drew a knife from his breast; it was an open knife, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him draw it from his breast, and stab the deceased three or four times in the upper part of his body; his head, I believe—the deceased fell on his knees; the blows were violent ones—the prisoner held the handle of the knife in his hand, with the point downwards—I saw the knife in his hand—I did not hear him say anything—I believe he is a Dane; they were both sailors—I saw Monk go up to the table, and as soon as he went to the table, I saw the prisoner strike him with the knife in the upper part of the body; I cried, "Murder!" and the police came.</p>

               <p>nothing to do with It"—shortly after 1 o'clock, Crossley came—I did not expect any body—I had not seen Crossley before that day—Baker let Crossley in—I was in the hall with him—Crossley looked at me, and Baker said, "I think <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> is all right"—we then proceeded to the pantry, and Baker opened the closet door and showed Crossley the plate belonging to Sir Hyde Parker—he also showed him General Eden's plate chest, which was outside the closet—he did not open the chest, he only showed him the chest, and told him that was General Eden's plate—after Crossley had looked at it, he said, "I think we had better have a bit of dinner first"—we went and had some dinner in the kitchen—Baker said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, this scamp has been in two or three robberies before, and one murder"—Crossley said, "You fool, it was no murder; the man was only shot"—we drank some of this sherry with the dinner, and after dinner we went into the pantry, and the whole of the plate was then weighed by Crossley, Baker, and myself—I took account of the weight as it went on—I believe the weight was 75 lbs.—Baker asked Crossley what he thought the value of it was, and Crossley said he thought about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Baker then suggested giving me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., wishing me to emigrate to New York or America—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, we will give you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you like, at once, as your share, and you can emigrate to New York, or America, or Australia, or where you like"—I said, "No, I will have nothing at all to do with it; I plainly see what your intentions are; you would have me take this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then you will say that I was a thief, and had run away with the plate"—Baker said, "We did not intend you to take it; we only suggested it; if you like you shall have a third part"—I said I would consider; and let them know on the morrow, which was Monday—Crossley was present during the whole of this conversation—the plate was all put back again, and we went back to the kitchen, and resumed the drinking of Sir Hyde Parker's sherry—Crossley stayed till about half past 8 o'clock in the evening; he was then quite drunk—during the weighing of the plate, aqua<lb/>fortis was applied to anything that was doubtful, whether it was silver or not—I purchased the aquafortis from a chemist in the neighbourhood—Baker gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for it—when Crossley was drunk, at half past 8 o'clock in the evening, I took him to Brompton <hi rend="italic">cob</hi> stand—I spoke to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man there, and lie refused to take him—I was in conversation with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man for some time, and I told Crossley, "I will pay this <hi rend="italic">fellow's</hi> fare"—the caiman said, "I am no <hi rend="italic">fellow</hi>, I get my living honestly"—the cabman was offended, and refused to take Crossley—Crossley was not able to stand; he fell down—I picked him up again, and took him on to Knightsbridge cab stand—I there found a less scrupulous cowman, and he took him—I paid his fare to Bermondsey-street, and Crossley gave the cowman his address—when the cabman drove away, I went back to Sir Hyde Parker's house; I found Baker there—Priscilla Abbott had not come home—I think she came home about half past 10 o'clock—the next morning I went with Baker to Crossley's house, in Bermondsey; he keeps a beer shop—he was at home, and we all three went to a public house, at the corner of Tooley-street—I do not remember the name—I had in the course of that morning, before we got to Crossley's house, said to Baker, "I will have nothing at all to do with this affair, Baker, and I would advise you not either;" Baker said, "Tom, I must; for I cannot make my plate right"—I said to him, "That is a bad job"—while we were at this public house in Tooley-street, there was a note written and signed by each of us—I had that note for some time—I am sure I do not know what became of it afterwards; I have</p>

               <p>sent home for it, but they could not find it at home—Baker said at the public house, that the reason he could not carry out the robbery at once, was because he wanted time to get his discharge from the army—he said he could get his discharge on 12th Sept.—it was said that Baker and I were to take a portion of the small plate in our pockets the next day, which was the Tuesday—I had agreed in the note to do so, but previously to that, I had employed a man to take my box from Onslow-square, telling him to be sure to say nothing to Baker, as I intended to go away by the first train the next morning to Bristol—I did not intend to have anything to do with this affair—Baker and I then left Tooley-street, and I went to an office in Austin Friars, to inquire about vessels sailing to America—after making those inquiries, I returned to Onslow-square—I did not sleep there that Monday night, but in a room that Jones had got for me at No. 13, Pond-place, Brompton, where my boxes were, and the next morning I went off by the Great Western, to Bristol—my father lives about twenty-five miles from Bristol—I went afterwards to Cheltenham, and got employment as an omnibus conductor—I returned on 24th Sept. by the night train—what brought me back was a letter which I received from a friend in London—on my arriving on 24th, I went to No. 73, Onslow-square—I found a Mrs. Stone there, who had been a former servant of the family—I made some communication to her, and she and I went to the nearest police station—I there saw Serjeant Whicher, and made a communication to him—I accom<lb/>panied him and another Serjeant the same evening to Crossley's, No. 5, Bermondsey-street—I went in alone, leaving the officers in the street—Crossley was not at home the first time I went—I went a second time, and met him in the street—he said to me, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, how are you? I said, "Quite well, thank you; how are you?"—he said, "I have something to say you;" I said, "I have something to say to you too"—I said, "Of course you have heard of the robbery; have you seen Baker?" he said, "No"—I said, "Well, he has run away with every bit of plate, and they suspect me"—he said, "They cannot do anything with you or me, unless they know about the Sunday job;" I said, "No"—I then said, "I want to go and see General Eden about it; I expect he will come home this evening"—I then went as far as the top of Tooley-street, and got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Cross<lb/>ley said positively that he has not seen Baker since the Sunday—he went with me to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, half way up Tooley-street, and I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which was passing, and went to the top of Tooley-street—I am not certain whether Crossley went up or down the street—when I got to the top, I told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to walk back, as there was somebody I wanted to speak to—I was looking for the officers; I found them, and made a communication to them—I then went home to No. 2, Bury-street, Brompton.</p>

It was by my advice that what was said about money being found at Crossley's house should not be mentioned—I gave notice to the prisoners themselves that that evidence would be mentioned here—I attended the examination at which Ricketts was examined—after he gave his evidence in chief, some questions were put to him by Baker—they were not taken down—I requested Mr. Arnold to have them taken down, but he said it was quite unusual, and he did not like to depart from the ordinary course—the first question I remember his putting was whether Ricketts had not done something to disfigure the plate—Ricketts' answer to that was taken down—another question I remember was, whether he had not borrowed a chisel to break open Sir Hyde Parker's cellar—the answer to that was taken down—another question, and the only other that I remember, was, whether</p>

About a quarter before 3 o'clock in the morning of 17th Sept., I was on duty in Aylesbury-street, which is the street Jerusalem-passage comes into; I beard the smash of glass—I looked down Jerusalem-passage, and "saw the prisoner and two others run from the shutters of No. 20, St. John's-square; I stopped at the top of the passage till they came to the top—I caught at them, but missed them—they all three ran down the Green—I pursued the prisoner, and caught him in Red Lion-street—the others escaped—I told the prisoner he must come back with me—he said very well, he would go back, he had not done anything—I asked him what he ran away for—he said he did not know that he was running for anything particular, he had been running with the other two—they all three came from the shutters of No. 20—I went there, and when I got there I found the bar pressed out in the middle, and one of the shut<lb/>ters pressed over the other—I found these articles on the pavement, and this box was projecting out of the broken pane—I searched the prisoner, and found on him a screwdriver, and a large clasp knife.</p>

On Monday evening, 25th Sept., I was returning from work—I was passing Richmond-road—I saw the prisoner and another man—I was behind them, walking towards Copenhagen-street—I heard the other man say to the prisoner, "Let this one go past; he is an Irishman, let him go past"—the prisoner said, "No, I shall see whether he is an Irishman or not—he asked me whether I was an Irishman—I told him I wanted to go home—he said he should make me say whether I was an Irishman, and with that he struck me a violent blow in the mouth with his fist—I told him I should give him into custody—he said he should give me something to give him in charge for, and he struck me another blow, and ran away down Payne-street—I followed him—he ran into a house—I placed myself in a position opposite the house—I said I should wait till he came out—I saw him again; he ran out of the house with a knife in his hand, and as he came out he said, "You b—r, I shall give you something to give me in charge for",—he ran across the road to me, and as he ran towards me the knife was raised in his right hand—I put up my hand, and he ran with it against me, and the knife cut me in the thumb ball of the left hand; and he struck me at the same time with his fist in my breast, and knocked me down—when he had the knife raised, he came up to me on the run-my thumb bled very much, too much for me—the prisoner then ran into another house—I believe it was No. 34, Payne-street—I placed myself opposite, and in about ten minutes I saw him come out, and saw him come down the steps with a woman—he had not the same dress on that he had when he went into the house—when he went in he had a jacket, and when he came out he had a white smock frock—I followed him till I saw a policeman, and I gave him information—the prisoner saw me speak to the policeman, and ran away—I saw him taken into custody—my thumb was dressed by a surgeon—the prisoner is the same man who came out with the frock, and the same man who struck me with the knife—I am sure of it—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock; near upon 7—it was just dusk—there was plenty of light to see who it was—the prisoner was three parts drank—they were lighting the lamps.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter of Bishopsgate workhouse. The guardians of the East London Union had their usual meetings on Wednesday, 4th Oct., in the board house in Devonshire-street; at these meetings paupers apply for relief—I attend there to keep order—on 4th Oct. the prisoner made an application to the guardians for relief—he asked for a sovereign—the guardians offered him an order to come in the workhouse, which he refused—he became very insolent and told the guardians they were no gentlemen, and wanted to starve the people; that he had been in the work-house before, and had had enough of it—after talking to him some time the</p>

               <p>guardians ordered me to remove him, and he refused to go unless a police constable was brought—I then put my hand on his back very gently, and said, "This won't do, you must go away"—he turned round, and began to strike and kick at me; I closed with him and laid hold of him and he fell on his back, and in that position I got him out of the room—I then let him go; he got on his feet, took a knife from his pocket, and made a plunge at me—it was a small clasp knife, with a black handle, and a sharp point, and it cut through my coat—this is the coat I had on (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I saw him open the knife, and I got back on purpose to avoid it—the knife has gone through the lining, and cut through my trowsers, through both sides of the pocket—it must have been very near to the skin indeed—a man named Mackoy stopped him—other people interfered; I could not see who they were; and assistance also came from the board room—he was removed by a policeman, named Carr.</p>

I do not know him"—the prisoner stepped forward, and said, "It is my husband, you long <hi rend="italic">cow;"</hi> and she said, "You lie, you have his gold watch and chain"—I had said nothing between her calling me a <hi rend="italic">cow</hi>, and her saying that—I said, "Oh, you wicked, false woman, bring your husband to my face!"—she afterwards said, "Well, never mind, let us have some thing to drink," and put her foot on the mat, over the threshold of the door—I had never seen her before—I was standing inside the door; she said to Mr. Bartlett, "Come in"—he said, "Not without this person's permission," or "consent;" I am not certain which—I said, "You will do nothing of the kind;" he then took hold of her arm, and pulled her away—she stood out<lb/>side, using very bad language—she then came back again, and made a blow</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 2nd Oct. I examined the child; he was suffering from phlegmonous erysipelas—that is rather a serious form of erysipelas, it goes beyond the skin, and affects the cellular tissue—there was a slight discoloration on the right side of the chest, apparently where there had been a slight bruise—in my opinion, that bruise was the cause of the erysipelas—I have not had many cases of erysipelas coming from a slight braise, but I consider that the erysipelas was produced by the bruise—it does result from bruises under certain conditions of the atmosphere—in damp weather very trifling causes will give rise to it—I do not know that a bruise on a young child would be more likely to produce erysipelas than on a grown person—the bruise that I saw would be very likely to be produced by a woman's fist; it did not appear to be a severe one—the child got progressively worse, and died on the 7th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion of the body—in my judgment the cause of death was erysipelas, which gave rise to other diseases; it produced inflammation of the pleura, and an infusion of serum into the cavity of the chest—the brain was also affected, from sympathy—it was very highly congested, and its membranes also—there was a little effusion over the surface of the brain, and the ventricles—there was no mark on the head to account for that; the whole of those ap<lb/>pearances would be accounted for by the child receiving a violent blow on the Friday, producing erysipelas, and the erysipelas producing the other symptoms—in my opinion, the blow was the cause of the erysipelas, and the erysipelas gave rise to the other symptoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The proximate cause of death was erysipelas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is no doubt of that—it sometimes arises quite independent of any blow, from the constitution being reduced to a state of debility, and from intem<lb/>perance, exposure, or any previous indisposition—I do not recollect ever seeing erysipelas in a child without a scratch or injury of some kind—I have never seen it produced in a child by cold—I have seen it arise from strain<lb/>ing, or from a scratch, from a bad habit, or scrofulous blood—I did not see the child till Monday—erysipelas had then set in twelve or fifteen hours—it is very uncertain how soon it comes on after the infliction of a blow—if I had been called in on the Saturday, I should have applied a lotion to prevent inflammation of any kind—I did not anticipate erysipelas—a lotion, such as was applied, was very proper under the circumstances—I did not see the child on Sunday, nor did my assistant, as he considered it a trifling case, and of little consequence—I do not know what medicine he ordered; I saw the lotion—the blow itself certainly could not have caused death.</p>

               <p>Hall, and is a legally qualified man—it was a soothing lotion—lead and oil; nothing else—there is a difference between a lotion and an embrocation; a lotion is applied with a piece of rag or lint, and an embrocation is generally rubbed in with the fingers—I do not think that rubbing would be more likely to produce inflammation than laying on a lotion, because the skin was not broken—embrocation is sometimes given for the purpose of excit<lb/>ing action, but that is a stimulating embrocation—if I had seen it myself I might have ordered it in the form of a lotion—I do not think it possible that the erysipelas was superinduced by the rubbing of the embrocation, not with such an embrocation; but with a stimulating embrocation, such as ammonia, it might—the use of rubbing in a cooling embrocation is to assist absorption—probably if I had been there myself, I should have used a lotion, or a fomentation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, and live at No. 5, Tinley-court, Old-street. Last Monday fortnight, about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I went into the Merry Carpenters, in Old-street, and saw the prisoner there, whom I had known when I used to work at the cowkeeper's, in White-yard, Whitecross-street—he did not live there, but he lived in the same yard, and used to knock me about with a stick twice or three times a day—that was five or six years ago, when I was not able to take my own part—I have grown since then; I am now between twenty-three and twenty-four years old, and am bigger and stronger—I said to him, "Are not you the man who used to knock me about with an ash stick, when I used to work at the cowkeeper's?"—he said, "I will do it again"—I then went outside, and finding that he was quite as inclined to fight as I was, I pulled off my coat, to fight—we set to directly, and had two rounds, and at the second round we both went to the ground, and I felt him run some instrument into my arm, just below my shoulder; it cut through my shirt, and my flannel shirt—I said, "He has broken my arm"—there were a goodish many people round; I do not know whether I got up, or was picked up, as I was senseless with pain—I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and examined by a sur<lb/>geon—I still feel the wound, and my arm is in a sling by the surgeon's directions—I was in the hospital a fortnight last Monday, and am an out patient now—I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand.</p>

               <p>on 11th July, and went to the defendant's factory, in Goldsmith-place, Hackney—they have been in the habit of discounting bills with our firm—I believe I saw them both—I stated that I had two bills drawn by them on Fawcett and Parrott, and accepted by them; one at maturity for 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was dishonoured by us; and the other for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not fully due—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—this policy was placed in our hands as a colla<lb/>teral security—one bill only, the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one, was discounted while this policy was in our hands; the other was discounted before it came into our hands—I was requested by the firm to procure, if I possibly could, collateral security; in consequence of which, I had an interview with the defendants just previous to 27th March, 1854—I cannot tell you precisely the date—I requested further security, and I think on the very same day, this policy of the Guarantee Society passed into my hands on behalf of the firm, as collateral security—I cannot recollect what was said; nothing was said about what the bills were for—I am not aware of having communicated with either of them about it after it came into our hands-—they addressed a letter to the Commercial Assurance Society on 27th March—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is a copy of it—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was dated</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th March</hi>, 1854, <hi rend="italic">and was to the Commercial Assurance Society from the defendants, authorizing the pay<lb/>ment of all moneys due to them under the policy of insurance, to Messrs. Harvey and Hudson, bankers, of Norwich, and undertaking to ratify any arrangement that might be so made</hi>)—that was the conclusion of the trans<lb/>action in March—when I came up in July and saw the defendants, I had with me these two bills, and said, "In consequence of the failure of Fawcett and Parrott, these bills become claims on the Society, and I hold them for the purpose of taking them, with one of you gentlemen, to the office, for the purpose of the claim being put in"—I knew the firm of Fawcett and Parrott—they had failed at that time—I am not aware that any claim had been made by the defendants on the society prior to that—Mr. Bateman went with me to the office of the Commercial Credit Assurance Society—I might possibly have waited half an hour before I went with him—when we got there, on my producing these acceptances, Mr. Parker, the manager, required some documents from Bateman, and he gave him a paper written on—I should say that this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, but I cannot swear to it—here is an endorsement of mine on it, but I do not think I ever had it in my hand—Mr. Parker requested Bateman to furnish him with more particulars about Fawcett and Parrott upon the other assignment, which Mr. Bateman did at the time, but I cannot remember what he said—I believe this paper to be in Mr. Wright's writing—Mr. Parker said to Bateman, "I remark that this bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is dated 1st April, but the goods apparently for which the bill is drawn, are dated 15th April"—Bateman said that he had no doubt but that that could be explained, and I think he said that it was probably an error—I do not think Mr. Harvey is here; I do not know where he is—I believe he is bound by recognizance to appear—he was not here some time since—I can speak to his not having been here up to a quarter of an hour ago—I believe he was bound over by the Lord Mayor, but I cannot say—I do not remember whether Mr. Parker asked any further questions of Mr. Bateman, except what I have told you—the inter<lb/>view lasted twenty minutes perhaps—the result of it was that the regular six months' account should be furnished; I believe that the society require an account of the transactions six months previous to the claim—I spoke of that, and Mr. Parker said that it should be furnished and put in in the regular form, to which Bateman agreed—I cannot say, but I believe that</p>

               <p>to the defendants still, as holding their acceptance, they are liable for the bills—if they cannot compel the Guarantee Society to pay, they will be compelled to pay themselves—if Messrs.

I was in partnership with Mr. Parrott—we have had dealings with the defendants—this account, alleging goods to have been supplied to us amounting to upwards of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the course of that year, is not correct—we have not had one portion of the goods which are charged to us after 15th April this year—nothing is correct in the account for goods supplied to us, except 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these two bills are my partner's writing; excepting the balance of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they were for accommodation—the amount of them is 309<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had the misfortune to stop payment in July, and these two bills were dishonoured—I believe that they became due on the occasion of our stopping, but one is not due by the date-—I believe the defendants were at our house on 12th July—I did not see them—I have seen them since our failure—I saw them both together, in the city, in the beginning of July—they gave me some papers, which they said they wished put into my book, or something of that kind—I believe Mr. Wright said that if they were put into our book it would make him all right, and Mr. Bateman said he knew I could do that—I said I would not do it, but did not look at the papers—I told them that I could not meddle with the papers—nothing was said to me about the Assurance Society—Mr. Honey was the accountant of our estate—after he had gone over the books, I saw both the defendants near my house, and told them that he had detected that the account was not for goods—that was a fort<lb/>night or three weeks after I first met them—I do not know what they said, but they were very vexed that their wishes had not been complied with in inserting the account in the books, as they had requested.</p>

On 2nd Oct., I was at the Queen's Arms, Poplar—I saw the prisoner Park there—I had some beer, but not with him; I paid for my own beer—there were other persons there—after I had paid for my bear, I attempted to go away, but Park put his hand against the door, and said, "You can't go out here"—I got out, and went in the back yard—Park fol<lb/>lowed me, and wanted me to pay for a quart of beer for him—I said I would if he would let me alone—I took my purse out of my pocket, and gave him sixpence to let me go—he snatched my purse out of my hand, threw me down, and ran away—I do not know what money I bad in my purse—I had one 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, some half crowns, and some shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am of the firm of Bolton, Smith, and Co., of Bow-churchyard, warehousemen. The prisoner Bannister, who called himself Mortimer, called at our warehouse on 25th May; he stated he was about opening a shop in Drury-lane, and he required goods to stock his shop—I said it was customary for us to have money for the first parcel—he replied his uncle had just died and left him property, and he referred me to Mr. Taylor, in Southampton-street, Bloomsbury—he said the value of the property was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said Mr. Taylor would satisfy me that the property was coming to him—in consequence of that I went to Mr. Taylor, to the address given, Mr. Arthur Taylor, No. 22, Southampton-street, Bloomsbury—he was represented as being a surveyor—I called on Mr. Taylor, and was introduced into his room—it was between the 23rd and 25th of May, that I called on him—(I cannot give the exact date, that Mortimer called—it was from the 23rd to the 25th)—I was introduced into a room where there was a table, and plans, and papers, distributed in a manner that I should suppose any surveyor's office would have—I told him I was come from Mr. Mortimer, who had requested us to let him have some goods as he was opening a shop in Drury-lane—I said, "Should I be safe in allowing Mr. Mortimer to have the goods that he wanted?"—he said he was instructed by Mr. Mortimer to sell property that had been left to him by an uncle, and that in about a month or so he had no doubt he would have the proceeds, and that I should be quite right in trusting him to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he should think the property he was instructed to</p>

               <p>sell, would realise certainly between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we supplied Mortimer with goods; ready made clothing to the amount of between 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I requested that some arrangement might be made about payment after I had seen Taylor—I had said to Taylor, "Suppose I take a bill of Mr. Mortimer on you, will it be right?"—he said, "Make it payable here, and I will see that it is paid"—I said, "A bill on Mortimer at two months"—I af<lb/>terwards took this acceptance (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>); I saw this acceptance written by Mortimer—this other paper is a note to Mr. Taylor, to pay the amount of the bill when due—I asked Mortimer for a note to Mr. Taylor, and he com<lb/>menced writing, and could not—he said he had had the cholera the night before—I said, should I write it, which I did—I wrote the body of the note myself as he was so incapable, and he signed it—I read it to him—what induced me to part with my goods on this occasion, was what Mr. Taylor had said, that he had the property to sell, and that he would see me paid, and Mortimer said something of the same description, before I went to Mr. Taylor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Dupree; I reside at the Grove, Hackney. On the afternoon of 3rd Oct. last I was driving to Wood<lb/>ford—I had come from Hackney, and passed down the Lea-bridge-road—I saw the prisoner near to Higgin-lane, Walthamstow, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, behind a carriage that was standing—I was driving—he was before me—he came up the road—the carriage was in the road—he took a coat from it, and then walked to the footpath—I kept my eyes upon him—he went into Woodford Forest, before you come to Woodford-green, behind some bushes—as soon as I could I got to the carriage, and said to the coachman, "Is there anything gone belonging to the carriage?"—I thought the man had stolen a coat—I saw the lady beckon to the coachman—that convinced me he had robbed the carriage—I rode over to the lady, and told her I saw the man who had gone into the forest steal the coat—I stopped a little while—some persons went into the forest to see if they could meet the prisoner: the gentleman, I believe, belonging to the carriage; I do not know who else—I saw the prisoner again—after the carriage drove off and all</p>

On 3rd Oct. last I drove down to Woodford, in an open carriage—my wife was with me—on my return home, in the afternoon, the carriage was in advance of me—I was walking and my wife was walking with me—I was about 500 yards behind the carriage—I observed a horse and cart in the road—there were two men and two women in it—I have every reason to believe the prisoner was one of them—to the best of my belief, he was; I do not say positively—that was nearly 5 o'clock—I observed a conversation take place between the two men, and the prisoner stepped over the tail of my carriage—my coachman was on the front seat, driving—I saw the man, who I believe to be the prisoner, take a great coat from the seat behind the back of the car<lb/>riage, and place it on his arm—he turned back, and walked towards the cart again, which was coming towards me—the cart was between me and the carriage—he then had the coat with him on his arm—on seeing that, I crossed over the road, so as to place myself in opposition to him, to meet him as he was returning to his cart—when I was within about thirty or forty yards of him, I imagine the man who was behind me must have made some signs to him—the cart was behind—when within forty yards he had the coat, and he jumped from the roadway into the wood—it was the coat</p>

                  </hi> I am single, and live in Griffin-street, Deptford. On the morning of 12th Sept. I was in the churchyard of St. Paul, Deptford, and saw the funeral come in—I stayed till the mourners went away—they had hardly got out of the churchyard gate, before the two prisoners pulled the corpse up by the ropes which they had let it down by—they carried it to another grave, and placed it down head first—I then went and told the child's father—I got back very nigh as soon as he did, and heard the con<lb/>versation between them—M'Kann was very civil, but Rutherford was very impudent.</p>

I was in the churchyard on this day, and saw the funeral of the prosecutor's child—when the mourners had left the ground I saw the two gravediggers fetch the corpse from the grave, put it on the ropes, and carry it to the next grave—I then saw them put it down head first and heels upwards—they were not many minutes putting it into the second grave; two or three minutes—they could not get it in, the grave did not appear large enough at the top, so they had to lower it down head first—I believe they used ropes to lower it into the second grave.</p>

My bakehouse is at the back of the house—there is access to it without going into the house—I have employed the elder prisoner about three months—his employment was about an hour in the morning, to come and assist to set the bread; and occasionally he set the sponge on a Sunday evening—I myself work in the making of the bread—I gave some instructions to the police—on the evening of 8th Oct., I sent for the prisoner to set the sponge—he came about 8 o'clock—he was alone—I saw him come in—his son came about five minutes after him—I was in the house during this time—after some time, information was brought to me that the prisoner was in custody—I went to the bakehouse, and missed some flour from one side of the trough—I cannot swear to the flour—my flour was not unlike that—I suppose the quantity missed to be about 5 quarterns; that would be about 17 lbs.—the quantity in the bag is about 19 lbs.—the bag is not one that I use, and the apron is a thing that I would not send out; they do not belong to me—the value of the flour is about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner had no right to take these things—I never gave him permission—there was no thorough agreement made between him and me; after he had been a month, I asked him what I was to pay him—he asked me what he owed, and I told him about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for bread and flour—he said he was satisfied, if I was—he always sent for bread and flour to the shop—he stayed two months after that, and sent for the flour in the usual way, and I booked those things against him—that amounts to about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had no authority whatever to take flour out of the bakehouse.</p>

                  </hi>, I am Inspector of Police in Her Majesty's Dockyard, at Woolwich. The prisoner has been at work in the Dock-yard as Armourer to the Dockyard Battalion; it was his duty to take care of the arms—on 11th Oct he came up the yard, about half past 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I gave directions that he should be stopped and searched—I saw him stoop down as he went into the office—I followed him, and found a piece of copper bolt in his right hand trowsers pocket—it was about 3 lbs. 10 oz., and had the mark of the broad arrow upon it—I put my hand, and felt something in his right hand trowsers pocket—I said, "This is what I want; take it out"—he took out his spectacle case—I then felt, and it was gone—I said, "Where is it?"—I found it in his hand, in his hat—I said, "Where did you get this?"—he said, "It is all right; it was given me by a man to make a soldering iron of"—I said, "What man?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Where does he belong to?"—he said he did not know—he had no right whatever to take this away—after he was given in charge, I searched a drawer belonging to him, in the Armoury—the drawer was locked—I found the key hanging up in the Armoury—I had some little difficulty in finding it, as well as the key of the shop—I found in that drawer, eight pieces of copper bolt, most of them marked with the broad arrow—I asked the prisoner, in the station, what was in that drawer that was locked, in the shop—he said, "Nothing particular"—I said, "Tell me</p>

               <p>what is in it"—he said, "A parcel of rubbish"—he then said, "There is a pistol"—I said, "Is there any copper?"—he said, "There may be"—I said, "If there is copper, you must have it in charge"—he said, "No"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "When a ship is paying off, the men sometimes are very kind, and they sometimes give me pieces"—He had no right to these bolts, nor had any one a right to take them out of the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenhithe, in Kent, and know the defendants. Martin is a butcher there—Robert Ware works for Martin, and George jobs about—they are both journeymen butchers. On Saturday afternoon, 3rd Sept., I was standing at the corner of pay house, between 4 and 5 o'clock, which commands a full view of the, river—I saw what appeared to be the carcase of a bullock, which a man, named Edward Taylor, was drawing out of the Thames on to the shore, with a horse, on to dry ground, three or four yards from the river—I went up to the spot in four or five minutes—it was a white bullock, and part of one of the horns was sawn off smooth—I do not what that indicates—the defendants were all three there—the Wares were skinning and dressing it, and Margin was standing by—when they were chopping the horns off, I saw a great deal of matter run from the nose—I thought they were merely getting the hide, and went away—I heard Martin tell them to take care is dressing it, for it was too good for dogs' meat, and that he had sold worse meat than that in his shop—in five or ten minutes I heard a rumour—I went back, and found the defendants still there—I asked Martin if they were dressing it to send to London—to the best of my recollection, he said, "I have nothing to do with it"—I said, "It appears that you have; and if you dress that, and send it to London, I shall write to the Lord Mayor about it"—a man named Robins and the people who were helping him, jeered me a great deal, and told me to do as I liked—I went to the corner of my house, away from the crowd, where I could see what was going on—when the dressing was complete, some cloths were brought from Martin's shop by, I believe, his boy—I saw him come out of the shop with them—I could see the shop and the shore too—the boy took them down to where the beast was, and some skewers too—I saw them hang the beast up by three poles, and chop it down the back to divide it—Martin's cart was then brought, without any horse, and the four pieces, it having been cut into quarters, were put into it, in the cloths—it was dragged by the two Wares and other people past my house to the railway station, Martin following—I went in and got a cup of tea, and then went to the station, and met the two Wares coming back with the cart—I did not see anything in it then—I found the same parcels on the platform at the station as I had seen in the cart—there was no direction on them—I then went to Dartford, to get the Inspector of Nuisances—then I went to the Inspector pf Police, who took me to the Inspector of the Board of Health, who said he could not interfere—on the next day, Sunday, I came up to London, by the half past 1 train—I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230132"/>
               <p>direct to the Mansion House; it was then about 3 o'clock, and the Lord Mayor had just gone to church, in state, it being the Thanksgiving Sunday—I mentioned my business, and was directed to the Smithfield station, and Inspector Teague went with me to find the market beadle—I then went back to Greenhithe, and in the course of the evening saw Martin in the parlour of the White Hart—he asked me if I had been to London—I told him I had, respecting the meat—he said, "We shall do you yet; how will it be if the direction is altered? the telegraph is a good thing that way"—I said, "I understand that you have sent your man up to alter the direction, or to get it sent elsewhere"—he said nothing to that—on the next morning; Monday, I saw George Ware, of Greenhithe, and asked him why he was not going to London, because he had told me on Saturday night that he had sent the meat up on his own account, that he would bear all the responsi<lb/>bility of it, and should go to London, and draw the money for it—he said, "There is time enough yet"—it was then about 8 o'clock in the evening—I saw him again, and said, "You are not gone to London yet, George"—he said, "No, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> has gone"—I said, "I thought it was yours, that you took the responsibility"—he said, "No, I only said that to mislead you"—I saw Martin and Robert Ware coming from the station, between 6 and 7 o'clock that night—they had both come from London—Martin said, "A great deal of good you have done, going to London, haven't you? we have sold the meat, and got the money for it; you could not stop it after all"—after that I saw Robert Ware coming out of Martin's shop—he said to me, "A great deal of good you have done; we have sold the meat, and got the money;" and then he said to his wife, who was present, "You take care of that sove<lb/>reign I gave you; I have got some more in my pocket"—I saw Martin again that evening, in the White Hart parlour—he said that the meat was passed by the Inspector of Newgate Market, and he had sold it to a butcher for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that just as they were closing the bargain, an officer came from the Lord Mayor, and said that some old woman had written to the Lord Mayor, and that he, the officer, would like to see the meat first—Martin also said that he had killed worse meat than that, and sold it in Newgate Market—he also said that I had robbed them of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he had been to Mr. Pearson, at Guildhall, to prosecute, and he would spend 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before it should be dropped.</p>

               <p>twelve years ago—I was discharged from that, not for doing wrong, but something perfectly right—they appoint a high constable every year if they like; they do not discharge any of them, but they appoint another in their room—they did not discharge me—no complaint, that I know of, was made against me—there was a complaint of my appropriating money, but I was honourably acquitted without the Chairman summing up—it was only made by four parishes—there are five parishes that might have complained, but the fifth could not, because they did not pay me the money; if they had, they would hare complained the same as the others did—I do not consider there to have been any complaint against me, as it was done out of spite—I was not imprisoned at all for it—I have been imprisoned for contempt of Court and for debt too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Forrester, a coal-merchant, of Greenhithe, and have been so twenty-six years. On Saturday afternoon, the last day of September, I saw the dead body of an animal drawn out of the river on to the shore—I saw the defendants there—Robert and George Ware cut the fore feet off and Robert Ware cut the bullock's throat—I cannot say what quantity of blood came, but there was no living blood; it was black as far as I could see—the skin was taken about half off, while I was there—I saw Robert Ware cut part of the skull off—Martin was there, and said he would have it taken down to the slaughter house, dressed, and sent to London, and be would give them a note where to send it to—I said, "Martin, I will not have any more beef steaks out of your shop;" but that was only a joke, and I went away to my employment—I saw Mr. Fulljames there—I was there perhaps half an hour—Martin was there all the time I was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boatman and waterman at Greenhithe.

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of meat at New-gate-market. On Monday morning, 2nd Oct" about hall-past 6 o'clock, I went to Mr. Webb's, and saw two fore quarters hanging up, and two hind quarters lying down—I examined them—they were in a very bad state, stinking, and not fit for human food—I said, "This meat has been smothered on board; it has not been killed at all in any shape whatever"—I had heard from the Lord Mayor that there was a beast coming up from Green-hithe, but I knew from the appearance of this that it had been smothered; I will be blindfolded and tell you, without seeing the lungs or any part of it—this had been trampled upon and bruised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the sign on the haunch of a bullock, which shows that it has been smothered, supposing it not to have been trampled upon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would look very wet and damp—seeing the state that this meat was in at 7 o'clock on Monday morning, it could not have been in a perfectly sweet condition on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Have you not known fresh meat to turn green in twelve hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from thunder and lightning; from lightning in particular it will turn green in six hours—fresh meat will not turn green in twelve hours by the action of heat alone, without thunder or lightning—it was</p>

               <p>rather <hi rend="italic">muggy</hi> weather, and the meat would not improve by lying at the Bricklayer's Arms from Saturday night to Monday morning—it is my duty to visit the market at 5 o'clock or a quarter past, and I am sorry to say that I have taken away 136 quarters of beef in the last six weeks, with the lung disease, and mutton as well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, practising occasionally in the County Court, at Lambeth. I was instructed by Mr. Couling to appear for him in this action—I was instructed on the same day, when he came into Court—I remember Mrs. Henley being sworn, and this document being put into her hand—after she had made her statement, I cross-examined her—I asked her whether that was the signature of the deceased, George Bennett—I think I put another paper over part of it, or doubled it over, so as only to show the signature and the figures, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not let her see the body of the document on the first occasion—she said she did not think or believe that it was his signature—I believe she said she believed it was not—I then showed her the whole of the document, reminded her that she was upon her oath, and I asked her whether she would positively undertake to swear that it was not his handwriting—she said, "I will"—the Judge also, I believe, at the time cautioned her, and said he should take a note of her evidence—he appeared to write, and I believe he did—I asked her whether she had seen the deceased write, and she said she had, frequently—I then asked her whether she would undertake to swear whether she knew whose handwriting that was, still keeping the receipt before her—she said she could not—I asked her whether it was like the deceased George Bennett's—she said it was not—I then asked her whether she had heard from the deceased that Couling, the then defendant, had paid the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time—she said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230137"/>
               <p>she had not, and she was sure he had not paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or she had called on him, and he had promised to pay her—I then asked her whether she was present with the deceased when he had borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on a Saturday night, stating that it was for the purpose of getting a joint of meat—she said she did not remember it, and she was sure he never had it—I pressed her upon that, and believe that was the last question I put, and she still denied all knowledge of it—the question I asked her was, whether she would persist in swearing that she was not with him on the Saturday night when he had the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to purchase the joint of meat, and she said, "I will"—I believe the date of borrowing the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was mentioned—I have no memo<lb/>randum of my questions—several documents were handed to the Judge in the course of the case, and I believe these now produced are the same—they were impounded by order of the Judge.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230138"/>
               <p>whether he told me so—I do not know whose writing the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is at the bottom—I have no belief about that—I do not believe that Mr. Couling told me whose it was—I simply cross-examined as to the signature of George Bennett—I called Couling as a witness, and put this into his hands—I did not hear him swear that this 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in his handwriting—now I come to refresh my memory, I think he did swear that the body of the receipt was his handwriting—I am now quite certain that it is his writing—of course I believed him—I then asked the defendant, "Have you not heard from the deceased that Couling paid the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—she said, "I have not;" she said nothing more than that—I then asked her whether she was not present when the deceased, Bennett, borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the purpose of getting a joint of meat on the Saturday night; she said she was not, and she was sure he never had it—I will pledge myself to the accuracy of the words as nearly as possible—the words I used to her were, "Do you re<lb/>member being present when the deceased, Bennett, borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Couling, for the purpose of getting a joint of meat on a Saturday night?" and her answer was, "I do not; and he never had it"—I am an attorney—I am not certificated this year—I decline to answer the question whether I was practising in the County Court without a certificate.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After this affair of the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., did you at all see Mr. Ben<lb/>nett again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw him after that—he died on 18th April—he did not, between 25th March and 18th April, make any application to me for the balance of the rent that was due—after his death, Mr. Lyons, the broker, applied to me for the rent on behalf of Miss Henley; that was somewhere about the latter end of June—I showed him the receipt, and offered to pay the balance—Miss Henley herself applied to me; I think it must have been five or six days afterwards, it must have been at the latter end of April—she said she had called for the rent; she had understood from the broker that I had a receipt, and she should like to see it; she knew Mr. Bennett's handwriting—I said, "Very well, I will show it to you; I have left 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance of the quarter's rent, several days for you; but I have been called on by Mr. Grove, for two years' property taxes, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I produced the receipts to her, together with the receipts for the hurdles, and the receipt for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which Mr. Bennett had had of me—the balance of the rent, deducting the taxes, was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., putting the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the question—I produced to her the same receipts that I had produced to the broker—she said she knew Mr. Bennett's handwriting, but she knew nothing about the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I produced this receipt to her, and she looked at it for some time; the date of it is 20th Feb.—I then said to her, "Then possibly if you know nothing about that, you know nothing about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I lent Mr. Ben<lb/>nett, in your presence, to buy the meat;" and her reply was, "Oh, yes! I know that"—(I had particularly requested Mr. Lyons to ask her that, when he called for the rent)—that was all that passed with her—she said she should not take the balance then, that I should hear from her again—I offered her the balance, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was not including the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the hurdles; that was a different transaction—Mr. Bennett had told me that he had got some hurdles which would just suit the front of my place, and I agreed to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and half a crown for the cartage, and I paid him that 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the presence of Sharland—I never saw Miss Henley any more until the summons came—I was present in the County Court when she was exa<lb/>mined—I saw the receipt put into her hands, and heard her asked questions about the handwriting of George Bennett—after looking at it some time, she said she did not believe that it was his—I stood behind my solicitor, and I said, "Ask her positively, she is on her oath;" and he did so, by my direc<lb/>tion—I think, to the best of my recollection, he said, "Your believing is out of the question: you are upon your oath; do you swear it is not?" and she said, I do"—I told my solicitor to be particular in asking her if she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230143"/>
               <p>recollected anything about my giving Mr. Bennett 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in her presence, to buy a joint of meat—by my direction he put that question to her, and she said, "No"—he then said, "Do you swear that also?" and she said, "Yes, I do"—I think his words were, "Do you positively swear that also?" and she said, "I do"—nothing more was said about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was when she called at my house for the rent, that I told her about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was at the latter end of April.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into Court, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I did that because I had no receipt, and from her summoning me for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after seeing Mr. Bennett's receipt, I thought she would deny the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because I had no receipt—I went into the house in July, but I had to pay a quarter's rent previous to June, because the house was locked up, and the man had gone away, leaving a quarter's rent due—I paid it; it might be six weeks after—I was much better off in Feb., and was able to advance the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my landlord—I would always do so if I had it—I was prudent enough to take a receipt—I have three ink bottles at my place; there may have been different sorts of ink in them; that I think would account for the different colour of the ink—I bought two bottles the other day, and tried them both—I think that I used one bottle, and he the other—there are three or four pens—I took the paper on which the receipt was written, from the desk; it was lying there when I went in with Mr. Bennett—I did not tear it from any other piece of paper—I took it up and wrote a receipt on it; there was no stamp on it when I took it up; I put it on before I wrote it—I did not make a third line of the receipt, instead of over it, because I have heard that you must disfigure the-stamp—that is the reason I put the date on it—I did it on purpose—I understood that I was bound to do so—I never wrote any receipt for Mr. Bennett before—I believe that there will be plenty of proof that he was a very good writer—I wished him to write the receipt, but when I came to inquire, I found he was in the habit of doing it with tenants and ail manner of persons—I did not begin with the date, I put the date on as I wrote it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at it; did you put the date after you had written the remainder of the receipt, or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I put it after I wrote the words, "Rent due, March—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for hurdles;" and then I think I put "Feb. 20."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you see that "11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for hurdles," is written over the stamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is written along the line; I thought it would be quite proper to put the date on the stamp—I saw the attorney hand this paper to Mrs. Henley; he doubled it down in my presence—I applied for anew trial, but did not get it—I produced an affidavit of my wife, and one of my own also—on the trial I swore that, to the best of my belief, I could not recollect that anybody was present when the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, and that I did not believe that anybody was present when Bennett signed the receipt—my wife is here now—having failed in obtaining a new trial, I paid the money—an execution was put in on my goods, but I paid it—I never declared that the goods belonged to some<lb/>body else—I did represent that part of them belonged to Mr. Rutland; I thought you asked me about the whole of the goods—it was not with a view to prevent their being seized in discharge of this claim, certainly not; I have got 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property on the premises independent of that—I mean to represent that Mr. Rutland did not claim the whole of the pro<lb/>perty on my premises—there was an interpleader action, and the case was to come on for trial at the County Court—it was not until then that the money was paid in by Mr. Rutland—Mr. Collier saw Mr. Rutland for Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230144"/>
               <p>Bickley, as his attorney—Mr. Bickley is my attorney now; Mr. Collier is his clerk—I do not know whether Mr. Rutland had claimed too much the officer will know that—they were not seized for Mr. Rutland, but I owed him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had borrowed of him five years ago, to furnish a house which I had taken in the Brixton-road—I do not know whether Mr. Rutland would have taken such a little as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he was good enough to be my referee to Mr. Bennett—I have got 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property to pay it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why was my client obliged to go to the Court? why did not you pay it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I thought it was an illegal thing, and I did not wish to pay it without being forced—the seizure did not satisfy me that this woman's claim was right—I paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver for the hurdles; I paid it all at the same time, in a public house called the Black Prince; I think it must have been in the beginning of Feb., about the 6th or 7th—I had the hurdles about a week before; I do not mean Feb. in this year; it must have been in Dec. last year; I swear that—I paid them within a week of having them; I paid for them in Dec. last year, if I had them last year—it must have been Feb. 1854, that I had them—I will swear that it was not Feb 1853, and that I did not have them in Dec. 1852; it was after I had taken possession of the house, which I had not done at that date—I paid for them about the 7th or 8th Feb., and took no receipt—I paid for them all at the same time—I have had no other bill of sale existing; I am sure about that—I have had one distress in my house before; it was from Mr. Crockley, a hay salesman for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I proved that the clover was thrown on the dung hill—the order was given to pay the money at a certain time, and I paid it; there was no execution there—it is ten or twelve months ago—no little inconveniences have arisen on the subject of the poor's rates, nor has any execution been put in for any rates whatever—I have lived in the parish forty years, and there is not a rate collector but would take my word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a householder in the parish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Forty years on and off; during that time I have never had any distress for rates or taxes—I set up a defence that the clover was bad, but I had not given notice, owing to the neglect, of a horse keeper; the Judge would not allow any costs, because he said I was loser enough—the execution which I resisted was put in by the woman at the bar; it was her claim as executrix of the late George Bennett, and I resisted it in every way I could, considering it illegal—here is the receipt for tithes, which I have been called upon to pay—Mr. Rutland has advanced me money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he got a bill of sale on some, of your property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sold them to him—a portion of his property was seized under this execution; that is what I declared to be Mr. Rutland's property—I did not declare my own property to be anybody else's, to avoid a debt—I acted under legal advice in resisting this execution, and found that I bad to pay for it pretty highly, and for this prosecution also, and all out of my own pocket—the debt to Mr. Rutland was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property; I have two omni-buses, and twenty horses—it was the household furniture that I assigned to Mr. Rutland, but only about half of it—I did not know Mr. Bennett in 1852—the payment for the hurdles, was made before the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced—the payment of the hurdles at the Black Prince was made in the presence of a person named Sharland—excepting the execution I have mentioned, and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I defended, no claims for money has been made upon me—I have been twenty years an omnibus proprietor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it, if you had all the property on your premises, that Mr. Rutland had to pay this debt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was put in his name, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230145"/>
               <p>he paid the money; he was the claimant—he did not claim the whole of my property, only such things as were seized—I thought that the woman had acted badly, and I did not feel anxious to pay Mr. Bennett.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any reason to put Mr. Rutland to inconvenience in having his things taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not at home when the men came—I came into the premises in July (<hi rend="italic">looking at a receipt</hi>)—I had to pay back rent—this receipt is for rent due in March—I was there six weeks before I paid any rent—there was half a years rent due in June—I paid in June the rent due at March; I paid it before I went into the premises—I have been in the habit of advancing money to Mr. Bennett since I have got the place repaired—I have gone to people two or three miles off, to stop executions being put into his place—this receipt is for rent due up to Christmas; 1853—Mr. Bennett has been obliged to press me for payment—up to this time I had not been in the habit of paying my rent in advance—I have a niece of the name of Thyrza Knight, and when I came home from the County Court, at the end of April, she said, "Uncle, I heard her admit about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she did not go with me to the County Court, but the second time; when I moved for the new trial, she was present, and when I came home she said, "Uncle, I heard her acknowledge about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On 20th Feb. I was present when he paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. George Bennett—I was ill at the time, and was sitting on the sofa—I took no part in the payment, but I saw the money paid by my husband to Mr. Bennett—I distinctly saw Bennett write something, and I saw the paper after it was written.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230146"/>
               <p>wanted to get paid before it was due a great many times, and one time he succeeded—I cannot say how soon after the knock Bennett came in; I was too ill to know anything—he would walk into the stable as though the place was his own—when Bennett came in, the first thing he said was, "Now I hope you will not disappoint me; you will let me have this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—my husband said, "It is all right, Bennett; here it is"—there were four sovereigns and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—it came out of my husband's pocket—I saw that distinctly, because I thought it was very foolish of my husband to pay money on account, and I said so to him the very same evening, when he came home—of course he knew that I saw it paid—the file was in a cupboard—I was well enough to get up and put this receipt on the file.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 134, Blackfriars-road. On Friday, 13th Oct., about half past 9 o'clock in the evening, I was in the Borough-road, carrying a basket of bread—I had a silver chain; the chain was round my neck, and through my top button hole, out into my pocket—at the end of the chain there was a padlock—I do not wear a watch at night—as I was going along, I felt a blow upon my forehead; it was given me by the prisoner—it made me rather bad, and knocked me right down upon the ground—after that blow, three men held me, while the prisoner took my chain—I saw him four times before I was knocked down—I saw him first coming home with my father, and then going for the bread, and then coming back again, and once before that—I saw him at the time I was struck, before I was knocked down—I saw him after I was down, and I saw him get up—after I was down, I saw him doing something to my chain; I could not tell that he broke it—it seemed to come out by a pull from him—it is broken—when that was done, they ran away across the road, and I ran after the prisoner, to look at him—I saw something in his hand like that (<hi rend="italic">part of a chain</hi>)—I have half of the chain; the duplicate half is</p>

               <p>missing—the half in my hand was left on my person, after I had been assaulted—what the prisoner had in his hand resembled my chain—he made his escape at that time—the three other men did not run; they walked to the Swan, till they saw me going to my house, and I saw no more of them; that was after I had been so ill-treated—I have no doubt that the prisoner is one of the four men who so ill-treated me—it seemed a heavy blow—I was told that it was with a life preserver—there was quite a little hole in my head—I found blood all about my hands; I cannot say whether it came from my forehead or not—I had no blow before that—I went to a surgeon, Mr. Edmonds; he looked at my head—it was he who said he thought it was done with a life preserver.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the shop, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the evening—he came for some pills—he gave me a sixpence, and left the shop—I put the sixpence into the desk, where there was no other silver—I looked at it again about two hours afterwards, and found it was bad—I kept it locked in the desk from the 2nd to 4th Oct.—on the 4th the prisoner came again for some Epsom salts—I knew him directly he came in—he gave me a shilling—I tried it, and it was bad—I went round the counter, and endeavoured to detain the prisoner, but he struggled and got out of the shop—I kept the shilling in my hand, and put it into the desk with the sixpence—I gave them both to the officer on 5th Oct.</p>
