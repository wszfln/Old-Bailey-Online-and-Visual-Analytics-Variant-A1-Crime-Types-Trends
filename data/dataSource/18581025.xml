                  </hi>. I live at 16 1/2, Emmett-street, Poplar—I am a clothier—I don't particularly deal in old coins, but we take more foreign money than we do English. On the morning of 20th August I came down about a quarter before 7 o'clock—I had gone to bed about a quarter or twenty minutes before 12 the night before—I sleep on the premises—I came down to turn off the gas—I locked the front entrance to my warehouse securely myself—the back door was locked by a young woman. On coming down in the morning, I found my counting-house all in disorder—my desk was removed; one of the sea-chests was opened, and all the foreign coin was gone—it consisted of coins of different nations; there was a coin of Henry</p>

               <p>the Fifth, six Mexican sun dollars; there were Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, Prussian, and other coins—I lost about 200 as near as I can tell—I have since seen about thirty of them; they were placed in a sea-chest and locked in—I had always been in the habit of keeping these coins in that chest—there were sixteen other sea-chests beside that one—Thomas Lovesay was in my service from ten to twelve months, but not at the time of the burglary—he had an opportunity of knowing where these moneys were kept, because he was employed by me to take out English money—he always saw me take it from the sea-chest—I think he left me early in June this year—I also lost some India silk handkerchiefs, and a red check Baltic shirt, and about fourteen spun silk handkerchiefs, that is a mixture of silk and cotton, and a silk lawn cap—I did not miss the cap till afterwards; when it was shown to me I immediately recognised it—there was an umbrella found; it was my property, but that I did not miss at the time; it was safe the night before—I found in my counting-house an iron crowbar or jemmy, and a south-wester; they do not belong to me—on discovering my loss, I went to the police-station, and had some bills printed—after the prisoner Dunn was taken, we went to Henry Lovesay's house, and searched a box belonging to him, and in it was a pair of doe-skin trousers belonging to me, and a few foreign coins—I had similar ones in my possession, but I had no marks on them—up-stairs we found five cotton handkerchiefs belonging to me, and we also found a book belonging to me—they all belong to me, but they must have been taken some time before; they were not there the night before—Thomas Lovesay was not at his brother's, but I saw him afterwards, and he acknowledged having taken the handkerchiefs before—the back door of my house was broken open—I have a private entrance at 8, Rodney-place; that had been forced by the means of this iron jemmy—there were five marks on the door, which correspond with this jemmy—that door led first into a lodge, and there was another door which led to the kitchen—there was no door to the counting-house; one room leads to another—the door to the kitchen was not locked, only latched—the exterior door was securely locked the night before, and when a person forced that door, they were into my house and premises.</p>

My neighbour's shop was broken open about a month after that—these handkerchiefs are of an ordinary description, I am quite certain they are my handkerchiefs—I don't think Thomas Lovesay ever bought anything of me but a monkey-patterns; jacket; I don't recollect anything else—these handkerchiefs are all common I had a great number of them—there is a particularity in</p>

               <p>one silk handkerchief, but the others are the same as other patterns I have got; but I am sure they are mine, they were in the shop window, and laid at the bottom of the window, and were frequently trodden on in putting other things in the window—I have not examined the goods since I was before the magistrate—this is the first time I have said anything about their being in the window—they were the cotton handkerchiefs which were found at Lovesay's—I have no mark to tell me these have not been sold, but my belief—I will swear we never sold those handkerchiefs we found at Lovesay's—when we found them they were all hemmed, but when taken from me they were not; they were all in one piece when taken from me. We found the trousers in Henry Lovesay's box—the five handkerchiefs and book and doeskin trousers do not belong to the first indictment—we have another indictment, which charges Thomas Lovesay with stealing the handkerchiefs, the book, and the doeskin trousers. When I was before the magistrate I did not identify these handkerchiefs and trousers as part of the property I had lost at the burglary—I did not miss those goods then; they were the last things we found—these five handker<lb/>chiefs were mine—I suppose these trousers were taken from No. 20 shop, but not on the night of the burglary—I should say I had seen them within two or three months of the burglary—Thomas Lovesay pointed out these handkerchiefs, and owned he took them while in my employ—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; he did not often pay me something out of that for anything but the jacket; he paid me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for that—I dare say when he bought it it was last winter—he was generally under my eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Archer-street, Camden-town—I was in Mr. Dale's employ for about six weeks; I left in March last—I only know the prisoner by selling leather to him; I did not know him before I first went to him with leather, about the latter end of February—I then took him a small piece of bridle leather; I got it from a back workshop at Mr. Dale's—I stole it—I saw the prisoner, and asked him if he would buy it of me—I did not tell him who I was, or where I lived, or where I got it—he asked me how I came by it—I told him it was leather I had out of the shop to do some work by, and that was a piece that I had over; I told him it was my own—he bought it—I went to him again two or three days after; I</p>

               <p>then took him some more bridle leather; I think I took two pieces, as near as I can remember, they were two sheets similar to these produced—the piece I took the first time was about a pound weight—when I took the leather the second time he asked me how I came by it—I told him it was my own leather; I told him I had work to do out of doors, and what was over I had for myself—he asked me both times how I came by it—I gave him the same answer both times—he allowed me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it—I do not remember how many pounds there was—I went again a few days afterwards; I almost forget what I took then, it was either something of the same kind or some wallet pocket leather; he bought that of me—I went altogether perhaps seven, eight, or nine times, while I was at Mr. Dale's—I took him a few straps and buckles, something like these produced, but long and narrow, not quite so wide as these—that was all I took; I did not take any of these blinkers—I can't say how many times I took wallet pockets; it was during the eight or nine times that I went—the largest quantity that I took at any one time, was perhaps four or five pounds weight—he allowed me 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the wallet pockets, as nearly as I can remember—the straps he weighed with the large pieces of leather at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—the largest sum I received at one time was 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think—it was all new leather that I took; it was all stolen from my master—I told the prisoner who I was working for; I mentioned Mr. Dale's name—when he gave me the 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the leather I took, he asked me how I came by it, and I told him it was work I had to do out and what was over I had for myself—he did not ask me that question upon every occasion—the wallet leather was not cut when I took it; I took it quite whole, and in shape for the wallets—I told him they were for wallet pockets—there was some white bridle leather; I received half-a-crown a pound for that, that is more expensive—he paid me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on one occasion; I can't say what that was for. I was charged by Mr. Dale in March; he consented not to prosecute me—some time after that I was told that Mr. Dale wanted to see me—I was not at home at the time; he left a card for me—that was on the Sunday before the prisoner was taken into custody—on the Monday morning I called at the prisoner's shop, about a quarter to 10; I asked him if he had heard from Mr. Dale where I had been working—he said he had not, and asked me the reason why I enquired—I told him that Mr. Dale had left a card at my house on the Sunday morning, and I was afraid there was something wrong about the leather I had been selling him—he asked me why I left Mr. Dale—I told him the reason, and he said, "Oh, indeed"—I said I would go and see what Mr. Dale wanted me for, and I would call on him as I returned back—I have always dealt with the prisoner himself, he has always paid me himself—I have asked him to have a glass of ale on several occasions, and he has gone with me to a public-house opposite his shop; I have paid for it several times; sometimes he has paid for it himself; I believe he paid for it one or two occasions—I was paid in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Devonshire Arms, Queen-street, Golden-square. On Thurday, 2d September, Dutton came to the bar for half-a-pint of porter—I served him, and he gave me a sixpence—I broke it and found it was bad—I told him so, and asked him if he had any more of the same sort—he gave me a good sixpence—I kept one part of the sixpence that I broke and gave him the other—the last witness came in and told me something, and I showed him the part of the sixpence—I afterwards gave it to the constable.</p>

               <p>Swift had a child in her arms—they went into the house together—I was in such a position that I could see beyond the door into the house—Swift sat down in front of the bar—Freeman disappeared at the back of the bar, and soon afterwards returned without her basket, without her cloak, and a bow that she wore—she and Swift sat down in front of the bar, and had something to drink—soon afterwards Joseph Sparks and Elizabeth Sparks came in—they went in and out; and Freeman and Swift went in and out frequently—about half-past 1 o'clock, Elizabeth Sparks came again alone; she apparently had some conversation with Freeman, who was in there—Freeman then disappeared at the back as usual; and she returned and received a piece of newspaper from the landlady over the bar, in which Freeman wrapped up what appeared to me to be silver, and gave it to Elizabeth Sparks, who held it under her shawl and came out carrying it in her left hand—she came away with it, and I gave the officer Elliot in<lb/>struction to follow her and apprehend her at some distance from the place, not within sight of the beer-house—I still kept watching, and about ten minutes before 2 o'clock, the prisoner Crawford came—he joined Freeman, and they were together a very short time; then Crawford disappeared at the back of the premises and left my view—he soon after returned, and at that time Freeman gave him what appeared to me to be a quantity of silver, which he put into his right hand trousers pocket—they had something to drink at that time—there was a good deal of drink going on during the morning—I observed Crawford go in and out several times, and he met several parties, and gave them something—some of them came to the side where we were, and some of them we saw had money in their hands—there were fifty-three persons went into the beer-house that morning; and I believe only two went for a legitimate purpose—about half-past 2 o'clock I saw Crawford disappear at the back of the place, and he came back and tore a piece of newspaper off the bar and wrapped up something which appeared to me to be silver, and gave it to Freeman—I and Bryant gave the con<lb/>stables some directions and we came down—Freeman was proceeding along the street—she turned round, and Bryant seized her—she then had this parcel in her hand in her pocket—she attempted to take her hand out, and I seized her hand and found in her hand this parcel containing six counterfeit shillings—I took her back to the beer-house, where I found Crawford in custody of Cook and the other officers—I called the landlord, and proceeded down stairs to make a search—I went down to the kitchen at the back of the bar—that was the direction in which I had seen the prisoners go at all times—under the window in the kitchen I found this basket, and in it was a counterfeit crown piece and seven half-crowns—the basket was on the floor under the window, and the cloak was laid upon it which I had seen Freeman go in with on her.</p>

On Saturday evening, 18th September, about 7 o'clock, I was on my premises—I saw the prisoner pass me—it is about 200 yards from Mr. South's stacks—I walked round the premises and on to the top of my kiln, and about four or five minutes after the prisoner had passed me I heard some one halloo "fire"—I saw the stacks on fire, and ran towards them and met the prisoner—it was he who cried "fire"—he was coming from the fire towards my premises—he apprised me of the fire and he was hallooing "fire" at the same time—I said to him, "Why, it is not above three or four minutes since that you passed me"—he said "No, it is not"—I said, "Did not you observe it when you went towards the stacks?"—he said no, he did not; that he had got some twenty or thirty yards past when he heard a crackling like fire, and he turned his head round and saw the stacks on fire—I said, "Did you not observe any one run from the stacks?" he said, "I did not"—I went and apprised Mr. South of the fire as early as I could—I then came back to the fire—a police-sergeant came and spoke to me about it, and I gave him information.</p>

I remember this burning of Mr. South's stacks—I saw the prisoner that evening at the fire—I asked him how long he had passed—he said he had gone about one hundred yards by the rick, he heard a crackling noise and turned round and found it was the ricks on fire, and he then went and gave information to Mr. Catlin in the brick-field—I asked him if he had seen any person near at the time—he said, yes, there was a man in front of him with a blue frock on, and he went on the road towards Staines—I asked him if he had seen him since—he said he had not—on the Monday, as I was taking him to the Sunbury bench of Magistrates, I asked him where he came from, as I should write down to the place to enquire about him—he said he had come from a place called Frater, near Gosport, where he had been working at a barracks; he then told me that he went to lie down under the rick, that there was a hole in the rick, that he had been smoking a pipe previously, that he put the pipe into his waistcoat pocket and set fire to some lucifers which he had in his pocket, and in throwing them out of his pocket he set fire to the rick—I examined his waistcoat pocket; there were no marks of any fire—another constable was present at the time—this was on the 20th—he had been taken on Saturday night, the 18th, by Atter—he is a stranger in the neighbourhood.</p>

Piper's sent us an order dated 30th September, for 155 copies—this order was brought to me on the morning of the 30th September, by a porter from Piper's, of the name of Thomas; when he brought the order, there were not sufficient copies printed for him, and I gave him fifty-five copies—I kept the order; he signed for the fifty-five copies on the back of it—some time afterwards another person, who I believe to be the prisoner, came as from Piper's—he said, "Is anything ready for Piper's"—he inquired for the Westminster Review—I told him how many they had had of them, and that the others were not ready—I then told him how many they had had of the Christian Observer, and I gave him one hundred copies more of them and he signed the receipt—shortly after Piper's porter came, and I told him—I gave a description of the prisoner to Gayler the officer; he took me to a public-house in Warwick-lane, and I saw him take from a closet under the stairs eighty-three copies of the Christian Observer for October, and some other things—it was then about half-past 2 o'clock, and I should say at that time, there was no publisher who had so large a number of the Christian Observer—the publishing price of one hundred numbers was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I am a soldier's wife, and live in Providence-place—I was present at the dispute between the prosecutrix and young Mrs. Sweeney—the fight commenced at about half-past 8 with a soldier's wife and a civilian woman who does not live in the court; it was about a Spanish onion—I had only a petticoat on, as I was going up to bed at half-past 8—the two women had done their fight and Mrs. Sweeney stepped out and commenced to talk—I told her to go in and not interfere, as she had her husband to take her part and we had not—Mrs. Cragin came up and said, "What have you to say to the soldiers' wives?"—she said, "B—r the soldiers' wives"—Mrs. Cragin said, "Anything you have to say against the soldiers' wives, take it out of me,"—I do not know what happened, but I said to the prisoner, "Separate them"—he was standing by, while the daughter was beating her, and he hit me in the eye and said, "I will separate you, you b—y soldiers' whores"—after he struck me he went up and hit Mrs. Cragin on the forehead with a knife, and knocked her down—it was a short jack-knife which opens and shuts—her boy lifted her up, and she was all over blood which was running from the cut—a surgeon was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 71, High-street, Whitechapel—I examined the prosecutrix's forehead, and found a wound extending three inches down to the eyebrow and under the brow to the other side—it was a clear incised wound about an inch deep, such as a sharp knife would make—it was a slanting cut and descended very nearly to the temporal artery—it was a very dangerous wound—I attended her for four days.</p>

               <p>is sometimes found against the doors of poor people? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—an old used scraper of that kind would inflict such a wound as far as the eyebrow, but would not continue it under the eyebrow—it came under the arch of the eyebrow—I do not think that in any possible position a scraper could cut the eye, supposing it was cut to a sufficient depth; because a knife coming from the forehead would soon cut where a scraper could not come—the hollow of the eye would prevent the scraper cutting there—the projection on a scraper would occasion a contusion, but it would cut if it was sharp.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brunswick-place, Backchurch-lane, Com<lb/>mercial-road-east—that is on the opposite side of the way to the prisoner's house. On 16th September, about 9 o'clock, I heard some women quarrelling in Providence-place; I went there, and saw Mrs. Gill and Mrs. Carter fighting—I parted them—after that I saw Mrs. Cragin put her head out of the window and make use of bad language, wanting to know what the civilians had to say against the soldiers' wives and that she would soon come down and scatter them—she came down directly afterwards and said, "I will soon scatter half a dozen of them; take it out of the soldier's wife any one who can do it,"—she then flew on Mrs. Sweeney directly, and they were both fighting together—their hands were in each other's hair and remained there the whole time that the fighting went on—they both fell together; Mrs. Sweeney fell against the door, and Mrs. Cragin on the scraper; they had hold of each other's hair then and Mrs. Sweeney was getting up but could not extricate her hair, and then I saw that when Mrs. Cragin did get up she was pouring with blood—the prisoner was eight or ten yards off at the time the disturbance was going on—I saw the fight from beginning to end—the prisoner was not nearer than eight or ten yards from her and he did not strike her—I saw no knife in his hand, and I was sufficiently near to have seen it if he had anything in his hand—when it was over I heard them say, "We will say the old man did it with a knife"—I am only acquainted with Mrs. Cragin by living in the same place—she sent for me after this on the Tuesday, as the prisoner was to have his hearing on the Wednesday—Mrs. Shannon came first, and I told her I would not go unless she sent her own child for me—I did go—I saw Mrs. Cragin and talked with her—she said, "Mrs. Jessop, I have sent for you about the old man; I will not go against him, and no one shall make me go against him, not all the doctors or policemen shall make me go against my conscience"—I said, "Well Mrs. Cragin, it is a pity that poor old man should lay where he is, when you know he is innocent—she said, "I will not go against him, and no one shall make me go; and for God's sake, Mrs. Jessop, if you can, go and fetch the old man out; go and fetch him to-day, for I shall never be happy until I see him again,"—she did not say whether he did it or not, but she said that she did not know who did it, or how it was done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is this scraper at her door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; at Mr. Cox's door, eight or twelve yards from the prosecutrix's door—there was nobody near us; nobody tried to part us; somebody came up, but my husband said, "There will not be half-a-dozen tackle her."</p>

I saw the prisoner in Whitechapel on 23rd September, between 10 and 11 at night, nearly close to Mr. Hart'shouse—his dress was very shabby indeed; that waistcoat is similar to the one that he wore when I saw him—he had a pair of corduroy trousers on, and a coat nearly the same colour as this as far as I could see; it was something of the same sort of material—he was carrying his hand in a sling; he had this</p>

I remember Mews, Green<lb/>field, and Williams being brought to the station by Welsh, and he showed me a bottle of gin, and said he took it out of Mews' bosom—I asked Mews how he accounted for having the gin—he stated that he purchased it in Whitechapel-road, and gave 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the bottle—I asked him where in White<lb/>chapel-road—he said he did not know, but he might take us to the place—I asked Williams and Greenfield if they knew anything about that gin—they said they knew nothing about it—I went with Williams and Mews and Greenfield on board—when we were near the <hi rend="italic">Sparkling Sea</hi>, Williams called out, "I will go with you anywhere, I am not frightened, I have done nothing amiss"—we went on board the <hi rend="italic">Snapdragon</hi>, and when we got on the middle of the deck, Williams called out to some person on board the <hi rend="italic">Sparkling Sea</hi>,"Is that you?" and that person ran into the cabin—I went on board and went into the cabin, and saw Schultz with this bottle in his hand, and he was scraping the label off—I asked him what he was touching that for—he said he was not touching it—by that time Williams had followed me into the cabin—I saw Higgins lying down very drunk, and a bottle of gin by the side of him—Freeman was in the cabin—Greenfield was brought in by Welsh, who said he had found a bottle of gin—I said to Williams, "Whose room is that that this bottle of gin was found in?"—he said, "It is my state-room"—I said, "Do you know anything about the gin?"—he said, "No"—I awoke up Higgins, who was very drunk; I found in his pockets some coloured papers—I have since seen some other bottles from the <hi rend="italic">Sparkling Sea</hi>—they correspond with the bottle found on Mews, the bottle found in the state-room, and the bottle found by the side of Higgins under the cabin-table—this empty bottle is what Schultz was scraping the label off.</p>

               <p>parcel out of it, and go up Cutler-street with it—I followed after him up Cutler-street, and could not see any more of him—I then communicated with the policeman in Cutler-street, and told him what I had seen—in consequence of what he said, I went to Bishopsgate police-court—after that I went into the neighbourhood of Shoreditch—I saw the male prisoner in the company of the female prisoner, and the female had something bulky under her shawl—they went up Church-street, Shoreditch, till they came to a pawnbroker's shop at the corner of a turning; they parted—the female went down the turning, and crossed over to go into the pawnbroker's shop—the male prisoner stood outside—she returned in about 5 or 8 minutes, and she gave him something which appeared to me to be a pawnbroker's ticket, and after he had it he rubbed his hand as if he was rubbing the sand off the ticket—they walked back along Church-street—I then met a policeman, and told him what I had seen—I went up to the male prisoner, and said, "I charge this man, with stealing a parcel off a truck in Houndsditch"—he was off his guard, and did not make any reply—the policeman laid hold of him, and I said, "I charge this woman with pawning that parcel"—she resisted, and tried to get away—we then walked along Shoreditch, till I got another policeman—I then transferred the woman into the hands of another policeman, and told him to look out that she did not drop anything or pass anything to anybody—as we were going towards Bishopsgate-street police-station, a man came up to me and said in the hearing of the woman, "This woman has dropped this piece of paper"—my attention was drawn to the colour of the piece of paper, corre<lb/>sponding with the colour of the paper in which the parcel was wrapped—we then went to Bishopsgate-street police-station, and after that the police<lb/>constable and I went to the pawnbroker's with the female prisoner—previous to going into the pawnbroker's shop, the female prisoner said that she was known at the shop—when we got into the shop, the young man that is a witness in this case was not present in the shop, but he was called—as soon as he made his appearance, the female prisoner said, "I have not been here this morning, have I?"—and the young man said, "No"—I said to the young man, "It is very possible that whatever it is that has been pawned would have been brought in a large piece of paper, and the party might have taken the paper back with them"—he said, "Have you got a ticket?"—I said, "It has not been found"—he said, "I cannot tell you what has been pawned"—I said, "Is this the woman that has been in here this morning?"—he said, "No, I cannot say that it is"—we then went back to the station-house, and both the prisoners were taken before the Lord Mayor on the following Monday—I am quite positive that what she said was, "I have not been here this morning, have I?"</p>

I am quite aware that Freeman was ill for a considerable time—I cannot say for what time—he was confined to his</p>

His impression at present certainly was that the word disclosure" meant stating for the first time; no other construction of the Section appeared to be in accordance with good sense, and he therefore felt bound to put that construction upon it; a statement made after committal, when the thing had previously been found out from other sources, could hardly be called a disclosure; but as there might be some doubt about it, the questions re<lb/>served should be, first, whether this was a disclosure within the meaning of the Act of Parliament (which at present he thought it was not), and next, whether it was that sort of disclosure that would operate as a protection</hi>.</p>

I lodge in the prosecutor's house—I occupy the first floor and the front kitchen—I was sleeping that night in the back room on the first floor, which is over the back parlour—at a little after 1 o'clock I beard a noise of breaking glass, and about a minute afterwards I heard a great screaming from Mrs. Lever, and I heard Mr. Lever calling to me for assistance—he called, "Mr. Wyatt, Mr. Wyatt"—I called to him to know what was the matter—he said, "There are men in the house"—I called "Police"—in a few minutes the police came—I got on my things and exa<lb/>mined the bottom of the house—I found the kitchen door broken open—the window was open, the blind drawn aside, and on the blind and the kitchen window cill there was blood—a tea pot was on the kitchen table, a tea-caddy was open, and a chess-board had been opened—the back door was open which leads into the passage, and the passage runs from the front to the back of the house.</p>

Police!" at a few minutes past I o'clock—I made my way towards Warwick-street, the spot where I thought the sound came from, and four or five doors before I got to the prosecutor's I met my brother-constable, who had got Garrett in custody—I inquired what it was, and he said, "A house broken open in Warwick-street"—I went to the place, and there were several persons there—the shop is two doors from the corner of Berwick-street—I stood there a minute, and I saw Bygrave come to the corner and I made my way towards him, and at that time Piddington came alongside of me and tried to pass me—just before I got to Bygrave he pulled his cap over his eyes, as if to hide his face—I took them both in custody, and asked them what they were after—I took them to the station and went back to fetch the parties in the house—Mrs. Lever identified Bygrave as having been in front of the house—the place where I took Bygrave and Piddington is not twenty yards, I should think, from No. 49—I took off the hoots of all the three prisoners—this is a boot I found on Garrett, and there was some soil on it—I took it back to the place, and found soil of the same sort on the area railing and likewise on the dust-heap below, and there was white on both the legs of his trousers.</p>

               <p>having got that, he then goes to the receiver's office, and obtains the money mentioned in the imprest—on 18th September, the prisoner brought me this report—it is his writing, except this in the corner, which is mine: "Police-constable 54 reports being sent to Birmingham with an imprest to apprehend a convict whose licence is revoked"—the convict's name is not mentioned—that would be contained in the warrant—on the production of that, I asked him for the warrant—he said, "I am expecting the warrant di<lb/>rectly, it is not signed yet; but I want to draw the money before they leave the office at Scotland-yard"—that was between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, as near as I can remember—I then signed the imprest—on the following Monday or Tuesday, I saw the prisoner on his regular duty, and asked him the reason he had not gone the journey that I signed the imprest for—he said that he was given to understand that the convict was ill and in the infirmary—I saw him again on the Wednesday, and asked him the same question—he gave me the same answer—I saw him again on Friday, the 24th, and said, "Gymer, when are you going that journey?"—he said that he did not know—I said, "Unless you go to-morrow, you bring the money in," which he promised to do—that would be Saturday, the 25th—I saw him again on the Sunday morning—he had not brought me the money, and I sent for him to come to the station—when he came, I asked him the reason he had not paid me the money as I told him—he said, "I have paid it into the office"—I understood him to mean the office at Scotland-yard—I said, "To whom did you pay it?"—he said, "To Mr. Goulden; I was not aware that you in<lb/>tended me to bring it in here"—that is the chief clerk in the receiver's office—he pays out money, and would receive it back—I said, "If you have paid it to Mr. Goulden, I am satisfied: I do not want to have any respon<lb/>sibility on my shoulders"—I then inquired what had become of the imprest: "Has Mr. Goulden given it you back, or has he given you any receipt for the money paid in?"—he said, "Mr. Goulden tore up the imprest with the Commissioner's signature on it"—on the following Monday, I made inquiries at the receiver's office, and, on returning to the station, sent for the prisoner, and said, "Gymer, I am given to understand you have not paid the money in to Mr. Goulden, as you told me you had"—he said, "No, Sir, I have not"—I said, "Why did you tell me you had? where is the money?"—he said, "I have it here in my pocket"—I told him to put it on the desk—he took out his purse and took out of it, I think it was, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and the remainder in silver, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—he said, "I have not enough, but I will bring it to you immediately"—I told him to leave the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the desk and fetch the other 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then said, "Gymer, yon have told me an untruth in this matter, and I must report you for it"—he said, "Do forgive me, Sir, and I will tell you all about it"—I did not answer—he said, "Some time since, I had a misfortune, and lost my purse with 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, through a hole in my pocket, and many of the men know that to be true"—I said, "I cannot overlook it; you must see me again to-morrow morning, and I will see what I can do with you"—he said, "Do, Mr. Mitchell, forgive me; if you take me before the Commissioner, I shall be dismissed"—at the time of this conversation, I had not made inquiries as to whether he had any authority to go to Birmingham at all—on the afternoon of that day, I went to Bow-street, to make inquiries—that was Wednesday, the 29th, and on the following morning, the prisoner came to me—I said, "Gymer, I am given to understand you had no authority from the Court to draw the money"—he said, "No, Sir"—I said, "Neither is there a prisoner at Birmingham to be apprehended"—he said, "No, Sir, there is not"—I</p>

Q.</hi> Have you had this matter in hand to prosecute? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have managed the case—I had to speak to list on one occasion, about three weeks ago—he was then in custody—he had been examined before the magistrate and there was a remand—I had been looking up the case very much in Stratford—I did all I could; I expected to have done more—I did not go to List in gaol to talk to him; I saw him before the Magistrate—I saw him after that, but not in gaol—I had a long ride with him—on his confessing, a conveyance was engaged and I went with him to find a third party—I had very little talk with him about this matter, nothing more than asking him to look out on one side of the fly to see if he saw the party we were in search of, as I knew he was on the road—I was not present then he made his confession—the deceased officer King was with me—I have not been to the house of the witnesses; the solicitor for the prosecution, Mr. Wilson, of Stratford, did that—I did not go with him, but previous to that I had been to Bray's with him once, it may be twice—I went there because they were very unwilling to throw any light on it; they were unwilling both times—I went the second time from what came to my know<lb/>ledge—I did not try the coaxing system or the threatening system—I treated them fairly open-handed—I did not shake hands with them; I referred back to the first conversation—I said that it would be necessary for them to attend before the Magistrate to repeat what they had been heard to say—I did not tell them what they had been heard to say—I was by myself the second time—I told Mrs. Bray that she had been heard to say that Saville said that his hands stank of it for a week, but they did not stink now—I said that on both occasions I saw Sarah Strange, but had no conversation with her, no more than serving a notice on her to attend here—we had no conversation about the evidence she was to give—I have had assistance from Mr. Wilson; I have had none from my wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stratford-green, West Ham—I am one of the executors of the will of the late Mr. John Taylor—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the probate—he was buried in 1846—I saw his body inclosed in a copper coffin which he had had made three years before his decease, having been a coppersmith—I should imagine it to be worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I attended the funeral, and saw it deposited in the vault—Mr. Robert By field, of Stratford, is the other executor.</p>

               <p>for about four years prior to my apprehension—Saville was my assistant—he used to come in to help me—Mr. Craddick was the sexton—he kept the keys—I recollect digging a grave in Stratford churchyard, in the summer of 1855—there were a good many dug about that time—I was digging one on a Tuesday, and Saville said, "What do you say, Jemmy, to having Mr. Dr. Taylor's coffin out?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Never mind, let us have it out—will you have a drop of beer?"—I said, "I do not care about it"—he said, "Come on, let us go and have a pot," and we did at the Coach and Horses—he then went home and fetched his tools, a bag, a hammer, and a chisel—he went down into the vaults first, and I went after him—the gate into the vaults has never been locked since I was there—that is where you go down to the tool-house—the wooden door is always locked—when you get through the wooden door, the iron gate is open—you then have access to the various vaults—Mr. Craddick kept the key of these doors—it was necessary to get the key from him when we wanted to get our tools to dig a grave, but sometimes he did not have the wooden door locked all night—I did not have the key on this occasion—the door was open—when I went in, I found Saville breaking the brickwork of a vault open—after it was broken, I went into the vault with him, and he wrenched the coffin open, and took out the copper one—the shell was not opened—he replaced the shell afterwards—he could not take the shell out from the copper coffin without opening the lid of the shell—he tore off the copper part of the lid—I helped him with the copper coffin, and we took it to another empty vault at the side, and left it there—it was then in good large pieces—we then went out and finished a grave—this was between 6 and 7 on a Saturday morning, either June or July in 1855—we did nothing more that day—we let the coffin be there till Monday, and then he went and found a man who would take it, named Brett, who lived at Stratford—he fetched the man's truck down to the church, and some bags, and we took it up to the man between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in two or three bags—the truck was brought out of the churchyard to the gate which looks into Essex—I saw nothing more of the copper afterwards—I did not break it up, but I was with Saville in the vault when he broke it up—I got 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my share—I went with Saville to sell it—I was just outside the door—I did not see the dealing between Saville and Brett—we then went to the beer shop—I knew the name of Brett when I was before the Magistrate—he was apprehended, and I saw him there—I did not know his name before that—I only knew him by sight, but I heard him charged as Brett.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is this the first time you have done anything in the coffin line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I always worked honestly for my living—I was very much shocked when it was put to me to take the coffin—I have continued in that state of mind ever since it has been done—it was weighing on my conscience when the policeman took me, and I said I did not know anything about it—I did not know exactly what he wanted me for—he told me at the station that he wanted me about a coffin, and I said that I knew nothing about it—I did not know what he wanted me for before that—I had forgotten it—my memory served me that I had been engaged in it about half-an-hour afterwards—I did not send for the policeman, and tell him—I was examined before the Magistrate—it was then fresh on my memory—I did not say anything about it then—while I was in the gaol, I spoke about it to the sexton and clerk, who came there, Craddick and Biggs—that was, I think, after I had been examined the second time—there was no police officer with them, only the warder of the gaol—they came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185810250077"/>
               <p>into the gaol where I could see them, but they could not see me—they came to ask me how I was getting on—they did not ask me whether I would have anything to drink—they could not get it there—they asked me about it, and asked me to confess—they did not tell me that Saville had peached, or anything to that effect, nor did anybody else—nobody had told me that at any time—nobody told me in gaol that Saville was about to turn evidence against me—I swear that—they wanted me to tell the truth about it—they did not say that if I would, it would be better for me—they said that they should lose their places if I did not give evidence—I said nothing to that—they did not come again, or anybody else—they did not tell me when I was to give my evidence—I told them that I would do so—they were with me a quarter of an hour—I told them that we had done the job—Saville was not there—I said that it was done by 6 or 7 in the morning—we had one pot of beer at the Coach and Horses before we began.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sexton—List was the gravedigger—Saville assisted him in July, 1855—I kept the keys—I was in the habit of giving them both the keys to get their tools—when the wooden door is open, you can get access to the whole vaults—I never knew the wooden door to be left open—I do not know what they did when I left the keys with them—I was present on 23d September, when the vault was examined—I had discovered on the 22nd that it had been broken open—I heard some talk in the neighbourhood on the Wednesday and went down into the vault in consequence, and found symptoms that it had been opened—there is a small gate which separates the highway from the churchyard at the south-east corner—List had a key of that gate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you present at the first examination of the prisoners before the Magistrate at Ilford? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was a matter of great interest to me—I was anxious to see justice brought home to the men, if they were found guilty—I think I was absent the second time, and the third—I went to the gaol with Biggs the clerk, for the purpose of seeing List—there would be no blame to Biggs—he had no key—he merely performs the responses in church—I had no particular object in going to the gaol to see List, but I had known him a long time, and went to ask after his welfare—the gaol is three miles from my house—I do not know whether I suggested going to Biggs, or he to me—there was no vigilant attorney behind—I think Mr. Wilson was the first solicitor to move in the matter—I forget whether I heard Mr. Hillery of Stratford, open the case to the magistrate—Mr. Humphreys is prosecuting now—I do not know whether he has any partners—it was very unpleasant for us in the situation we were placed in, and we told List so—I did not say "If you do not give evidence, we shall lose our situations"—I heard nothing about a confession—neither I or Biggs made any such statement to List as, "If you do not confess, we shall lose our places"—I do not recollect that anything of that kind was said—I believe I have given you the substance of what passed—we were with him perhaps ten or twelve minutes, it might be a quarter of an hour—that was not all the conversation in a quarter of an hour—we could scarcely see List—Biggs said, "Well, Jem, how are you?"—he said,</p>

               <p>"Very well; I have been in the garden to-day"—Biggs said, "This is a bad job, Jemmy,"—he said, "It is"—Biggs said, "Both for me, and for Mr. Craddick"—List said, "I never should have done it, if it had not been for Saville, and I wish I had never seen him"—he then said, "I was working in the churchyard in the month of June, when Saville came up to me and said, 'Jemmy, what do you think of having Taylor's coffin'—I refused to have anything to do with it, but after some persuasion I yielded to his request; and while I was digging the grave, Saville fetched the tools, and went down in the vault and opened it"—Biggs said, "Well, that, is a fair answer—it places us in a very awkward position, for the wardens think there has been some neglect of us, in respect of the keys"—I said, "What do you mean by whitewashing?"—he said, "I whitewashed the wall, for Saville was drunk under the vaults, and I had to brick it up myself."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the churchwardens did not like it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they told me so, and I thought that my situation was in peril—that was operating on my mind, when I went to the gaol.</p>

               <p>12th September, I was on duty at the Horse-and-Groom—the landlord pointed out a cob there in a stable—I went to the prisoner, and saw him on the turnpike-road—he walked into a wood, and I went after him—I said to him—"Have you got a horse at the Groom?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "I believe you have stolen that horse"—he said, "I bought the horse, and paid for it"—he said, "I have got two carts and a donkey besides"—Mr. Perren came and owned the horse, and I gave it up to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I have but a very little to say. I am quite aware that it is a very capital offence, but at the same time I am perfectly innocent of stealing the horse. I had been <hi rend="italic">hopping</hi>; I came up to Wrotham; I saw a horse feeding, and I got in conversation with the man that was with it. I sat down, as I was tired, and he told me that he had come to Wrotham to make a sale of his horse. I said, "Who do you propose to sell the horse to?" and he said, "Any one that would give money enough for him." I asked him at the same time for a bit of tobacco; he said he had none, but he would treat me to a pint of beer if I would go with him. I dare say there were a thousand people on the road going hopping. We had three pints of beer, and while we were having it the pony; it was only a pony, turned round and went up the hill, and got put in pound. The man requested me to go and inquire how much the money would be to release it; I went and asked. I said I was authorised to see if the pony was in pound; the stable<lb/>man said there was one, and he should have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before he let it go. I went back to Wrotham, and told the man what the ostler said: I stopped in the town till he requested me to go a second time about the horse. I did not altogether like the job: I said, "Why do you not go yourself?" he said, "I have been walking a great deal and don't feel altogether very well; you can tell him my name; my name is George Simmons." I went a second time, and told the ostler just what I had been told to say, and that the man had not got the money to release it out of pound. After that I left the man at Wrotham and went about my own business; I went hopping. About a fortnight afterwards I went back to Wrotham; I knew nothing about the horse then: the policeman came to me and said he should take me on suspicion of having stolen the horse. I am positive I never saw the horse before in my life till I saw it at Wrotham. I have no more to say; I can assure you I am perfectly innocent of stealing the horse; had I known it was Mr. Perren's horse, I would have got it detained myself.</p>

                  </hi>. In May last I was on a visit to a friend of the name of Tritton, who lives at Amersham Park—on returning home I missed a box of jewellery containing twelve articles—Ellen Newson was a servant at my friend's house—I returned to my friend's house four months afterwards—I found she had left—in consequence of some information I went to her house with two policemen—that is about 300 yards from where Mr. Tritton resides; it is called Kent-terrace—I found her there—the policemen searched her box in my presence—there was found in it a gold chain and two lockets, and a cornelian cross with part of the gold top missing—she was taken to the station—whilst I was at the station some other things were brought, which I identified.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer, of Cardiff. In July last, I was in London, and on the 30th, I went to Woolwich—a gentleman addressed me on board the boat—some conversation took place, and when I got on shore at Woolwich he asked me to go and have a glass of ale with him before we parted—after some persuasion, I went with him to Mr. Murray's, the Gun Hotel, into a room upstairs, in which there was nobody else—I had one glass of ale, and after I had drank it, the prisoner came in alone, and after that, another man came in and introduced a ring for sale to the whole three—no one would buy it, and he immediately introduced three cards—the prisoner and the one who was in the bout with me got betting, and wanted me to bet—I said no, as I had left my purse in London—they got from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw which was the black card when he laid it down, and saw some money and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note pass between them—I said, "I know which is the card"—they said, "Why do not you bet if you know the card?" both the prisoner and the man who was in the bout—I said, "I have no money"—they said, "You have got a watch and chain," and I took my watch and chain off and laid them on the table—while I was doing that, I lost sight of the cards which were lying on the table all the time—after I had put my watch and</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, John Baily's-court, Deptford, and am a labourer. On 21st September I was at the Lord Nelson public-house, Dept<lb/>ford, from 12 o'clock till 4—the prisoner and two other sailors were sitting there drinking; they quarrelled, and I was asked by the landlord to inter<lb/>fere, and keep them quiet—they were going to fight, and I tried to persuade the prisoner to put on his jacket and not fight with them—he put on his jacket and came in again; they began again, and I saw a knife nourishing about—I took it from them and threw it over the bar; I cannot say in whose hand it was—I had no sooner done that than the prisoner struck me in the face, and several blows were exchanged between us—after that he ran outside the door, and coming to the side door, said, "Make way, I will settle him"—I was standing with my handkerchief wiping the blood off one of the other men's faces, and the prisoner struck me in the back with one hand, and on the head with the other—I turned round and saw him with a knife in his hand making another blow at me, I warded it off with my arm, and it just touched my chin—he attempted to jump over the bar, but I caught his legs and prevented him—he then shut the knife up, and in doing so cut his hand—he then ran outside into the skittle ground where there is a stair-case—I followed him there, and said that I was stabbed; I felt blood running down my back and legs—the prisoner came back again and said, "They cannot hurt me, I have got no knife about me"—he was given in custody—he was not sober—I am not under the doctor's care now, I left him a fortnight ago.</p>

On 29th August, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I went with Edwin West to George Dobinson's shop, Lower-road, Surrey—it is a chandler's shop—we were both in plain clothes—I went in first—I had before that seen eight or nine persons go in between half-past 10 and a quarter to 11—I followed some one in, and saw five persons sitting down and four standing up—I saw the landlord Dobinson draw some beer from a cask in an earthenware jug and put it on the counter—one of the men took it up and drank from it—I then asked the landlord for a penny<lb/>worth of tobacco; he said he did not keep it—I asked him for a pennyworth of apples, which he gave me—I saw him draw some beer in another earthen-ware jug, and saw a man tender him some money, saying, "Here you are;" he took the money—I saw neither child nor woman present—I did not see the defendant there, or any family—I let my brother-officer in, and he saw part of what was going on—when I went out I called the defendant out and asked him if he knew he was doing wrong in serving beer on Sunday morning—he said that he did not think there was any harm in serving a poor man with a pot of beer—I also saw him serve a bottle of ginger-beer.</p>

               <p>morning, 29th August, between 10 and 11 o'clock Smith came in—the prisoner was there, she had come in at just past 10 o'clock—I know these two officers—when they came in the prisoner was standing between the two doors talking about Mr. Torr's two children who were lost—any body could see her who came in—if they have said that there was no woman there it is a great false story—there were three children there—they came in for some sweets, and the officers followed them in; and the young man asked for some tobacco; the answer was that we did not sell it—we have got nothing outside the door intimating that we sell tobacco, no sign-board or jar—I was there from 10 to most 12 o'clock—I saw no beer drawn in a jug from a barrel, not a drain—there was one jug—we supplied two bottles of ginger-beer—they were poured into a quart pot—no beer was sold, and nobody asked for any—I served some apples to the officer—he was not eating them in the shop—the other officer gave him the apples and I do not know what he did with them—the two were together, one was inside, and the other had the door half open and half shut.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, James-street, Commercial-road, Peckham—I am a widow, and live with my son—I remember sitting in the kitchen, on Monday afternoon, 26th July, at about a quarter or twenty minutes after 3 o'olock—I was sitting resting myself in my chair, when a man came in at the back door, and said, "Mother, you are having a nap." and threw a hand<lb/>kerchief over my face—I did not see any other men, but I heard them, after he threw the handkerchief—I lifted up my eyes—he had something black over his face, so that I could not see his features—I said, "Who are you, what do you want"—he said, "It makes no matter who I am, hold your noise"—he then took me out of the chair I was in, put me in another chair by the side of the fireplace, and tied the handkerchief very tight over my face—he put another handkerchief round my hands, and held my hands very tightly—I had several bruises on my hands—I said to him, "Pray don't hurt me"—he said, "I won't hurt you if you hold your noise, but if you don't hold your noise, I will kill you"—he then said, "Go upstairs"—I heard some footsteps going upstairs, but I could not tell how many—as soon as they had gone up, he said, "Now tell me where the money is"—I said, "There is none; when my son goes out he takes the money with him"—he said, "We know better," and just as he said those words, in God's mercy, my son came in—my son laid hold of him and said, "What are you at with my mother"—he caught hold of him—the man then let go of me and rushed to the stairs—he called out "Bill" or "Jim" (I don't know which) "come down"—I ran out into the garden and called out "Police"—my son and the man were struggling a little time in the passage at the foot of the stairs, and he struck him on the head six times—while I was in the garden, my son and the three men came out—I saw the prisoner in the garden, when my son threw the garden-pot at him—he was about to get over the wall and he turned round and grated his teeth at my son—that was the way that I came to see his face, and that is the man—I was as near to him as I am to you—I was on the grass-plat in the garden—as I was going through the gardens, he got over the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother at Peckham, and am a retired tradesman. On Monday afternoon, 26th July, I had occasion to go out about a few minutes after 3—I left my mother at home alone—I returned in about twenty minutes—I came in at the side entrance with my latch-key, and came the back way into the kitchen—when I came in I saw a man laying hold of my mother; she was in a chair and the man was standing over her holding her by the wrists—I thought at first that she was ill—I said, "Hallo, what are you doing with my mother?"—the man looked up very much confused and started towards the passage door—I laid hold of him by his two collars—he dragged me towards the staircase and hallooed out, "Jim! Jim!" upon which two men came downstairs—I was then at the foot of the stairs, holding the man who had had hold of my mother—the prisoner is one of the two that came down the stairs; the other one was a taller man than the prisoner; he had a life-preserver in his hand, and he struck me with it six times on the head, and a terrible blow on the jaw-bone, I could not eat for nearly a month afterwards, except soft victuals—I was struck seven times altogether; six times on the head and once on the jaw—it was this life-preserver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), or one very much like it—I kept hold of the man who had been in the kitchen until the three of them came upon me—I then left go of him and went into the garden to give an alarm—the men followed me; one of them went out through the side-gate, another flew over the wall, and this man, when he had got some little distance in the garden, turned round and grated his teeth, and felt in his breast-pocket for something—I then threw a garden-pot at him and hit him in the breast with it—he then turned round and jumped over the wall; it is a six-foot wall—I returned into the house—there was an outcry about one of the men being taken—that was the man that I found in the kitchen—he was taken and brought back by the constable, and he has been tried and convicted—I found this life-preserver in the passage, and the hat of the man who has been convicted—I went up<lb/>stairs, and in my bedroom, I found one drawer open, and the things in it were pulled from the back to the front, I suppose to see what there was in it; there was not much of any value—I missed a broken seal and an old purse, that was all—at that time a man named Perry lived next door to me—when I went in on this occasion I saw Perry leaning over his gate with his arms folded, at the time the men were in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at Albert-cottage, James-ground, Peckham. On Monday, 26th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in front of Mr. Kilburn's house—I could see the garden-wall of Mr. Kil<lb/>burn's—I saw two men get over it; the prisoner is one of them—he used to come to Mr. Perry's house early of a morning and go out—Mr. Perry's house is next door to Mr. Kilburn's—I have seen him go to Mr. Perry's house about six or seven times—when I saw him get over the wall I ran round through my father's cottage, and I saw this man and another man run past me—I saw the prisoner throw something like this (a life-preserver) into the hedge—I afterwards looked in the hedge where it had been thrown; I could not find it, and I called a gardener's man and he knocked it out with his hoe—that was where I saw the prisoner throw it—it did not appear as if it had been long in the hedge when I got it out; it was perfectly dry—I have gene<lb/>rally seen the prisoner come out of Perry's house about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning—I have no doubt but that he is the man I saw getting over the wall on this Monday afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Warren Stormes Hale, and another—they carry on business at Orange-street, Southwark; that is where their manufactory is. On Saturday, 18th September, the old lead which lines the cisterns was being stripped off, for the purpose of new being substituted—the prisoner Tilley was then in the employ of Messrs. Hale &amp; Co., and was at work on the premises—in consequence of something which occurred, I watched Tilley on that day, and another person who was also at work there, named Haines—I saw Haines cut up a piece of lead—I watched Tilley pick up this lead and secrete it within his clothes—I saw him secrete two large pieces—having done so he left the premises, and I followed him to a plumber's shop in Union-street—I saw him go in—while outside the shop, I could see the other prisoner Hagan within—Tilley stopped in the front shop—I saw him take the lead from underneath his frock and deliver it to Hagan, who put it into a recess on the right hand side of the shop—I saw him pass something to Tilley but I could not see whether it was money; whatever it was I saw Tilley put it in his pocket—I was standing close to the door inside—I do not think they saw me previously to this—they then turned round and saw me—Tilley wanted to make his way out, but I would not let him go—I said, "Was not that lead which you took from Mr. Hale's premises?"—he said, "I have taken no lead"—I said, "You have"—I would not let him leave the shop—I then said to Hagan, "I want that lead that this man fetched into your shop"—he said, "You are under a mistake, there was no lead fetched in"—I had my hand on Tilley at that time—I said I would lose my life before I would allow him to escape—Hagan then went and produced the two pieces of lead from a recess in the shop, the place where I had seen him throw them—he said that was all the lead they had in the place—I still had hold of Tilley, and said I would hold him till a policeman came, to give him in charge to—Hagan said I might let him go in the passage as we need not make a row about the door, he could not get through the back way; I then left my hold of him—Hagan took him to the back of the shop—I saw him beckon him towards the left hand side of the shop where there was a step-ladder and he made his escape—a policeman came and Hagan was given into his custody—I assisted to search the premises after that, and found a quantity of lead weighing 7cwt. 1qr. 7lbs.—the two pieces which he threw into the recess, weighed, I should say, 26lbs. or 28lbs., but I do not know.</p>
