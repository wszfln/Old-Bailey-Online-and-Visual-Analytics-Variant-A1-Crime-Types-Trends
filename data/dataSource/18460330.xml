Everett's, Finch-lane, City—when it became due I had it presented by one of my workmen, and it was detained—I knew Everett, and he called on me the same evening—in consequence of what he said I looked after the prisoner and went to Shackell of the G division, a week or two after, but could not find the prisoner till just before the last session—I believed the acceptance was genuine at the time.</p>

                  </hi>, I am the wife of Sir William Coles Medlycott, Bart., and reside at Venn-house, Milbourn Port. On the 21st of Feb. last Sir William was in London—I addressed a letter to him, and enclosed in it three advertisements, two invoices, an elastic strap and buckle, and two bills—the strap was enclosed in the cover—I sealed the envelope,</p>

               <p>and addressed it to Sir William Medlycott, or Sir W. C.

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer, stationed at the General Post-office—on Monday, the 23rd of Feb., I was directed to take my place near where the water-closets are, in the Post-office—there is a row of these water-closets against a wall, without any doors, separated from each other by a small partition, but the front is open—facing the water-closets there is a wall—in that wall there is a circular of, I should say, a foot and a half wide, covered with a small wire—that would enable a person on the other side of that wall to have a view of the water-closets—there is a gas-light in front of the water-closets, throwing a light into the whole of the water-closets, so that any one can see—they are open at the top as well as in front, so that the light is thrown on them—I was stationed behind the gratings—I observed the prisoner come there about seven o'clock in the morning—he remained there a short time, and then left—he returned again about half-past nine o'clock, and went into the farther water-closet—I had a view of that—he undid his dress, and sat on the seat—after he had done that, I saw him take a letter, with his right hand, from his left hand inside coat-pocket, and bring it in front of him—there were footsteps approaching, and the prisoner replaced it again—all was silent, and he brought it out again a second time—he then took his right</p>

               <p>hand, with the letter, and brought it to his left side, and from the motion of his arm and hand, I was induced to suppose he was breaking the letter open—his hands were working about—he then brought the cover of a letter behind him, and dropped it down the seat—on observing that, I left mf posi<lb/>tion, and went round to where he was sitting—I was perhaps a minute, or not so long, in doing that—the moment I entered, he put his right hand to his left hand pocket—I seized his arm, and asked what he had got there—he said, "I don't know; money, I think—I have just picked it up, and intend taking it to the inspector"—I then put my hand into his left hand pocket, and took out this packet—at the same time I placed my knee on the seat, to pre<lb/>vent it from rising—on the seat rising, the water will flow, and carry every<lb/>thing away—I also prevented the prisoner from rising—I took these two bills and the elastic strap out of the same pocket, and then sent for the plumber—I detained him there till the plumber came, and then told the plumber to search the seat, and took the paper and cover he found there—I saw him take this cover from the pan—I told him to take all papers, mark them, and bring them to me—he marked this cover and these three parts of letters, which he gave to me—I saw this cover taken from the seat.</p>

I went into Mile-end workhouse, on the 12th of March—I found the prisoner there when I went in—I had never known him before—while I was in bed I heard him say he had lost some things—next day I was in the yard and he came up to me, and asked where his things were—I after<lb/>wards went to make water—he followed me and asked where his things were—I told him I did not know—he called me a d—d liar, and said, "You b—r if you don't give me my things I will have your life"—he took up the iron key that turns the water on, and struck me on the head, and on the arm—my head was cut about two inches and a half—a doctor has seen it.</p>

I was a pauper in the Mile-end workhouse—I heard the prosecutor crying out "Murder!"—I ran to the place, looked in the passage leading to the privy, and saw the prisoner with an iron key in his hand, striking the prosecutor with it—I saw him strike him once on the arm, the other blows hit against the wall—I did not see him struck on the head—I saw blood running from his head—I went up to them and said, "What are you doing?" the prisoner said, "If he does not give me my things I will have his life"—I Caught hold of the key, but could not get it from him—Pauley got away, and after that the prisoner walked about the yard with the iron in his hand till he was given in charge—I did not see Pauley strike him—I did not see the beginning of it—I did not hear Pauley say anything about making the prisoner recollect sleeping in the workhouse—I heard the prisoner say, "If you will give me the things I don't care."</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, 21st March, I went to my premises in Cross-street about half-past five in the morning, and found there had been a fire there—I saw a quantity of paper bags under the counter, which we use for putting flour in, and part of a pocket-handkerchief that was still on fire when I arrived there—I remarked to the prisoner that it looked very suspi<lb/>eious—he was in the shop, and several of the police were there—he said he did not know anything about it—I had left him only in possession of the shop on the Friday—I left about half-past eleven at night, in company with the witness Palmer—about an hour before I left I had occasion to look under the counter, and there were no paper bags there then—it was not a usual place for such bag's to be put—we always kept them in a box at the extreme end of the shop—I never knew them to be there—on seeing the bags there, I said to the prisoner that it looked very suspicious, and that the bags were not there the night before when I left—he made no answer.</p>

I saw Turner take my veil from my bonnet—it was a black lace veil—the officer came up on my calling "Murder!" and "Police!"—and I gave Sykes into custody—Turner walked by the side of Sykes a little while and then left—I did not give her into custody, my hand was smarting so—Turner broke the comb in my head with striking me—they both beat me about, Sykes with two hands and Turner with one hand—the witness Impey was of our party, and she tried to save my veil and received a blow in the face from Turner—we had been in a public-house just before this occurred—I saw both of the prisoners there, and two men—one of them was the man that held me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Sykes. Q.</hi> Did you seize my hand and bite it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not scratch it, or put it in my month—nor did I tear your bonnet off your head and lay it down on the stones—there was no opportunity of putting it on the stones, there were too many people there—I might have torn your bonnet in defend<lb/>ing myself—I struck you I believe, in self defence—my male friend did not strike you—Mr. Impey, Mrs. Williams's brother, was with me, and a little boy twelve years old, who stood at the edge of the pavement crying all the time—there were five of us—the man was persuading me to let you go or you would kill me—I said, "Never till the officer comes, and I will give her in charge"—the man made his escape—he stuck his elbow in my side, and grasped my arm, which made me relax my hold—a sailor came to the sta<lb/>tion, but that was not the man who held my arm—he looked a very honest hard-working sailor—I had never seen him till he came to the station—the man was quite a different looking man—I should know him again.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Brown's employment in Oct. last, and had been so about three months—I remember Thomas Hartley being at Brown's in Oct.—he left about the middle of Oct. as near as I can recollect—I know Muieller, and remember his being at Brown's house in Oct.—I was present at a conversation between Brown and Muieller about the 12th I think—there were two or three men present who went away in the American ship along with Thomas Hartley, and a youth that went away with Thomas Johns—I heard Brown say more than once or twice that he would get Muieller an English ticket to get him in an English ship—I heard Brown tell him he must have a ticket, and I was present when Brown bought the ticket of Thomas Hartley in the yard for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave it to Muieller the day after—Hartley stated that he was going in an American ship, and did not want the ticket, and if Brown would like to have it, he would sell it to him, as it might be of some use to some of the foreigners in the house—he handed the ticket to Brown, and Brown gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my presence—the ticket was not in a case then—I saw Brown hand it over to Muieller—it was then in a the case, and he told Muieller he should have it for the same he bought it for—that was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then you first heard Brown and Hartley talking about the ticket in the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard Brown state to Muieller first that he must get him a ticket to get him in an English ship—it was two or three days afterward that I heard the conversation between Brown and Hartley, and the day after that he sold the ticket to Muieller—it was to enable Muieller to get a berth on board an English ship—Muieller was not at that time looking out for a berth, because Brown would not allow him to go out of doors, for fear the captain of the Prussian ship should take him—I saw the money paid for the ticket to Hartley—I did not see any money paid to Brown—it was in the kitchen that Brown gave the ticket to Muieller—I saw him give it him in a tin case—no money passed, because Brown told him it would go out of his note—Muieller got on board the <hi rend="italic">Tom Tough</hi> about two days after this—Hartley went on board the American ship before Muieller went on board the <hi rend="italic">Tom Tough</hi>—I think the day before—I never had any quarrel with Brown—he never kicked me—I never charged him with assaulting me—one day in Mr. Fosters shop he said I had been telling a lot of lies about him, that he was in prison, and he threatened to hit me—I said if he did I would give him in charge—that was all that passed between us—I am now in the employment of Mr. Ryan—I did not go before the Magistrate when the complaint was first made—I went on the 25th—I did not know of the complaint being made—the first I knew of it was when Mr. Burchett came down to the house where I live, and said I was wanted—I went next morning—I never expected to get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or half of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for giving information—I never went of my own accord to give information—I knew nothing about it till they sent for me.</p>

               <p>to-morrow morning"—the other man said, "Never mind the ticket, I can get a ship and go to America without a ticket"—when Muieller was charged with having stolen the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he did not say he had stolen it, nor did he deny it, to my understanding—I could hear what he said, but did not know the meaning—he asked for mercy—he cried, and went down and put his hands together—Brown said, "He begs me not to lock him up, and he will pay me when he comes back again"—Brown said that in English to me—I said, "If that is so, I have done with it." and it was then that Brown mentioned about the ticket and the box—the other man wrote out a ticket—something passed between them in the shape of a ticket, but what I do not know—it was almost dark in the kitchen, and Muieller sat with his back towards the window—the writing referred to the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by the reading of it—I heard the man who wrote it read it—I do not remember now what it was—it is a long while ago—there was a ticket of some sort passed from Muieller—whether it was a pawnbroker's ticket I cannot say—I did not handle it—I heard Brown say, "Is that the ticket for the coat?"—from those words I should say it must have been a pawn ticket—the other man took it.</p>

Currie, in Cornhill, who are the agents of the Hemel-Heropstead bank—some days afterwards I saw the <hi rend="italic">Hue and Cry</hi>, and in it there was a note, No. 1345, advertised as being found at Cambridge.</p>

I am a constable of Covent-garden-market—on the 14th of March, Gadson told me something—I called Johnson to assist me—we went to the corner of Tavistock-street—I found the two prisoners stand<lb/>ing there—Jane had a piece of red paper, resembling this which I produce, in her hand, and passed it to Susan, who had a basket containing roots in her hand—I was not close enough to see whether the paper contained anything or not—I am known as a constable of the market—we wear plain dress the first thing in the morning, and I was in plain dress then—Susan Chappell saw me, and they then both crossed the road to go down Southampton-street—I followed them, and took hold of Susan's hand, in which she had the basket—she resisted very much, and tried to throw the flower roots down—in coming along, Jane said, "Throw the roots down, and let the b——take them up himself"—when we got to the station, I took the roots out of the basket, and found at the bottom of it this piece of red paper, with these four counterfeit shillings in it.</p>

Deacons', by the corner of Cheapside, just turning round by the General Post-office—he was not driving—I followed the van till it stopped in Aldersgate-street—he got out there and delivered a parcel at a house—as soon as he came out I laid hold of him, and said, "Young fellow, do you recollect escaping from me a few weeks ago?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "I shall take you to the station"—he said, "Where?"—I said, "To Moor-lane"—he asked what charge I had against him—I said, "For escaping from me when I had you on suspicion of stealing a parcel which was in your pos<lb/>session"—this was on the way to the station—he said, "You are mistaken"—I am convinced I am not mistaken—I can say positively I am not—he is the man I first saw—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, a pocket-book, and a book of the same appearance as the parcel delivery-book which he showed me before, but I cannot identify it.</p>

Deacon, the car<lb/>riers—I have been in their employ twelve years—the prisoner has been por<lb/>ter there about ten years—his employers have placed confidence in him—I was at Messrs. Deacon's on the 12th of Feb.—I remember the van which was going to the London and Birmingham Railway leaving the yard—the pri<lb/>oner drove it, and William Paveling was behind as guard—the van left about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—this is the sheet of paper referring to that load—it was given to the prisoner—when the van got to Camden-town it would be the duty of the two men who accompanied it to place it in our warehouse there, to leave this paper in the counting-house, and then to take the horses out and stable them—their day's work would then be done—they would have no occasion to return to our warehouse—the prisoner began work about four o'clock in the morning, and I saw him leave about half-past four in the afternoon—I had been on the premises in the former part of the day—the prisoner would first have to bring a load from the station at Camden-town to deliver the meat at Newgate-market—his next duty would be to deliver the rest of the goods of his load wherever they might be directed, and having</p>

               <p>done that, to come to our place—the delivery of the meat and other parcels would occupy two or three hours—he was in the habit of coming to the yard in general after the delivery of the meat, about six o'clock—then he would start about ten to deliver the rest of his load, and he would be in the yard about twelve o'clock generally speaking—I saw him on that day about two o'clock—I cannot speak positively to seeing him again—I suppose he gets his dinner generally about twelve or one o'clock—I do not know where he lives—he would have no more duty to do after delivering his meat, and his goods but to get his dinner, and be prepared to go with the van in the afternoon—it is no part of his duty to load the van—he never had to go to the Great Western Railway at all to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did the first van go to the Great Western Railway that morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Great Western van never goes till about eight o'clock in the evening, and remains there all night—the prisoner came every day to his work from the 12th of Feb. onwards—I never noticed him in any other dress than the one he has on, except a handkerchief or so—John Burrows went with the Great Western van on the night of the 11th of Feb.—he had the charge of the goods—I cannot say who drove it—I saw the prisoner start on the 12th, and gave him the bill—I gave the Great Western bill to Burrows on the night of the 11th—the man who drives might change with the man who has the charge of the goods sometimes—I particularly noticed who went to the Camden-town station on the 12th of Feb., in consequence of there being some boxes of sago in the van, and one of them leaked, and I gave the man directions to put some paper in—I know by our books that that was on the 12th of Feb.—here are seven chests of sago mentioned in this bill, and in one of them there was a waste—the van goes on the overnight and returns next morning—it goes to meet the luggage train.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk in the employ of Mrs. Hore—on the 2nd of March, 1842—the London schooner traded between Dundee and our wharf—I copied the manifest into a book kept at Mrs. Hore's, called the ships'book—there is a bale of goods entered, marked G. S. S. 7—I saw that bale—this is the cover of the bale I saw on Mrs. Hore's wharf—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a wrapper</hi>)—I saw it when I took stock, in July, 1843—I left in May,1844—I have the manifest here—I received it before the <hi rend="italic">London</hi> discharged, when she came up in the river—that is the usual course of business—I know this to be the self-same paper—it came through the post, directed to Mrs. Hore—I saw it there in the course of my duty.</p>

S., 7," but we did not receive the bale—this order is not similar to what we send out—the printing is different—this is printed "28, Ironmonger-lane," and we removed there about five months ago—we write on our orders "28, Ironmonger-lane," over the old address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas James Watkins, of No. 19, Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove, St. Marylebone. We get our living by taking houses and letting them out in tenements—my husband occasionally gets tipsy, and I do not trust him with money—in Sept., 1844, I had received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had also saved up 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my husband knew I had received some money from my family, and was plaguing me to know what it was—I in consequence deter<lb/>mined to put it away—I put eight 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country bank notes, one 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and fifty sovereigns together, into a tea-caddy, and put it into an old handkerchief, and took it to the house where the prisoner and his wife lived as my tenants at No. 78, in the same street—they occupied a little shop, a parlour and a bed-room—I saw the prisoner's wife—the prisoner was not present—he was in the shop—she put the tea-caddy into a chest under her bed, in my presence—I kept the key of the tea-caddy—the trunk was locked, and she kept the key of that—in April last year I had occasion to go to that tea-caddy again—Mrs. White turned up the bed and opened the box—I found the tea-caddy safe, and opened it, and put in three sovereigns more, and then locked it up as before—Mrs. White did not see me put the money in—I took the tea-caddy home, that no one should see it—I brought it back immediately—I never told the prisoner at any time anything about this tea-caddy—about a month after this I was sent for to White's house—it was on Whit-Monday morning, about half-past seven o'clock—I went into the middle-room—Mrs. White was then crying—I did not see anybody else—she said something to me, in consequence of which I ran for the police—I came back with Sergeant Thompson—I then found the prisoner at the house, with the tea-caddy upon the table, and the rag which was tied outside it—they were not there before I went for the policeman—they could not have been upon the table without my seeing them—I was very much flurried at seeing the empty box—Sergeant Thompson was taking down what they said they had lost—they said they had lost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and a tea-caddy spoon—the prisoner said the thieves had pushed the key out of the door, though the door was locked—he also said the thieves had, perhaps, come in through the window—I said nobody in the world could do it, and gave him into custody—he was discharged before the Magistrate—after the prisoner had been taken a second time and remanded, his wife came to me, and in consequence of what she said I directed the cesspool at the back of the pre<lb/>mises to be searched—I was present when a worsted stocking was found, containing nearly 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, with half a sovereign, and a tea-caddy spoon, which the prisoner said they had lost that morning, and two purses, which the wife said were hers—I know the prisoner had not been out on the morn<lb/>ing of the robbery, because it was Monday morning, and he never does go cut—he said he had been there all night.</p>

In consequence of a commu<lb/>nication from the last witness, on the 17th of March, I went to the prisoner's house—I waited until he came home about eleven o'clock at night—I said, "Well, Mr. White, I have come to you about Mrs. Watkins's robbery"—he said, "Well, I know something about it; if you will appoint a time to-mor<lb/>row, or any other time, I will meet you, and find it"—I said that would not do; he must go with me, and see what the Inspector said—he said he did not mind, which way I liked—I took him to Marylebone station-house—he said he did not wish to stop there, that the money was nearer to the Har-court-street station than it was to Marylebone—he had said previously at the Kennington station-house that he did not mind going, because the money was nearer to the Marylebone station than it was to Kennington—he had said! previously he would meet me in the morning, if I would take him to the place—I went to him in the morning—he said he should say nothing till he went to High-street before the Magistrate—he made a statement before the Magistrate, and said he would go with me, and show me the place as nearly as he could—he said something about the caddy, but I did not hear the words—I went with him to a field in the neighbourhood of Primrose-hill—he pointed to a bank there where he said he had put the money—he did not say money, he said <hi rend="italic">put it</hi>—he said he had put the notes into a bottle, and the gold in a piece of paper, the one a little distance from the other—I got assistance, and dug, but found no money or notes.</p>

I live in Half Moon-passage, leading from Gracechurch-street to Leadenhall-Market—I am the beadle of Lime-street ward—about five o'clock on Thursday morning, 26th of March, I saw Jones coming from Gracechurch-street with two females—he had a large basket on his head—I watched and saw him pass Mr. Warmington's door and return to the females—he had some conversation with them—he then returned towards Mr. War<lb/>mington's, and passed on to the house of Mr. Lambert—he had the basket still on his head—I afterwards saw him without the basket—I went round and told the policeman to watch at that end of the passage—I afterwards saw him join the women again—I saw him again at Mr. Warmington's shop door—he had nothing with him then that I could perceive—I then lost sight of him—I saw him again in a short time, when the policeman had just taken hold of him—he had a bag on his shoulder—the policeman put his hand under the bag and said, "Where did you get this?"—he said, "At War<lb/>mington's"—I went round another avenue and took the two women—I knocked at Mr. Warmington's private door, which is about three yards from the shop-door—after knocking for about five minutes Mr. Warmington's man opened the door—I went into the shop—I saw Brooks about twenty feet from the door, in the middle of the shop—this meat had been taken out of the bag which Jones had, and put into the basket—it was then laid on the block in the shop—I asked Brooks if he could identify that meat as his master's—he went towards it, turned it over, and appeared very much agitated and confused—the answer he made was, "I found the door ajar"—I said, "That is not the question, I ask you, can you identify this meat as your master's"—he turned it over and looked at it again, and said, "It did not come from here, it is none of ours"—I pointed to the vacant places in the shop where I thought it had hung, and said, "That is where the leg of mutton hung, and that is where the beef hung"—they had hung up in rows—Brooks made no reply, but Cox came in directly afterwards and said he could identify the beef—I directed him to get down another leg and chine of mutton—he said this leg was part of the same—we fitted them and they corresponded exactly—I have been a butcher all my life—I asked Brooks if he knew Jones—he said to one of the men "He is a chap that used to live along with us."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Dukeson, a carman, in Dun<lb/>ning's-alley, Bishopsgate-street. On a Thursday afternoon, about the 5th of March, the prisoner came to our place about one o'clock, to hire a truck to go to the Eastern Counties Railway to fetch two boxes to go to Sun-street—I let him have the truck—he was to bring it back within the hour—he did not bring it back—I saw it at the police-court the following day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walham-green, and am an auctioneer. About half-past one o'clock in the morning of the 24th of March I was in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Mr. Barnard—we stopped just below the Garrick's Head, in Bow-st.—I was getting out—I tripped from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and felt some one put his arms round me—I also felt his hand or his fingers in my right-hand waistcoat pocket—there was a crowd round—I had a watch and a sovereign in that pocket—I am sure it was the same person who had his arm round me whose hand I felt in my pocket—it was the person who pretended to catch me when I tripped—I am sure it was the same person—there was but one person who touched me—I was sober—after I felt that, I saw the same man making off, and tried to catch hold of him—I had not missed anything; I merely felt the action of the hand in my pocket; I had no time—I did not miss anything till my watch was picked up—I heard it drop—I judged what it was—I then put my hand to my pocket, and it was gone—it was picked up and brought to me.</p>

M. S., and one salt-spoon, and three stockings—one of them is marked Smith—these are the articles—M'Gregor was not bound over to attend—it was quite light in the morning, and I had a distinct view of Stone—I lost sight of him when M'Gregor ran after him—I am quite sure he is the same man—I had a dis<lb/>tinct view of him befere he started.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Smith—we live at No. 62, Beaumont-square, Stepney—on Monday evening, the 16th of March, I shut up the house very early, perhaps between six and seven o'clock—I went to bed about eleven—the house was all safe at that time—I was alarmed by the policemen about seven in the morning—they directed my attention to the kitchen door, leading into the garden—I found that door open—I had shut it myself the night before, and bolted and barred it—there was a pane of glass cut out of the window—by doing that, they could lift a piece of wood which fastened the window, open it, and get in—a part of the window-frame was cut—I missed a kettle, a warming-pan, the lid of a stew-pan, a coal—skuttle, and a copper—four haras were lying ready to be taken—two tea—spoons and a salt-spoon were gone, and four shillings—I know these spoons, they have our initials on them—this skuttle and other things are mine—they were all safe that night—our house is in Stepney parish.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb/>tion, I went on Tuesday morning, the 17th, to the house in Beaumont-square, but before that I went to the Five Bells, and found the prisoner Smith there—I asked where he was at half-past one o'clock last night—he said he was along with Wincop—that is the prisoner Stone—I asked where he went to after he left the first bridge—he said, "I shan't answer you any more, you know too much for me"—I took him to the Mile end station, and there took his boots off—I went with them to No. 62, Beaumont-square—I got there about half-past eleven o'clock—I saw marks in the ground very distinctly—I compared the marks with the boots—I made a pressure alongside of the marks that were in the ground—the impression corresponded with the marks that had been made before—these are the boots—they are nailed, with tips to them, and are rather extraordinary boots, having so many nails in them—here</p>

"Now then, get up, what do you do lying here? I won't have you here"—I held the light over them for a minute or two, but they did not make any move—I had suspicion—I came out, looked the door, aud locked them in—I went to the top of the mews to see for a policeman—in the mean time I heard the men rush against the door—they broke the lock, but could not force the door sufficiently to get out—one of them escaped through a hole cut in the door to</p>

On the morning of the 15th of Feb. last, in consequence of hearing a disturbance, I and Knight went down King-street—we went up and found the prisoner and another, (who has had fourteen days imprisonment,) trying to take Hastie's staff away—in conse<lb/>quence of that, I saw he was in danger of his life, and I took out my staff and hit the prisoner across the shoulder, because there were so many round him—there were more than one striking him, there was the man that had fourteen days for assisting the prisoner in getting his staff away, and there were several more round him, but these two were the worst—when the prisoner was taken away I heard him say that he would do for the bloody police—this happened between twelve and one o'clock on the morning of the 15th, about ten yards from the public-house—it was close by the spot where Hastie was</p>

I am in partnership with my sister Frances, and live at No. 7, Smith's-place, Kennington—we carry on the business of linen-drapers—we have the house on lease—we sleep there—it is in the parish of Lambeth. On Sunday the 8th of March I went to bed about eleven o'clock—my sister slept in the same room with me—we were the last persons up—the servant went to bed just before us—I left the house safe, the windows and all the doors fast—I was awoke between one and two by a screaming, and soon after I heard a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drive down—some one spoke to somebody, and they replied, and directly after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> had passed on I heard a window thrown up, and directly polled down again—I was not aware at that moment whether it was in our house or not—I listened for some time, and heard a noise in the drawing-room, directly under my bed-room—I then got out, and walked round to the bed-room door, and listened—I again heard a noise as if somebody was picking a lock, and I was quite sure it was the drawing-room door—I aroused my sister, threw open the window, and called, "Police"—there were no policemen on the beat—I called to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>men, who said there were no police, and the cabmen came down immediately from their rank, and they went off for the constable, who came, and got in at the drawing-room window—I saw him do so—I was looking out of window—it was shut down before the policeman got through—he pushed it up, and it opened directly—I had tried the drawing-room door when I went up to bed at night, and I found it right; and when I came down I found it locked, with the key outside—I unlocked it, and turned the key two or three times before I could do so—when I unlocked the door and went in, I found the prisoner in custody in the drawing-room, with the two police<lb/>men—my next door neighbour is a butcher, and has a sort of shop or pent-house over the shop—that would enable anybody to get in at my draw<lb/>ing-room window—the scream appeared on the common, and the policemen were called off for that—so the cabmen told me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Royal Jennerian Institution, and reside in Orchard-street, Hackney—I have known the prisoner for many years—he was our collector up to the 12th of Dec, 1844—he was then dis<lb/>charged, and Mr. David Hine succeeded him—it had been his duty as col<lb/>lector to receive subscriptions, and to endeavour to obtain new subscribers—our institution is for the purpose of distributing vaccine matter, and to vacci<lb/>nate all who apply to the institution—we had a set of regular subscribers—the prisoner would have a report in his possession, containing their names—he was paid a per centage on his. collections formerly, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, as all his time was occupied; but latterly he was only engaged in collecting—he had no authority to receive subscriptions since Dec. 1844—Mr. Reeves has been a subscriber of ours for many years—no subscription of his has been paid to me by the prisoner since Dec. 1844.—I received none in Feb. 1846—this card (<hi rend="italic">looking at one affixed to the receipt</hi>) is not a card authorized by the institu<lb/>tion and this receipt is not one authorized by us, it is quite a different form—I produce one of the forms we use, and which the prisoner was in the habit of using when he was collector—I know Mr. Hine's signature—I do not believe</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been the secre<lb/>tary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between seven and eight years—the prisoner was collector for upwards of twenty years—the institution is conducted by a board of managers consisting of twelve—one of them has a rope wharf—he is not a ropemaker—one is a chemist and one a tailor, and Dr. Epps is one—we have two stations for vaccination—there is another institution, a government one—we have never represented ours as the government institution, nor pretended that we had a great many stations, for the purpose of getting money—I never heard of such a thing and do not believe it—I was a schoolmaster at Watford before I became secretary to this institution—I left there twenty-three years ago—I have since then held another situation for twenty-two years, as school-master at Hackney—I understand that the prisoner was thrown out of a gig while he was in the service of the society—he is crippled—I do not know whether his lameness proceeded from that circumstance or another—after he was dis<lb/>charged he stated that a sum of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to him—I have not seen him since his dismissal—he sent in an account for 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by his wife—I never heard him say, that as I would not pay him what was owing to him, he would col<lb/>lect the subscriptions and pay himself—I swear I did not hear him say so—I believe he was a very active collector, and that he advanced the interests of the institution as far as laid in his power—his brother is a life governor—the prisoner is brother to Mr. Chafey, the auctioneer, at Brighton—I do not know of his getting 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a lady of title—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was bequeathed to the society by a Mrs. Wakefield, but I do not know that the prisoner was instrumental in that—it came through another medium—we had sent out letters to the sub<lb/>scribers stating the prisoner's dismissal.</p>

I live in Cole-street, Dover-road, and am a clerk—on Friday, the 20th of Feb., I saw the prisoner running along Napier-street, Dover-road, from Kent-street, towards the Dover-road, running after a woman who was walking on the pavement, and calling to her to stop—he stopped her, and turned her against the wall—the first word I heard was his saying to her, "I will knock your b—eye out," and directly hit her in the face with his right fist apparently—the blow knocked her against the wall—he imme<lb/>diately put up his right foot, and kicked her in the lower part of her stomach, in her belly, as she was falling against the wall—he appeared to kick her as hard as he was able—she screamed out, and fell right down on the pave<lb/>ment—he then kicked her again in the same place as near as possible—I was about twenty yards from them—he then turned away from her, to come towards me, then turned back again, and lifted his foot, attempting to kick her again—some women came up, and said something to her which I did not hear—he turned from her, and did not kick her the third time—he then came towards Kent-street, towards me, walking as fast as he could—he passed a woman who said, "You brute, how could you serve a woman in that way? you are no man"—he turned round and said, "You old cow, you ought to be served in the same way"—I then said to him, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to use a woman in that way"—he said, "You had better go and pick her up"—he went towards the George, in Kent-street—I saw no more of him—I have since seen the prisoner in Horsemonger-lane, and I am certain he is the man—he had on a white smock frock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Richard Croggon, of Cottage-green, Camberwell. The prisoner has been in my service seven weeks—on the 26th of March I missed a brooch, a locket, and a ring, from my looking-glass drawer—I did not miss it till my daughter did—I knew it was there, because she kept it there—that was where I expected it to be—I spoke to the prisoner about it—she said she had seen it there some days before; she did not know where it was—I proceeded to search her box—she was present, and took the things out herself—it was not locked—I found a variety of articles in it—I found a child's spencer, and a shawl pinned up is the sleeves of her dress—they were all my husband's property—the prisoner said she picked them up in the dust-hole—they certainly would not have found their way to the dust-hole unless she put them there—I proposed to her to undress—she resisted—Mr. Croggon said he would send for a policeman—she then undressed in my presence, and I found round her waist a small worsted comforter, which was stuffed full of different articles—there were some muslin collars and a small silk handkerchief—she said she found them in the dust-hole—a policeman was sent for, and she was given into custody—I know these articles—they were found about her person and in her box—this brooch, gilt chain, silver thimble, and pen-knife, are the property of Mr. Croggon.</p>

I live at No. 7, Mint-street, as servant with my brother—he is a milk-man—Hall goes out washing and cleaning, she mostly works for her mother—she did live up stairs at my brother's—my brother is married—I think it is five weeks ago last saturday, I was going up Kent-street, to buy something for dinner, and saw the prisoner come out of the Black Horse—two boys ran by and threw a hearth-rug down at his feet—he stooped and picked it up—I said, "Young man, if I were you I would not have any<lb/>thing to do with it, I think it is stolen, by the manner the boys ran away"—he said, "I shall take care of it till it it owned"—he staid there five or ten minutes—I did not hear of his being taken before the Magistrate till teat week, when a man and woman were talking about it in a public-house, in Kent-street, they said they saw a young man taken up for a hearth-rug—I asked what time of the day—they said between eleven and twelve o'clock—I asked what sort of a young man—they described him, and I said, I saw it—I did not know the man and woman—they said his name was James Connelly—I heard he was fully committed to take his trial, that is what brought me here—I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge before, mat any of his family—I never heard that he had got a sister—I do not know Ann Sweeney.</p>
