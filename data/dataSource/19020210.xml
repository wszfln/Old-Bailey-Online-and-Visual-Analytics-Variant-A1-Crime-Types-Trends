I am a decorator of 14, Warbeck Road, Shepherd's Bush—on December 17th, between 11 and 12 a.m., I went to Mr. Evans' fish shop—I saw a small crowd outside—the deceased was holding the prisoner down in the doorway—he was partly kneeling on top of him—the prisoner was struggling to get up, and saying to the deceased, "Let me get up, you b—, I will settle and murder you"—a policeman came and helped him up—the deceased went back into the shop, and the prisoner went about 20 yards down the street—before he went away I heard him making some remarks, but I could not hear what they were—I saw some books in his pocket—he came back in about three minutes with some books in his hand and went in at the east door of the shop—the deceased was standing at the door—the prisoner put up his hand in a threatening manner and the deceased again called for the police—the prisoner came out of the shop and a policeman pushed or sent him away and followed him up—I should say he had been drinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had marks of ill-usage on his face, and his nose was bleeding—the deceased had been holding him by the throat—the prisoner was very excited—I did not see the deceased trying to prevent the prisoner from coming in at the door—I did not hear Miss Evans call out, "Let him come in, it is all right"—when the prisoner went away altogether the policeman was about 10 yards from the shop—the prisoner made the threatening gesture while the policeman was watch<lb/>ing the shop—when he finally ordered the prisoner away, he went away quietly—Miss Evans ran out of the shop and told the prisoner to be quiet—the policeman said to the deceased, 'Do you want to charge him?" and the deceased said, "Don't lock him up, let him go away and let him come to-morrow when he is sober," and Miss Evans said the same thing—she was there the whole time.</p>

Evans, a fishmonger of 62, Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush—I live there with my father, and am employed by him as book-keeper—on December 17th deceased was my father's foreman—he had been there for a very long time—till that day the prisoner was employed there as fish salesman—some years ago he had been errand boy-to my father—he left my father's service to better himself—he returned in the spring or summer of 1901—I used to sit in the office at the back of the shop—there were also employed in the shop two men named Cohen and Hodley—on December 17th he came into the shop between 11 and 12 a.m.—he came to my office for me to book the orders he had taken on his rounds—I thought he was intoxicated—he then put some fish on the slab, straight, and then he went over to the Black Prince public house opposite—he returned to the shop after some little time—the deceased was standing at the shop door, and I saw them have some conversation—I could not hear what they said, but from their demeanour I thought it was an angry conversation—then I saw them struggling together—the prisoner fell to the ground, and I saw the deceased holding him down—the prisoner was shouting and trying to kick the deceased—I went and asked the prisoner to go home, because he was intoxicated—he continued to struggle and shout—I asked a bystander to go for the police—a policeman came and pulled him up on his legs—he came into the shop to get his overcoat and then left—shortly afterwards I saw him standing in front of the east door of the shop—the deceased was standing in the shop and was going to prevent him coming in—the prisoner held up some small books to me, they were customers' books—I told the deceased it was all right and to let him come in—he handed me the books and left the shop—about half-an-hour afterwards he came in by the east door, and as he was coming towards my office I saw him pick up a small knife which was used in the shop for filleting—I do not remember where he picked it up from—the deceased was cleaning fish at the fish</p>

               <p>block—after the prisoner had picked up the knife, he went towards the fish slab—I came out of my office and said to him, "Put that knife down at once, <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>"—he threw it behind him on to the top of the cupboard—I said, "You had better come downstairs and have a cup of coffee"—I do not remember if he said anything—I took hold of his arm—he was still intoxicated—I led him through the door which led into the private house—he did not want to go, and he said he was very sorry, he did not mean anything, or something to that effect, and he burst out crying—I took him to the kitchen and made him a strong cup of coffee"—I left him there and went back to the shop—about 2 o'clock he came back to the shop—he seemed nearly sober then—he proposed to start his work again—I said, "You had better go home and come to-morrow"—he went away, and I saw no more of him that day—next morning he returned about 8.30—his ordinary hour of coming was 8 a.m.—my father was at the market—I told the prisoner not to start work till my father came home—I do not remember if I told him to come again when my father returned—the deceased was in the shop then—I do not think the prisoner spoke to him—he went away, and my father returned shortly afterwards—before he returned the prisoner came again, about 9.45—my father returned about ten and came to my desk and asked for 6s., the prisoner's wages for two days—he went outside and gave it to the prisoner—I do not remember what he said to him, something like "You had better go"—he dismissed him, and the prisoner went away, after he had asked my permission to fetch his apron from the kitchen, where he had left it the previous day—the deceased was present when the prisoner was paid his wages—after father had dismissed the prisoner I heard the deceased and the prisoner saying something, but I do not remember what it was—they both appeared to be angry—I did not see the prisoner again till between 10 and 11 p.m. on Monday, December 23rd—I was sitting in my office—the prisoner rushed in at the east door—he went straight up to the fish block—he took up this knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is used for cutting up big fish, and is kept anywhere about the shop—the deceased was standing near the scales on the counter—I saw the prisoner turn round with the knife in his hand—I rushed out of my office and went towards the counter where the scales were—by the time I got there I saw Cohen holding the prisoner and the deceased falling—I noticed some blood coming from the deceased's mouth—I cannot remember where the knife was then—my father was not in the shop then, but he came in directly afterwards—then a policeman came, and then a doctor—it was only a minute from the time I saw the prisoner rush in at the door to the time I saw the deceased falling—I thought the prisoner was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has been in my father's service ever since he was 13, with the exception of the six or seven months when he went away to better himself—after leaving school he went first to Mrs. Biggs, who kept a shop for my father at High Street, Acton, then he came to the shop in the Goldhawk Road, then in the spring of 1901 he went to better himself for six or seven months, and then returned to the Goldhawk Road shop—previous to that my father transferred him to Silver Street, Notting Hill, where we have a small shop—I have known him nine or ten years—after he came in from his rounds on December 17th, it would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190202100015"/>
               <p>be his duty to cleanse fish and to fillet them—the knife he took up would be the one ordinarily used in those duties—after he had had the coffee he wanted to work again—when he came at 8.30 on the 18th he and the deceased did not speak to each other—I was the only other person in the shop—when he finally left, angry words passed between them—when he came back to us in the spring of 1901 I noticed he was much more abrupt and irritable—I thought he was rather more sullen and gloomy—I con<lb/>sidered him not so good—he was more forgetful—I knew that in August, 1901, his brother-in-law had died leaving a widow and four children—he appeared very depressed about it—during the seven or eight years that he and the deceased had been together in my father's service I had never heard a threat or seen a sign of ill-feeling between them—I did not hear any threats which I could distinguish, used by the prisoner on the 17th when the men were struggling—on the 23rd I saw the prisoner was foaming at the mouth—after this affair was over I noticed that his eyes were staring and wide open—before the Coroner I said that ray reason for thinking he was not sober was because he looked so different to what I had seen him before—he looked wild—his eyes were wide open and he appeared to me to be foaming at the mouth—I did not notice when he came into the shop that his head was thrown back—I noticed it when he was being held after he struck the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I cannot remember when the transfer of the prisoner was made by my father—it was before he left in the Spring of last year—he was transferred because of his insobriety—he had occasionally come home from his rounds intoxicated, and my father thought that he met people he ought not to—he wished him to get into a new set—he was at the Notting Hill shop when he left to better himself—when he came back after that he seemed better as sobriety—since the Spring of last year I do not think I have seen him come home intoxicated before December 17th—I remember on one occasion he did, but then nothing to speak of—the filleting knife is the same pattern as a dinner knife, but very much smaller—I believe I did notice on December 17th what part of the shop he got the knife from, but I have forgotten now—he did nothing with it then—he simply went straight behind my desk—I do not know why I said to him, "Put down that knife at once, Fred"—if I thought he was going to do some mischief with it, I thought it was more to himself—I cannot say if he was foaming at the mouth when he came into the shop on December 23rd, because he came in so hurriedly—I lost sight of him from the time he picked up the knife until I saw the deceased fall—I next saw him when he was being held—Hodley and Cohen were holding him, and, I believe, a stranger also—I cannot remember how they were holding him.</p>

I live at 30, Newcombe Street, Notting Hill—a few days before December 30th I was employed by Mr. Evans to take the prisoner's place—about 11 p.m. on December 23rd I was in the shop, which was being got ready for closing—I saw the prisoner come into the shop—I can hardly say by which door—he said, "You b—where is my knife I—took no notice, because I had been told he had left a small filleting knife at the shop—I went out to take some goods in—I heard someone say, "Don't, Fred" as I was</p>

               <p>returning with the geese—that was about a minute after he came in—I saw he had this knife in his right hand against the ice box—I rushed up towards him and got hold of his wrist and wrested the knife away from him—I noticed the deceased for the first time on the floor near where the scales stand on the counter—just as I had hold of the prisoner, Hodley rushed up and got both his hands round his neck and pushed him towards the ice box—at that moment a stranger came through the door and caught hold of him—I have not seen him since—I went for Dr. Leith.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer.</hi>) I went to Mr. Evans' shop a little before 11 p.m. on December 23rd—I saw the deceased lying on the floor—the prisoner was being held down on the ice block by three men—I said to the men, "I am a police officer, let me have him"—I was not in uniform—Dowding came to my assistance and we took the prisoner to the station—we took him out of the shop by the side entrance to avoid the crowd—on the way to the station he said, "I am very sorry for what I have done, I was in drink at the time, my sister came down with me, I have a sister left with four little children; this man has got me out of my place, he has done me a lot of harm"—that was not all said at once, but at different times as we went to the station—it took us 20 minutes to walk there—it was raining very hard and a crowd of people were following—he appeared to me to have been drinking very heavily—when I first saw him at the shop he was foaming at the mouth and trying to resist being held, he was looking very peculiar about his eyes, he had got his eyes up towards the ceiling.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner of 117, Goldhawk Road—I saw the deceased in Evans' shop on the night of December 23rd—he was dead—I examined him then and subsequently—I found two wounds on the left forearm—they could have been caused by the man when putting up his hand to ward off a blow with a knife—another wound had penetrated the left lung and the heart and fractured the third rib—that wound caused instantaneous death, and could have been caused by this knife—the three wounds, in my opinion, were caused by three separate stabs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Eleanor Road, Barnes—I used to be a domestic servant—I live at home now—I kept company with the prisoner for two and a half years—part of that time I was in service at Castleneau, Barnes—I broke off keeping company with the prisoner on November 17th last, because he used to have fits and knock me about so—he has had a good many fits when I have been out with him—I cannot say how many—when he had fits he used to foam at the mouth and his eyes would look very strange and he would clench his hands—he has struck me on several occasions, but never when he was not in a fit—I have told him of his ill-using me, and he has never remembered it—he said he had never done it—on January 8th, 1900, when I was in service at Castleneau, I remember being called by a stranger to the prisoner, who was in a fit in the street—at that time I did not know he had fits—he was sitting on the coping of a house down the road—I stayed with him till he got better, when he went home—I remember his brother-in-law dying in August 1901—he has had much worse fits since then—he would look very strange for a few hours after he had had a fit—the last fit I remember was on November 17th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never had to call for assistance to take the prisoner home when he has had a fit—I have never seen him the worse for drink—I told his mother that he foamed at the mouth—I did not tell Inspector Reynolds about it, because he did not ask me, or about the strangeness in his eyes—the Inspector asked me what the prisoner was like when he had fits—I told him he clenched his hands—on January 8th, 1900, I thought he had been drinking till I knew he had fits—he never remembered what was going on when he was having a fit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 93, Studley Grange Road—about 14 or 15 years ago I was manageress to Mr. Evans at his shop in High Street, Acton, while the prisoner was employed there as errand boy—he was there for four or four and a half years—I have known him almost from birth—I know his mother and family—I have known him on and off right up to the present time—while he was with me he complained very much of his head—I have seen him in fits several times—he used to rub the back of his head and put his hands across—I first knew him to have a fit when he was between three and four—he got so agitated that I would have to send him home on account of his health—he would bite his lips, and he could not hold himself up, and he trembled very much—he was 18 or 19 when he left me—I have not seen him in a fit since—I have only seen him in three fits—he would then fall down and foam at the mouth and bite himself—once he bit his tongue severely—his eyes seemed to project out and he would turn them up—I know he was attended by Dr. Gardiner and by Dr. Baracoe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The fit which the prisoner had when he was three or four years old was not the ordinary convulsion which a child of that age often has—I have seen a child in convulsions, the eyes do not turn up then, the hands being clenched is a common thing—he was older when he bit his tongue—sometimes the prisoner would not go home, and I had send for his mother—he complained of his head all the time I had him—on one occasion he went to the stable, and we did not know where he was—when the man went to bed the pony up he found him in a truss of straw, and when we woke him up he declared we had put him there—he would not go home and I had to get my husband to take him home.</p>

I am the medical officer at His Majesty's Prison at Holloway—the prisoner was received there on December 24th—I have kept him under personal observation since—I have had conver<lb/>sations with him about his health and condition—he said he has had fairly good health, that he had not had fits, but had what he called faint attacks at times, when he went hot and cold; that during the three months previous to this affair he had taken rather more drink than he had been in the habit of doing—he said he had never met with any serious accident; that he had fallen out of carts occasionally, but not hurt himself; that he had had influenza twice—he has always been rational in his conduct, and not unnaturally depressed, considering his position—he has frequently complained of pains in his head, sometimes in the front, and sometimes at the back of his head—some of his nights were restless, but generally he slept well—I have detected no signs of insanity, and he has had no epileptic attacks—I had one report that he was faint—it was so short I did not see it myself—in my opinion he is of sound mind—I have heard the evidence and seen the depositions in this case—I see nothing in the prisoner's condition on December 23rd which is inconsistent with the condition arising from drunkenness—there are several features which make it rather improbable that his condition arose from an epileptic fit, although I cannot say it is impossible—during an epileptic fit a person is unconscious most of the time—as a rule they do not know what has taken place when they come to their senses—I have never heard or known of a case where a person has hastened or run nearly a mile to attack another person in an epileptic fit.</p>

I am a carman, of Cannon Street Road, East End—before this date I knew neither the prosecutor nor the prisoner—shortly before 12, on January 21st, I was passing through Brick Lane and saw the prisoner go up to the prosecutor, snatch his handkerchief off his neck, and strike him on his jaw—then two men rushed upon him, knocked him down, kicked him while he was on the ground, and the taller of the two put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket—the prisoner was kicking him while he was on the ground and shouting, "Go on <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, go on Arthur, kick him, kill him"—I said it was a cowardly thing to do to a man on the ground—they said they would do the same to me—there was no one about at the time—a police whistle was blown, and the two men ran down Eyre Street and the prisoner walked off down Slater Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This lasted about a quarter of an hour, and when the whistle was blown some people came up—I was standing close by—when the police came I went away—I did not give my name to the police—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am an official of the London Bankruptcy Court—I produce the file of proceedings in the bankruptcy of Frank Mievelle &amp; Son, of Angel Court, who are described as foreign bankers—the petition is dated March 12th, 1901, the receiving order March 27th, 1901, and the adjudication of the debtors on May 1st, 1901—the two partners who were so adjudicated were John Frank Mievelle and Lester Guy Humphery, the present defendant—this is the statement of the affairs of the firm filed by the defendant; it shows liabilities £15,923 1s. 7d., and assets £222 10s. 3d.—there is one fully secured creditor—the net deficiency is £13,163 1s. 4d.—there is also on the file the statement of affairs of Mr. Humphery in his separate estate, showing estimated assets £151 10s., and liabilities £55 9s. 8d., with a surplus of £96—upon the file is a transcript of the defendant's public examination, which took place on June 11th, 1901—each sheet purports to be signed by the debtor. (<hi rend="italic">Certain questions and answers of the examination were here read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The petition of March 12th was founded upon a judgment obtained by Martin's Bank in relation to £1,989 5s. 2d.—the receiving order following the petition was on March 27th, and that was followed by a statutory meeting of creditors on April 22nd—after the adjudication on May 1st the defendant filed his statement of affairs—the unsecured creditors were 13, fully secured one—the public examination was on June 11th, 1901—on July 15th there was a private sitting, at which Mr. Barrett attended—the trustee's report is dated October 17th, 1901—the defendant's application for his discharge on November 29th has been adjourned, and nothing has been done in it—the date of the order to prosecute is December 21st, 1901—I attended with the file and gave evidence at the Mansion House in this case on December 17th, when the defendant was committed for trial.

                  </hi>. I am a banker and a representative of the firm of C. J. Hambro &amp; Son, bankers, of 70, Old Broad Street—for some years past we have had transactions with the firm of Frank Mievelle &amp; Son—during the last year or two in dealing with that firm we principally transacted business with the defendant—on Jannary 29th, 1901, we wanted to buy cheques on Paris, and I bought a cheque from defendant for 75,000 francs, about £3,000—that was a purchase on the Exchange at between 1.30 and 2.30—the rate of Exchange at which I bought was 25.14 francs as shown in this contract—on the same day I got a cheque</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190202100035"/>
               <p>drawn by Mievelle &amp; Son for 75,000 francs on Henrot et Fils, of Paris; they are Paris bankers—it would be the usual custom to pay for such a cheque the next day, but on this occasion I paid the same day because the prisoner asked me to do so and allowed us one day's interest—this is the cheque I signed on behalf of Hambro &amp; Son, dated January 29th, payable to Frank Mievelle &amp; Son, or bearer—it is equivalent to 75,000 francs", less a day's interest—the cheque we received from the defendant was paid by Henrot et Fils—I met the prisoner on the Exchange, and I said I was a buyer of cheques on Paris.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The firm of Mievelle has been established for some years, it is not what you would call an old firm—I knew Mr. John Frank Mievelle for many years—he was the senior partner of the firm—I believe for some time he had not been attending to the firm's business—I had not seen him on 'Change for some little time prior to this matter—I have done business with the firm frequently prior to January, 1901—I might have said to the defendant on this day, "I can use a cheque on Paris to-day; have you anything to do?"—he would come up to me and I might say that—I stand there and he comes up to me—on this occasion I might have approached him first and made the suggestion that I could do with a cheque on Paris—the interest for the day was at three or four per cent., and that works out on this amount to about 5s. 6d., a very small amount—payment on the same day has occurred in times prior to 29th January—it has been made on the same day, on the same terms as with this transaction, on previous occasions—I should say the usual practice is to pay on the following day, but it is not an unusual thing to pay the same day as between anybody—I know the defendant's father was one of the proprietors of Hay's Wharf—his uncle, Mr. Hugh Collins Smith, is a director of Hay's Wharf, and was a governor of the Bank of England.</p>

I am sub-manager of the London Agency of the Societe Generale de Credit Industriel in Paris, which is commonly called the Credit Industriel—their office is at 126, Cannon Street—on January 29th, 1901, I purchased from the defendant a cheque on Paris for 31,500 francs at the rate of Exchange of 25 francs 14 1/4 cents.—this is the contract (C); paying for it on the same day at his request by a cheque (D) for £1,252 13s. 10d.—the usual practice in banking is to pay the following day—he allowed me a day's interest for the accommodation, which I deducted from the cheque—the cheque which he handed me for 315 francs was drawn on Henrot et Fils at Paris.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The day's interest amounted to 3s.—4d.—I have very frequently dealt with Frank Mieville &amp; Son for some years—I have not seen Mr. Mieville for some time; I believe the whole conduct of the firm has rested with the defendant for some little time—I have seen Mr. Mieville on 'Change, but I cannot say definitely whether between 1899 and 1901—I had heard he was not well—I had paid the defendant on the same day on other occasions, and I may have done it to one other firm I do not think I can recollect more than one other firm, unless they were ordinary commercial firms, who asked for that accommodation—among my clients if a commercial firm were to come and ask to be paid the same day</p>

I am the senior partner in the firm of Samuel Montague &amp; Company, of 60, Old Broad Street, bankers and bullion dealers—I have had 54 years experience in foreign bankers' business in London—I am qualified to speak of the custom on the Exchange with regard to the buying and selling of foreign bills and cheques—it is almost the invariable custom to pay the next day for foreign bills which are bought—that has been the custom for about 20 years—prior to that we used to buy on Tuesday and pay on Friday, or buy on Friday and pay on Tuesday, but there were two cases of fraud under that system, and the custom was altered, to diminish the possibility of fraud, to payment on the next day—we could not have the money the same day as a rule, because we deliver the bills as a rule in the afternoon, after the banking hours—the alteration was made at my instance, after consulting Messrs. Baring and Messrs. Rothschild to get the cash next day—if the person buying is a bill broker, we rely on his having the principal at his bank, or on order, if he is not dealing on his own account</p>

               <p>—the assumption is that we know we shall be paid—if he gives us the name of his principal, we look to his principal—if he does not give us the name of a principal, we look to him—it is understood that he has the money when he buys a foreign cheque of us, if he does not give the name of his principal—I have known the firm of Mieville &amp; Son on Change for some years—for the last year or more before their failure defendant conducted the business of the firm on the Exchange almost entirely—I hardly remember seeing Mr. Mieville on 'Change for a year before this transaction—on January 29th, 1901, the defendant on the Exchange purchased of me a cheque on Paris for 57,500 francs 13 1/2—this is the contract (H)—I believe he handed me that on 'Change, or he might have sent it on afterwards—the usual custom is to give it at once, but I was so busy on 'Change I am not sure if he gave it to me—the equivalent in English money would be £2,287 12s. 10d.—on the same day he purchased of me a cheque on Antwerp for 299 francs at the rate of Exchange of 25 francs 15 1/2—this is the contract note—I delivered to him the same day our cheque for 57,500 francs drawn on the Credit Lyonnaise of Paris and also our cheque on Antwerp for 299 francs—those two total up to £2,299 10s. 7d.—in accordance with the usual custom I gave the defendant credit till the following day for that amount—on the following day, January 30th, my firm drew on Mieville &amp; Son, in accor<lb/>dance with the usual practice, for that amount, £2,299 10s. 7d.—I believe the acceptance of that to be in the defendant's writing—he accepted it payable at the Head Office of the London and Westminster Bank—it was presented the same day and dishonoured—on the following day, January 31st, I received this letter (L) from the defendant's firm, dated January 30th, and addressed to us [<hi rend="italic">Expressing regret that in consequence of the failure of a firm with whom Frank Mievelle &amp; Son had had long business connections, they were obliged to ask for Montague &amp; Co's kind consideration for about 14 days; that their books had been placed in the hands of Messrs.

Pollock, and that they hoped to make a satisfactory proposal, as their total shortage, as they then made it out, was less than £3,000.</hi>]—we have received no portion of the £2,299 10s. 7d.—we have not received a penny of the £11 17s. 9d. which the defendant received from Messrs. Simpson and Co.—I knew he was buying that cheque on Antwerp for Messrs. Simpson &amp; Co.—it is in the contract, and in drawing our cheque on Antwerp we made it payable to Simpson &amp; Co.—upon receipt of the letter of January 30th from the defendant announcing his inability to pay, we stopped our Antwerp cheque and tried to stop the French cheque also, but we were too late—when we subsequently discovered that Simpson and Co. had actually paid the defendant for that cheque, we removed the stop and allowed our cheque to be honoured, and it was paid with the charges which had been incurred in protesting it—after I received the defendant's letter of January 30th, I sent for him, and he came to my private room at the office on the 31st—I reproached him for his conduct—he said he had only continued that which Mr. Mieville had done before—I said, "If Mr. Mieville had told you to pick my pocket, would you have done so?"—he said, "No"—I said, "That is what you have done"'—he burst into tears—it was a very painful</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190202100038"/>
               <p>interview, and I was glad when it was over—I said that if he had come to me for assistance I might have helped him—we found out that he had been selling at a loss for many days before that, and on this particular day he was carrying out these transactions at a loss—he lost half a cent in one case, three-quarters of a cent in another, and paid for that day's interest—I certainly would not have given him those cheques if I had known he was carrying on business in that way—I should presume he was carrying on business, in the way usual with brokers, at a profit—we have not had an instance of non-payment like this for 20 years—the defendant must have been paying at the rate of 15 to 20 per cent on the transaction for the use of the money—we always looked on the firm of Frank Mieville and Son, as an honourable, respectable firm—we never heard anything against them—it dwindled rather—it was a dwindled firm, but respectable—I should say in 999 cases out of 1,000 in transactions on 'Change the custom is to pay the next day—sometimes when documents have to be cleared we may be asked to pay the same day, but it is looked on as a sign of weakness in the seller if he asks to be paid the same day—we should be rather frightened to deal—I am speaking of the case of a broker.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The firm used to be Courtland and Mieville, and then it was the firm of Frank Mieville and Son, some ten or fifteen years after—it was an old firm changed into Frank Mieville and Son—the old firm was one of the best firms of brokers in the city—I knew it fifty years ago—Frank Mieville's uncle retired and took away, I believe, a great part of the capital, and then the nephew took it up—that was about 1889—I never heard anything against the firm until this transaction—it had a reputation not of wealth but of respectability—since 1900 Mr. Frank Mieville has not attended much to the business—I only saw him twice about that period—I had not seen him for many months before this transaction—the business then devolved on the defendant—the firm of Mieville dealt with us buying and selling, chiefly buying, during the whole time of their existence as a firm—at my interview with the defendant on January 31st, I cannot be sure if he told me he was trying to get time for the firm—I do not remember his saying that—he only said the practice of buying for the next day and selling for cash had been commenced long ago by Mr. Mieville, and he had continued it—he may have said he had been trying to get time for the firm—I think he said something about its being a hard struggle, but I did not pay much attention to his particular words—I was angry with him for the way he had duped us—I was astonished, too—possibly he may have said the had been trying to get money from his friends—I am sure he did not mention that Mr. Mieville had been approached for the purposes of getting money from Mr. Mieville's friends, I do not believe he did—I do not think he said that the effort to get money from his friends had been depending on the efforts of Mr. Mieville to get money from his friends, and in that way he was struggling on to carry on the business; the interview was very short—I was astounded at what had occurred, and I was glad to get him out of the place—he may have said he was struggling to get on and trying to get money; I did not pay much attention to him—I think Martin's Bank began civil proceedings against Mieville and Son immediately after the 31st, as soon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190202100039"/>
               <p>as they could—in those proceedings their solicitors, Goldberg, Barrett, and Newall, whom we also consulted, acted for them—I wanted to take criminal proceedings at once—Messrs. Martin instituted civil proceedings, which were followed by proceedings in bankruptcy—Goldberg, Barrett, and Newall were not my solicitors until this occasion; they became our solicitors as soon as we consulted Messrs. Martin—that was a day or two after January 31st, or perhaps the 31st—after that date they acted for us as well as for Martin's—I do not think our claim was put forward, we thought it was not a debt—I believe it was put forward later on in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings—I left the matter in Goldberg, Barrett, and Newall's hands, except that I proposed they should go before the Lord Mayor at once; I think I said that the same day, somewhere about January 31st or February 1st—I believe the solicitors carried on negociations under which we would accept payment of so much in the £in relation to this debt on behalf of ourselves and Martin's Bank—one of my partners was very averse to any settlement except taking criminal proceedings—I told the defendant on January 31st that this was a case of picking pockets—I believe the solicitors tried to obtain a settle<lb/>ment for so much in the £for Martin's Bank and ourselves—I do not know if those negociations went on for six weeks—I will not say they did not; it is very likely—they began about February 1st and went on to the middle of March—we were advised to wait till the bankruptcy—I fancy the negociations were on the basis that if 10s. in the £were paid we would not press the firm into bankruptcy—I should have to consult my co-creditors, Messrs. Martin—I do not know that the question of bankruptcy was a condition—no resolution was come to—we should have decided yes or no when we had the proposition—I had several visits from Messrs. Goldberg and Barrett—at first Mr. Goldberg acted and afterwards Mr. Barrett—they came and saw me between February 1st and the middle of March—they said the matter would be taken up by the Public Prosecutor in some way if we took it before the Lord Mayor—that representation was made between the 1st of February and the middle of March—they advised us not to take criminal proceedings, because they said the same result would come from the bankruptcy, and the Public Prosecutor would take up the case—I suppose I was a party to the negociations under which we should get 10s. in the £, and if the matter afterwards went into bankruptcy we were assured that the Public Prosecutor would take up the case, but we did not know of the facts of the case—I do not say that I was assured by the solicitors that if we got half our debt, neverthe<lb/>less there might be a prosecution—it was very likely said that if 10s. in the £were forthcoming we would guarantee that there would be no bankruptcy; as far as we were concerned we did not take any bankruptcy proceedings—we did not know then the facts we knew later on—we did not know what had occurred—even after the petition was presented on March 12th negociations might still have gone on for the payment of 10s. in the £—it was not stated to me that the understanding was that the petition should be withdrawn if the payment of 10s. in the £was forth<lb/>coming; I suppose that would have been the result—the 10s. was not forthcoming; other facts were disclosed—on June 11th the defendant attended for his public examination, I believe—I attended a private</p>

               <p>sitting—I suppose July 12th was the date—Mr. Barrett was there on both occasions—I believe December 2nd, 1901, was the date when I swore the Information at the Mansion House, I suppose in conjunction with Martin's Bank representative—we did not set out in the information the negociations which had been proceeding from the 1st February to the middle of March in regard to a settlement of our claims by a payment of 10s. in the £—we had determined that the facts disclosed necessitated other proceedings—the Public Prosecutor took the case up—I do not know whether the order of the Bankruptcy Court was on the 21st December—I believe I was informed of the result of the bankruptcy examination on the 11th June—I did not hear the answers that were given then—I was there when the application was made for his discharge—I may have heard something of what the defendant said on his public examination—I knew about the transaction with Henrot, I think, only a short time before we took criminal proceedings—I do not think I took the trouble to inform myself about his answers, except casually; I may have been told some of them—Mr. Barrett reported generally, I suppose—when I swore the information in December I knew generally, but not all the details—I may have heard the statement as to his drawings, and one or two things may have been told me, but I did not trouble myself very much about it—I swore in the information that on January 28th, 1901, the firm of Frank Mieville &amp; Son had decided to stop payment and had called in an accountant, who appears to have suggested that the firm should carry on another day so as to give the accountant a chance of going through the books; Mr. Barrett told me that—I remember now that one important fact, and perhaps two or three others, but not all the details—it is quite impossible for me to fix the date when he told me that the defendant had said that it was in January, and owing to the failure of Schmolze and Reischmann, and the subsequent failure of Herbert Alexander, that his firm had been practically brought to the ground—I do not think it was long before the Mansion House proceedings—the delay was because I was told that the Public Prosecutor would take the case up immediately—I was not told that on January 31st—they said that was likely to be done, and the application was made, I was told, to the Public Prosecutor, and he said he would take it up after committal—information of that character was not given to me about January 31st, 1901—they dissuaded me from taking criminal proceedings, saying it would be better to wait for the bankruptcy, when the Public Prosecutor would take it up—that is if, in the proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court, evidence was elicited which showed some criminal offence had been committed—until that was done there was no order to prosecute—we were guided by our solicitors—if Martin's Bank and my partners had agreed, I should not have opposed the accepting of 10s. in the £—I should have acted in that way, as my solicitors recommended—I am not so sure that there would have been no prosecution—I do not think my partners would have agreed to that—there would have been no bankruptcy if the other persons interested had agreed—we did not know until much later on the facts in the bankruptcy, and I thought it was necessary that we should endeavour, if we could, as a duty, to prevent the insecurity that would arise unless we did take those steps in our dealings on Change—I was present on November 29th when the defendant asked for his discharge—the proceedings only took a few</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190202100041"/>
               <p>minutes—I do not think he received then the first intimation that criminal proceedings were contemplated against him—I think he must have known at the private examination—I cannot say if he would have presented himself and applied for his discharge on November 29th if he knew criminal proceedings were pending against him—payment the same day is most unusual in dealings on the Exchange—Mr. Bagster is a person of some experience with regard to such dealings—I do not think that any one can speak with more authority than myself—I do not deny that Mr. Bagster is qualified to speak as far as his experience goes—Messrs. Hambro is a considerable firm—it is extremely unusual in transactions on the Exchange to pay the same day, and I think Mr. Bagster said so; he said the usual practice was to pay the next day—I think we may have ten contracts to his one—I agree with him that it is unusual to pay the same day; I disagree with him that it is not unusual to pay the same day—Mr. Knapp does not come on 'Change, and it does not apply to him—if we dealt with a comparative stranger we should ask for the money the same day but it would not be on 'Change, but at our own office—a merchant might ask his broker, but he would not give bills, but his own cheque—it is a sign of weakness if a man cannot wait till the next day—it is very unusual to ask for the money the same day, except in the case of a very small merchant—half a cent would be 10d. in each £100, about 8s. per.£1,000—the rate of Exchange is worked very closely, the most closely of any Exchange operated on here—at 15 or 20 per cent., which the defendant was paying for interest and the difference in the rate of Exchange, it would work out at £20 in the course of a year—the rate of Exchange fluctuates very slightly; half a cent is considered a large fluctuation—it would not fluctuate here except a telegraphic communication came from Paris, and that arrives after the Exchange is closed, very rarely before—if the bank rate went up or down it would affect the rate; we should know that at 12 or 12-30; in those cases there would be perhaps a fluctuation of half a cent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not know until after the defendant's failure that he had been doing the same kind of thing for some days before at a loss, or we should never have trusted him; I found out afterwards by enquiry in February that he had had repeated transactions, losing money by them—I was angry at my interview with him because he had deceived me; I thought he was incapable of doing such a thing; the money was not of very great importance—he had deceived me by buying a thing for which he could not pay, and did not pay, and had not the likelihood of paying, and it was the first case in 20 years that had occurred—my firm did not take any civil proceedings for the recovery of this money from the defendant—the writ was issued against him at the instance of Martin's Bank—I do not think it was issued in any sense on our behalf or in' our interest—I do not know whether we should have participated in it later on—the writ only claimed the money due to Martin's Bank, but I suppose our claim would have been similar to it—we made no claim, we always thought our claim was not an ordinary debt—at the time I first consulted Messrs. Goldberg and Barrett I had no information as to the defendant's knowledge of his own pecuniary position, except the letter which we Received—I had no previous knowledge of his position—it was by the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190202100042"/>
               <p>questions in the bankruptcy examination alone that I learned what his previous knowledge of the position was—I think we proved in the bankruptcy for our debt, but we put against it that we did not consider it was an ordinary debt—that was my opinion about the transaction—I do not know what form it took exactly—the defendant would schedule us among his creditors—we certainly did not approach the defendant or his advisers with a view to settlement after the proceedings had been begun by Martin's Bank—I think the proposals I have been asked about came from the defendant and his advisers; I cannot be certain about that.</p>

I am the manager of Martin's Bank, Ltd., 68, Lombard Street—on January 29th, 1901, the defendant on the Exchange purchased of me this Paris cheque (N) for 50,000 francs at the rate of Ex<lb/>change of 25 francs 13 1/2 c.—this is the contract—the equivalent in English money is £1,989 5s. 2d.—we drew our cheque on Messrs. J. Allard &amp; Co., of Paris—on the next day, January 30th, I drew on Frank Mieville &amp; Son for £1,989 5s. 2d.—this is his acceptance (O)—it is the defendant's writing—our cheque for 50,000 francs has been duly paid by the drawees, our Paris house—the defendant's acceptance when presented on the 30th was dishonoured—we received this letter from the defendant on January 31st. (<hi rend="italic">This was in similar terms to that written to Sir Samuel Montague and Co.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not have an interview with the defendant—I saw him about 16 days after receiving the letter—I said I was sorry for him—I have no recollection of saying I desired to help him as far as I could—we instructed Messrs. Goldberg, one of the firm of solicitors to the Bank, and a writ was issued—we gave them instructions before I had some interviews with Sir Samuel Montague—probably he sent round and asked us to call on him, a day or two afterwards, within a week I think—the civil proceedings had not been begun then—I think Mr. Pollock, the defendant's solicitor, made some proposals in writing to Mr. Goldberg—probably it was after those proposals were made that we saw Sir Samuel Montague, but it was not on account of the proposals—the writ was issued after that, but not for some time—we proceeded to judgment, and then a bankruptcy notice was issued, and a bankruptcy petition filed on March 12th—between 2nd February and 12th March negociations were proceeding between Messrs. Goldberg and Mr. Pollock—Mr. Goldberg said it was done simply to gain time—we did not attach any real importance to it—we thought we must give him time—there were no serious negociations—he said he would be able to make an offer in writing, but it never came to anything—I do not think I have had submitted to me a correspondence from February 7th to March 21st between Messrs. Goldberg and Mr. Pollock and Messrs. Preen—I did not learn what was being done—I thought they were waiting to see if anything came from Mr. Pollock's offer, which was 10s. in the £ to the best of my recollection—Mr. Pollock has since died—I don't think Messrs. Goldberg went quite so far as to say that if the offer could be secured to their satisfaction they would accept it and there need be no bankruptcy proceedings—I understood they would advise us to accept it—during this time we saw Sir Samuel Montague on the Exchange occasionally and mentioned to him the fact of Mr. Pollock's letter—there</p>

               <p>were no serious negociations—we never seriously entertained it—Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Goldberg, Barrett, and Newall, solicitors, of West Street, Finsbury Circus—for some years we have acted as solicitors to Martin's Bank—I believe Mr. Goldberg was first consulted about this matter on January 31st or February 1st—I was away at the time—on February 7th we issued this writ on behalf of Martin's Bank, claiming £1,989 due upon the bill which had been accepted by the defendant—judgment was signed on February 23rd—I think appearance was entered, and I believe we made application under Order 14—on February 23rd a bankruptcy notice was issued—prior to the issue of the writ I do not think there were negociations for a settle<lb/>ment of Martin's claim—we were approached by Harvey Preen, an accountant, and he made a proposal, presumably with a view to a settlement—I think Mr. Pollock came to see us first—he made one or two suggestions—the object, I believe, was to gain time—that was the view we took of it—I think Mr. Pollock called two or three times—Mr. Preen submitted a statement of the defendant's affairs, and on March 6th or 7th we told Mr. Pollock that nothing less than 10s. in the £would be entertained—that was communicated to Mr. Preen as well, I think—up to that time we had never had instructions from Sir Samuel Montague that he would accept anything in settlement—I knew we were acting for both parties, but we were suing for Martin's bank, and I take it that up to the beginning of March it was for Martin's bank, because I don't know that we were doing anything for Sir Samuel Montague so far as these negociations were concerned, up to the beginning of March—after we intimated that nothing less than 10s. in the £would be accepted, the matter took no definite shape, but fell through—it was rather what we had anticipated, and we continued our proceedings—I advised the private</p>

               <p>examination on July 15th—at an interview we had on February 8th, 9th or 10th, Sir Samuel Montague &amp; Co. desired criminal proceedings to be taken—that was in confirmation of what I had heard before—my partner and I advised it would be better not to take criminal proceedings at that time, as if we made the debtor bankrupt, the whole facts could then be got out—the defendant would be on oath—I had not obtained the whole of the facts till after the public examination—on behalf of the trustee I caused the bankrupt to be examined at a private sitting—the defendant was not only examined at that, but at the public examination—I applied for the private sitting at the end of May or beginning of June, immedi<lb/>ately following the public examination—having obtained the evidence at the public and private examinations on 31st July on behalf of the trustee I submitted the whole of the facts to Counsel for an opinion, which we got, I think, a day or two before the long vacation—then the long vacation intervened, and we could not apply to the Court till November, as it was not vacation business—at the end of October we applied to the Registrar for an order to prosecute on behalf of the trustee—he adjourned it, and it stood over two or three weeks for his consideration—ultimately we went before the Registrar, and he considered that this was an unusual prosecution under Section 14, and the suggestion was made that we should start the prosecution, and on committal the order to prosecute should go—from the first, so far as our interviews with Sir Samuel Montague are concerned, he and his firm were anxious to take criminal proceedings—we were consulted with that view—Sir Samuel Montague said that, so far as his own views were concerned, it was only on our advice that it was postponed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> About the beginning of February Sir Samuel Montague expressed the desire to take criminal proceedings—I do not admit we have had negociations; proposals were made to us by Mr. Harvey Preen and Mr. Pollock at that time—proposals were received and entertained by us principally, if not wholly, on behalf of Martin's Bank, but I believe that certainly from towards the end of February whatever proposals were made were submitted to Sir Samuel Montague &amp; Co. about the first week in March—a proposal was made in writing to pay £100 down, and then something else—the definite proposal was about the end of February or beginning of March—that was submitted to Martin's Bank and to Sir Samuel Montague—before that, other proposals had come forward, which we had rejected—we should probably submit those to Martin's Bank, but I cannot quite say we should to Sir Samuel Montague; we may have done so, but if we considered them too small we should not—(<hi rend="italic">The witness was referred to letters of February</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th and</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th with regard to the proposal, and to subsequent correspondence.</hi>)—it is clear from my answer that I did not submit the proposal to Sir Samuel Montague &amp; Co.—we were in communication with Sir Samuel Montague &amp; Co. as from March 6th, and acting on their behalf—in the letter of March 9th the total indebtedness is stated to be £4,700; I do not doubt that that includes Sir Samuel Montague's debt—10s. in the £ on that would amount to £2,350—the petition was filed on March 12th—I daresay negociations proceeded even after the filing of the petition, as is usual when the debtor wants to get the petition dismissed—I have the letters of March 18th and 20th—it</p>

               <p>was with a view of compromising the petitioning creditor's debt and getting the petition dismissed—in the course of the correspondence refer<lb/>ence is made to the help which is expected to come from Mr. Mieville and his friends, and how the defendant was doing the best he could in the circumstances of the case—I do not know whether, if 10s. in the £ had been forthcoming up to March 21st, we should not have proceeded in bankruptcy; I should have taken my client's instructions, and if my clients had been willing to take 10s. in the £ there would have been an end of the bankruptcy proceedings—you can only withdraw a petition by order of the Court—I should have taken instructions as to applying for it.</p>

I am a clerk in the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury—Frank Mieville &amp; Co. have an account there—I produce a certified copy showing the account from January 28th to 31st, 1901, inclusive—on evening of 27th there was £377 17s. 2d. to credit; on evening of 28th the balance was £57 7s. 2d.; on evening of 30th, £9 16s.; and on evening of 31st, £3 1s. 3d.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to John Annan, Dexter, &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants, of Ironmonger Lane—Mr. John Annan, one of the partners, was trustee in the bankruptcy of Mieville &amp; Son—under his superinten<lb/>dence I have investigated the books and affairs of this firm, including the ledger, which contains an account of the firm with Henrot et Fils, of Paris—it shows that on the morning of January 29th, 1901, Mieville &amp; Son were in debt to Henrot et Fils about £116—Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann are returned by the defendant in the bankruptcy proceedings as debtors to the firm for £1,164 15s. 9d., for bills under the heading doubtful debts—the state of affairs was sworn on April 16th, and the receiving order is dated March 27th—the deficiency account prepared by the defendant is on the file, and purports to account for the deficiency, there being £13,163—he puts down the nett loss on trading from January, 1900, at £1,040, the draw<lb/>ings of Mr. Mieville at £136, and himself at £1,044; that is under expenses incurred since December 31st, 1899, up to the date of filing the statement of affairs—Alexander &amp; Co. have failed; I cannot speak to the date—I should not think their failure increased the liabilities of the defen<lb/>dant firm; they were endorsers of bills to Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann, who had endorsed, in due course, to Mieville &amp; Son—I should not think Alexander's failure increased the liability of Mieville &amp; Son after January 1st.—Alexander &amp; Co. had endorsed bills to Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann, and Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann, in the ordinary course of trade, I suppose, had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190202100046"/>
               <p>endorsed them to Mieville &amp; Son—it is in respect of the same bills that the defendant speaks, when he speaks of Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann having failed, and so caused loss to his firm—I should not think the loss sustained by Mieville &amp; Son in consequence of the failure of Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann accounted for the deficiency of Mieville &amp; Son, for the reason that the deficiency as per statement of affairs is £13,361, and I do not know the exact figure at which Mieville &amp; Son place Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann's liabilities to them, but I am pretty sure it is not more than half that sum—the defendant puts down in his deficiency account the loss on the bills at £6,790, for which they were liable as endorsers, and that is not more than half of the total deficiency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bills were drawn by Alexander, of Leeds, and various parties; they were accepted by various parties on the continent and endorsed by Schmorlze and Reischmann, and then by Frank Mieville and Son—I do not know that of those bills £1,100 had been taken up in January—I do not know that the defendant had taken up in January £1,400 worth of those bills; if you add that to the £6,790 it gives a liability <hi rend="italic">of</hi> £8,000—I <hi rend="italic">do not know</hi> that at the date <hi rend="italic">of Schmorlze</hi> and Reischmann's failure bills to the amount of £16,000 were outstanding, of which Frank Mieville and Son were the endorsers—I have not concerned myself with that part of the case—so far as I know the books have all been quite regularly kept, I do not give a decided answer to that—I represent the trustee; we have investigated—it is a matter of opinion whether it is the trustee's duty, when a charge of fraud is made against a man, to see whether his books have been regularly kept—as far as I went I saw no mistakes in the books—I am a clerk in Mr. Annan's office; he being trustee in this bankruptcy has delegated his duty to me—I cannot tell you when the original firm of Frank Mieville was formed; I had no concern with that—as far as I have seen from the books I believe the original capital was about £6,000—I do not know it as a fact, because my investigations have never taken me over that ground—I do not know that the capital as it stood on the books was £10,000, or how much of that was put in in 1889—I believe the defendant came a clerk to learn the business in 1892, but I have never been told-in so many words—I believe he entered as a partner in March, 1893—I do not know that by that time all the capital had been absorbed—I made no investigation into that—I cannot say off-hand what Frank Mieville's drawings had been for a number of years, but if the ledger is produced to me I will tell you—it may have been about £1,200 a year—the defendant introduced £3,000 into the business in 1892—he had in 1893 £200 a year plus £150, the interest of 5 % on the capital he introduced—I do not know if he after<lb/>wards put £3,230 into the business—it would probably appear in the defendant's capital account—I have not had occasion to investigate this—the books have been in my care since about May last year—Mr. Guy Stephenson appeared for the defendant at the Police Court; he did not put these questions to me—the ledger is not indexed, and it is not my fault if I cannot find it; it is the fault of the defendant's cashier—I find that Mr. Payne advanced to the business in December, 1897, £2,500—I believe the defendant's drawing of £600 began subsequent to 1897 and to that advance for which he became responsible—in 1900, when Mr.</p>

               <p>Mieville drew £136 and the defendant £1,044, Mr. Mieville was not attending to the business at all—in the bankruptcy Henrot et Fils appeared as debtors to Frank Mieville and Son in a sum of £124, which emerged at £132 on realization—everything has been handed over to me as far as I know—the proceeds of the cheques from Hambro and the Credit Lyonnaise of January 29th, 1901, went to liquidate other liabilities of Mieville and Son incurred in the same way the day before in the firm's business; every penny was paid into the bank, including Simpson's cheque, £11 17s. 9d.—two of the liabilities I speak of as incurred in the same way the day before were £1,592 0s. 10d. to Martin's Bank and £2,228 17s. 2d. to Sir Samuel Montague.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> By liabilites incurred in the same way, I mean cheques were purchased from Sir Samuel Montague &amp; Co. and Martin's Bank on the 28th exactly in the same manner as cheques were purchased on the 29th, and those bought on the 29th went to liquidate those of the 28th—the books show that on the 28th he was buying 40,000 francs at 25 for 12 1/2 from Martin's Bank, and selling at 25 for 14, a loss of 1 1/2 cent.—there are two transactions on that day, both showing the same loss, one with Martin's Bank, the other <hi rend="italic">with</hi> Sir <hi rend="italic">Samuel Montague &amp; Co</hi>—I see on January 21st he bought 40,000 francs from Martins's Bank, and sold at a loss of 1 cent.—on the 25th he bought 38,000 francs from Sir Samnel Montague &amp; Co., and sold at a loss of a half cent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated on oath that he had put into the firm £6,200, and in 1897 he had voluntarily parted with securities he had to Harold Payne, who put in £2,500; that in 1900 the whole conduct of the business devolved on himself; that when he became involved in difficulties, through the failure of Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann, he did not know the position in which his affairs really stood, as he had not had to do with his books or balance sheets, but that he heard that Alexander &amp; Co., of Leeds, might be floated as a solvent Limited Liability Company, and that he thought if he could keep the business going he would receive help from his friends, and that the firm could be carried on successfully; that it was quite usual on the Exchange to ask for and receive cash the same day; and that he had no knowledge or intention of doing wrong to any one, nor of acting otherwise than in the ordinary course of his trade.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a decorator in a large way of business at 9, Mount Street, and Ebury Street—I am the defendant's father-in-law—in January, 1901, he consulted me on the question of means, and there was a family meeting in that month at my house, at which I, the defendant, and my son were present—we discussed the affairs of Frank Mieville &amp; Son—the defendant said he thought he was in serious difficulties because of the gentlemen you have heard about, and I said at once that I would find him £1,000, and my son was prepared to give him, I think, £500—my offer was not limited to £1,000; I would have found another £1,000 if he wanted it—I said if we found that, Mr. Frank Mieville's family ought to find a similar amount, and that would meet the whole question—our offer was open right through until I heard criminal proceedings were going to be taken—I don't think at the family gathering any sum was mentioned as the amount of the</p>

               <p>deficiency, because he was not bankrupt then; he only said he might be in difficulties over this failure of Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann—I think he said he had about £4,000 worth of bills outstanding against him, but they would not come back all at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The family gathering was early in January, directly after Schmorlze &amp; Reischmann's failure, when the defendant knew he would have to pay these bills—I did not gather from him that he knew early in January these bills would have to be paid by him; I gathered most likely he would have to find some money to meet these bills—I knew he was in difficulty unless I helped him—he would not have come to me unless he wanted some money—I did not help him because the Mieville family would find nothing—we did not make that a condition then—on January 8th I sent him a first instalment of £100, and he returned it saying it was not big enough, and I wrote and said if he liked he should have £500—then he said Mieville's people would not do anything and he did not see why he should do anything—he declined to have the £500 because the Mievilles would not help—he returned the £100 on January 9th or 10th—I suppose he knew by the middle of January the Mieville people were not going to help—when he was found to be bankrupt I offered to find 5s. in the £, provided Mieville's people would find the other 5s. to pay 10s. to annul the bankruptcy.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, St. Stephen's Court, Bayswater—I was employed in Lawrence A. Marks' office at 3, Adelphi Terrace—it was one room—during the time he occupied the office he lived at the Adelphi Hotel—I went into his service at the beginning of October, it may have been September—a separate business was carried on—I was clerk in the betting business—the ordinary books of a betting business were kept, a debit and credit book, a day book, and a betting book—during the earlier part of my time there I entered the transactions as they occurred from day to day—they varied a great deal—the average sum put on a horse was £1—there were smaller bets of 2s. 6d., 5s., 10s., and so on—that went on till last October—Burge first came about the beginning of October, it may have been earlier—I had been there about six weeks—it may have been the beginning of September—a man named Mances began to come about the same time—Marks told me they were authorized to open telegrams that came to the office—they came regularly about one o'clock each day, just before racing commenced—I gave them the tele<lb/>grams, which they opened—some were returned to the entering clerk, some were retained—I kept the accounts which <hi rend="italic">were</hi> opened between Marks and his customers—I never entered any bets in the name of Scott—these are the books (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Scott's name is not to be found in them—there was also this file for telegrams—there is no telegram purporting to come from a customer named Scott—I wrote at Marks' dictation this telegram, "To Scott, Bureau, 15, North John Street, Liverpool, Commissions executed, Marks"—that was the only one I wrote to Scott—I last saw Mances at the office on Friday, November 22nd—I knew Mances was living at the Charing Cross Hotel, and Marks at the Adelphi Hotel—Marks' telegraphic address was "Gargled, London"—The original of this photograph is the man I knew as Mances—Marks was at business on November 2nd to 5th—I did not know of these telegrams: "369, Strand, B.O., 2/11/01. To Scott, Bureau, 15, North, John Street, Liverpool. I am doing no business to-day, I will arrange for next week, so you are not on, Marks;" "West Strand, B.O., 5/11/01. To Scott, Bureau, &amp;c," "Cheque received with thanks, have received no wires from you this week, neglect of clerk to post letter, Marks;" and "369, Strand, 5/11/01. To Scott," &amp;c, "Clerk's neglect, having mislaid wires, so you have no bet, we are the losers, if horses had won should have had to pay, Marks"—I never heard of any clerk's neglect, there was none that I was aware of—I was</p>

               <p>not, I think, given any letters to post for Scott—I knew nothing of this telegram in the name of Scott to put £20,000 on Sansome, nor of these telegrams to Scott of Nov. 11th: "Not doing anything to-day, Mr. Marks sick," or "Mr. Marks is very sick, I cannot do business without him," sent at 1.35 and 2.27 p.m. in Mances' writing; nor of these: "369, Strand, B.O., 11/11/01," sent 9 55, "To Scott," &amp;c., "Cheque received, will not be able to execute any commissions for a day or two, L. Marks taken suddenly ill, he will try and write you, Gargled;" or "West Strand, B.O., 12/11/01, sent 10.54, "To Scott," &amp;c., "Mr. Marks will be able to do business to-morrow or next day, he is very sorry for you, he could not help it, Gargled."—Sansome did win at Leicester that first day, starting at 5 to 2—I know Marks' writing—I looked at those telegrams before the Magistrate—they are not Marks' writing—The bets ranged from 2s. 6d. to £25—Marks had a book of rules for his customers—this is a copy—Rule 5 refers to bets up to £5 up to starting time of race, and with regard to larger sums, that must become the subject of special arrangement between Marks and his customers—the office generally opened about 11 am., when I got there—I was not there by the first post to receive registered letters.</p>

Marks was there every day, but not at the same time, and sometimes not till 4 p.m.—he was in very bad health even before Burge and Mances came to the office—Marks opened the telegrams if he was there—I do not know of Burge opening a single letter—Marks was not always consulted before doing a large bet, say £25—I know of no bet over that amount—Marks rarely did any writing, I had written his private letters—perhaps he was physically incapable—he was often shaky—I believe he drank—he was sufficiently educated to read and write—I frequently opened letters and replied to them or left them for Marks—I opened all letters that were found in the letter box when I arrived at 11 a.m.—the letters that came by the first post were brought to me later in the afternoon by Marks to answer, letters which he had opened in the morning—Mances generally met a telegraph messenger at the door—he read the telegram, and if it referred to the ordinary business he gave it to me, otherwise he kept it, I can tell Marks was at the office by transactions entered in this letter book—the book merely shows the office was open—I saw Marks on November 22nd—I first heard of the Liverpool Bank on the next day, Saturday afternoon, in a newspaper report—I think it would be mid-day—there was racing that day, November 23rd—it was an important day—Marks had not appeared—Burge came in the afternoon—he asked me where Marks was—I advised him to go round to the Adelphi Hotel—I think he went there—he remained in the office about five minutes—Marks' brother was there—he had nothing to do with the business, he had come from New York "' two or three days before—both were staying at the Adelphi Hotel—I introduced Burge to Marks' brother—very likely Burge asked me who he was—I said at the Police Court, "He asked me where Marks was, and why he had not turned up at the office"—that is true—I know Burge was arrested on Sunday night, the 24th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I entered the bet and knew the name of the customer, and whether we could accept the bet—Marks kept the book—I kept a record of every sum, however small, received from any customer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Referring to this book I find now that the telegram sent from Liverpool on September 10, "Going to Manchester, return to-night to Surbiton, if anything important, wire to Victoria Hotel, Man<lb/>chester, best love. Dick," is marked "Burge"—Dick is Burge's name—looking it that telegram' now, I say it is not the same writing as Burge's—I checked the telegrams marked in the book—this is unlike Burge's writing—that is a mistake—it is signed Dick, that is all—there were about 500 documents altogether.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The pencil entries in the copy book are not in Burge's writing—I had for comparison of writing, two letters written by Goudie from Holloway of December 10th and 12th, a cheque on the Credit Lyonnais of November 12th, made out and endorsed by Lawrence Marks, a counterfoil of the cheque book issued by the Credit Lyonnais alleged to have been written by Burge, and a specimen of Mances' writing on a small slip of paper alleged to have been taken by the police from a pocket book which Mances left with his luggage.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hudson—in the case of cheques I forged I did not debit the customer's account—I destroyed the cheque—coming into possession of the clearing clerk, it would be entered in the journal—those entries should be checked with the entries in the ledger, and if correct they are ticked—I sat by the ticker off from the clearing book—the clearing book is a separate journal—to make the books agree I ticked off the clearing book, which ought to have been done by, the checker, a different person from the clearing clerk—I had been in the habit of receiving telegrams at the Bureau in North John Street, Liverpool, before October 18th, 1901, where I could have letters addressed by paying a fee of 1d.—I received letters and telegrams in the name of Scott and sent them away with that address—it was about 300 yards from the Bank, or about three minutes' walk—before October 18th I had sent telegrams to Newmarket and other race courses—I went to the Bureau nearly every day—about October 18th C was spoken to by a man I did not know, about 12.30, at the Bureau—this is his photograph—he asked me the address of some stationers, and I pointed out a building where he would be likely to find them, in North John Street—I went back to No. 15 and he followed me—he said, "You go in for racing"—I said he was making a mistake—"Oh no," he said, "I have not, I have seen you at Doncaster, Manchester and Sandown; I have seen you along with Kelly and his partner Stiles; you have lost a lot of money to them"—I still insisted that he was making a mistake—he said he had been in my company at Doncaster and that he knew all about me, and "You are a clerk in the Bank of Liverpool, and you are in a position where you can command money"—he wanted me to grant him an interview and to have an hour's conversa<lb/>tion—I admitted being at Doncaster with Stiles and Kelly—he said he was an American, and knew all the American jockeys, and that he was in a position where he could get good information regarding racing, also that there was money to be made, and he wanted to make some—I suggested that he was hard up and wanted a sovereign or two—he said no, he was not at all, and showed me a receipted bill from the Charing Cross Hotel, London—he said his name was Mances—he said that it was only capital that was required to make a fortune, and that he was in a position where he could get racing information, whereby we would make a fortune—all this conversation took place just inside the door at 15, North John Street—he was decidedly hostile—he forced the conversation on me—when I tried to avoid the conversation he said, "I am not a detective"—that was immediately he said that I was a clerk in the Bank of Liverpool, and that I was in a position to command money—I was alarmed—I think he said he was staying at the Victoria Hotel—he said he had come specially from London to see me—I promised to see him in the London and North Western Hotel at eight that night—the conversa<lb/>tion lasted ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I arranged to meet him and went to the Bank—at night I went to the London and North Western Hotel—he came into the smoking room, where I was waiting for him—he asked me to come across to the Victoria, where he was putting up—there he took me into his sitting bedroom—I asked him how he got my name—he told me by taking wires off the telegraph board which were addressed to Kelly at different race meetings—I had telegraphed to Kelly</p>

               <p>at different race meetings—he said he opened, read them, and put them back—he addressed me as Scott—he got my address, he said, by following Kelly until one day after he had written a wire he tore it up, and he, Mances, put the fragments together, and so got my address, 15, North John Street—he said he knew a jockey named Ballard, who owned race horses under various <hi rend="italic">nom de plumes</hi>, and that Ballard could so arrange a race that he knew the absolute winner—this was all on the Friday night—he said he expected a message from Ballard for something very special on the following day, and that he could introduce me to a firm of very large commission agents, "L. Marks &amp; Co.," and that Marks was very wealthy and connected with very wealthy people, and if any sum was too large for Marks, he could pass it over to any of his wealthy friends, who were Jews, and had large transactions on the Stock Exchange, and he would get a commission on the winnings, and that he did not back the horses himself, because he had not the means, but it was possible to back a horse for almost any amount—I arranged to call round at the Victoria Hotel the next day, Saturday, the 19th—I went about 2 o'clock—I saw Mances in the same sitting bedroom at the Victoria Hotel—he showed me a message signed by Ballard, and said that the horse Hedera was extra good—he showed me this telegram, signed by Marks, sent at 10.40 from 369, Strand, and addressed to Mances at the Victoria Hotel: "You can send £5,000 an hour before starting time of race"—he suggested that I should back Hedera for £5,000, and he gave me the address, "Gargled, London"—I sent off this wire in the name of T. P. Scott to back Hedera for £5,000 and "Reply if on to Bureau," etc., although I knew nothing of "Gargled" nor Mances—I sent it from the post office under the London and North Western Railway Hotel, close to where I was—shortly after<lb/>wards I received this reply from Marks: "You are on Hedera £5,000" the race was run after 3 p.m., and the horse did not win—I left Mances, but saw him at the same place after I knew Hedera had lost—he had this telegram, signed Ballard, that the horse was very unlucky and had got left at the post, but it would be all right next week—Burge was not mentioned to me—he said that he would arrange so that I could bet with Marks up to £25,000 in one week—to pay the £5,000 to Marks &amp; Co., I made out a cheque in favour of T. P. Scott, and signed it R. W. Hudson, endorsed it T. P. Scott, and sent it to Marks by registered letter—I think I posted it on the Sunday—I never saw Mances after the Saturday, nor received any telegrams or letters from him—the cheque came back into my possession in the way I have described, and I destroyed it—on Tuesday, October 22nd, I telegraphed, <hi rend="italic">"Five</hi> each way Lady Macdonald "—that meant £2,500, because Mances was to tell Marks that £500 was to equal "one" on a wire, so that Macdonald stood £2,500 to win and £1,500 for a place—I got the cheques from a book I bought at the bank counter—I had one cheque bonk in the name of a customer, but that was full by the time Mances came on the scene—I had a small account at the bank—I received the answer, "You are on five each way Lady Macdonald"—on October 23rd I was betting again, and received these two telegrams, "You are on, Marks"—I also sent this telegram, "Ten, Tee-to-tum"—that would be £5,000 on Tee-to-tum—that is</p>

               <p>answered the same day at 3.57, "You are on, Marks"—on the 25th I bet on Tin Soldier and Port Blair, and on the 25th I got this telegram, "Impossible to do any business this week, as I am a commission agent, and made arrangements with other people same as I did with you, Marks"—I put "ten" each on Laird and May King, and got the answer, "All right"—that week I lost £25,000—to pay that £25,000 I forged two cheques for £9,000 and one for £7,000—I posted those in registered letters to L. Marks &amp; Co.—I saw their advertisement in a sporting newspaper—the amounts were put on the horses at starting prices—the <hi rend="italic">Sportsman</hi> gave the starting price—I recognise in it the advertise<lb/>ment of Marks &amp; Co.—I received this telegram of October 29th, "You can do business to eighty this week, send letter to-night"—"eighty" meant £40,000—I did receive the letters—they were all signed, "L. Marks &amp; Co."—I destroyed (item—as a rule they acknowledged receipt of what I had sent, asking for arrangements for the following week, and they would endorse what I put money on—I had no knowledge that Mances or Burge were sending these telegrams—on October 29th I telegraphed, "Ten each St. Bernard and Claret"—that would be £5,000—the answers were, "All right"—"Shot Gun twenty" would be £10,000—I sent another bet on Lock and Key, five, and Double Dealer on October 30th, and on November 2nd ten each on Laird and May King—that week's result of racing was my loss of £30,000, as I supposed—on November 2nd I received this telegram, "I am doing no business to-day, I will arrange for next week, so you are not on"—on the Saturday, to meet the indebtedness of £30,000, I forged the cheque for £30,000, and forwarded it in the same way to L. Marks &amp; Co.—on. November 4th, I received this telegram, "Everything arranged, do nothing until you hear from me, Mances"—I had not heard from him since he left Liverpool—on November 4th and 5th, I wired again "Twenty Nahlband, ten Merry Andrew," and "Five St. Hilarious," but received no acknowledgment of cheque—and on November 5th I received this telegram, "Received with thanks, have received no wires from you this week, neglect of clerk to post letter," and shortly afterwards, in Mance's writing, "Clerk's neglect, having mislaid wire, so you have no bet, we are the losers, if horses had won should have had to pay, Marks"—on November 6th I telegraphed "Ten each Deep Sea and St. Quintin," and "Ten each Vertigo and Viper," and got answers "Ail right"—then I received this telegram of November 7th, "Yesterday bet on Sidus, seven to one"—I had put £10,000 on Sidus by letter, and asked what price he could give me up to £10,000, and the answer was "Seven to one"—on November 7th the race had been postponed—I telegraphed "Ten each on two horses at seven to one," which was answered at 2.33 "All right"—on November 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th, I telegraphed, includ<lb/>ing £10,000 on Sansome on November 11th, which was the only winner that week—I met the loss that week by forging the cheque for £31,000, and sent it in the same way—Sansome started at five to two—I should have won £25,000 if it had been a real bet—having wired at 12.40, at 1.34 I received the telegram "Not doing anything to-day, Mr. Marks sick," and an hour later another, "Mr. Marks is very sick, I cannot do business without him," and on the same day.

W. Hudson upon the Bank of Liverpool—that was collected and placed to his credit on October 24th, after Bank hours, so that it was not available till the morning of the 25th—on the 25th Burge and Marks came to the Bank and presented this cheque on Marks' account for £4,500 payable to Burge and endorsed in my presence by Burge, who wished to open an account—Burge had £1,000 placed to his credit and £3,500 in cash—he took 10 £100 notes, 20 £50 notes, 50 £20, 45 £10, and £50 in sovereigns—I have the numbers of the notes which have been produced and which were paid to Burge—I obtained Burge's signature and his address, Hum<lb/>mum's Hotel, Covent Garden—he represented himself as a commission agent—the body of the cheque for £4,500 is Burge's writing to the best of my belief—the next day, the 28th, Marks brought two cheques for £7,000 and £9,000 and dated October 26th, drawn against R. W. Hudson in favour of T. P. Scott on the Bank of Liverpool—they were paid on the same day and credited on the 30th as £16,000—on October. 31st Marks came again with a gentleman, and said "I wish to introduce you to Mr. James Mances, who wants to open an account with you"—the usual form was gone through, Mances signed the book—he described him<lb/>self as a commission agent living at the Charing Cross Hotel, and he opened a new account by a payment in of £1,500 in notes and a sove<lb/>reign—I have the numbers of those notes—on November 1st Burge brought this cheque for £13,000, drawn by Marks, who was with him—it was endorsed Richard Burge, who opened an account by having £6,000 placed to his credit—he took £7,000, in cash by four notes of £1,000 and 60 notes of £500—I have the numbers—in Mances' account on November 1st I find £10,000 placed to his credit in exchange for the £13,000—on November 4th Marks brought a cheque for £30,000 of November 2nd, and purporting to have been drawn by R. W. Hudson upon the Bank of Liverpool—those were paid, and were credited to Marks on November 7th—on November 8th Burge handed me a cheque for £15,000 drawn by Marks in Burge's favour, and endorsed by Burge, and is credited to his account, and another cheque for £5,000 payable to himself or order and endorsed by him—that was paid to him in five notes of £500, 20 of £100, 15 of £20, and 20 of £10 each—the same day Mances brought a cheque for £10,000 drawn by Marks, and I find in Mances' account of November 8th he is credited with £10,000—on November 13th Burge drew on his account a cheque for £10,000 in favour of Mrs. Burge</p>

Mances, who was born in England, but had lived in America for many years—I knew Marks was carrying on a starting price business at Adelphi Terrace—my inquiries were directed to—the arrest of Marks and Mances—I received this telegram from Marks, it is handed in at Paris "Leave here at 10.30 by way of Folkestone. L. Marks"—accordingly I went to Folkestone to meet the Boulogne boat—I saw the passengers come off—Marks was not amongst them—he has an extraordinary face—I could not fail to miss him even in a big crowd—I did not find him—I made subsequent inquiries and was handed this bag and rug, which were on the boat—they have been identified—I subsequently took possession</p>

               <p>of the books, documents and papers relating to Marks' betting business including those spoken to by Mr. Woolgar—I also took possession of room No. 87 at the Charing Cross Hotel, Mances' room—I found amongst a number of addresses 15, North John Street, Liverpool; 28, Wiltshire Road, Kemp Town; 99, Bedford Court Mansions; Mary worth House, Brighton, a lease of Marks &amp; Co., formerly B. Michaels &amp; Co., a number of telegrams from Goudie to Marks, signed Scott, gambling implements or a card sharpers lay-out—[<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>]—paying-in slips of the Credit Lyonnais and other banking documents and letters showing communica<lb/>tions between him and persons in America, and some money he was sending there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found 18 telegrams from Goudie to Marks in the name of Scott of recent dates in a pocket of a portmanteau.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Sergeant</hi>). I saw Burge at 28, Wiltshire Road, on the night of November 25th—he had just got out of bed—I told him I was a police officer, and held a warrant for his arrest, and that he would have to come with me to Bow Street—I read the warrant to him and told him he would be charged with being concerned with others in uttering forged bankers' cheques—he replied "all right," and commenced to dress himself—I called him out of the bedroom and read the warrant to him again—he said "Are they Marks' cheques that are forged?"—I said, "That is what is alleged"—he said, "That is all right, is not it? Mine's for betting"—amongst other papers I found a paying-in slip of the Credit Lyonnais for £15,000, a receipt for £10,000 on deposit, at the London and South-Western Bank, Brixton, in the name of Bella Burge, and a book of the same bank in the name of Mrs. Burge and a Credit Lyonnais cheque book and a paying-in book and a paper of sums lent and paid.</p>

               <p>books with the prisoner once a week—the prisoner kept the advertise<lb/>ment book—the entries might be made by a clerk—clerks were employed at Cockspur Street—Mr. Smith generally each week sent me a note of the amount due to the prisoner and I drew a cheque for it and sent it to Mr. Smith and he handed it to the prisoner—on June 27th I sent this cheque for £40 7s. 11d. to Mr. Smith for the prisoner, for his commission up to date—it is payable to Albert Miles and endorsed by him and has been paid by my banker—on September 6th I sent Smith an open cheque for £40 3s. 7d. to A. Miles or bearer—that has been paid across the counter—when I sent those two cheques I believed that they were due to the prisoner—I was abroad up to November, managing the business in Paris so that I did not pay attention to the Cockspur Street business—I went to Cockspur Street in November and found the office locked up—I went to the house-keeper, and on getting in I found the prisoner's desk locked—I got a locksmith and had it opened, but found no papers whatever—I did not know that the prisoner was going away—I instructed my solicitors to take proceedings.</p>

               <p>not in the books, and he at once made a counter claim, and suggested that we were indebted to him in a considerable sum for commission not paid—I do not think there are commissions due to him, but I have not seen, the books lately—I should not like to say positively—I have not been able to form any idea what is due to him, or what is not—I asked the firm for an explanation of these two cases—I sent a letter to the firms in question—I had no book keeper when the prisoner came into my employment, and he suggested that I should get an accountant, and have my account put into order, and smith was engaged—Mr. Strong is not here—since these proceedings commenced I have sold the newspaper for a good price, owing to the prisoner's exertions to some extent.</p>

I am an accountant, of 34, Nicholas Lane—since March last I have attended at 30, Cockspur Street, once a week, to go through the books with the prisoner, and arrived at what was due to him by comparing the contracts which I got from him with the advertisements—this is the advertisement book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it contains a list of the contracts—I entered them up myself—I got the materials from him, but later on he or his clerk wrote them—I got to page 13 about June 17th, and made this entry with regard to Sandon and Company for £26—the week before, ended on June 15th—to enter that I had before me a memorandum signed by the prisoner, which I returned to him, and from the memorandum I entered these tickets and added up the amounts due to him for commission—the commission due to him on that order was £10 8s.; his total commission for that week was about £35, but altogether it would be £85 2s.—I wrote a letter and informed Mr. James Dixon of the amount due to the prisoner, and received this cheque from him, con<lb/>taining the amount of that commission among other things—I certainly believed that that was a genuine order from Messrs. Sandon—on Septem<lb/>ber 5th, here is an entry in the prisoner's clerk's writing with regard to the Aspinall Publishing Company, and the prisoner showed me this contract from them. (<hi rend="italic">This was an order for</hi> 56 <hi rend="italic">insertions of an advertise<lb/>ment</hi>)—there are initials underneath that—I believed it to be genuine—the 56 insertions came to £78, upon which the prisoner's commission would be £31 4s., at 40 percent.—I wrote a letter and received a cheque for £40 3s. 7d., dated September 6th—the prisoner did not tell me in either of those cases that no money was to be paid by those people!</p>

               <p>kept back had nothing to do with Aspinall's—if he says that he was to receive 30 percent on some orders and 40 on others, that is not true, it was 40 per cent on all—the advertisement was obtained on about January 15th, and the commission was paid on the 21st—I submitted the account about the 16th to Mr. Dixon, senior, either personally or in writing—he was paying the money on behalf of Mr. Dixon, junior—I prepared a proper written statement every week, I did not always discuss it with the prisoner, he would see the entries in the books—I had consider<lb/>able correspondence with Mr. Dixon, junior, at Paris, about the matter—all the money came from Mr. Dixon, senior—I showed the £10 in the books to Mr. Dixon and showed him why it should be deducted, and he did so, that £10 was a question of advertisements—the only settlement I had with the prisoner was when there were one or two small advertise<lb/>ments which had not been inserted, they were to be deducted from his commission at certain dates.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had not been pressing him, it was voluntary—his letter was simply a suggestion whether we would take the amount out in a contract—it said, "Can you fix up a contra?"—he wrote Mr. Moore asking me to come down and see him about it—that was later than June 13th—he said that I had mistaken the arrangement altogether, and wanted a new contract—he said that it was not at all in respect of the old debt—there was nothing to show the contrary—I understood that it was to go off of his old account, but he did not.</p>
