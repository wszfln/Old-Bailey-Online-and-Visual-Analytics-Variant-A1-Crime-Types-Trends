            . I belong to the Hand-in-Hand fire-office; I was told by a neighbour as I was at the Waterman's-arms Bank-side, that the prisoner had brought five chairs from the fire that was then below bridge, I went and saw the chairs at Mr. Richard's house, in his cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Richards live?</p>
               <p>Richmond. He keeps the Waterman's-arms Bank-side, I went and saw the chairs; there was the prisoner, I asked him how he came by them, he told me he took them up in the river Thames; I felt of the seats of the chairs, they were every one of them dry. I told the prisoner he had done the wrong thing by bringing them from the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that?</p>
               <p>Richmond. He said nothing at all; I went and told justice Clark of it, he ordered him to be kept in the custody of Mr. Richards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the fire near the water side?</p>
               <p>Richmond. It was close by the water side; the prosecutor came and owned them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Richards. I keep the Waterman's-arms Bank-side, there were five chairs brought into my house by a gentleman unknown to me, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them did the prisoner bring ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Richards. He brought in one or two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say concerning how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Mr. Richards. He said he had taken them upon the river Thames as they were swimming, and that there was a great fire below bridge where he took them up.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. In what part of the house did you see those chairs?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw them in a one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Richards. How came the chairs to be removed out of the cellar to that room above?</p>
               <p>Richards. The prisoner was going to take the chairs away on the Monday morning, and as I was ordered by justice Clark not to deliver them to him; I carryed them up stairs, I having a back door to my cellar, at which it is possible he might have got in and taken them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that gentleman you mention, that brought some of them into your house?</p>
               <p>Richards. I do not know any thing of him, it seems he was going by and saw the chairs in the prisoner's possession, and he asked him how he came by them; the prisoner told him he took them up as they were floating on the river; so the gentleman said they ought to be kept in somebody's custody till the right owner came for them; he carried them first to a chandler's shop and the woman would not take them in, so he was directed to my house; he came and said, landlord give these chairs house-room till the right owner comes, here is a waterman says<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175810250004"/> he found them swimming on the river Thames, he insisted upon their being put in some other person's custody, and not in the hands of the prisoner at the bar, thinking he did not come honestly by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the gentleman since?</p>
               <p>Richards. No I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Richmond. Did the prisoner say he picked up five chairs?</p>
               <p>Richmond. I mentioned the five chairs to him, and told him he should not have brought them through bridge but have put them on shore near the place where he took them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with stealing them?</p>
               <p>Richmond. I told him I believed he took them from the fire on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that ?</p>
               <p>Richmond. He said nothing to that: I told him they were as dry as they were when they were made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the fire burning at that time?</p>
               <p>Richmond. The fire was burning about five or six hours that Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to Richards. What time were the chairs brought into your house?</p>
               <p>Richards. They were brought in between the hours of four and five on Sunday Sept. 10.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from your house to the place where the fire was?</p>
               <p>Richards. It is better than half a mile distance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was with my boat below bridge, I happened to see this fire, there were two chairs a floating, a young gentleman desired me to hand them out of the water, I did, presently I saw three more, he desired me to take them up too, I thought they might be his chairs; after that I could not find him, so I brought them to Mr. Richards's house, because the house was all of a hurly-burly, I had not a pipe of tobacco for taking them up.</p>

               <p>Gurney. No he was not, I am lame and could not attend it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Higgins. I heard the prisoner demand the chairs of Richmond before he went to justice Clark, he told Richmond he would carry them to the place where he took them up that they might be given to the right owner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say whose chairs they were?</p>
               <p>Higgins. No he did not, and I think he never knew whose chairs they were.</p>

               <p>Q. What are they?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. Every lemon is wrap'd up in paper; there we saw abundance of them; then I went and told another of my neighbours of it, and we sat up till between twelve and one o'clock, but no body came. On the Saturday morning I sent for Mr. Ives, and told him of the affair; he no sooner heard of the thing, but said he believed it to be his boy. I went with him into the cellar, and looked under every butt, and found as many as my hat would hold. We charged the boy with taking my lemons, he at first denied it, but at last owned it, and told me the woman at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175810250005"/> bar was the receiver of them; he said he was in my cellar on the Saturday at seven in the morning, and that he took some then, and that he had practised it five, and the woman had received them of him for four months. I took up the woman, and she confessed she did receive the lemons of him before Mr. Alderman Stevenson, in my hearing, and that she had of him twenty six lemons the Saturday morning before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she gave him for them?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. She said she gave him two shillings for them, and Mr. Alderman Stevenson said he knew them lemons were worth four or five shillings, and so they were, and in two or three days time they would have been worth seven or eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Petty. The boy told me they were given him by a young woman that worked in Botolph lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she in her confession say the boy told her this?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I cannot take upon me to say she did make that excuse then, she owned she had received lemons of the boy at divers times for four months past.</p>

Mr. Stevenson having missed lemons from time to time, he came and told me of it on the 19th of September, and desired I would go over to his cellar and look on the chests; I did, and found there were a great many lemons gone, they all appearing to be found, we concluded they must have been taken out; we looked at the partition with the candle, there was a hole that a man might get through; the edge of it look'd quite bright, as if rubbed by often going through; we concluded that must be the way they went; he said he was sure his servants were honest; I advised him to say nothing about it, but watch for several nights, he did, but could not catch any body: then he desired me and Mr. Hill to go to his house, and he sent for Mr. Ives; when he came and was informed of it, he had a suspicion of his boy and the prisoner, and said also he remembered the woman at the bar coming and leaving her basket in his cellar; the boy was taken up, and at first he denied it, but at last he confessed, that on that morning, which was a Saturday, he got thirty lemons, and was to have half a crown of the woman for them. When the woman was taken up, I heard her confess she received twenty six of the boy, and gave him two shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess she had received any more of the boy?</p>

               <p>Holsey. She confessed she had received lemons of him several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. On the Wednesday morning I was with Mr. Stevenson, watching to see who came into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the boy's confession?</p>
               <p>Hill. I heard him confess he stole thirty lemons, and sold them to the woman at the bar for half a crown. When the woman was taken up, she confessed before Mr. Alderman Stevenson, she received twenty six of the boy, and gave him two shillings for them. The boy also confessed he had done it for five or six months, and she said she had received lemons of him several times.</p>
               <p>Perciful said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ives. How old is the boy?</p>
               <p>Ives. I believe he is between thirteen and fourteen years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he behaved with you?</p>
               <p>Ives. He has behaved tolerable well, I cannot say that I ever catched him pilfering from me; he is a weak boy as to understanding.</p>
               <p>Petty's defence.</p>
               <p>I bought twenty six lemons of the boy, and gave him two shillings for them.</p>

               <p>I had been out with a friend about a little business, she made me welcome, because she had heard good news concerning her son, who is abroad. I was coming home, and found the liquor had turned my head; I sat down at this gentleman's door, there I saw the water running from a cock, I thought if I drank a little it would do me good, so I went into the house for something to drink in, and the gentleman accused me with this milk-pot.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you charge him with?</p>
               <p>Walker. With stealing a hundred weight of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for so charging him?</p>
               <p>Walker. When the officer came to take stock, the prisoner, in order to make it answer to the exciseman's books, put weights into the canisters, to supply the weight he had taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this?</p>
               <p>Walker. I know it by his own confession, I took stock along with the officer, the first time of weighing it, it weighed six hundred and eighteen pound and three quarters. This was in the morning, and after breakfast, finding a canister wanted eight pounds of what it had weighed before, I ordered it all to be weighed over again, and then it weighed no more than four hundred and sixty five pounds; all this was before the exciseman was gone out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this tea under the prisoner's care ?</p>
               <p>Walker. It was, I sent him after this to fetch a chest of tea home, he went away and did not return; I sent a letter to him at Edmonton, his wife came to me to enquire what the matter was. I told her I had some suspicion her husband had robbed me, and desired her to go home and bring him to town; he came, then I desired to know of him how he came, to rob me, and to tell me the truth, saying he could have no opportunity of taking away any between the two times the tea was weighed; then he told me he had put weights into the canisters to make it answer to the exciseman's books, and that he had taken them out again before the second time of weighing it. I desired to know what he had done with it; he told me he had sold it at several times to such and such people, half a pound, and a pound at a time, for six-pence or a shilling. I asked him how long he had gone on in this way, he said he had practised it ever since the year fifty one or fifty two, and that every time the officer came to weigh, he kept putting in weights till it amounted to an hundred weight and odd.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to send him for tea after you missed such a quantity ?</p>
               <p>Walker. I knew he could not open that chest in the street, and if he ran away, I knew where to find him. I took him before my Lord Mayor, I told the same there as here.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the tea you charge him with?</p>
               <p>Walker. I have put it at the lowest value in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>My master promised me very faithfully, if I would tell him who I sold it to, he would forgive me every thing, and I did tell him who I sold it to, and the peoples names.</p>

               <p>Daniel Bunning. When I took my room of my landlord I was to lie alone, and none to lie with me without my consent; after that my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175810250007"/> landlord took in the prisoner, and said he knew him to be a very honest man, so I let him lie with me; when he and the things were missing then my landlord said he did not know any thing of him, although before he said he was his acquaintance; I found the prisoner two or three weeks after, and before justice Welch he confessed he had taken my things.</p>
               <p>Q. What things?</p>
               <p>Bunning. A peruke, a silver stock buckle, a stock, and Common Prayer book.</p>

               <p>Sarah More. On the 6th of June I had ordered the prisoner at the bar to fetch my box from the waggon with the things mentioned in the indictment in it; ( naming them,) I gave him a shilling for fetching them, and when I went to his house for them the box was broke open and the things mentioned were taken out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She ordered me to bring the things to my own apartment.</p>
               <p>S. More. I told him in case it was too late at night when he returned he might keep them at his house till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring them to your house?</p>
               <p>S. More. He did not, so I went to his house the next morning, there I found my box uncorded and the lid broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked before?</p>
               <p>S. More. It was, and I had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home?</p>
               <p>S. More. No, I saw a little girl first, then his wife came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it broke?</p>
               <p>S. More. The lock was not broke, but the hinges were.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that you took out a warrant against the prisoner?</p>
               <p>S. More. It was about a month after.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not take it before?</p>
               <p>S. More. I was ill and could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon the account of your illness that you did not?</p>
               <p>S. More. It really was.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>S. More. I took him up on the first of July, I waited for the waggoner coming up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge the prisoner with this fact at taking him up?</p>
               <p>S. More. I did, and said if he would bring me my things that were missing nothing should come on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Wade ?</p>
               <p>S. More. I do, he is one of the prisoner's bondsmen, they came and offered me the money for the things after the bill was preferred.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came with him?</p>
               <p>S. More. Mr. Banister did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with the prisoner before the justice?</p>
               <p>S. More. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said there?</p>
               <p>S. More. The prisoner said he would die before he would confess, and he would never pay me for them neither.</p>

               <p>Waley. I am sure I delivered it locked and corded fast to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was about nine at night when I received it, and she was in bed when I brought it, and would not come down, so I took it home.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Burk Wade.

               <p>Q. What concern had you in it?</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Was the box empty when you found it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No it was not, there were other things in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no more in value left, than there were missing?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more in weight left, than taken away ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you locked the box ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I did, before I came from my mother's house, and my mother corded it, and there was not a bit of cord upon it at the prisoner's house,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I did, and thought him an honest man or I had not sent him for my box.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to think he took them out?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The waggoner told me he delivered the box out of the waggon to him safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No I did not, they told me I could not take a search warrant out for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the condition the box was in when you first saw it at the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It was broke in several places on the top and sides, I have not had it mended, it is in the same condition now.</p>
               <p>Q. to Waley. How long was the waggon coming to London?</p>
               <p>Waley. It was five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box in the waggon all the time?</p>
               <p>Waley. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body come at it in the waggon?</p>
               <p>Waley. No they could not without removing other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that at the time it was delivered to the prisoner, that the hinges and lock were as safe as when delivered to you?</p>
               <p>Waley. It was all the very same, locked and corded fast and the things safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it?</p>
               <p>Waley. I am quite sure, I delivered it to him with my own hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you received the box of the prosecutrix's mother before you put it into the waggon?</p>
               <p>Waley. I put it in directly as I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it stay in the yard any time?</p>
               <p>Waley. No it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the waggon stay at London before you took the box out?</p>
               <p>Waley. I believe the waggon stood in the inn-yard with it in about two hours; the waggon was not unloaded till the next morning, there was only the box taken out, which I delivered to the prisoner with my own hands.</p>

               <p>Answer.

               <p>Q. Did you lie there?</p>
               <p>Cray. I was upon the bed with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you charge her with?</p>
               <p>Cray. I lost a purse and eleven guineas in it.</p>

               <p>Cray. From out of my right hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her take it?</p>
               <p>Cray. I felt her take it; I jumped out of bed after her, and before I could get down stairs, the other woman that was with her, that shewed me the way to the house, was gone away, then I could not get a constable, so the prisoner and I went both of us to the Watch-house together, and staid there till the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched there?</p>
               <p>Cray. No, she was not, I could not search her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other woman upon the bed with you?</p>
               <p>Cray. No, she was not, I never kissed her hand nor lips, I did kiss this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your breeches on or off?</p>
               <p>Cray. They were on, but they were down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it?</p>
               <p>Cray. No, I did not, but I felt the purse go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it walk out, or did she take it out?</p>
               <p>Cray. There was no body near but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you lay hold of her?</p>
               <p>Cray. She was too nimble for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your money in the prisoner's custody afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cray. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your purse or money again?</p>
               <p>Cray. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Cray. No.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor then laid before the court a detail of his giving the prisoner six-pence to purchase a couple of birch rods, and the purposes for which they were bought, which rods the prisoner produced in court; but as this history is of too indelicate a nature to be laid before the publick in general, we chuse to draw a veil over it.

               <p>Gustavus Forshohm. On the 23d of September, between the hours of eight and nine in the evening, I was going over Hanover-square, and in a short street, going into Oxford-road, four men came and took hold of my coat, and stopped me, and demanded my money; there was a lamp at the corner just near me; I said gentlemen come to the light, let me look at you, I thought they had been some of my acquaintance; they said they came to rob and murder me; I said I had no money, and bid them go about their business; one of them cried out shoot him; then one of them put a pistol to the side of my head, and shot me; after that I saw another pistol flash in the pan, but it did not go off. I cried Murder! stop thief! They ran away, but in about three minutes time

             was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. He was one of the four, he was at my left hand behind Dawson, who had hold of me, the other two were on the other side of me. (He shewed a wound on his left cheek bone.) Three weeks after the surgeon took out a slug from the wound, (producing one.)</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell which shot off the pistol?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. I then thought it to be Dawson, but he says it was the prisoner that stood behind him, and fired it over his shoulder. For my part I am not positive which did it, but it was one of the two.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you ever see me before?</p>

               <p>Forshohm. No, never before that night to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from your own knowledge who shot off the pistol?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner was one of the four?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. I am. At first I had two men brought to me; I said they were none of them, then they brought the prisoner; I said he is one of them, I am certain to him and Dawson.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had met the prisoner in the street, should you have known him?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not charge Dawson before the justice with firing off the pistol at you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175810250016"/>Forshohm. I did, I thought it had been he, he being close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never declare that the prisoner was not there?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. No, never; I said he was there close behind Dawson.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know he was behind Dawson from your own knowledge, or from what Dawson has said?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. I know it from my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the exact time of the night that this happened?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. It was just wanting a quarter of an hour of nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see their faces?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. It was not very dark, but there was a lamp at the corner within two yards of us.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the prisoner to you?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. Dawson was close to me, and had hold of me, and the prisoner close to Dawson, within a yard and a half of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who spoke to you first?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. They all spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What cloaths had the prisoner on?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. He had blue cloaths on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his face with his hat on?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. I could plain, by the light of the lamp, and the flash in the pan; I looked at sharp at them as I could, to know them again, to have them taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them all four?</p>
               <p>Forshohm. I did, before I was shot at, the other two are not taken.</p>

            . That evening that the prosecutor speaks of, we all four met at the Woolpack in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Court. Name the persons.</p>
               <p>Dawson. There were Preston, Keaney, Nolan, and I, there we consulted to go a robbing; about seven in the evening we went out, and proceeded to the corner of the street which the prosecutor mentioned, and stopped him, and demanded his money, he made some small resistance, and a noise, but did not speak a word to be understood. [The prosecutor is a foreigner, and did not speak very plain English.] Immediately Preston cried out, shoot him; then the prisoner put the pistol over my shoulder, and fired at the prosecutor. We all dispersed immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a second pistol fired?</p>
               <p>Dawson. Not as I know of; as I was running, a chairman lay down, and I fell over him, and he and his companion secured me, and a great number of people came round me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken?</p>
               <p>Dawson. He was taken the next evening, as I was informed, but I was then in prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The first commencement of Dawson's and my acquaintance was on board the Antigallican privateer, commanded by capt. Foster.</p>
               <p>Dawson. The prisoner had this coat of mine on at the time we stopped the prosecutor; (it was as the prosecutor said, a blue coat.) I put on another coat, which he left on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I know for what intent you put it on?</p>
               <p>Dawson. Yes, as well as I did.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shoot at the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Dawson. No, I never did, it never was my intention to shoot at any man.</p>

               <p>Wright. I asked him what he had done with the landstaff, and he told me he took it off the mare's leg and threw it into the land-surrow in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he did with the mare?</p>
               <p>Wright. That was not asked him.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose di d he take off the landstaff?</p>
               <p>Wright. In order to ride her.</p>
               <p>Q. To ride her how, or where?</p>
               <p>Wright. I did not ask him that question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body ask him in your hearing?</p>
               <p>Wright. I do not know, not I, I asked him, how far did you come, and he said from Barton, that is about 4 miles off from us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is become of the mare?</p>
               <p>Wright. We had her home with us from Islington,</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you?</p>
               <p>Wright. That is, Valentine and I.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come by her?</p>
               <p>Wright. She was at an inn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Valentine. Have you got your mare again?</p>
               <p>Valentine. I have.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at the bar to the Angel and Crown at Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent for you?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Mr. Waters and Mr. Marston, the prisoner was coming on the mare's back to Smithfield, they asked the price of her.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the mare?</p>
               <p>Parsons. She is a black one, I went with the prisoner before esquire Palmer, there he confessed he had taken her out of Bedfordshire, from a place called Bedford Houghton.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where did you lose your mare from?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost her from Bedford Houghton fields; a place called Houghton Conquest in Bedfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. to Parsons. How came the prisoner to be suspected?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Mr. Waters had bought the mare for four guineas at the inn, and gave him a guinea earnest, and then he gave him liberty to go and fetch two vouchers, he went and did not bring any to his liking, so he took the guinea again and stopped the mare: when before the justice he first said he stole the mare from his uncle, but at last he named the field, and said, he had her out of that; I had forgot the name of the field till I heard it now mentioned again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor by at this confession?</p>
               <p>Parsons. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did he say he had it out of your field, or name a field belonging to you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not mind, I thought he mentioned some field of his uncle's.</p>
               <p>Q. to Parsons. Are you sure he mentioned Bedford Houghton Conquest ?</p>
               <p>Parsons. He did, and he mentioned two mens names in that country, that he said had a hand in taking her, and his worship granted a warrant to take them up, and Mr. Valentine brought up a letter from a justice of the peace there to show that there were no such people living there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. Graham. Are they the same you delivered to the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Graham. I cannot say these are the very same.</p>

               <p>Graham. I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but desired my Lord's steward might be called.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar and I went out together a house-breaking, for about six months last past, particularly last August, we got a hatchet, which we had laid by for that use; we went to look for it, and it was taken away about the 23d or 24th of August; then he said he could carry-me to a place where we could get a chisel, and that would do as well, so we went to this shop, and broke open the prosecutor's chest. I took out forty-one 36 s. pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the shop before?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I never was at it before nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go with the prosecutor afterwards?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, I was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know it was the prosecutor's chest?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I know no otherwise but by the quantity of the money, and the disposition of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We spent it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you of it?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I had about thirty of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have so much more than the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He did not know that I had so much. I took some out of it for my self, and the rest we shared.</p>
               <p>Q. Who broke the chest open?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He did, and I found the money; he took some tools.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>This evidence is a man of a very bad character; I have no questions to ask him, because I am but little acquainted with him; I have some witnesses here to my character.</p>
