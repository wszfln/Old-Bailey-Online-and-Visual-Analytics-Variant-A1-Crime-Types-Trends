I am in partnership with Stafford Briscoe; the prisoner came to our shop, on the 10th of December, about noon, and wanted to look at some diamond rings; we could not agree; he went out without buying any. I immediately missed one of a particular pattern, worth 8 guineas: I went out to see for him, and found him in Mr. Townsend's shop. in St. Paul's Churchyard, offering to sell it. I took him before my Lord Mayor; there he acknowledged he did take it. (The ring produced, and deposed to).</p>

            . I am a goldsmith, and live in St. Paul's Church-yard. The prisoner at the bar came into my shop, on the 10th of December, about 12 o'clock, and offered this ring to sale, saying, it was a friend's of his, who gave 16 l. for it. I told him it was not worth above half that money. Mr. Morrison came in immediately, and charged him with stealing it. The prisoner acknowledged he took it from his shop.</p>

I missed the things mentioned, out of my room, on the 13th of June; on that day the prisoner came to me, as I was in the hospital, and asked me to take a walk to Knights-bridge: we went there, and had a dinner of cod-fish. I perceived he wanted to get me in liquor. When we parted, I sent word by him to my wife, I would be with her in the morning. In the morning, my wife came to the hospital, crying, and told me the prisoner was gone away with all my cloaths: he came to me, and seeing her, ran down stairs, and I never saw him from that time, till the day after Christmas-day. I got to be an out-patient in the hospital, and made it my business to enquire after him, and was informed that day, he was at the Red Lion, in Chandler-street. As soon as he saw me, he whip'd up, and ran away, but was soon taken; he then had a suit of cloaths of mine on: we took him before Justice Fielding: he told him he bought them of a Jew, and that he never knew me. He had often been at my house, and passed for a lawyer, and I have since found, he passed with others for a doctor. I came acquainted with him by his lodging at my brother's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Oake. On the 13th of June, the prisoner came to my room, about 8 at night (he used to come every day): he said he had been to my husband, at the hospital, and my husband was pretty well: he said he was hungry, and gave me 2 s. and desired me to go and buy him a rabbet, and fry it; I gave him one again, and went and bought a rabbet, and fry'd it for him. While I was frying it, he went down stairs, and I never saw him again, till about a quarter after 10; then he came and asked me ten thousand pardons; he went and ordered a pot of beer; he was all in a sweat, and look'd confus'd; then he eat the rabbet; sometimes he had no money, but at that time he had money: he went away about a quarter after eleven, and I missed my husband's cloaths in about an hour after, (mentioning them by name.)</p>

Mr. Oake came to me about the 12th or 13th of June, and asked if the lawyer was there? he was not; he then had lodged with me for about three quarters of a year; from that time I did not see the prisoner for two or three months. When I saw him at a public house as I was going to North-Audley-street, I asked him for the money he owed me, and told him he was advertised; he pulled out a guinea. I said, I'll take you to a public-house, and change it, and send for Mr. Oake; he would not go there. I gave him half a guinea; he said he would call on me for his change the next day ( he owed me 7 s. 6 d.) but he never called; I owe him his change now.</p>

I do not know who brought it; it was in a dirty sack, and put into a place where I put my grease. Mistress lost her cloak much about that time, I believe it was that day.</p>

            . The woman called out, Stop thief; I followed the prisoner to St. John's wood, he held up this iron, and said he would dash my brains out, if I came near him; (producing a piece of iron near two feet long) I followed him almost to Marybone, from thence to Primrose-hill, and from thence, down to the Belsize-house, below Hampstead church. As I was getting over a ditch, he came back, and struck at me with this iron. I held up my arm to keep off the blow, and took hold of him, and brought him down in the ditch under me, and took the iron out of his hand. He put his hand into his pocket, I thought with intent to take some weapon out; I struck him over his head with the iron, and the blood ran; then he told me he would go civilly with me.</p>

I told him I had wanted to see him a good while, and was glad to see him, as we had long looked for him. I hand-cuffed him, to take him away; he owned to several robberies, and this among the rest, and said, he had a groat from one of the women, and two-pence from the other. He denied taking any silver: I searched his pockets, and found no silver.</p>

On Monday night last, about a quarter after 7, my maid servant came to me in the back shop, and told me somebody wanted me; I went forward, and saw the prisoner lying cross my counter: he got up and ran away; I pursued him, but could not take him. I returned back, and examined my till; I missed a little box, and the gold mentioned in the indictment, which I had seen in the box about an hour before. The next day, I got a warrant from Justice Palmer,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130006"/> and gave it to the officer. About 6 the following evening, the prisoner was taken up, and carried before the justice. When we were coming from thence to the New Prison, he said he wanted to speak to his mother; the officer stopt till his mother came up; they talked together; after which, the prisoner went to a tree with us, and from a hollow place, about the middle of it, he took out the bottom part of the box, and 2 guineas and a half. He was carried before Justice Palmer again, and upon his owning he did take it, the justice committed him: he is very young, I hope the court will consider his youth.</p>

Under the window, on one side the door, we took the whole pannel out: I got into the shop, and took out three great coats, four waistcoats, eight shirts, and eight silk and cotton handkerchiefs, five pieces of printed linnen, two remnants of silk, one about 8 yards long, a black cardinal, six pair of white gloves, four pair of worsted stockings and an odd one, we dropt the other; I hauled down a blanket from one side the shop, but did not take it away; I handed them out to the prisoner, then we put them into a bag, and went away with them, and the things that we broke the house with, to Thompson's house; there we distributed the things. He took three shirts, and I took three: we sent our wives to sell some of the things in Rosemary-lane.

            . I had a warrant against Branch from the bench of Justices, on Christmas-day in the morning: I went down to Saltpetre bank, and met with him there between 11 and 12 in the day. He made his information before the Justices, in Whitechapel, on the Monday: he impeached Thompson, as being concerned with him in breaking the house, and Biass for receiving a coat and waistcoat, and also he gave an account of other robberies. Then I went over the water, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130007"/> Thompson; and, in the house where he lodged, we found a coat and waistcoat on his bed; we tied his hands. Said he, pray is Branch turned informer? I said he is not made an evidence yet, but he has made an information. Said he, I doubt you are going to deceive me? I said no, he is not admitted; the prisoner had a white coat on: he said, the man that owns this coat, shall die with me, if I die; and a dozen of them shall die, if they will admit me an evidence. After we had secured Thompson, in the watch-house, we went to seek for Biass; we found him at cards in his lodgings, and he was committed.</p>

I was coming out of the Gun and Holly-bush, in the Back-lane, and saw Biass, with a bundle under his arm; I followed him; there was the evidence with him; they turned back, and looked at me, and ran away; I shot after them, and overtook them in a little alley; I took hold of the bundle, and said, my lad, let us see what you have got?

            . I am betwixt 14 and 15 years of age. I live with Mr. Parkinson. I was standing in Cursitor-street, when our maid came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130008"/> out of our house, and I knowing there was nobody at home to take care of the house, I went in, and met the prisoner coming up the kitchen stairs, in great confusion. I asked him what he wanted there? said he, is not this Mr. Brown's, the barber? I said no. Said he, will you tell him I call'd to shave him; he went out at the door, and came back again, and bid me not to forget. I followed him down Cursitor-street, and into Lincoln's-Inn: seeing he had something under his coat, I staid till he came in sight of people; then I asked him what he had under his coat? he said his apron. I called to two men to come and assist me, and kept hold of him; They came; I got the gown from him: he said a woman at a door gave it him, and bid him go and pawn it for half a crown; but I desired the people to bring him to our house, which they did.</p>

I turned about, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief half out of my pocket; he took it out, and past by me. I took hold of his collar, at Clifford's-Inn coffee-house, and said, you have pick'd my pocket: he said, I pick'd your pocket, Sir! I give you leave to search me: I have none of your handkerchief. I had not then mentioned the word handkerchief, I only said he had picked my pocket; this was about six in the evening. I took him into the coffee house, and sent for a constable, Mr. Webster, who was with me, said, if you can bring any substantial tradesman that can give you a character, you shall be at liberty. He said, there was somebody that knew him, on the other side Temple-bar; after that, he said the persons lived in Old-street. I told him, if he could bring any body next morning, he should then be at liberty, but nobody came; I never saw my handkerchief after. My friend said he saw two other dirty people near him, but I did not. I know I had it in my pocket when I was near Fetter-lane.</p>

I said, yes; he said, have you any business here? I said, yes; said he, I pawned a watch with you; I said, my business was about that: When we came to Sir John's, the office was so full of people, when the door was open, the prisoner, I believe, went out among the rest, and I saw no more of him, till last Monday, when Sir John sent for me again; he told me, the man was taken up for something else in the city: he was examined, I produced the watch, but the prosecutor did not attend, being then ill; but last Wednesday he did attend, and swear to the watch, as his property; the prisoner acknowledged he pledged it, but said, he knew nothing of the robbery.

The next day, I took him before the Alderman at Guildhall; we took the box there; the things were taken out, there were things of great value not mentioned in the indictment, then they were put in again, and the box nailed up again: the prisoner would not speak one word; he would give no answer at all to what was asked him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Baillie. I asked him several questions; he would not make any answer at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>They all said I was a Jew. I was afraid of getting my brains knock'd out, which made me afraid to speak: when I was coming along. I heard a cry, about something being lost; a man slipt by me, and away he ran. The gentleman says, he laid hold of me; it was the mob that laid hold of me.</p>

            . I never knew the prisoner before that time, only I saw some part of the affair that night. I was standing at the next shop to Miss Ramsay's, it is a milliner's shop, looking through the glass, having some jeweller's work to sell: there were people in the shop; I saw a man come out of the shop with a slapt hat, and an apron on; he unbuttoned the door and came out, with a box under his arm; and, in about two minutes after, Stop thief was cried out; the mob laid hold of the prisoner: some gentleman was there said, he had drop'd the box on his toes. I saw the man, as soon as he dropt the box, run cross the way again; it was not the prisoner; the prisoner is not the man that I saw come out of the shop with the box.</p>
               <p>Q Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I am sure of it: I am sure that man was taller than this man: I saw him unbutton the door, and go in, and button the door again, when he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is not the man?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I am sure he is not: that man ran cross the way; I did not see this man before he was taken hold of, and I saw the other man run cross the way when Stop thief was cried.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Baillie?</p>
               <p>Hatton. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him. (Mr. Baillie stands up.)</p>
               <p>Hatton. I think I saw this man among the crowd. I think he had hold of the man at the bar afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the box was down on the ground, was it the prisoner was laid hold on?</p>
               <p>Hatton. It was not above two or three minutes, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other man, at the time Stop thief was first called?</p>
               <p>Hatton. The man had crossed the way, and, I believe, ran a dozen yards then. - He ran immediately as soon as Stop thief was cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner run?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I can't say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say you never saw the prisoner before that night?</p>
               <p>Hatton. My lord, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be known, to give evidence here?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I work among the Jews. I am generally at the King's Arms in Hounsditch on a night. While I was telling the story, some of the Jews went out and brought the prisoner's wife in.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the shop, where the box came out, was the shop you was looking through the window?</p>
               <p>Hatton. That is on the right hand of the shop; it is a milliner's shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130012"/>Mr. Ramsay. That shop was shut an hour before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Hatton. It was about 5 o'clock - I think thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baillie. It was about 7.</p>
               <p>Hatton. It could not be 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear it was not fix?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I will venture to swear it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Hatton. It was a Saturday night, the 18th or 19th of November.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ramsay. It was after 7 o'clock: I went out immediately; I went for another man: I met this constable, and carried him with me, and he took hold of the prisoner, and brought him out of the shop directly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Baillie. How long had the prisoner been in your custody before Mr. Ramsay came in?</p>
               <p>Mr. Baillie. I believe it was about ten minutes; it was rather after 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hatton. Where do you live?</p>

               <p>Hatton. I work in the filagree way, making things for ladies hair, and dress caps in the fancy way; and I was looking to see it they had the same sort of goods as I had. The shop was not shut indeed, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Baillie. Did you observe that shop to be open?</p>

About a month or five weeks after, I was going up stairs to a woman that mends old cloaths, that lives in the house the prisoner does; going by his room door, I saw him counting a great parcel of half crowns out of his hand into a green purse: I went home and told my husband of it; we knew he was wanting money before; we had often lent him money; the most at a time was 13 s. he owned us 20 s. and 3 d. and had paid me between eight and nine days after our money was gone, and I recollecting that when I was at his house, I laid my key of the room down on his table, while I dined with him. I saw him have it in his hand, but when I went to go away, it could not be found. I was forced to have my lock taken off, for another key to be fitted to it; the lock was not altered at all; and the prisoner had bought cloaths and a great many things: these things together, made me suspect he had got in, and taken my money.

He was carried before Justice Culpeper, (he chose to go before him) he was discharged: then I heard him say, Come along, my boys, we will spend a crown of the money now. His trunk not having any direction upon it, as he was going with it, was brought back again to the George-Inn, in Aldersgate-street. I desired the bookkeeper to let me know of it when it came, which he did: we let him come to own it, that we might be sure it was his trunk; there I was ready with a constable, and took him up again. I had before he came, had a constable, and opened the trunk: we found 17 half crowns in it, and 3 l. in small silver. I had, before it was opened, described a half crown that was all like sand holes on the tail side, and that was found amongst them; (produced in court) this I know to be my property, and was amongst the money I lost.</p>

I miss'd it the next morning; as she was the only person that had been there that we could suspect, I concluded it was likely she might cut it into pieces, to make away with it, by way of sale, or pawn. At the first pawnbroker I went to, I found 2 yards of my cheque; this was in the same court in which I live: I got a warrant, and took her up. She said, if I would let her go to her room, she would give me the remainder of my cloth: upon which, the justice ordered me and the constable to go and search her lodging. We went; she would not open her door; we took her again to the justice: he committed her to Bridewell on suspicion. On the Monday, we had a search warr ant; we went and found her husband; he admitted us into the room; we told him we had a warrant to search his room: he took out about 4 yards and 3 quarters of cheque, that was hid under the bed. We found at Mr. Siers's shop, a pawnbroker, on Clerkenwell-Green, 7 yards pledged there, for 4 s. 6 d. and at Mr. Warner's, a pawnbroker, in St. John's-street, we found 6 yards: then I had found near 20 yards.

She came in again, in about an hour after, and brought a hat to pledge; I denied taking it in; she went away, and in about a quarter of an hour she brought in a pot of beer, and asked me to drink; I denied it, and would not a good while; but before she went out of the shop, I did drink: she said it was paid for, and went out of the shop.

She came in on the 24th of September: I enquired about her, and found she was gone to Norwich, with a weaver's wife; but upon the Thursday before Christmas, she was seen in Norton-Falgate, by a little girl, who got a man to bring her home. which he did, to the top of the alley, where I live, and I was sent for. I took her into the Green Dragon alehouse; her master was there: I went for a constable, and when I returned, I was told she had confess'd: then she told me she had taken 21 guineas, and how she had spent a great deal of it; and that some of the neighbours encouraged her to play at cards. The same she told me afterwards in prison. I had once seen her head peep over the wall; she told me one Garland, the next neighbour, lifted her up, and that he frequently used to lift her over the wall, to get into the house, when she was locked out.</p>

I am a lodger at Mr. Rogers's house; I did suspect she was got into some very bad company: I examined her how she came by things which she had, ribbons, necklaces, and cloaths; she said a young man gave them to her. I being a silver orris weaver, was fearful of being robbed: she had not been in my service at all, for three weeks before she was taken up.</p>

            . On the 16th of September, we sent twenty-eight sacks of coals to Esq; Leak at Mile-end, and I wrote the bill of parcels of that quantity, and delivered it to the prisoner: he drove the waggon with them; when he returned, he never mentioned a word that there was a misunderstanding: the other man that went with the other cart, brought me a few lines from Mr. Leak, that there were four sacks wanting, I read it to the prisoner, (my master, Mr. Salloway, was then ill in bed), the prisoner told me it was a mere mistake of Mr. Leak's boy, that should have taken an account of them, occasioned by his playing backwards and forwards with the girls. I saw the twenty-eight sacks delivered to the waggon.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Leak: the prisoner came with a waggon with coals, and delivered a ticket to me of twenty-eight sacks, but he brought but twenty-four; Mr. Leak and I chalked them down as they were brought in: I taxed him with the four sacks: he insisted upon it, he had brought twenty-eight, and my master might come and count the sacks. My master sat at the parlour-window, and chalked down as he brought them in, and I in the place where the prisoner brought them. My master came and asked me, how many I had chalked down? I said, twenty-four; the prisoner said, my master might come and tell the sacks; my master said, very likely, he might have twenty-eight empty sacks, but he had brought but twenty-four with coals, he was sure: my master sent a paper by the man that came with the next cart.</p>

               <p>I asked my master, what was to do? he told me, there was ten chaldron of coals to go to Mr. Leak's at Mile-end: I got it half loaded, and he stood by the waggon side: there came a gentleman on the wharf, and said, he wanted a sack of coals; my master ordered him a sack; said he, must I pay your servant that brings them in; my master said, as you please for that; he pulled out 3 s. and gave it into Mr. Salloway's hand; my master said to me, Thomas, load twenty-nine sacks; I loaded twenty-nine, and put my horses too: my master followed me into Fox's Lane; he there chalked the sacks, that nobody might have any suspicion, but what the sacks were his; he showed me the door where the sack was to be delivered; I knocked at the door, and a woman opened it; I carried it down the entry; I shot the coals; she said, must I pay your master for the sack of coals? yes, said I, my master is at the door; my master said, come along, I have received the money for the sack upon the wharf; I said, you may pay me for shooting; she gave me threepence: I put the empty sack into the waggon: going up the hill, my master said, Thomas, stop, I'll get up and chalk the other sacks, that nobody shall have any mistrust of these other sacks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130017"/> if they come by, but what they are my own sacks. I delivered two sacks more to the hair-merchant, according to his order; he kept going on: the woman said, must I pay you for the coals or your master? I said, which she pleased; she paid me, my demand was six shillings; she took out a six and nine-penny piece, I returned her nine-pence, and put the other in my pocket; then I drove on to the sign of the Cheshire Cheese, and delivered two other sacks by my master's order; I carried them up-stairs to a school-mistress, she paid me; then I drove on to Mr. Leak's with the remainder part of the coals, which were twenty-four sacks, by my master's order: when I came, I rang at the gate, the servant came, I delivered to him the ticket; I did not know the contents of it; I can neither write nor read; he gave the ticket to his master: I followed him up; he shewed me the hole where I shot the coals. The footman was there when I carried the last sack; I said, they are all out, come and see the sacks told; said he, they are all right; said I, if you please to come and see the sacks told, well and good; said he, they are all right, there are twenty-four. I put the sacks in the waggon, and drove down to the wharf, and began to load the second turn of the same coals. The wharfinger came up to me, and said, I understand your master is very bad; said he, the ticket delivered, was for twenty-eight sacks, and there was but twenty-four delivered. He went and delivered the paper at the house: my master got up, and came upon the wharf to me, and said, Thomas, for God Almighty's sake, be true to me, and take an oath and stand to it, that you delivered twenty-eight sacks to Esq; Leak, if you do not, I am ruined for ever; said I, I will do no such thing, to take an oath for you, I never will: Sir, you know you gave me orders to leave five sacks, which I did; four I received the money for, and one you did; here is the money, if you please to take it; said he, I am so ill, I must go in and lay down; keep the money in your pocket, and give it me at night. I drove twenty-eight sacks to Esq; Leak's a second time; after I shot the last sack, I asked the footman, if he chose to see the sacks told; he came and saw there was twenty-eight of them. I went home to the wharf, and fetched the remainder of the ten chaldron at night: after I had done, I asked if my master was within. Mrs. came, and said he was ill in bed; said I, I should be very glad to speak with him; this evening: she went up and came down, and said, her master wanted me to walk up to him: I did, and said, your servant, Sir, I am very sorrow to see you so ill; he said, I am very ill; how have you made the matter up about Esq; Leak's coals? I said, I heard no more of it; if there is any thing amiss, I left the coals by your order, as I am your servant, and here is the money I received for the other coals, and gave him a six and nine-pence and a five and three-penny piece, which was twelve shillings. Here are the witnesses to whom I delivered the coals.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ashford. I live by Shadwell church. I dealt with Mr. Salloway for coals: the last sack I had, was the Saturday was se'nnight, before Christmas day: I can't recollect the times the prisoner brought them; he brought them never above one sack at a time, but once, then he brought two sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Ashford. I believe it may be three months after my child was born, and that was born the 12th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Salloway by at the time they were delivered?</p>
               <p>Ashford. I cannot tell that; I only saw him twice at my house.</p>

I took the prisoner up last Saturday; I searched him, but found nothing upon him; he owned he took the prosecutor's watch, and offered me 2 s. to let him go; and said, he had 3 s. due to him at another place, which he would give me also: I would not let him go; he offered to make his escape from me, but I kept him secure.</p>
               <p>Job Biffen. I am an officer, and live five or six doors from the prosecutor. I had the prisoner in charge; he would not confess to me till the prosecutor came in; then he said to him, I have fed you and served you, how could you go and serve me so? you could not do it for want, as you have 10 s. a week; then the prisoner owned he took the watch, to us; the prosecutor asked him, where the watch was, and said, if he would tell him, he would go and take it out, and he should go about his business; the prisoner said it was somewhere in St. Giles's. We took him before Justice Berry; there he would not speak; the Justice said, you rascal, why don't you speak? then he said, I took the watch. What have you done with it? I have pledged it. Where? I don't know, it is somewhere by St. Giles's Pound. Go and shew the man where it is. The Justice wrote his mittimus to Newgate: we took him first to St. Giles's, then he said it was not there: we went farther; he wanted to make his escape, when we were going back again, down Tyburn-road; he said, this is the house, I believe, but cannot tell. We could not find it, then we took him to Newgate.</p>

Then the prisoner said, take hold of his arm; then one took me by one arm, and the other by the other, and dragg'd me up stairs, into a one pair of stairs room. Then the prisoner said, you shall give us 6 d. I said, for what? she said then you shall lie with us both. After that was over, I said, I will give you 6 d. if you will let me go? she said, she would, if I would give it her. After I had given her 6 d. she said I must give her 6 d. more for her sister: I gave her another 6 d. Then she said, now, d - n your blood, I'll have another shilling; I said, you shall not. She said, then I'll murder you: I said, no, you shall not. She took a knife, and held it to my belly, and swore she would murder me, in case I did not give her another shilling. When I saw the knife, I hesitated a little; she said, d - n you, why don't you give it me? then I put my hand into my left side pocket, and gave her a shilling: then she said, d - n you, you have got some sly pocket, or other, let me see it; then she turned my apron aside, and put her hand into my pocket. I began to call out; then a person came down from a one pair of stairs higher, and bid her let me go: then I said, one 6 d. was my master's, and I dare not go home without it; she swore she would not give it me: then the other woman that had received a 6 d. of the prisoner, gave that to me again. I was then on the middle of the stairs; then I went to my fellow-'prentice at the play-house, and told him what had happened: I was advised to go to Justice Fielding. I went, and told his clerk of it; he desired me to come again on the Monday evening, and described the two women, and they were taken up very near the same place where I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the women before?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I never saw either of them before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I shall be 20 years of age next June.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times might you have been at the play last year?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I was there but once last year, and but once or twice this year.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any attempt to get free from them?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I can't say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not, when you was in the street?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I began to be frighted, seeing nobody but whores and thieves: I was afraid she would call out murder, and I should fall into bad bread.</p>
               <p>Court. So then you rather chose to wait till the other woman came down, to help you up stairs.</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they get from you in the whole?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Two shillings and two pence, but I got one sixpence back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your master's money?</p>
               <p>Bailey. No; but I wanted it to go to the playhouse.</p>

            . I was never in company with the prisoner at the bar before that night; going thro' Holborn, I met with her: she asked me if I would go and drink a draught of purl.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. It was this day 5 weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. I lodge in Cross-lane.</p>

               <p>M. Jones. I lodged there a month.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she lodged in that lane?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. I don't know. As we were coming out from drinking the purl, she said, will you go home with me? She met this young man; I was on the other side, turning into Queen-street, about five yards before her: we went cross the street, through Queen-street, and to Cross-street; she asked the young man to go with her; she said, he was her acquaintance: she said, her husband was at home, and he would hand me down the candle to one pair of stairs; we went into a court, to a house next door to the Boot. As I walked before them, she asked me to take hold of his hand; he refus'd it. I said, why should you ask the young man to go, when he does not chuse it; she call'd me fool. I refused to lug him along: I walked before them, and at the door he gave her 2 d. for a pint of purl: she told me to go up stairs, I did: there was a drummer, he gave me a candle upon the stairs: I held it in my hand, and lighted them up stairs as I stood upon the stairs. When they were up stairs, she asked me to come in; then she asked me if I would be concerned with him. I told her I would not: she picked him up. They offered me some beer; I saw him give her 6 d. she asked him for another; he gave her another: she gave me one of them; then she intruded upon him to give her a shilling more: I turned my face to the fire, and he cry'd out murder. I turned round, and saw a knife in her hand: I asked her if she was not ashamed to show a knife to any body. She bid me mind my own business. She did not intend to hurt him, but to fright him, to see if he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130020"/> give her more money. He said his master sent him on an errand, and gave him 6 d. and if he went home without his errand, his master would use him ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him give her any thing after you saw the knife?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. No, I did not. I desired her to give him the 6 d. but she would not; then I gave him the 6 d. I had; he was then gone down stairs, and stood at the street door. There were several people came down, and asked her if she was not ashamed of herself, by reason the young man call'd out, and cry'd, concerning his master's 6 d. I would not go in her company any more. On the Monday, I went and bought me a pair of pumps, and met the prisoner, and another woman with her. I told the other woman what a fright I was in: we were all three taken up about the middle of Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the drummer after that?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. I do not know. He came to the gaol, and threatned to destroy me.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Monday evening, the 12th of last month, Mr. Marsden, and this lad, Bailey, came to my shop: Marsden said, this lad has been robbed by some of my neighbours. I asked the lad if he should know them? he said, he should. I desired him to go into a public-house, a little way down Drury-Lane, and see if any of the parties were there: he did, and said there was none of them. We went down Great Queen-street, then into Little Queen-street; going along, I saw some women standing; I went to them, and said, young man, look at these women; he bid me take hold of the prisoner at the bar: I took her by the wrist; he said, this is the woman, I will swear, that held the knife to me and robbed me; the evidence was going along towards Holborn. I said to her, where are you going? she said she was going home. I called to the young man, to come and look at her: he had a sight of her face, by the light of a lamp, in Little Queen-street; said he, this is the woman that was with her. Mr. Fielding's clerk asked the young man to show the place where he was ill treated; he said he could; we went to Cross-lane: when we came to the place, it was dark; he went and got a half-penny candle, and lighted it, and went directly up to the very room of the prisoner at the bar, and said, this is the room where I was threatened and robbed: we took the two women to Sir

            . This evidence is a servant under me, to take care of these lighters, and other goods, upon the keys: he called me in the dusk of the evening; I stepped forward, with a candle and lanthorn in my hand: he said, I saw a handkerchief handed out of the lighter into an empty lighter; I bid him go and fetch it up; he did; I carried it to a house in Dark-house-lane, and laid it down. After the prisoner came in, I asked him if he knew who took the tobacco? Mr. Ward<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130023"/> said, Beckett was the man that handed it out of the lighter; then I carried him to the Compter; I did not see him handle the tobacco at all; neither am I of opinion that he was the man that opened the hogshead, and took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you believe it was taken from?</p>
               <p>Linton. From out of a hogshead.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe that?</p>
               <p>Linton. There had been a hogshead opened, and it was put close too again; but when we came to examine it narrowly, we found some tobacco was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ward. Did you examine the hogsheads?</p>
               <p>Ward. I did immediately, and found one of the heads was hollow; it went in.</p>
               <p>Q. to Linton. Whose tobacco was it?</p>
               <p>Linton. It was the property of Messrs. Bucannan, Hinman, and Lankaster; there was no other tobacco that was shipped, but theirs; I have known the prisoner 8 years, and never heard he was detected in any bad action, nor ever saw any thing bad of him. I don't believe he was the man that opened the hogshead.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain your reason for your belief?</p>
               <p>Linton. All the reason I have to believe that, is, I never saw him down in the lighter; he was at the end of the lighter, holding what we call the Guy. I always looked upon him to be an honest hard-working man.</p>
               <p>Q. How much tobacco was missing?</p>
               <p>Linton. It is impossible to judge; but according to my opinion, there was more than 20 pounds missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was working at the tobacco; I never saw the handkerchief, and know nothing of it. There were five men along with me.</p>

On the 3d of this instant, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, I was weighing some goods: I saw the prisoner with a piece of cloth in his hand, behind him: Hollo, said I; with that he dropped the piece behind him, and turned about seemingly unconcerned. Said I, what was you doing with that piece of cloth? he said, he did not touch it; we seized him, and carried him to the Compter, and the next day before the sitting alderman, at Guild-hall, who committed him to Newgate. As we were going to Newgate, he said, he had it in his hand; that he took it from the ground, and was going to lay it on a chest: the cloth came out of a Hamburg ship, packed up in chests: (produced in court) in one chest there was a place where it had been drawn out.</p>

Then he came to my house again. I never heard any harm of him in my life; he has been at my house commonly. Last year, he worked at ballast-work, and on board of ships.

I saw him get upon the fore wheel, and take hold of the coat, and pull it off; just as he had got it off, the prosecutor came out at the door: he ran directly round the coach; I heard him say to the man, where is my great coat? the prisoner was going back again, to put it on the coach; he seeing the prosecutor look at him, threw it down, and ran away. He was soon taken.</p>

I stood at the farther end of the house, on Wednesday the 5th instant, about 7 in the evening: the prisoner came into the tap-room, and stood against the fire. My servant and he had some words together; I saw the prisoner go towards the door, with a tankard by his side; it was without a lid. My servant followed him out at the door; in a little time he returned to me, and said, I have let the tankard go to Mr. Marshall's shop (Mr. Marshall is a barber); I said, it is very well; no more passed that night. The next morning, going there, and not finding my tankard, I then suspected it was lost. I made the best enquiry I could, about the prisoner and tankard; I found the prisoner at the Crooked Billet, in Kingsland-road, about four or five days following: I told him, there was something betwixt him and I, and desired to speak to him on one side; he said, he knew there was something. A man in company looked me in the face, and asked what I wanted with the man? I said, unless you behave yourself well, I shall take you along with him. I told the prisoner, if he would tell me where my tankard was, or if he had pawned it, I would pay the money, and take no farther notice of it, and it will be the better for you. He said, he had carried it into Hounsditch, and met a Jew, and the Jew gave him a guinea, and a bad shilling for it: he produced the shilling immediately: we removed him from that public-house to another, and talked to him in the same manner; he persisted in it he could say no more. I asked him, did the Jew ply you, or did you call to him? he said, he was drunk, and could not well tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with your tankard again?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No, I never heard any thing more of it; the prisoner was carried to New Prison, and afterwards he had a hearing before a magistrate, and he was committed to Newgate.</p>

            . I am Mr. Lloyd's servant. The prisoner at the bar came into the house, and called for a tankard of beer: I drawed it in a silver tankard; he stood with his back to the fire, and bid me put it on the bar; I did, and went about my business directly. I came out of the cellar, and saw him take it from the bar, and go to the door; I followed him: he said, I am going to the barber's with the tankard; I stood at my master's door and saw him go in at the barber's shop, with the beer. In the morning, I went to the barber's for the tankard, and it was not there; they said, the young man came in with a tankard, almost full of beer, and he brought it back again, as the person was not there, which he said he brought it to drink with. I never saw him since he took the tankard from the bar, till to-day; he had used our house once or twice a day, for about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Whether did you give me the tankard, or I took it from the bar?</p>
               <p>Barrett. The prisoner took it from the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else see me take it from the bar?</p>

The person with me had a gun in his hand: we wanted to know what they had got; the prisoner begged we would let him go. My friend said he would shoot him, if he offered to make his escape; he said he might, if he would: the other man ran away, I overtook him, we scuffled, and at last he got from me, and got off: the man with the gun brought the prisoner to Westburn-green, and they sent two or three men to fetch the fowls; there were four geese and a gander; two of the geese and the gander were dead.</p>

            . The prosecutor came to me about seven weeks ago, on a Thursday night, and said he was robbed such a morning in Stepney-fields, and that the two men were at the sign of the Ship, and one was named Shields or Williams; we went to divers houses; when we found the prisoner, he insisted upon it, that the prisoner was the man that was in company with the man that presented the pistol to him; I carried him to Mr. Clark's: the prosecutor called me to the door to know who was to have the reward, if he was hanged; I said, d - n the reward, don't hang the man for the reward. I lodged the prisoner in the Cage, and in the morning we took him before Justice Berry: the prosecutor there swore the prisoner was in company with the man that presented the pistol, and that the other owed him some money. The prisoner was committed for farther examination: I have known the prisoner nine months; I never saw him in liquor half so much as he was that night.</p>
               <p>Q. To prosecutor. Did you ask what the reward was?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They said I would hang him for the reward. I swore before Justice Berry the same as I now swear here. I did not say it was the other man that held the pistol.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marks. I am headborough. The first time he was before Justice Berry, he swore the prisoner was in company with the man that had the pistol: the next time, he swore the prisoner was the man.</p>

               <p>AEneas Clark. I live near the Victualling-office. The prisoner came to me, and said he had been stopt by a person that wanted to rob him, and wanted to know of me how he should act in it, in order to make it up; he said, if he had the money it cost him, he would drop it. The woman that Mr. Ballentine lives with, said, it was a wrong thing, that the man was innocent; then the prosecutor said, if he had a guinea, he would make it up, and, if he did not agree to that, he would hang him: the woman wanted me to lend her money on her silver-buckles; I said, I would not; she got half a crown: the prosecutor said, he would take it, and then she would owe him eighteen shillings, and then he would wash his hands of innocent blood; he went to a wash-house and washed his hands in a hand-bowl; the Justice asked him, if he would swear to the man; he said he would to the best of his knowledge; the Justice said, you blockhead, what are you about? either swear it or not; he said, well then, d - n it, he is the man.</p>

            . The prosecutor is my acquaintance; he came to me, and said, he was robbed last Tuesday was se'nnight; I asked, who robbed him; he said, one that was in custody; he asked me to go along with him: I went to Justice Berry; the prisoner was there; the prosecutor said to me, is there not a reward? I said, what did he rob you of? he said, he robbed me of nothing; he said, two men came to him, and one of them ask'd him, if his name was Luise; that he had only seven farthings in his pocket, and they took nothing from him: I at that time thought he was broke down, and wanted money; he did not then say which had the pistol; he came to me a second time, and said, he believed he should have no reward; he said, he would make it up for three or four guineas; I said, may be the poor people may not have a farthing; he said, there were silver-buckles and other things; I said, he must get a lawyer; he said, he could do better than a lawyer.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130029"/> I was in company when the woman and Mr. Clark was with him; he called for a pint of gin hot; there was brandy brought by mistake; the prosecutor was consulting with Mr. Clark what to do; I told Mr. Clark, he had a mind to make it up, and not prosecute; he and Mr. Clark went out; he came back, and said, he would make it up for a guinea; she said she would agree to it, to get the man out of gaol; she gave him half a crown in part of payment; she took the buckles out of her shoes, and desired Mr. Clark would lend her some money upon them; he would not: we drank pretty freely; he said he would go back again, and get five shillings more; I had like to have got my brains beat out by a parcel of women.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think of the honesty of the prisoner at this time?</p>
               <p>Crawford. By this discourse, I began to think him not guilty of the charge, by the prosecutor wanting to get money from the people, and he was not willing to prosecute the man. Upon the last examination, the Justice called him villain, and said he had a good mind to commit him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They got me drunk, and the prisoner's wife wanted to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Crawford to advise with him about this matter?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I only went to him in a civil way?</p>

I had a thing like a screw-driver, with which I broke open a box in one of the garrets, and took out two suits of cloaths; then I went into another garret, and broke two more boxes, and took out several books, but I did not take them away: we took a linnen gown, a silk and stuff gown, ruffles, aprons, caps, shifts, and several things, and tied them up in a rug upon the bed: I never saw the ring, buckles, or thirty-six shillings piece, that are laid in the indictment: we went out with the bundle at the window again, and down to Nokes, and delivered them to him, and he carried them on his back to my room in Long-lane: we got there by 9 o'clock; the next day, or day after, we sold the two gowns, coat and breeches, to one Levi that is here; he lives in Hounsditch: we kept one brown waistcoat, that I had.</p>

               <p>Ives. Nokes was out, and met with him, and brought him to my room; I had never seen him before: Brown breakfasted and dined with me every day. When Nokes brought the Jew to us; he said he was a good honest fellow; he had known him a great many years, and was what they call an Old Fence: we agreed for two guineas; he paid us half a guinea, and said he would bring us the remainder the next day. He took them away in a bag, but we never could get any more money of him: the women's wearing apparel we divided into three parcels; I laid them out, Nokes chose one parcel; he had two shifts, two pair of ruffles, and two or three white handkerchiefs; I am not certain whether he had not an apron. Brown did not want any; he said, I might have his part; so he gave them to me. I think we divided them the day after Levi was gone. Nokes wanted money, so I gave him fourteen shillings, which is one third of two guineas, 10 l was three shillings and sixpence out of pocket. This was at the Nag's-head in Hounsditch; the Jew met us there. I was taken up the 27th or 28th of November, for another fact, and examined before Sir

            . I have lived in Hounsditch seven or eight years. I am an old cloathsman, and dress old hats. I was crying old cloaths in Bread-street in the city; Nokes called me behind, and said, will you buy a parcel of cloaths? I said, where? he took me to an ale-house, we had two pints of beer, I paid for them; he had a woman with him; he said to her, you may go about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130031"/> your business; I shall go with the man, and let him see the cloaths, I went with him to Ives's room; he opened a chest, and took out a linnen gown, and another gown made of silk and stuff, and a camblet coat with silver-buttons and button-holes, and breeches; he asked me three guineas for them. Ives had a brown coat on, which he gave into the bargain: we agreed for two guineas; I paid half a guinea in hand: I took them away with me, and sold them in a day or two after. Some to a woman that came out of the country to buy things; and some to another person where I could get the best money for them.</p>

They all three came to my house three or four days after; I said, I could not pay them, I had no money; I have got four small children, and, if I paid them all the money, my children must die; I have enough to say against Brown, but nothing more about these cloaths.</p>

            . I am mother to the evidence Ives. I have known the two prisoners about ten weeks; they used to come to my son. This Jew came twice; I saw him buy some cloaths of them once, but the particular time I cannot tell; he took the cloaths away; he came the next day, and asked them, why they did not tell him they were in the Chant, that is, the News Papers.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have been drawn in, in a cruel manner, by Ives. I came home from the Havanna; and was sitting at a public-house; he came and asked me, if I would drink any beer, and then to take a walk with him; we went round Bedford-row: he said he would give me a coat, he bought one, and gave nine shillings for it: he gave me some dinner; I did not know his design when I went with him. When we came near Lincoln's Inn fields, he gave me some purl, and a welch rabbet; he pulled out a small dark lanthorn and a wax-candle; I said, I did not like it; he bid me give myself no concern; so I went on with him in four or five robberies. I recommend myself to the mercy of the court: I have been nine years in his Majesty's service. Ives told me, he has been several years a house-breaker. If any favourable sentence can be for me, I hope I shall have it.</p>

               <p>I have such a bad set of people to deal with, and I have nobody that will come nigh me; I have been so long in confinement, that I am incapable to subpoena people to come for me. I know nothing of the charge; this is done to swear my life away to save themselves.</p>

On the 27th of November, about half an hour after nine at night, the maid was ordered to go up and warm the bed: when she got upon the stairs, she was frighted; she came down, and said she saw a light, and thought she discovered the flap of a man's coat go up the three pair of stairs, before her; she said, she believed there were thieves in the house. Her Mrs. being big with child, I said, don't pretend to fright your mistress, go up again; she did, and the boy with her, and came down more frighted than before: then I went up, and I found the things all about in the two pair of stairs room, from out of a chest of drawers. I said to my boy, go and get me some assistance, I'll go no farther, at present; he went, and got a person, who came with a poker; we went up, and found the thieves had got out at an end window, in the garret; it was made to go out, in case of a fire; they had broke a pane of glass to put their hand in, to unhasp it; that we found open. My shop where we work above, was tumbled all about; they had broke a hole there, and took out many valuable things. I missed from there, and in a closet, and from drawers, the things mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them by name); I have got some of them again, which were found in the street. Ives was taken in the pursuit, and brought back; he dropped many things in the street, and some were found upon him. I have here two pair of buckles, which I received from Ives, and the constable has some effects which he found upon Ives.</p>

            . On the 27th of November, Brown and I went out of my room, and went in at an empty house, in Gutter-lane, within two or three doors of Mr. Hanwell's house; we went to the top of the house, and upon the ridges, till we came to his house; there I broke a pane of glass, and put my hand in, and opened the casement; I went in first, and he followed me: we took the things mentioned in the indictment; I put some in my pockets, and he some in his. I had the gold watch and some of the rings, and some gold ear-rings, and the money; two crown pieces, some half crowns, shillings, pence, two-pences, three-pences, and four-pences. Brown had the pint silver mug, the coral, and all the rest of the things. Brown said he sold the pint mug for 3 l. at Chatham; the maid came up stairs, just as we were going away, and put us in a fright; said she, is that you above? (I suppose she thought it was her master); Brown said, yes, my dear: we went out-there again, and came down the empty house, we were pursued; Brown ran towards the end of Friday-street, and I towards the end of the Old 'Change. I was taken with some of the things. I dropped the watch in the street, as they were carrying me to the Compter; I was taken before Mr. Alderman Stevenson, and there made my confession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say in my behalf; only I leave myself to the mercy of the court. Ives was the first that brought me in, and now he is going to take my life away; he knows what he did at Martinico, when he threw the dice to save his life. I hope you will detain the Jew; he has been the ring-leader of us all, as well as Ives; he bought the things belonging to Dr. Askew, for two guineas, that were worth many pounds.</p>

I have got the gold seal again, which Ives's wife, as he calls her, gave me. There were petticoats of my wife's, and a crape gown, and other things, taken out of a trunk: the gold watch and watch chain cost me 30 guineas. I went to see Ives in the Poultry-compter: he told his wife to go home with me, and give me all the things that were marked with his name.

            . In the beginning of July last, I advertised a house to be sold. Mr. Prince applied to me to purchase the house; we had several meetings about it; and on the 7th of July, I delivered my memorandum, setting forth the terms upon which I would sell it; he then desired to have that memorandum, to keep it till the next day, to show to his attorney and some friends. He applied to me the next morning about 9 o'clock, at the New York coffee-house. Soon after he came in, he said he must have the house, and he would give me my price; and soon after, he had two copies of the memorandum that I gave him, brought in by a little boy, wrote out fair; one of them I have in my hand; we examined them; he had left out a few articles, which I pointed out to him, and added at the bottom with my own hand. I signed one of them, and the prisoner the other: I held mine in my hand, and said, now Mr. Prince, where is the 100 l. (he was to give me 100 l. by way of deposit, which I should have told before) he took out a pocket-book, and said, I have not cash enough about me this morning, but here is a very good bill of exchange for 125 l. I said, if it was a good bill, it was as good to me as cash. I took it in my hand, and looked at it, and asked him, who Bricklen and Co. were? he said, they were great distillers, and brandy merchants, and lived near the watch-house, in Moor-fields; that they served Orcherton, the accepter of the bill, and that he keeps the Rose tavern, in Cursitor-street, where the bill is directed to; and that it was for brandy and rum that he had had of them. I gave a receipt for the bill, under the memorandum that I had wrote before, describing the bill; which bill, when paid, was in part of payment of the above sum. (The memorandum produced by the constable; he takes it in his hand). This is the agreement I signed; it is my own hand-writing.</p>

               <p>R. Mackoun. I put the bill up, being satisfied with it, and we parted. About a week after, Mr. Prince applied to me, to have a broker, to appraise the goods. I was a little surprized at his wanting to appraise the goods, before the duplicates of conveyance were made, and the money paid. I began to enquire after Mr. Prince, and could find nobody that knew him; neither could I find Bricklen and Co. I sent my clerk to Moorfields; he could find no such people in the parish.

            's, as bankers know a great many people: the clerks there said, they knew no such people about London. I enquired at the Custom-house, if they knew of any such people making entries there? I could get no intelligence at all of these brandy-merchants. By that time, I had heard a very bad character of Mr. Prince: I went to the Rose tavern, in Cursitor-street; I heard there were bad people about the house, I did not chuse to go alone, so I took a gunsmith, an acquaintance of mine that lived in the neighbourhood, with me; I told him what I was going about, and beg'd he would remember what passed. We went to enquire after Mr. Orcherton, the accepter of the bills there was one Fisher, who said it was a very good bill, and would be paid when due; Orcherton was then gone away, and left his house. I did not believe what Fisher said: he gave Mr. Prince and Orcherton very good characters, but said, he did not know Bricklen. I asked him if he knew Prince very well, and if he was a man of fortune? he enquired to know what my business was, and my reason for enquiring after him. I told him my reason: said he, you had better keep your house, and give him back his bill. I went to my attorney directly, and told him what I thought, and advised with him what to do: he advised me to give up the bill, and get back the memorandum, as I could not sell my house, while he had that. About three or four days after I had been at the Rose tavern, I saw Mr. Prince, and told him; this was a bad bill, that I had enquired after Bricklen and Co. and could find no such people; and that I had enquired after Orcherton, and he was gone away, and I could not find where he was gone to. He told me, that Bricklen, in truth, was an outlawed smuggler; that he was worth three or four thousand pounds, and the bill would be paid when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130034"/> due (it was not due then); he said, he lodged in some lane or alley, in Moorfields: there was a great deal passed between him and I. I offered to give him back his bill, if he would give me up my memorandum: he said, he had friends that would raise him the money; he insisted on his bargain, and I kept the bill till it became due; I had not given him the draught of the conveyance. Orcherton became a bankrupt before it became due, but I discovered where he was; I sent the bill to a notary public, near the 'Change, the day before it was due, and told the gentleman, Mr. Shamburg, what I suspected, and ordered him to do the needful, to present it for payment to Orcherton, at the Rose tavern, and apply to see if he could find Bricklen and Co. The bill has never been paid, nor never will: I went to the notary-public one morning to get the bill back, in order to go to Justice Fielding: I went into a coffee-house, and read the prisoner advertised; he was taken up on some other account, and was to be reexamined; I went to the justice's, and he was examined on this bill: he then said, Bricklen was gone into Yorkshire; I believe he then said, Bricklen lived in the country. Sir John told him, if he would give him an account what part of Yorkshire he was in, he would send an express for him at his own expence, and told him, it was a very material affair to him; the prisoner waved it, and he put it off.</p>

            , and another gentleman, whose name, if I ever heard, I do not remember. Hart, Prince, and that gentleman and I, went up into a bed-chamber, in order to write notes; the prisoner told me, that by this and others, he could raise money to pay for the house, and then have it mortgaged, to raise money to take up the notes with: at that time I wrote this and others by his persuasion, which I delivered to him; but there was not G. Bricklen and Co, on this at that time; I never remember to have heard of that name, till I saw it upon this draught, at Mr. Mackoun's attorney's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never deal with Bricklen and Co. for brandy and rum.</p>
               <p>Orcherton. No, I know nobody of that name; at the time I wrote them, he told me, that gentleman that was with us was to sign them; that he was a quaker, and worth a great deal of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where that gentleman lived?</p>
               <p>Orcherton. I do not remember that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any dealings with that quaker for rum or brandy?</p>

               <p>Orcherton. It was to be sold by auction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Prince bid for the house?</p>
               <p>Orcherton. He did; he was the highest bidder, and deposited ten guineas in cash; he came to me after that, and gave me a draught for 95 l. odd, and said, if the broker came in his absence, I might shew it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him pay the ten guineas?</p>
               <p>Orcherton. No, but I heard him say, he did pay that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him sign the agreement?</p>
               <p>Orcherton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. For whose benefit was the purchase to be made?</p>
               <p>Orcherton. He told me it was to be made for my benefit; those notes were to raise the money, in order to pay for the house, and the house to be mortgaged, in order to pay the bil ls.</p>

            . I was clerk to Mr. Mackoun. (He takes the bill in his hand) This is drawn in the name of Bricklen and Co. I went twice to enquire after a person named Bricklen, as near the watch-house as I could, in Moorfields, because Mr. Mackoun told me he lived near the watch-house, on the right hand, going up Moor fields. I went pretty near the watch-house; the first I spoke to was a surgeon, who stood at his own door; I asked him if Bricklen and Co. brandy-merchants, were to be found thereabouts; then I enquired if there were any of that name stable-keepers? the gentleman said, there was nobody of that name: he said, there was a watch-box over the way, where lived some merchants. I went as he directed me, and enquired every 2d or 3d house, till people were surprized at me; I could not hear of any such person: after that, I was sent to Mr. Shamburg, by the 'Change, and when the bill was due, I went to Moor fields again, and enquired of many people on each side the field. but could not hear of any body of the name, or like it; neither did I hear of any brandy-merchant there.</p>

            ; I have seen him along with the prisoner at the bar: it is about three years since I knew him first; the last time I saw him with Mr. Prince, was at the Swan and Two Necks, in Smithfield, by Hicks's-hall, better than 12 months ago, last October, or some where there away.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times may you have seen him?</p>
               <p>Boucher. I have seen him ten or a dozen times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write?</p>
               <p>Boucher. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell how you came to be acquainted with his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Boucher. At the Swan and Two Necks, in October was a twelvemonth, I had been at Hicks's-hall, about some business; the prisoner hipp'd me as I was going by; he called to me, and asked me how I did? (I had known him some time before) I told him pretty well; how do you do, Mr. Prince? - will you come in, and drink a glass of wine? - I am about some business here, at Hicks's-hall. - You are playing the dickens with one Clark: I answered, it is no more than he deserves. I went in; there was Mr. Bricklen; there was an agreement about buying or selling some horses: there was a note of hand drawn up: the man said, he had male his bargain, and would have his money. The other said, he would pay him some time. I offered to pay 6 d. for part of what liquor I had drank. Mr. Prince asked me, if I had any money in my pocket, to make this easy; lend me so much money: I said, I had but 3 guineas in my pocket, I cannot part with it all; I lent it to Mr. Bricklen, and said to Mr. Prince, I look upon you to give me security for the money; I had a note from them both, Bricklen signed it in my presence. I saw him write the note, and the agreement with the countryman; he would have his money; it was due in ten days: and about three weeks after, Mr. Prince came and took up the note, and paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you know his hand-writing again?</p>
               <p>Boucher. Really I don't know whether I can or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he sign his name?</p>
               <p>Boucher. He signed G. Bricklen, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note. (He takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Boucher. The note is not his hand-writing: the G. Bricklen, is like his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, or do you not believe the name, G. Bricklen, to be the hand-writing of the same person?</p>
               <p>Boucher. It is very like it, to the best of my knowledge - it is like some part of it - to the best of my knowledge, it may be his hand-writing - I cannot be positive to it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this all the knowledge and acquaintance you have of Bricklen?</p>
               <p>Boucher. I never had any more acquaintance than seeing him with Mr. Prince.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only time you have been in any house with him, has been at the Swan and Two Necks?</p>
               <p>Boucher. I have been with him at the Bull and Garter, in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Boucher. I live in Fleet-lane, now; I have been with him at the Green Dragon, in Smithfield; I have seen him many times about Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever present at any other dealings than that of horses?</p>
               <p>Boucher. No. I have seen him talk to people about dealing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you lent the money upon Mr. Prince's account?</p>
               <p>Boucher. I did. Bricklen signed the note, and gave it to Mr. Prince; and Mr. Prince indorsed it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to accept of Mr. Prince's note alone?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130037"/>Boucher. Mr. Prince said, he was a man of credit: I made some objections, I had rather not lend the money than lend it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man, Mr. Bricklen, dealt in horses, and he had partners that dealt with him; that was the reason he signed in that way. I desire Mr. Mackoun may be asked the question, whether I ever desired to come into his house, or not?</p>
               <p>Mr. Mackoun. He did not ask me to come in, but he wanted the goods appraised immediately, which I suspected was with a view to get into possession,</p>

            . I am trusted with a deal of cloth of Messrs. More and Townsend in Blackwell-hall. There has been three cloths cut within six or seven weeks; I suspected the prisoner a long time. I hid my man in a Pile on purpose, by which means the prisoner was discovered: the prisoner has confessed, and given it me in his own hand-writing, that he cut three pieces of More and Townsend's; for which hundreds of people have been taken up in the country, and carried before the magistrates. He owned he cut four yards from two of them, and three from one piece; he said he was sorry he ever meddled with any thing that I was concerned with; I always found him out too soon.</p>
               <p>Theyer Townsend. I am in partnership with Mr. More: (he produced the pieces which the four yards was cut from, and the pieces; they corresponded exactly). I heard the prisoner confess, he took and cut the pieces, and sold the pieces to one Bulcock, piecebroker, without Temple-bar, behind St. Clement's Church. We took a warrant to search his house, and secure him: we found these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130038"/> four yards here produced, which he owned he bought at eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Cotton. The prisoner owned he sold all that he cut from our cloth to this Bulcock, who is now in Newgate.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she a servant?</p>
               <p>M. Holland. I cannot say whether she was a servant or not. Mr. Evans found her with my things on her, except one shift, on the Saturday following, in Half-moon-street; the other shift was found in her lodgings. (The things produced, and deposed to).</p>

               <p>This gentlewoman told me, I was very welcome to put on them cloaths every time I went out. I had been enticed away from my service in Tyburn-road, and she knew how badly I had been used, and she said I was very welcome to any thing she had that was suitable to go out in.</p>
               <p>M. Holland. I told her she might wear them, if she asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. What station was she in?</p>
               <p>M. Holland. I do not know: I believe she has been but a very little time in the house.</p>

               <p>M. Holland. No, she had not; neither did I lend her these: I was not at home when she took them.</p>

I took the prosecutrix's box from off the bed, in order to take out a bolster, last Wednesday morning: going to set it down, it flew open; I found it had been robbed, and told the prisoner and another young woman, a lodger, there had been a robbery there: I made the prisoner go along with me to the prosecutrix; when we came back again, I asked her about an apron, because I saw it on the Sunday and Monday before on the prisoner; she said she had carried the apron to Mrs. Simpson's maid; and, as to the stockings which she had on, she said she brought them from Edinburgh with her; I had a very good character with the prisoner from the country; there were many things in the kitchen which she might have stolen, but I lost nothing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Simpson. I know the prisoner's parents, they live in East Lauther in Scotland; they are very honest people; I never knew her till she came to London; I have heard that she always behaved well.</p>

             M'Dermont. On the 21st of last month, I had been out about a little business; when I came home, I found a glass-window backwards was broke, and a brass candlestick was lying on the ground, and another missing; we were informed the prisoner was seen at that window; he was soon taken and carried before Justice Welch; there I saw my candlestick taken out of his pocket, (produced and deposed to); he said another man gave it him in the street to sell.</p>

On the latter end of January, or the beginning of February, he came to our warehouse; we were both together: he said, Gentlemen, I have got a gentleman come from Quebec, in partnership in a very good house; they are people of very great eminence, and will be very good customers: he has very large orders with me, and for the friendship and favours that I have received at your hands, I intend he shall deal as much with you as possible, therefore I should be glad you would send half a score pieces of velvets, Mr. Paterson is to see them at my house: (that was the name) Paterson, he said, was the gentleman come from Quebec. Paterson, M'Randall and Grant, he said were the partners; we were unacquainted with them then, but we enquired their characters of divers people that came from Quebec, before I sent the goods in: Mr. Cook owed me at that time upwards of 500 l. it was this house, not his character, that induced us to send in the goods; we sent in ten pieces of Manchester velvets, of different colours to Mr. Cook's in Sife-lane; this was either the latter end of January last, or the beginning of February: we entered them down in a pocket memorandum book, when we delivered them out (that book is in the hands of our assignees.) I sent,</p>

            , with a bit of paper, whereon was wrote the numbers of 7 of the pieces, and underwrote at the bottom, for Paterson, M'Randall, and Grant; these were the seven pieces Mr. Paterson had chose out of the ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand-writing was it?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. That I cannot tell; Rice was apprentice to the prisoner then I believe: the numbers did not tally with ours: we sent it back again, to have the mistake rectified, imagining he had put down some numbers of other people: he brought 7 numbers a second time, which then were not right; he went back again, and came a third time with 7 numbers, then they were exactly right; they were 7 of the pieces we had sent in; he desired we would make out the bill of parcels, and send it in: I made out the bill of parcels, and, to the best of my remembrance, I delivered it to Mr. Cook himself, that he might sign it, and deliver it to Mr. Paterson (that is the usual method). I made my bill upon Messrs. Paterson, M'Randall, and Grant. I believe that afternoon, or the next day, I asked Mr. Cook for the other three pieces? Mr. Cook said, he had had an order from Amsterdam, and he had sent them, and I must put them to his account; they suited him for another order he had from Amsterdam; he said, he himself was to be made debtor (which very reluctantly I did). I told him, he was so much indebted to us, that I did not chuse to go any farther, and I thought he used us very ungenerously; he said, he would soon make it up to us, and pay us every farthing. I was to give credit two months: when it wanted about a week, or ten days, of two months. I went to the New-York coffee-house, and enquired for Mr. Paterson. I was answered by Mr. Clark, the master of the house, he had been gone almost a fortnight for Quebec. I was a good deal surprized, and immediately went to Mr. Cook, and told him of it; and asked him how he could take up goods for such a person, when he was sensible to himself, he was gone out of the Kingdom? he said, he was sure it was a mistake; it was an oversight, he must have forgot it; he was a very good man, a very punctual man, and I need not be the least uneasy about my money; and to the best of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130042"/> remembrance, he said, he certainly must have left orders with either Mr. Bond or Mr. Vanderhagen to pay that money, for he imagined something called him away sooner than he intended to go, for he had not paid him his charges, and he was not the least uneasy about it. Mr. Cook called upon me a few days before he became a bankrupt, and shewed me a bill for 530. or 531 l. or thereabouts, drawn by

             and Co. payable to their own order, at 3 or 4 months, I am not quite clear in that: he desired I would get it discounted for him, and he would pay me 300 l. to account; I told him, I believed it was impossible to get it done, but I would try, and accordingly I took the bill: he said, how much do I owe you? let me see, said I; that you shall soon see; I opened the ledger, and drew out, to the best of my remembrance, an account of the different sums and debts: as I was going to cast them up, said he, you have been uneasy about Paterson, M'Randall and Grant; you talked of sending full powers against them, I should be sorry to have them affronted, for I am certain they will pay; and perhaps next packet, or a packet or two, may bring remittances; but I'll tell you what, If you will discount me this bill, and give me the difference, which will set me at liberty, add Paterson, M'Randall, and Grant to my account, and I'll pay you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by liberty?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. He was a little necessitated for cash at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the difference?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. The difference was about 130 l. which would have been coming to me: I under-wrote at the bottom, to the best of my remembrance, Paterson and Co. or Paterson, M'Randall and Grant, 101 l. 3 s. 9 d. the value of 7 pieces of velvets; he went away with this account, and the next day he called upon me again; I had the bill with me: I immediately went with the bill to a merchant, to ask him to discount it; he said, he did not like the parties, but if I was urgent upon him, he could not refuse me to discount it, but had rather not, for some particular reasons. I did not urge him any more to do it, but brought the bill back. Mr. Cook came to me the next day, I think, and asked me if I had discounted the bill? I told him, I had not, and believed it was not in my power just then: he said, he had got a friend that would do it immediately, one Mr. Aderly (a person I did not know): he desired me to let him have the bill, and said, if I would go with him to the Rainbow coffee-house, Cornhill, I should not come out of the house till I had all the money. I went with him there: to the best of my remembrance, he enquired if Mr. Aderly had been there? he was answered, no: he desired me to stay a bit, and he would be back again immediately, and I should be sure of my money, before I returned home. I staid; he took the bill and went out, but never came back to me again. I saw him but once after that, before he became a bankrupt: that was at the Queen's Arms, in St. Paul's Church yard; then he promised me certainly that I should not lose a farthing by him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you wait for him?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. I waited there, I believe, 3 hours; I told him at the Queen's Arms, of his behaviour to me, and likewise that he would ruin me: he went from thence to his brother's, I apprehend; but he was a bankrupt that night, or the night following. One Lyon, a foreman of his, came to us, I think, the day after he was a bankrupt, (I am not quite clear to the day), and gave us an account, by order of his master, of what was become of the number of goods he had had of us. I told the prisoner in the King's Bench, we had made application to have recovered these goods back again, by virtue of Lyon's information, but we could not come at them. I told him what Lyon had informed me: he made this answer, D - n them all, a pack of villains, they have ruined me (meaning the people into whose hands he had put the goods) which were

We had a warrant granted against Cook, and I endeavoured to take him before he was surrendered into the King's Bench, but could not. He was, I think, the next day, sent to the King's Bench; in discharge of his bail, he surrendered himself. My partner and I applied to Mr.

I asked him, Did Mr. Paterson ever give you such an or der to buy them goods? he answered, no. I heard him say this several times, that they were in the hands of the Jews, and that he had no order from Mr. Paterson to buy them. He sent to me once from the King's Bench, to come over to him, to pay me part of the money; he offered me 30 l. and said he should be glad to make it up, saying, why should there be any animosity between us?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any account of the numbers and qualities of the pieces?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. (He produced a book.) This is my day-book. This is my hand-writing, dated the 27th of February, the day that

               <p>Lyon. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any goods brought in from Messrs. Roebuck and Hodgson?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I do, several parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how they were disposed of?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I cannot tell how all of them were.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with Mr. Abrahams?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I am not, any farther than seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times may you have seen him at your master's warehouse?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I may have seen him ten times.</p>

               <p>Lyon. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know he is a person that lends money upon goods?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Upon my oath I never did know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor that he procured money to be lent on goods?</p>
               <p>Lyon. No, I never knew he did.</p>

               <p>Lyon. I did, before my master went to Guild-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are the papers?</p>
               <p>Lyon. They have not been in my possession since.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the contents of them?</p>

               <p>Q. Produce the copy of that relating to the seven articles, that relates to those goods?</p>
               <p>Lyon. It begins No. 1521; this is a copy of that paper that I delivered to Mr. Roebuck (producing a paper.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect it?</p>
               <p>Lyon. It was by the order of my master, when they were sent out.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look on that paper?</p>
               <p>Lyon. It is dated January 28, 1763.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand writing is it?</p>
               <p>Lyon. This is my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What does that date allude to; to what transaction?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Those were two velvets that were sent to Mr. Abrahams's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had those pieces of goods, that Mr. Paterson looked at, been in your master's house, before they were sent to Mr. Abrahams's?</p>
               <p>Lyon. They were delivered out January 31; I can't tell how many days they had been in our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think?</p>
               <p>Lyon. It might be about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they ever shipped on board for Mr. Paterson?</p>
               <p>Lyon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing done with these goods relative to Paterson and Co.?</p>
               <p>Lyon. No, nothing relative to them.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for a packer to procure goods for gentlemen to look at?</p>
               <p>Lyon. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they often give general orders, and leave it to the packer, to procure him what he can to the best advantage?</p>
               <p>Lyon. They very often do, and they are brought to the packer's house for inspection. Mr. Paterson looked at these before they were sent to Abrahams's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Paterson often?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man is Mr. Paterson?</p>
               <p>Lyon. He is a hard-favoured man, pitted with the small-pox; I have seen him many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Tall or short?</p>
               <p>Lyon. A little tallish.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130045"/>Q. A full or spare man?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Of a spare order, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Fair or brown?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he lodge?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What coffee-house did he use?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I do not know. I know nothing farther than seeing him at my master's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your master any correspondence with him when at Quebec?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I cannot tell. He had done business for him about a year before.</p>
               <p>Q. What month?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I can't tell the month: it was much about the same time of the year.</p>
               <p>Q. What age might Mr. Paterson be?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I believe he may be about 40.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect his dress?</p>
               <p>Lyon. No; he had woollen cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you foreman?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Almost 4 years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master use to do business with other Jews, besides Abrahams?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I believe there were some other Jews that he did business with.</p>
               <p>Q. What is their business?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do you not know upon what account goods were sent to either of these Jews?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Upon my oath, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with any of them?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I went with some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you went?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I left the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never receive any money?</p>
               <p>Lyon. One time I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for goods?</p>

               <p>Lyon. For goods.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money?</p>
               <p>Lyon. About 50 l. or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of Roebuck's goods in that parcel?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I cannot say there were.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you deal with the Jew for that 50 l.</p>
               <p>Lyon. I brought money back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it paid for the goods you carried?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I can't take upon me to say it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What order had you, when you carried the goods?</p>

               <p>Lyon. I suppose it was upon an agreement, as agreed upon by my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for the things?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I suppose it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master order you to receive 50 l. or to get what you could?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I was to receive the money that gentleman might give me.</p>
               <p>Q. What gentleman?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Mr. Levi, a Jew; I don't know what business he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a bill of parcels?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had any dealings with him?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. I have not; but I have lost money by him.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did they come from?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. They came from Mr. Cook, for Mr. Norden: Mr. Norden and I being acquaintance, he had different notes, to the amount of 500 l. some of them by Mr. Hodgson, and some were indorsed by Mr.

            . Mr. Hodgson applied for his money, but could not have any; Mr. Norden sued all these people together: after that, Mr. Cook came to me, and desired I would speak to Mr. Norden for him. Mr. Norden said, if he would give him security, he would give him time; he sent him in some cloth at first, which he said was worth a thousand pounds; this was all done with the advice of Mr. Kelley, an attorney; he

He sent in some velvets, to make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130046"/> the security the stronger; at the same time, the first paper was cancelled, and a new one drawn upon stamp'd paper, for velvets, cloths, and linnen: there were about 300 l. made out of all these goods.</p>

               <p>Abrahams. They were sent from Mr. Cook; they were given for a security for the foregoing debt of 500 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they pawned?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to be sent to your house?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. Mr. Norden at the same time had no house in the city, he lived in the country; he desired me, as I lived there, to let them be there: had he lived in the city, he would have taken them home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they brought there as a deposit for Paterson and Co.</p>
               <p>Abrahams. No, they were not. Mr. Cook said, they were his velvets, and he gave them as a security; and they were afterwards sold at Mr. Gear's, at an auction.</p>

            . I was book-keeper to the prisoner; I know he had transactions with Mr. Paterson of Quebeck, for two years past, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Byerman. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. What orders?</p>
               <p>Byerman. I can't remember the particulars; he was in our 'counting-house with Mr. Cook and me, in January, 1763. Mr. Cook said, Mr. Paterson, have you looked at these velvets? he said, I have, but they will not do for me. Mr. Cook said, I am sorry for it; I thought they might; upon which, the prisoner prevailed upon him to come and look at them again, which Mr. Paterson promised he would do the next day, if possible, or the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come again?</p>
               <p>Byerman. I can't tell whether he did or not, because I did not attend there but once or twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Paterson?</p>
               <p>Byerman. He is a merchant at Quebec; he was indebted to Mr. Cook; I have the ballance in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was he indebted?</p>
               <p>Byerman. He was indebted to Mr. Cook 74 l. he had paid him 50 l. before he went there; it was Paterson, M'Randall and Grant.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the goods coming in to Mr. Cook's?</p>
               <p>Byerman. I do not. My business was only to keep the ledger and journal: Mr. Paterson used to give orders to Mr. Cook, to get him such and such goods to look at: if they were liked, they were ordered; if not, they were returned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of these ten pieces of velvets?</p>
               <p>Byerman. I thought it was seven pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you write out the account of these goods to the assignees, and what became of them?</p>
               <p>Byerman. I have wrote out all, as far as Mr. Cook revealed to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he reveal to you what is become of these seven pieces?</p>
               <p>Byerman. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what velvets those were that Paterson looked at?</p>
               <p>Byerman. No, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mr. Cook asked Mr. Paterson, if he had looked at the velvets; can you tell whether they were talking of these velvets?</p>
               <p>Byerman. I cannot in particular tell whether they were or not; but at that time Mr. Cook had no other velvets but them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what particular velvets Mr. Cook had in his warehouse?</p>
               <p>Byerman. I do not; I have seen divers pieces in the warehouse.</p>

            . Mr. Cook and Mr. Roebuck were at my house last April; Mr. Cook was obliged to leave his house; I married his sister, he came to my house, and was there some time: Mr. Roebuck came to me more times than one, and desired me to use my interest with him to make him satisfaction for some money he was indebted to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sum?</p>
               <p>Fox. To the best of my remembrance, it was above 600 l. that he owed Hodgson and him; he came frequently to my house, and begged I would use my interest for him, as I was a relation, to give him some security, or some satisfaction for the debt.</p>

Mr. Cook desired I would go to Mr. Hodgson, and offer him, in behalf of Mr. Cook, 30 l. in order to discharge the warrant which he was charged with in the King's Bench; Mr. Hodgson said he would discharge him, in case he would make up the whole sum: I afterwards saw him in the King's Bench; he was then willing to discharge him, if he would raise the money he wanted.</p>
