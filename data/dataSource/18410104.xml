I missed a christening-robe belonging to one of my children, I suspected the prisoner, she was questioned about it, but not in my presence—some Irish linen was missing, and I asked her if she had taken it—she said no, she knew nothing about it—I did not make her any promise, or threaten her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live in Beer-lane, City. I had an account with Mr. Goss for lighterage—a delivery ticket for brandy was left at my father's in part of that account—I had it in my possession—I had it out of my father's house—my father had it from Mr. Goss—a person having property in the Docks can sign an order, by virtue of which any person can get the property, by jy paying the duty—this has been in my possession ever since it was given, which was on the 16th of May—I once met the prisoner, and asked him, as Mr. Goss and I were not exactly good friends, to ask Mr. Goss if he would take the hogshead of brandy back, and pay money instead; my father having failed in busi<lb/>ness, it would be of more use to me than brandy—he said he would ask. Mr. Goss—I saw him about a week afterwards—he said, "We have taken the hogshead of brandy"—I said, "Very well, let me have the money as soon as possible"—he said he would—I think, on the following Satur<lb/>day, I sent my brother with a note to Mr. Goss—I met the prisoner in the street on the 11th of November, and asked if he was going to play the fool with me—he said, "Everitt, take that," giving me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and a sovereign—I did not see him again till the Saturday—he told me he did not want any receipt for it, but when he gave me the remainder of the money he would take the delivery order back—on the Saturday week after I went over to Mr. Goss's on purpose to see Quinlan—I saw a servant girl outside the house, she went in, and called Quinlan out—when he came out he told me Mr. Goss was settling with the captain, and asked what house I frequented—I said, "The Bell, Tower-street," where he promised to meet me at eight o'clock, but he did not, and I walked over, and waited outside Mr. Goss's—(I expected Mr. Goss had taken the hogshead, till my brother went over)—I did not see Mr. Goss on the busi-ness till after Quinlan refused to pay me the remainder—the prisoner had said, "We have taken the hogshead of brandy," and he said, "We have shipped it, and given bond," or something similar to that—he did not say how it was to be turned into money, I expected that it was laying in the Docks, as I had the delivery order—I afterwards saw Mr. Goss about it.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was that arranged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With the captain, at the time we agreed sending it out on speculation—I never mentioned that before—Thornhill afterwards, when he found the captain would not pay his share, got a bill of lading signed, and consigned it to the house of Montefiore—that was stated in Court while I was a prisoner—I made an entry in my master's books of the sale of this brandy—that was stated by the prosecutor while I was a prisoner, and that I had subdivided it into a variety of quantities, as if supplied to a variety of customers—nobody told me to do that—on going home from the coffee-shop at night, I remember Quinlan discovering that this brandy in the ship belonged to Mr. Goes—I cannot tell that date—I do not remember Quinlan stating that to Thorn<lb/>hill—Thornhill did not tax me with it on the spot, and charge me with having deceived him—Quinlan asked me if I had shipped it from Mr. Goss's stock—I said I had—he did not tell me he had discovered I had done so—he told me afterwards that Bowen had searched the dock books and found out il was Mr. Goss's brandy—I do not think it was in that same conversation—I will not swear it was not—he told me in Thornhill's presence that Bowen had been down to the Docks and had seen that it was Mr. Goss's brandy, and Bowen came up and told Quinlan of it, and Quinlan went to Thornhill and told Thornhill that he must deliver up the bill of lading, or pay the money down—Thornhill told me he would bring me his proportion of the money the following morning, and it must be paid for—that was on the same day, I think—I met him next morning at a public-house in John-street, Minories, at his instance, for the purpose of receiving the money—he said he was not able to raise it—this bond was signed by Thornhill before I signed it—I am very much accustomed to business in the Custom-house—the two false addresses are in my hand<lb/>writing—Thornhill was admitted to bail several times in the course of the examinations, and has surrendered to-day—this is the delivery order—the name of Howe on all the papers is in my hand-writing—their name ap<lb/>pears as the importers, not the vendors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was Thornhill acquainted with the fact of this being Mr. Goss's brandy, before any thing was said about paying for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He knew it before it was shipped—he said nothing about pay<lb/>ing for it till it was found out that Quinlan and Bowen had discovered it was Mr. Goss's brandy—he knew it was Mr. Goss's before the bond was executed.</p>

                  </hi>. I hold an office in the Custom-house. I have produced this bond from there—I am the subscribing witness to it—it was executed, I should apprehend, the same day it bears date—I remem<lb/>ber Jennings's person very well, and Thornhill has been in the habit of coming to the office occasionally—I have a particular reason for recol<lb/>lecting</p>

               <p>that Jennings is the person who signed it, for I had a suspicion at the time that he was not of age, and I therefore requested the clerk to leave it—there is nothing which enables me to recollect the person of the other party—I do not know Thornhill's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe that the execution of these bonds in the Custom-house are carried on to a very great extent, are they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very heavy—they are always prepared beforehand by instructions given by the parties, and then they are signed as rapidly as possible—they are never read over to the persons who sign them—I may have one hundred and sixty bonds a day—I cannot recollect whether the bond was executed when Jennings came, whether Jennings executed it first or not, I cannot recol<lb/>lect—I cannot say whether Thornbill is known at the Custom-house—I did not know him—I have seen his face there once or twice, not more—it is not my custom to see the persons signing the bonds—one of my clerks is appointed for that purpose—he is not here now—he was here on the other case, but it gone away—it is not my office personally to come in contact with applicants for bonds—I attend in the long-room—I take the bonds in at the time they are presented, and hand them over to the clerk—I cannot tell whether any of the articles stated in this bond were the subject of transfer, by the bond—it is impossible for me to say—bonds an con<lb/>stantly filled up for things never transferred by them, and many times for things that are never shipped, but we know nothing at all about the contents—it is frequently the custom for merchants' clerks to sign these bonds for their masters in their own name, not as sureties, but as shippers—I do not believe it is a common thing to pick up a man in the long-room and say, "Just subscribe a bond for me"—I should not take it if I knew it—it is part of my business to be satisfied with the security—John Jennings is the shipper named in this bond—I nave nothing to do with the shipper—I did not ask Thornhill any thing, aa I had seen him before, and he had signed bonds before—I believe only one, not more—I should not have known him again if I saw him, but I had his name to a bond, which I have in my pocket—I do not say he is the man from knowing his person, because I did not know him when I saw him at the Mansion-house—I occasionally examine the security, not always—I do not recol<lb/>lect asking Thornhill a question—I believe I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you call examining the security, if you never asked a question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I have any suspicion on the subject, I always ask a question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was there about Thornhill that divested you of all suspicion, if you knew nothing about him?—what benefit does Government get in taking a bond, if they get it from two people of straw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot help that—the Act of Parliament gives roe no option at all—I am bound to take them as the exporter and shipper—the person presents himself as the owner, and brings a bond-note and a warrant which he makes out himself—my clerk sees the bond executed, and I sign these bond-notes for delivery—the bond alone would not get the property out of the Custom-house—there must be a delivery order, and other documents—the bond-note states this brandy to be bonded by Howes—before the goods are actually released, a title must be traced from the original importer—I as<lb/>sume that the persons applying have that authority, and if it turned out otherwise, they would meet with their check at the Docks—we generally know the parties pretty well who come.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a provision-merchant in the Minories. I have seen Thornhill in company with Quinlan, not with Jennings—Quinlan and Jen<lb/>nings were my clerks—Jennings transacted my dock business—in Novem<lb/>ber last, I had a hogshead of brandy in the London Docks, number 10, and marked with a double triangle, which I purchased of W. H. Howes—I had a delivery order from them on making the purchase—I then went to the Docks and had it transferred—the brandy then stood in the Dock books in my name, and any person would receive it that had a delivery order signed by me—I was in the habit of leaving delivery orders in blank signed in my counting-house—this is one of them—I never authorized the filling up of it, or the delivery of the hogshead of brandy, to which it relates—it is filled up in Jennings's band-writing—it is written off in my books in a retail way, as if sent on board different vessels—I never had any deal<lb/>ings with Captain Small of the brig <hi rend="italic">James</hi>—I never saw him, and never supplied the ship with an article—the addresses to the names of Jennings and Thornhill in this bond are both false—I applied at No. 3, Mark-lane, myself, which is a baker's shop, and I sent my clerk to inquire at Trinity-square—I have seen Thornhill write, it was when he gave me an order to go to Mr. Montcfiore's clerk to get the bill of lading, without making it known to Mr. Montefiore—that was after this matter had become the sub<lb/>ject of a charge—here is the order—I saw him write it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"To Mr. Reeves, 147, Leadenhall-street.—Dear Sir,—Please give the bearer the bill of Jading for the hogshead of brandy. Yours truly, Wm. Thornhill, 110, Fenchurch-street. 10th November, 1840."—I believe Mr. Reeve is clerk to Mr. Montefiore—Jennings was the first person I spoke to when I discovered this robbery—he then made a communication to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you taken Jennings into custody before you went to Thornhill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he did not make any communication to me till after I had taken him into custody—I did not allow him to do it—I did not ask him a question—I did not give him into custody till late that evening—I cannot tell the day—it was somewhere about the latter end of November, or beginning of December—I begged him not to say any thing, or any person to hold any conversation with him, till my solicitor came—when my solicitor came he asked him if he wished to disclose any thing, but he would not promise him any discharge for so doing—that was the first that was said about any disclosure—I think I went to Thornhill next day—I do not recollect whether I told him I had taken Jennings—I might have done so—I am not aware that Thornhill asked me whether the brandy was mine—I do not think he did—I swear he did not—I was not exactly clear at the moment, but I am now—I did not reply that it did belong to me, and ask him for the bill of lading—I asked him for the bill of lading after he was in custody at the station—he directly gave me the order to get it—he wrote it at the station—I did not state on that occasion that the brandy was mine, and that all I wanted was my property—I went to No. 23, Mark-lane—I believe I have seen Thornhill's uncle at my counting-house—I do not know him as a merchant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I was on duty in Museum-street, at a quarter past twelve o'clock in the night, and saw the prisoner coming up the street on the opposite side, carrying under his arm a parcel wrapped in a bag—I crossed, and asked what he had got—he said, "A box of raisins"—I asked where he was going to take them—he said, "To No. 26, Bedford-place"—I said I thought it was a late hour for goods to be sent home—he said their house worked very late, and he bad got to take them home, as he lived that way—I said, "You will have no objection to my going there"—he said, "No"—I went with him towards Bedford-place, and met a policeman, who I asked if he knew who lived at No. 26, Bedford-place—he said, Mr. Gibbs, but he was not living there now, but the house was taken care of by the prisoner's mother, and the prisoner lived there with her—I went there, and then took him to the station—I then went to the prosecutor's, and afterwards took the prisoner there—he said it was given him by James, the carman, and he was going to take it to the wine-man's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the private drawing-office, at the Bank of England. On the 11th of December, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner presented the cheque now produced, for 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed, "Sundrius and Penrucker," who keep cash at the Bank—I asked him in what way he would receive it—he said he would have 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns, and 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in small notes—entertaining some doubt, I compared the signature on the cheque with our signature-book, and not being satisfied, I referred the cheque to Mr. Palmer, who left, to go to the counting-house of Sundrius and Co.—I returned to my desk, and the prisoner was standing before me—I said, "I must trouble you to wait a minute or two"—I gave no reason, but the clerk standing by, knowing I had not 200 sovereigns in my drawer, said, in the prisoner's hearing, "You will want 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, I will go and get it for you"—the prisoner then turned his back to me, and remained in that position, leaning on the counter, till Mr. Palmer returned, which was within five or six minutes, with Tyrrell, an officer, and immediately gave him in charge—nothing more passed between me and the prisoner.</p>

On the 11th of December I went to the Bank, and took the prisoner in charge—he said he had received the cheque from a young man named Brett—that he was to come to the Bank of England, get the money, and take it over to the public-house—he could not tell the sign exactly, but it was somewhere near the Westminster-road, leading from the Ele<lb/>phant and Castle, but if the gentlemen of the Bank would allow us to go with him, he would show us the house—we got a coach, and went into St. George's-road, and drew up just before we got to the door of the Fountain public-house—the prisoner bad told the coachman which way to turn—the prisoner, Brand, I, and Tyrrell went into the bar—the landlord was there—I said in the prisoner's bearing, "Is young Brett here?"—the landlord said, "He is not in now, but I dare say he will be here pre<lb/>sently"—I stopped for about an hour, then took the prisoner back to the Compter—he stated, in the course of conversation, that he had known Brett a long while, and I rather think he said he went to school with him—he said he had been in the habit of using that house, that he had been there with Brett five or six times—he just nodded to the landlord while we were there, ana I believe said, "How do you do?"—he certainly knew him—after leaving the prisoner at the Compter I went over the water again, and stopped at the Fountain till near three o'clock in the morning—Brett did not come—the prisoner said he himself lived with his mother at New Feckham, that he was formerly a clerk to a gentleman on Fish-street-hill, and had been out of employ nearly twelve months—he said he was parti<lb/>cularly intimate with Brett, that they were together the evening before, slept at the house on the former night of the 10th, and breakfasted together that morning, the 11th—that Brett said he lived with his brother opposite—I did not find his brother there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector of G division. On the 29th of December I went, in company with Redman, Farrow, and Humphreys, to No. 3, Church-street, St. Giles's, and found the street-door open, I went up to the first floor front-room, which I found locked inside—I forced it open, and saw the prisoner Wicks sitting on a bed, quite close to a large clear fire—Perkins was standing up by the fire with a mould in his left hand, and a saucepan full of hot metal in his right hand—he dropped both—Wicks called out, "<hi rend="italic">Jem,</hi> you b—r, break it, you b—r, <hi rend="italic">smash</hi> it"—Per<lb/>kins had the mould under his feet at the time, and ground it to powder, except a few bits, which went right and left of his feet—on the fire was a small pot, red hot, without a handle, nearly full of white metal in a liquid state—I took it off—it was hot, and I dropped it on the ashes—both the prisoners kicked it under the bed—I took it up, and produce the contents, which were strewed about—I afterwards lifted up a loose board on the landing, just outside the door, and found a mould there for a half-crown of George III.—Perkins said it was not his, and he knew nothing about it—</p>

I was in the London Docks on the 18th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, loading hemp from the warehouses on the south side, which run on to the Wapping-basin—I saw Gann and Dalton rolling a quarter cask which I supposed to be brandy, from towards the brandy quay to the western entrance—they rolled it in between two casks of tallow, then rolled a barrel before if, and threw a handful of straw on the top of it—Dalton then went towards the western entrance—Gann remained near where the brandy was—(it would take a man about ten minutes to go from where the brandy was to the western entrance)—Dalton returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and at the same time one of Mr. Eyres' wagons which was</p>

               <p>loaded, came in, and Scalp was driving it—Dalton was a few yards behind the wagon—they passed by where I was, and where the brandy was, and went on towards the Wapping-basin—Dalton still kept behind the wagon till it had backed to where it was going—Gann remained where the cask was till after the wagon had backed in to unload, and then he went to<lb/>wards the tail of the wagon—he went in the same direction that the other bad gone—I saw the unloading of the fore-part of the wagon—I could not see the whole of it from where I was—Dalton then put a handful of straw into the wagon—I did not see Gann or Scalp at that time—the wagon had a tail-board that would let down—it is usual to load and un<lb/>load the wagons at the tail—I did not see Scalp again till he drew the wagon round, when it was unloaded, which was in about twenty minutes—he drew his horse round to come out, and came towards the western entrance—he stopped nearly opposite to where the cask was lying—he then left his wagon and went towards the eastern entrance and the spirit-quay—he was gone about half an hour, and while he was gone, Gann and Dalton lifted the cask of brandy into the wagon—Dalton got into the wagon, rolled the cask to the fore-part of the wagon, and covered the straw over it—Gann then wanted to borrow my tilt, which I refused to lend him—he and Dalton then looked round about them, and then went away in the same direction that Scalp had gone—in five or ten minutes I saw Scalp come up—he got in at the tail of the wagon, and placed his hands on the straw on the fore-part of the wagon—I cannot say that his hands went to the bottom—he then got out and drove on in the direction of the western entrance, the same way that he came in—as soon as the wagon started, I saw my employer, and told him.</p>

On the 18th of December, about half-past three o'clock, in con<lb/>sequence of information, I went to the back of No. 2 warehouse, on the north side of the London Docks—I saw Mr. Eyres' van there, standing still, and no one with it—I got on the wheel, lifted up some straw, and saw under it a quarter cask of brandy—I left the straw on the cask, and concealed myself in a place about ten yards off, to watch—in about ten minutes Scalp came up—he got up in the van, went forwards, and ap<lb/>peared to be looking under the straw—he got out again, and went be<lb/>tween the warehouse and the shed, where I could not see him—in about a minute he returned, and got into the van with a person of the name of Dudficld, and rolled the cask from the fore part of the van to the hind part, and they were in the act of striking it, that is, lifting it out—I stepped up to Scalp, and asked what he was going to do with the cask of brandy—he said, "I am going to leave it here, sir"—I said, "You can't leave it here; where did you get it?"—he said, "I came with a load of case wines to be shipped on board a ship in the basin, and I came from there here to load three pipes of wine at No. 3 warehouse, and I found this in the van; I don't know how it came there"—I took him into custody, and to the Queen's warehouse—this is the quarter cask of brandy, it is No. 36.</p>

I am a carpenter in the employ of Robert and George Webb, who are building a house at the corner of Chamber-street, Whitechapel—on Monday night, the 28th of December, I left a basket of tools in the closet in the first floor room, and the next morning it had been broken open, and the property stated gone—these articles produced are mine—my mark is on the planes and on the handle of the saws—here it the iron with which I marked them—the person who took them mutt have got over a wall and down the area, up the kitchen stairs, and broken open the cupboard.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Red Lion public-house, and am proprietor of some houses in Well-street, Poplar. Santree rented one of them of me, and Sullivan lived with him—about five or six months ago I went and found the flooring-boards taken up, and used for building pig-sties—Sullivan was present—I told Santree he must replace them, or else I should be obliged to take him before a Magistrate—none of the joists had been re<lb/>moved—I went again, about three weeks ago, and found no joists, no floor, and two courses of bricks were taken out, to get the bond-timber out, and a piece of timber was put up, to keep the roof from falling in—I told him the ground landlord had been to me, and there was a piece of work about it—he after that removed to No. 14, Ann-street, Bromley—I went there in search of my property, which had then been removed altogether from my premises—when I went Sullivan opened the door—I asked her about some wood that the pig-sties had been made of—she said, if I took them away I must put them up again—she claimed the wood—I knew the boards the pig-stye was made of, they came from Well-street, the house they had occupied of me—there were one or two pieces at Ann-street which were not in the pig-stye at Well-street—when I went the second time, I said there had been a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about these premises, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 16th of December, at half-past nine o'clock, I was going down George's-row, on the opposite side to the manufactory—I saw the prisoner with his hands in his pockets, leaning against the manufactory door—I went down to the bottom, and saw a female going along on the opposite side, as if from the manufactory—I stopped her and found this pipe under her cloak—I took her back to the manufactory—she knocked at the door, and the prisoner opened it—I had the pipe in my hand—the prisoner said, "Oh, policeman, it is all right; it is my perquisite"—I said, I did not think it was all right—he then said he had got a large family, that he took it to make a few shillings of—he asked for forgiveness, and offered to put something into my hand, which he said was half-a-crown—I shut my hand, and said I would not be bribed by any one—I asked if there was any one else on the premises, and Mr. Brown came—I sent him for another constable, instead of that he went to Mrs. Gray.</p>

On the 11th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner (to the best of my belief he is the man,) came to my shop—I have a very powerful gas-light in my shop—he asked to look at a gold brigade chain, which I showed him, and he purchased it—I then showed him a pin—he said he would take that also, and tendered this note—I asked his name—he said, "Smith, Greenwich"—I said, "What street?"—he said he did not know the street, it ran up by the Hospital—I said, "It is College-street"—he said, "Yes, I believe it is"—I asked the number—he said he did not know the number—I sent my servant next door for the change—she brought it back, and I gave it to him—he was in the shop about a quarter of an hour—this is the note—I have written "Mr. Smith, College-street, Greenwich," on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, residing at Portsea. On the 8th of June I sent a letter directed to Messrs. Collard and Furbur, refiners, No. 17, Jewin-street, Cripplegate, and enclosed in it a gold medal, on one side of which was an effigy of Charles the Tenth, King of the French—I did not take particular notice of what was on the reverse side—I can hardly say what was on it, it being some time since, I forget—I do not know whether it was of the French or English alloy—I do not know the exact weight—I took no memorandum of the weight—before I sent the medal away, I made a mark with a file on the edge, and tried it with aquafortis—I have tested the medal now produced, since, in the same way, and it is precisely the same quality, as far as the test of aquafortis will prove, and I believe it is the same piece of gold, for that reason—I gave the letter to my assistant to take to the Post-office.</p>

On the evening of the 17th of December, I had occasion, about twenty minutes past five o'clock, to go to the privy, which is between the Fly mill and Evelyn's mill—the privy door was partly open—while I was in the privy I saw Bignall with a pair of tongs getting a copper bowl up from the frozen ground—I saw the prisoner at the time standing five or six yards off, a little distance from the Fly mill—I heard him say to Bignall, "George, here is some one coming with a light," and they both went into the Fly mill—William Else then came up and came to where I was—after he had come into the privy, Bignall went to the bowl again, and the prisoner stood a little where he had stood before—Else said something to me—he spoke loud enough for them to hear, and on his speaking to me the prisoner and Bignall went away towards the barge, which lay near the Hammer mills—I then went to the place where I had seen Bignall, and there found the copper bowl, and the tongs which laid on the tub—the bowl was a little raised up—it had been frosty—I went and told Webb, the shearer, who I work with, of it, and we went to the place where the bowl was—Webb took it up, and took it to Evelyn's mill—I did not see what he did to it.</p>

On the 17th of December I received directions from Looseley, in conse<lb/>quence of which I went several times in the course of the evening to look at the copper bowl—I missed it about half-past eleven—I saw Bignall come into the yard—I let him in about a quarter past eleven, and I missed the bowl, as near as I could judge, about a quarter of an hour afterwards—the prisoner came into the yard about half-past twelve—they remained there together some time, I cannot say how long—I was off duty when they went away—I go off duty at six o'clock—they could get to their barge from the yard—they would have to come into the yard to go to the barge—when I missed the bowl I went to Looseley, and gave him infor<lb/>mation—he came back with me shortly afterwards, and I called his atten<lb/>tion to the place where the bowl had been.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I was sent for on Friday evening, about nine or ten o'clock—Bignall came into the mill while I was there—I took his key of the barge away from him, and took him into custody—I then went to the barge and opened the cabin with Bignall's key—I found this copper-bowl, the copper-cake, and these five copper bars under the bed in the cabin, all together—there were two berths—I went up to London to see Mr. Spedding the secretary, and on my return on Saturday morning, I took the prisoner into custody, and took him into the counting-house—Looseley, Davey and Mr. Jacobs were there—when the prisoner went in, Mr. Jacobs said, "You see what you have brought it to now, Captain—what it has come to now"—the prisoner burst into tears, and said, "Mr. Jacobs, I hope you will do all you can for me; and speak to Mr. Spedding to make intercession for me as much as you can, and not only for myself, but for my wife and family, and I shall ever be bound to pray for you."</p>

On Friday morning, the 18th of December, I was requested to watch the <hi rend="italic">Olive Branch</hi> barge—I watched by myself—I did not know that any one was watching at another place—I saw the prisoner and Bignall come out of the barge at very near eight o'clock—the prisoner returned to the barge in two or three minutes, unlocked the cabin, and went in—he came out again, locked the cabin, and went away—I had seen the copper cake now produced, on the Thursday afternoon, lying against the Fly mill door—there is a mark on it by which I know it—it is the property of the Company—I cannot speak about the bars—I was present on the Saturday when the prisoner was taken into the counting-house, and heard Mr. Jacobs say to him, "Captain, this is a bad job," or words to that effect—the prisoner walked towards him, and wished him to make intercession for him, his wife, and family, and he should ever have reason hereafter to pray for him.</p>

On the morning of the 5th of January I saw the two prisoners come up in a boat along Limehouse-reach—I went alongside of them, and found this rope in their boat, which appeared to have been fresh cut—I asked where they got it—Varnham said he picked it up in the lower part of Deptford, that he left it in the boat all night, and went home and brought it up the next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live in Pitt-street, Peck<lb/>ham. On the 17th of December I was going through the Broadway, Deptford, at twelve o'clock at night—I had had something to drink—I passed the three prisoners—they were together, and appeared to be talking to one another—they made some remark, and followed me fifty yards—they were walking my way—after I had got some distance they came behind me—I suspect it was the whole three—they pushed against me—there was more than one, but they came behind me, and I could not see very well—im<lb/>mediately I turned, and saw Dunbar and Harrod running in the road—I did not see where Bartlett was—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse—I ran, and overtook Dunbar—I said, "You have robbed me"—she said, "Here is your purse, it was not me that took it, it was the other girl," giving it to me—Harrod was then gone on—there had been 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse—it was gone—I gave her into custody—Harrod was taken about ten minutes after—this is my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, the 19th of December, I was gar<lb/>dener to Mr. George Halfhide, of Clare Lodge, Perry-hill, Sydenham. I left Perry-hill that night, about five o'clock, as near as I can guess—I had received 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., my wages, that night, and had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket besides, and also a watch—that was all I had with me—my way home leads me through Southend-lane, which is in the parish of Lewisham—I got to Southend-lane about half-past five o'clock—I met one man in Southend-lane following a dung cart—it was neither of the prisoners—I was going to my lodging at Southend—when I got about a mile up Southend-lane, I was stopped by two men—I first passed one of them, and he gave way to me on my right—it was very dark—after I passed him I turned round to look who it was—he had got something black over his face—as I was turning round to look at him, I received a severe blow on the temple from some<lb/>thing very heavy and blunt—I was not at that time able to distinguish the features of either of the men—it knocked me down and partly stunned me—I asked them what they wanted, and they stuffed something into my mouth—I was sensible enough to see that there were two persons—I got up as soon as they left me, I arose with them—when I asked what they wanted, they did not speak at all, but stuffed something into my mouth—I felt a great pressure on my stomach, and felt their hands at my watch—I put my hand down to save my watch, and found the ribbon was broken—the pressure on my stomach was like somebody kneeling on me, or something like that—I was not entirely sensible, and not able to make the least resistance—I do not think they remained on me more than a minute—I should think I recovered myself half an hour after, and I found I had lost a sovereign, a half-sovereign, a sixpence, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a bunch of four keys and a ring, and a bag the money was in—the money was all in a bag—my watch was also gone—I arose with them as well as I could, and ran a few steps, but fell down again—I arose again, and fell again directly, and found I could not pursue them, and then I quite lost myself, and did not know where I was for half an hour—as soon as I came to myself I found the injury I had received on the head—I did not bleed much—I lost my way through the state I was in, but at last I got into the lane—I happened to take the right turning, and went on—I came to Sydenham—I there saw a police<lb/>man, and told what had happened—it was about six o'clock, I was told, or a little after—when I had sufficiently recovered myself, I accompanied Mr. Kemp, a miller at Southend, to where I was robbed, to see if 1 could find any thing, and I found the stick now produced, lying down on the spot where I had been lying—the weather had been very heavy and dark for a few days before, and there was snow on the ground—I also picked up part of my ribbon and the key of my watch, and a black stock, which had come from a man's neck, a few paces further—I delivered that to the constable—I was quite unconscious who the persons were who did this—I know the prisoner Smith quite well—he had been in the service of my employer, Mr. Halfhide—he left the service about twelve months ago last August,</p>

               <p>in hay-time, 1839—it has been my habit for four years to leave work on Saturday night, and go to my lodging—Smith was quite aware that that was my practice, and he knew very well that I had a watch—he was aware that it was my habit to receive my wages on Saturday, and come home at five o'clock—I know Rosser quite well—he had not been in Mr. Halfhide's ser<lb/>vice, but I have known him six or seven years—if either of the prisoners had been there, and spoken while I was sensible, I believe I should have recog<lb/>nised their voices well—neither of them spoke during the attack, but one said, <hi rend="italic">hem</hi>—on the following day, Sunday, I went with the policeman Kirby to the spot—(I do not think I made any effort while on the ground)—I think I had a piece of paper with me when I left my master's, but I am not cer<lb/>tain—there was a piece of paper with lines drawn and figures, and I turned it over and saw something on it—I recollect the word "fines," or "sewers"—one side was printed—the figures were written—the "fines" and "sewers" were in print—there was nothing else that I recollect on the paper—I think I had last looked at that paper on the Sunday before the Satur<lb/>day of the robbery—I had got it from the brewhouse—I took it and put it into my pocket then, and have not any recollection of it afterwards—Kirby showed me a piece of paper after the robbery—it was the paper I had put into my pocket the Sunday before—this is it now produced—I at<lb/>tended before the Magistrates at Greenwich on the 28th of December—after the case had been partly inquired into, the prisoners were put back into the cells at the back of the Court, I was walking in the yard near those cells, and while doing so, Rosser called to me—I went up to him—Smith was not in that cell—I cannot say whether he was within hearing—Rosser said to me, "I am very sorry for what I have-done"—I said, "I could hardly believe you were the man"—I did not tell him why, but I thought he would not have committed such a thing—I asked him where my watch was—he told me it was in the Black Horse stables, in the first stable on the right-hand going up the yard—I went to that spot in company with Walker, the constable, the same evening, and in the first stable on the right-hand side I saw Walker find the watch, which I had lost that Saturday night—the one produced is it—the cook had given me half a sovereign—I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I was to bring her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the next morning.</p>

               <p>from that money—he then recollected himself, and said he did not give his wife any on the Tuesday, but gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Saturday, (which was the day of the rubbery,) and with the remainder he purchased herrings, apples, nuts, and oysters—I then desired him to take off his shoes, which I produce—I went with Doust to the spot where he said he had been robbed I there found the impressions of men's shoes—the snow was then quite thick on the ground—this right shoe has only half a plate on the toe, the other has a whole plate—there are six rows of nails in the soles, and eight nails in the middle of the heel, all of which exactly corresponded with the im<lb/>pressions—I made a corresponding mark by the side of those that were there, and also put the shoes into some of them—in the impressions I found in the snow there was the absence of the portion of the tip on one of the shoes—those that I found exactly tallied with those that I made—the shoes are rights and lefts, and so were the impressions—I ascertained the numbers of rows of nails in the impressions quite plainly before I put the shoes into them—I feel confident that these shoes made the im<lb/>pressions I found—I traced the impressions across the fields into the foot-path that leads into the Southbend road, which is the turnpike-road to Bromley—I know where Smith then lived—I traced the impressions in the direction to Smith's house, and within 250 yards of it—it is full half a mile from the place where the robbery was committed, to Smith's house, the way they went across the fields—the impressions were quite plain across the fields as well, for I made corresponding marks along the road—I afterwards went to Smith's house—I there found this bill-hook in a cupboard in his bed-room—it has a rough edge, and is notched—I after<lb/>wards compared it with the stick that was given me by Doust, and it is my impression that it was cut by this bill-hook—I tried two marks on it. to the stick, and they exactly fitted—the stick had been partly cut, and then knocked down—when I looked at the bill-hook, it was my impression that it had cut the stick, but I had not the stick with me then—here is a chip in the stick, which corresponds with a notch in the bill-hook—I only speak as far as my impression goes—I saw nothing of the prisoner Rosser until Monday, the 28th, after he had been examined before the Magistrate a second time—he then stood committed, but was remanded for a fortnight—he was in the inspector's room, about to be removed to Magistone—he said he wished to tell of the whole affair—I said nothing to induce him to make a statement, nor did I threaten him in any way—I not only cautioned him that whatever he might say would be taken down, and made use of against him, but I told him he had better not say any thing—he was likewise cautioned by my superintendent and the Magis<lb/>trate's clerk not to say any thing, and told that what he said would be taken down in writing, and be used against him—he did make a state<lb/>ment, which I took down from his lips without asking a question, and after I had done so he put his name to it—this is the statement he made—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Abouta month ago Smith came to me when I was at work at Bromley, and said he wanted some money, and said he knew of a chance—that Doust, the gardener, in coming home on Saturday night had always 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with him, besides a watch; he knew what time he came down the lane, and wanted me to come with him—I said, per<lb/>haps I might, but I went another road to miss him—I saw him on the Monday following, and he asked me how it was I did not come, I said I worked too late—he then said he would meet me on the following Satur<lb/>day</p>

               <p>night, I said I should see him again before then. I saw him in the middle of the week, and he said, 'Will you go with me next Saturday night?' I said, 'You meet me by Southend, somewhere;' which I did not—when I saw him again, he said, 'You are not a man of your word.' I told him it was so light, I was afraid of being found out. Then I don't think I saw him for a week afterwards; when I again saw him, he said, 'It will be darker next Saturday night, will you go?' I said, I did not expect I should be in work, and I should see him about somewhere. On the Saturday it was done, he was going to London in the morning, he said, 'I shall see you when I come back;' when he came from London, he said, 'I shall be down by and by.' He came down to the Black Horse about dusk, and went in and lighted his pipe—he came out again and said, 'Come on, let us go;' and he went up the walk opposite the Black Horse, and I followed him. In going across the fields he took his hand-bill out and cut the stake off from the side of the hay-stack—we both went across into the lane, and Smith said, we had better go lower down the lane, as it would be darker there—then two men came along, and Smith' said, 'That is not him'—after they had passed, Smith said be would knock him down, and Smith gave me his apron to put in his mouth; and said he would take the watch and money he bad got—pre<lb/>sently the gardener came along, and he said, 'Here he comes.' Smith then went out into the road, and knocked him down with the stake—he took what he had, and gave a cough, as much as to say, Come on. He said, he had owed him a grudge for a long time; and said, 'I don't care if I have killed him.' I said, 'G—d forbid that it should be like that.' I said,' I wish I had not come now.' He gave me the watch and sovereign to hide up, which I did; and he said, 'I will see you another day,' I hid the watch in the stable the same night, and kept the sovereign in my pocket—Smith said I was to change it and give him half—the keys and the bag were thrown into the stream by Smith—then we came out at the gate into the Southend road, and I bid him good night, and Smith said be would slip home and sell his nuts, to which I made no answer, but bid him good night. If it was not for Smith, I should not have been led into it—Smith said, 'I know it is a good watch, for be has not long had it.' I changed the sovereign at Bromley on Monday morning—I did not see Smith afterwards till he was in custody. Signed, <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS ROSSBR</hi>."</p>

On Sunday morn<lb/>ing, the 20th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I went by myself to the spot where the robbery is said to have been committed—I traced the footsteps of two persons from that place across the fields, into the Southend-road—the snow was on the ground very thick at that time—the marks were exactly the same over the fields, as where the robbery was done, and in the first field I observed that the man who had the largest feet, which is Rosser, had fallen down—I traced the footsteps of the two persons into the footpath leading into the Southend-road—after they got over the gate that leads into the road, Smith's footmarks went towards his own house, and Rosser's towards Rushey-green, where Rosser lives—I know the house where he lives perfectly well—I traced his footsteps within a mile of his house, and Smith's, within 250 yards of his house—I after<lb/>wards</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs White and Green well in Blackfriars-road—the prisoner was also in the employ, in the fancy de<lb/>partment. On the 26th of December I was standing behind the counter in the fancy department, and saw the prisoner take down a box from behind the counter, and take out two handkerchiefs, one she placed under<lb/>neath the counter, and the other in a drawer, which she had the use of, and which she closed—she bad no customer with her at the time—I was about three yards from her—about five minutes afterwards, she got some paper, folded them both in it and put it in the drawer—she then opened the drawer, took the parcel out, and put it into her pocket, paper and all—I soon after told Mr. Hubbard, one of the partners, what I had seen—the two handkerchiefs now produced are the same I saw her put into her pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of William White and Green well. Morgan made a communication to me, in consequence of which I called the prisoner into the counting-house, and said I was afraid she was not so honest as she ought to be, and I believed she then had some of our property in her pocket—she said, "You cannot suppose I have any of your property," or something of that sort—I said I had reason to believe she had, and desired her to turn her pocket out—she did so, and turned out these two handkerchiefs—I asked how she accounted for having those—she said she had taken them in exchange for a black one, which she had put into the black box, and that the price was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I searched that box through, and there was not one at such a price in it—it was full of all sorts of prices from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. up to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but none at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am certain she told me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she had no right to exchange, unless she had consulted some one in authority, to give her leave to do it, and then it ought not to be done, except by showing to some person that such an exchange had been made—she</p>

               <p>must have known that was the custom of the firm—every body in the house knew it, for some little time ago we stuck up a notice to that effect—she should go to another person to serve her, who would either take the money for it, or enter it to her—that is a system we have ar<lb/>ranged to prevent our being robbed.</p>

In August last I opened a shop at Cheltenham, and about that time engaged the prisoner Wingfield as one of my shopmen there—I engaged him in London—he remained four days at my shop in Regent-street before I sent him to Cheltenham—I selected goods from my stock in Regent-street, to be sent to Cheltenham—Wingfield assisted me in packing them up and sending them down—he left London for Cheltenham on the 18th of August—I sent down silks, silk shawls, satins, and other things—I myself went down to Cheltenham in about a fortnight—I do not exactly remember when, but somewhere about the latter end of August—Wingfield was there performing his duties—he remained in my service there about two months, and in conse<lb/>quence of certain circumstances that occurred I dismissed him.</p>

On the 18th of Decem<lb/>ber I was on duty in St. Paul's churchyard, and was called to the Goose and Gridiron public-house—I went to a room up stairs, and there saw Kennedy and two or three others, not Wing-field—Kennedy said that Wing-field had left the house about a quarter of an hour, and he had appointed to lunch with him the following morning at eleven o'clock, when Mr. Good<lb/>games could see him—he gave Mr. Goodgames (who took me to the house) an address, which he said was Wingfields, "No. 4, Bloomsbury-square," where he said Wingfield's friends resided—nothing more passed at that time—about two hours after I was called again, and took Wingfield and Kennedy into custody at the same house—I searched Kennedy, and found on him a bunch of keys and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—this was between two and three o'clock on Saturday morning—I went to the house in John-street where Kennedy resided, on Saturday morning, the 19th, with these keys, and met Brook there—he came a few minutes afterwards by appointment—I was not present when the box was broken open—it was done previous to my going—I applied one of the keys to the lock of the box, with the name of Wingfield written on it on a card, and it fitted it—I produce the box and the keys—this key properly belongs to this lock—it is a common key—I</p>

If you have not got a berth yet, there is a first-rate boarding-house here where they will lodge and board you in first style for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, which is much cheaper than you can do it in town; and if you like to come down, you can make sure of a good parcel for <hi rend="italic">spouting</hi> at Liverpool. Give me an answer as soon as you can respecting this, and I think it would be a first-rate thing. Tear this letter up when you have read it." "<hi rend="italic">Cotton</hi>."

               <p>"Cheltenham, 30th August, 1840.—Tavistock Hotel.—Dear Kennedy,—I am very sorry to hear of your misfortune with respect to your face, that is a very bad job, as well as the goods. You see I owe 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. here, for I calculated on having 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Now here is Sunday, and I have not got a shilling in my pocket. Simpson is down here, and he will not go away till the end of next week, and I cannot get a thing till he is gone; and am afraid to do so till he is gone. You mention in your letter that you had not disposed of the two lengths of silk, but you were going to do so with a Jew. Now, if you would send me down a sovereign out of that by Tuesday morning, I should be much obliged to you, for I really want it. I calculated myself what I should be able to get on them, at least 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but still, of course, if you lost some, it made a difference—I shall not be able to send you any thing till Friday or Saturday, because he will not be off till then, and then I will send you as much as I can. Hoping to hear from you on Tuesday morning, I remain, yours truly, H. Wingfield.—With respect to coming here, and</p>

               <p>"Cheltenham, August 31, 1840.—Dear Kennedy,—Simpson left as yesterday morning. I have got as much as I could, for I want 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. very bad now. I have sent you thirty-one yards in one piece, and twenty-one in the other, which we sell at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they are excellent. Try and get as much as you possibly can, and send me down an order for the whole amount, and on Friday morning I will send you lengths and silk shawl for yourself.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother George—we are distillers and rectifiers, and live in Blackfriars-road. The prisoner was our carman—he drove our cart with spirits—on that Saturday he had a pipe of gin containing about one hundred and thirty or one hundred and thirty two gallons to deliver at Mr. Parsons', at the White Hart public-house, Merton—I have looked at the gin found on him—I am certain it is ours—that in the bladder is certainly part of what we sent to Mr. Parsons—the bottles may have been taken at various times, I cannot say; but the spirits in them resemble the articles manufactured by us—he got to Mer<lb/>ton about two o'clock in the afternoon, but he ought to have been there by twelve—he did not come back to us at all—he was taken that night.</p>
