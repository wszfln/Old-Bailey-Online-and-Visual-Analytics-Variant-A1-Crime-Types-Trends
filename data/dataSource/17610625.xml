About an hour after I was going away, which was about two o'clock, passing by the end of Cateaton-street, I saw several people running, and heard a general cry, Stop him, stop thief. I then ran, and when I got into Ironmonger-lane, the prisoner at the bar was stopped. I asked, What was the matter? A gentleman looking-man said, he saw the prisoner pick a gentleman's pocket. Then I thought it was possible he might have mine. I said I had been in Guildhall, and had lost one. He was unbuttoning his coat, and I thought I saw the corner of my handkerchief between his coat and waistcoat. I pulled back his coat, and said there is my handkerchief. Then it dropped down. It was mine, I collar, him, and carried him back immediately to Guild-hall;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250003"/> but it being Saturday, there was no fitting alderman. There was a constable who said, he was by when I took the handkerchief upon the prisoner; so I thought him a proper person to come here to give evidence. I told the prisoner I would make an example of him. Then he begged for mercy, and said it was his first crime. I said that was very unlikely, for he was not stopped for taking mine. Upon which he said, it was the first day he had been guilty. I carried him before my lord-mayor, and he committed him to Newgate.

               <p>Q. When did you leave your lodging?</p>
               <p>E. Harton. I had an account of it on the 15th of May, and I had not left my lodgings quite a week. I came to town on the 16th. The prisoner told me, if they were my things, they were in pawn with one Mr. Langford, and that they were given her by a companion of hers. I went with her to justice Welch, there the things were produced, all but the stone-buttons, handkerchiefs, petticoat, ruffles, and lace, which she would not own to, and deposed to by the prosecutrix. [ Produced by the pawnbroker's servant, who deposed the prisoner brought and pledged them at different times.]</p>
               <p>E. Harton. The prisoner owned she sold my necklace to a young woman for a shilling; that was brought to the justice's, and delivered to me.</p>

               <p>Comber. I have, and two children, they were not up. When I came home to breakfast at eight the prisoner was gone. We did not miss any thing then, till my wife sent to me at noon. On the Sunday Evening I accidentally met with the prisoner in Swallow-street: I charged her with taking the things mentioned in the indictment, she did not deny it, but would not tell me what she had done with them. I got a constable, and she was taken to the Gatehouse that night, and on the Monday morning before justice Cox; there she owned that she had pawned them in Great Poultney street, at the three golden balls; I went and found them accordingly. [ Produced in Court, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Thomas Lane. I am a constable. I was charged with the prisoner, and went to the pawnbroker, and found the things; I do not know the pawnbroker's name, but I went by the prisoner's directions; the pawnbroker delivered them without paying any thing for them.</p>

               <p>Eliz. Bagnall. I live but a little way from the prosecutrix; a month ago next Saturday, after she had lost her gown, she sent me about and at Mr. Pearcy's shop, a pawnbroker's in East Smithfield, the gown was lying on the counter; the prisoner had been there with it, and was gone to fetch some body to prove that she did not steal it. Presently the prisoner came in, she was asked how she came by it? she said she bought it of a young woman, and gave four shillings for it I asked her, who that young woman was, she said she could not tell, she had never seen her before.</p>

               <p>E. Bagnall. It is about a quarter of a mile distance. The pawnbroker took the prisoner up, and we took her before the justice.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had made hay with the girl that brought me this gown. I had lent her four shillings. I never saw her till I met her with the gown on Tower-hill: I said, Madam, I am very glad I have met with you, pay me the four shillings you had of me, or I'll have you before the justice. She said, I have a gown to pawn, and if you will pawn it I'll pay you. I said, come along with me; said she, I am going to my brother's, and if you will meet me here in an hour's time, I'll wait for you. I took it to the gentleman, he said, where had you this gown? I told him; then I said I'll go and see for the girl; she did not tell me where she lived. By God Almighty I am as innocent of stealing it as the child unborn. I never stole a gown in my life time. If I was sure to die this moment, I'll take my sacrament of it, I never was within the woman's door. I am no more guilty of it than the gentlemen are, (looking towards the jury) God bless them. There is a just God.</p>

            . My child went to school near where I work, about 12 o'clock, and called upon me for a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Stanford. This was on the 5th of this instant. Whether the prisoner heard him call, I know not, but within about ten or fifteen minutes, his mother came to me with him, without his coat or waistcoat; I went in pursuit of the person that took them, and near Little Turnstile, I was informed where he was. He had the coat, waistcoat and wrapper, that the child wore before him, in his possession when taken.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to meet with him?</p>
               <p>Stanford. The time I was in pursuit of such a person, a woman told me he was taken, and at the Three Kings, near Bloomsbury-square. He was carried before justice Welch and committed. My child was carried there, and the cloaths put on him: they are my property.</p>

            . On the 5th of June the prisoner was brought to my door, and I had charge given of him; I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you charge of him?</p>
               <p>Clay. One Mr. Frogsham did; he said the prisoner had endeavoured to decoy his young son into Devonshire-street, in order to strip him, but he did not make things appear so plain as to warrant me to hold him; he was taken to a publick house, I went to search him, he refused being searched, then I was the more for searching him, and in his great coat pocket I found a sustain coat, a waistcoat, and a brown holland wrapper; I then took him to justice Welch, and the prosecutor came and brought his child without coat or waistcoat; he swore to the cloaths, and they were put on the child. [ The boy was in court with the coat on; the waistcoat and wrapper produced and deposed to. The boy about four or five years of age.]</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say, when the cloaths were found upon him?</p>
               <p>Clay. He said they were his sister's child's cloaths, and that he was going somewhere with them, I cannot now recollect where.</p>

            . On the 5th of June, about 12 o'clock, a neighbour informed me, a dirty sort of a fellow was inticing a little child of mine about the houses, and that if I ran round the corner, I should see him walking along with him; the little boy came from him home, and the fellow, which is the prisoner, waited at the door: I stepp'd into a butcher's shop, where I had an opportunity of seeing them. My boy came out, and they went on together; on the other side of Theobald's-row, he went to make water against the wall, and a woman lifted my boy over the kennel; they went down Devonshire-street, which is near a quarter of a mile from my house. My wife having got scent of it, searing the child might be murdered, came and interfered, and prevented my seeing his intention. The fellow got away, and I pursued him into Red-lion-street, and took him to Mr.

               <p>I have a sister that has a little boy of her own, and I was coming along Holborn, an old woman had some things in her hand; I asked her the price of them: I said I did not know whether they would fit the little boy or not, but I'll leave you as much money as you think fit, and take them and try them; she was to meet me to know if they fitted, and if they did not, I was to return them. As I was coming back again the gentleman came and examined me, and said I wanted to take some things from his boy, and said I must go along with him. I did, and in an alehouse I shewed them what I had: they took me before the justice, and then to gaol. I was to have met the woman at the Two Brewers the next morning. She plies in Rag-fair.</p>

               <p>Forster.

They were ask'd where they had that timber; they said it was household furniture; and the landlord that they rented the room of, was going off, and so they would make sure of that.</p>

               <p>Forster. Both of them did. My companion and I were both carried to the watch-house upon their charge, about the guinea.

            . The prisoner lodged with me three weeks all but one day. She went out to go to work on the 25th of May. By and by she came home, and said her master would not employ her any more; and said she would go and clean herself. I had taken the prosecutor's shirt out of a box, and laid it on the top of it; the prisoner desired me to lace her stays on. I did, we were at the window, she said, you let the people see me; then I put the curtain too. The shirt was then lying by us. In about 5 minutes after she was gone I missed it; she returned very much in liquor at night, and had money about her, and she had borrowed a penny when she went out in the morning. There was nobody in the room but her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the shirt since?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. No, I have not. It was Mr. Potts's shirt; I took her up the next day, and two of her relations held me by the throat, while she got away; and when she got on the other side the way, she clapped her hands at me, and bid me do my worst, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure nobody besides the prisoner and you were in the room?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I am sure noby else was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a thoroughfare through that room for all the lodgers in the house?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. That door goes out into the yard, but no body passes there but the gentleman of the house and I, and at that time the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was the shirt lost?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. It was lost between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I have known her by sight, I believe, twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good character with her when she came?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I had, she said her husband was abroad, and she would have no men after her.</p>

            . I am a watchman, I was calling the hour two in Dyot-street, and the prosecutor charged me with the prisoner at the bar, for stealing a pair of silver buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say from where she took them?</p>
               <p>Henley. He said he had put them in his pocket in Compton-street. Said I to her, give me the buckles directly. She gave them me. I would have had him made it easy with the poor creature, and said it would cost him a great deal to prosecute her; but he would not take my advice. Then I gave the buckles to the constable of the night. [ The constable produced them.]</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are my property, which she took from me that night.</p>

               <p>I was in Knaves-acre; this gentleman came by; he tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me where I was going. I said I was going home I would ask him a question: Did not you take your buckles out of your shoes, when we were in Compton-street, and put your hand under my coats, and say, I have no money; if you will take these buckles and leave them for some money, I will come again in the morning?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Said I, perhaps the woman will not let you have money enough on them so as to give me any thing. Said he, It is time enough to talk of that, let us have a job first.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Mayne. About five or six months, or more. The linnen and stockings, mentioned in the indictment, were lost out of the kitchen. She lodged up two pair of stairs, The plate and dish belonged to her apartment, and were let with the lodging-room. The morning the things were missing, she had been to carry some small-beer down in the kitchen, and nobody had been there but her. As soon as I charged her with taking them, she owned it; and she had the stockings on her legs, when I took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she when you took her up?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250009"/>Mrs. Mayne. She was at a house in Short's-gardens, drinking with a great many men. She carried me to the pawnbroker's, where she had pawned some of the other things. It was over-against Cranbourn-alley. There she had pawned the shift and apron for a crown; but she would not own where the caps were; she said I might be d - d, I could do no more to her than I had.</p>
               <p>- Hatton. I am apprentice to Mr. Stiles, a pawnbroker; the prisoner brought these things, and pawned them. The shift and apron she brought on the 18th of May, and pawned for a crown. The dish and plate she brought about a fortnight before. She used to bring them in and out very often, and other things with them.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. There was a man lived with her, after she took the rooms; but afterwards she denied his being her husband.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live near you?</p>
               <p>Cockbill, jun. She lived about 40 yards from us. We returned about nine. She had left the shop, we understood, about seven. The landlord at a public-house, finding nobody at home, went and staid there about as hour, 'till we returned. About two hours after we returned, we missed a waistcoat, a coat, a pair of breeches, a petticoat, and a gown. Then we went and advertised her, and she was taken the next day in a barn by Highgate. I was told she went there in the summer-time to work.</p>

               <p>Cockbill. jun. I and my aunt. I charged her with taking the things. We found the cardinal, cloak, four handkerchiefs (two silk ones, and two pollicat ones) and a pair of laced ruffles. [ Produced in court, and deposed to.] She had the apron, cloak, and petticoat on. The other things lay by her. She denied having any other things; but before the justice, she said her husband had taken the rest to the Turk's-head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did her husband live with her?</p>
               <p>Cockbill, jun. He did in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him that morning that she was left in your shop?</p>
               <p>Cockbill, jun. No, I did not; but I heard him above stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Cockbill, jun. He is a labouring-man, and works at farmers business. The other things were found at the Turk's-head, and delivered to us. When we asked her how she came to go away, she laid it to her husband. We find he has been a very bad man all his life-time.</p>

            . The prosecutor is my father-in-law. About five o'clock that morning the money was lost, the prisoner came into the room where I lie, I was in bed, she look'd at me; the first thing she took, was a cardinal, and laid it over her left arm; the next thing, was a pair of black breeches, the next a shirt, the next a pair of stockings, the next a shift, and put them over her arm. Then she came and look'd over me again, then she went to the deal box that was close by my bed-side (this was on the Saturday morning) and I had had the money in my hand but the Friday before, it was in that deal box, put into a little tin box; she lifted the lid of the box up with her left hand, and drawed two of the nails.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to speak to her?</p>
               <p>E. Hopkins. I did not know what mischief she might do me, as my mother nor no-body else could hear me if I had called out. I saw the box in her right-hand, and heard the money jingle in the box. Then she went up where my mother lay, I followed her up. I said to my mother, where is the box that the money was in; she said, it is in that box by your bed-side. I told her, the prisoner had got the money. She throwed the cloaths down upon the table and flew away. My mother followed her, and down'd on her knees to the prisoner, and said, for God's sake, give me my money. The prisoner said, (what do you talk on) was all she said. Then my mother lock'd the door upon her. Then she said, d - n you, do you make a prison of your house; and said, she would break every pane of glass in the house, and tear my mother to pieces. Then my mother went for a constable, and a young woman that lay with the prisoner took care of her till the constable came. She was carried to justice Berry, I was at her examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>E. Hopkins. She said, she knew nothing of it, and was very unmannerly, and said, she long'd to go to Newgate, and that they were a long while writing her mittimus.</p>
               <p>Virtue Tudor. I am wife to the prosecutor. I was robbed of 4 l. 1 s. in gold, it was in a little tin box, put into a deal box; it was taken out of a lower room, my daughter lay there. She came up and asked me where was the key of the box; I said, it was in my pocket. Then she asked where the box was that had the money in it. I said, in the deal box. Then she said, the prisoner had taken the money out. The prisoner throwed the things from off her arm, and ran down two pair of stairs. I ran after her in my shift. I locked the door, and asked her for it. She turned about, and said, what do you talk of? I sent for my husband. She said, she would break the windows, and tear all the things to pieces. Then I called a constable; after that my husband came home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never was out of their custody, till they carried me to New-prison. I had a shirt to wash for a seaman, that young woman washed it, and I ironed it; and I desired Mr. Tudor to call me up to go by times to Cherry-garden stairs, to deliver it. She came up and called me, I did not get up directly. When I came into the room where his wife lay, said she, I imagine you were a little in liquor, when you affronted me last night: I said, then I humbly ask pardon. Said she, I forgive you. I said, will you please to drink any thing? She said, I cannot say I chuse it. She said, you have no money; said I, will you lend me some. She said, I cannot say I have any. I goes back again, and took up a cardinal, a pair of breeches, and other things, and brought them, and laid them down on a chair by the bed-side. The young woman came in with a black petticoat on; said she, mother give me the key of the box, - what box, - Why, the box that the money is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250011"/> in, and the India handkerchief, that the outlandish-man gave me. She gave her the key; then she went away, and came to us in about a quarter of an hour, and said, mother, I want to speak to you, and whispered to her. Then she said, where is the money that was in that box? Said the mother, is not the money there? - no. Then the mother jumped out of bed, and took hold of me by the arm, and said, I insist upon you having the money. Said I, you are welcome to search me, you know I had none last night. She kept me, till she sent the girl and another person to Wapping-wall, for the father-in-law. He came in about three quarters of an hour after; and said, you had better deliver the money, and made a great many words; I had a great many things in my lap. Said I, I will not offer to stand in defiance against you in your own apartment. Then a constable was fetched, he took charge of me; they told him the affair. I was carried to justice Scott, we were in an alehouse three quarters of hour, before he was to be spoke with, they brought the box before him locked. Justice Scott desired him to go to justice Berry, we went and waited there about a quarter of an hour, then the young woman and mother were sworn, and I was committed to New-prison. I was searched, I pulled all off but my under petticoat, I had nothing about me, I never saw nothing of the money. Please to call the constable.</p>

            , the prisoner lodged in the same house where I did, in a two pair of stairs room. I went out on a Sunday with a quilted petticoat on. I took it off at coming home, and put it down upon three linnen gowns on a shelf in my room, and put a silk and stuff gown upon it, and white under petticoat to keep the dust from it. I had a trunk lent me on the Friday following, which was the 12th of this instant, then I missed the petticoat. I mentioned it to my landlady, she said, she believed the prisoner had taken it, for she had been drunk all the week. The next morning I met the prisoner. I keep a shop in the New market, I said to her, you have got my petticoat, and have pawned it; tell me where it is, and I will fetch it out. Said she, give me the money and I will fetch it. I said, what is it pawned for? Said she, for six shillings. She said, if you will let me have six shillings, I will fetch it. I would not then. She gave me a paper, and I went with it, and saw my petticoat where she directed me; the pawnbroker's name is Harbin.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you lend me the petticoat?</p>

I have lost abundance of things since she has been with me, but the buckle is the only thing that I choose to swear to, (she produced a pair of silver shoe-buckles, one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250012"/> them had a string tied on it to distinguish it) this with the string upon it, I found in the prisoner's bureau; they are fellows, my property. She said, when she came, it would cost her 4 l. a year for a room to put her goods in; so I gave her leave to bring her goods to a room in my house. She had taken a man up to remove her goods unknown to me. I intreated her to have the bureau opened, and she refused it for about a quarter of an hour. Then I sent for a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who told her she must open it; she would not. After that I sent for a constable, she then refused opening it, she took her hat and went away, and said, she would go and fetch some gentlemen to vouch for her honesty. I never saw her that day after, till about 10 o'clock, then she returned and humbled herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you gave her warning, or was she going away of her own accord?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. I gave her warning two months ago; she used to want to go out every week or ten days, and we missing so many things in the family, almost every week; she was very much altered, and very irregular.</p>
               <p>Q. How came her bureau opened at last?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. I went to my lord mayor, and got a special warrant, but I did not open it till she was by, she being gone out the next day, she returned, and desired I would let her take the things away. She said, she did not understand the English laws, but she would open it. She opened it, we found a number of things in it, I think must be my property. She offered to give me any satisfaction, if I would not expose her; and this buckle, which I am confident is mine, was found in it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. She is a clergyman's widow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when you lost this buckle?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. It was about three months ago, I cannot tell the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where you lost it?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. I lost it in my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not lose it when you was out a visiting.</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. No, I did not; I made some inquiry one night, and talked whether I did not drop it in the court or not, but I never believed I lost it out of my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that night?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. I had been to visit a neighbour. The next morning I went to put my shoes on as usual, and then I missed my buckle out of my shoe. The maid look'd for it under my bed; it was known in the family that it was lost at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know you had lost it?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. She did, and talk'd of it many times, and said she was very sorry for the loss of my buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the locks easily opened?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. They were, all but one drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened that?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. That she opened herself, I never touched her keys; she made a great hampering at one lock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from your missing the buckle, to the opening of the bureau?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. It was about a quarter of a year</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body, by when the buckle was found?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. My daughter was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the buckle found in the drawer that was difficult to open?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for any other person to put the buckle into her bureau?</p>

               <p>S. Lamb, No; or at least I should think it not probable.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the buckle out of the drawer?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. My daughter did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have there been any mistakes in your house?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. Yes, a great many, where two or three dozen of things have been lost; there were found a cambrick handkerchief, ear-rings. starch, thread, candles, and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you once charge her with a crown piece?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray had the room where the bureau stood a lock upon the door?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. No; there was a lock upon the door, but the key had been insensibly lost, and then I had a carpenter to nail up the door, to prevent her or any body else from slipping up.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know the buckle by?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. I know it by its matching with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that blue string tied upon it?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. I tied that upon it when before the grand jury, when the bill was found.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you keep it before?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. I had it before in a paper by itself; my daughter and my servant knew it at first sight to be my buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon it?</p>
               <p>S. Lamb. There is the silversmith's mark upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250013"/>Mr. Gurling. Mrs. Lamb is a neighbour of mine: a night or two nights before she sent to me about putting an advertisement in the paper, about a silver mug she had lost.</p>
               <p>Court. Apply yourself to the present indictment.</p>
               <p>Gurling. Last Friday morning she sent for me; when I came, there were several bundles tied up. Mrs Lamb said, my tutor is going away unknown to me, and as I have lost a silver mug, I think I have a right to search her box. When we came to the bureau, she would not let us look into it, on no account; I reasoned with her; she said no, she would not open it. The constable was then sent for, she said the same before him, she would not suffer it to be opened. In about half an hour she went down stairs, and went out. It was opened the next day, but I was not there till after the opening, then I was told the buckle was found.</p>

            . I live with Mrs. Lamb, in French Ordinary court, Crutched-Friars; I was at the opening of the prisoner's bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. It was last Saturday My mistress desired the prisoner to open the bureau, and she refused it several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it opened?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. I did; she opened every drawer but one, and that she agreed to let a carpenter open, and he opened it immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any buckle?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. Yes, I saw the buckle taken out, which I knew to be my mistress's property; my mistress lost it about nine or ten weeks ago: as soon as I saw it, I went and fetched the other, that was the fellow to it, out of a china bowl. I sincerely believe it to be my mistress's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it talked on in the family, as being lost before you found it?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. It was a great deal; it was the morning it was missing, it was universally known in the family to be lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say upon its being taken out of her bureau?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. I think she said it was her own buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she attempt to match it?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. No, she did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the drawer locked where the buckle was?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. There was a key to it, it was found in a little drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give full consent to deliver it, to have the drawer opened?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any mark upon the buckle?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. No, I did not; but I know it to be the same as the other, and have the greatest reason in the world to believe, from circumstances, that she had several things there that were not her own property.</p>
               <p>Q. Who unlocked that drawer to take the buckle out?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. Miss Lamb did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key to the prisoner's room door?</p>
               <p>M. Johnson. She never had a key while I lived there.</p>
               <p>Miss Lamb. I opened the inward drawer of the escrutore, and took the buckle out of it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in the basket?</p>
               <p>Riley. There were cloaths in one of the baskets, which I was to carry to Forster-Lane; the other had 18 dead pigeons, tied up by the legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you bring them from?</p>
               <p>Riley. I brought them from Gracechurch-street, near to Leaden-hall.</p>

               <p>Riley. I am an Irishman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man that took the basket away?</p>
               <p>Riley. I am. I have seen him often towards Holbourn-bridge: I said to the people, I could swear to him amongst a thousand people. I delivered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250014"/> to him all the goods, and gave him a cloak-bag.</p>
               <p>Q Who did that belong to?</p>
               <p>Riley. That belonged to one Mr. Smith, in Hatton-Garden; there were four guineas in that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these in your possession?</p>
               <p>Riley. They were.</p>
               <p>Q Where did you meet with the prisoner afterwards?</p>
               <p>Riley. I saw him since very often.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. How the man came to know me to be the person?</p>
               <p>Riley. I was positive before Mr. Fielding that he was the man that took the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear to him there?</p>
               <p>Riley. I swore to him twice there.</p>

               <p>Riley. It was about eight o'clock.</p>

             I lost the goods on a Friday; I went to Mr. Fielding, and got an order against the prisoner on the Saturday; but I could not get at him, the door was locked, and he would not come out; and I went for another order to break the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect near the time you lost the goods?</p>
               <p>Riley. It was about May; I cannot say what month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He accused me with taking these things from him on the 24th of April. He and his master came to me the 25th; I could not understand the odd account he gave; I desired his master to interperet to me what he meant: the master said, If you have no lodgers, it cannot be any body here. They went on farther. After that I went to him, and ask'd him if he had found the man he wanted? he said yes, you are the man, the book-keeper wants you; I went to the publick-house next door, to see where the book-keeper was, and on the Monday following I went and surrendered myself to a constable; they searched my house on the 27th of April, and I was committed to New-prison, and brought up again on the Wednesday, and re-examined before Mr. Fielding; I had four witnesses to prove where I was that night, that he says he lost the things, from four or five in the afternoon, till between ten and eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Riley. As soon as I went into the prisoner's house, I told the book keeper he was the man that took the goods from me. I went out again, and then I saw the prisoner running along, he went in at a chandler's shop, and out again.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prisoner. The 24th of April was on a Friday, and we have four witnesses to prove he was at Islington; and the Wednesday after, these four people were by when the examination was taken.</p>
               <p>[ The examination produced, dated April 29.]</p>

               <p>Q. to Riley. Did you sign any paper before Mr. Fielding?</p>
               <p>Riley. I put a mark upon a paper before the justice, but upon my shoul, I cannot tell whether this is the paper or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know your own mark when you see it?</p>
               <p>Riley. No, I do not; I did nothing upon the paper but only mark a cross upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. Look upon that paper. [He looks at it ]</p>
               <p>Riley. I did not do that at all; I did not mark that paper.</p>

The prisoner came into my house on Saturday the 16th of May, about eleven o'clock, and staid there 'till about four; he drank three single penny-worths of beer, then he joined company that were drinking out of a tankard; but it was not that tankard that I lost.

            . I live at the Queen's-head, opposite Hicks's-hall. On the 17th of May, the prisoner came into our house, and called for a penny-worth of beer; and while I went to draw it, I heard the keys of the bar-door rattle I had a suspicion of the prisoner: I came up, and saw the marks of a tankard in his pocket I told my brother of it, and we took a tankard out of his pocket, and this stick from him. [Producing a very large ash-plant.]</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. By what do you know that tankard?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. By the letters of my name on the handle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I got up on Sunday morning, and in the street, about six o'clock, I found that tankard lying in the kennel. I happened to meet two women: I asked them if they knew who it belonged to. They said, they did not know. I carried it a good way, before I put it into my pocket. I said to myself, in the name of God, if I can find who it belongs to, I will advertise it, and I was taken up by two men.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you known her before that time?</p>
               <p>Floyer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take her?</p>
               <p>Floyer. I had a slight recommendation: I believe she is a country girl lately come to town</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first hear of her?</p>
               <p>Floyer. The same day she came to live with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Floyer She came to offer herself; I understood she had been before in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250016"/>Q. Had you used to keep a servant?</p>
               <p>Floyer. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you parted with your late servant?</p>
               <p>Floyer. About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Floyer. I first saw her at my own house; she came directly to me.</p>
               <p>Q. By what recommendation?</p>
               <p>Floyer. By the recommendation of some person in the neighbourhood, that knew our servant was gone away; and I received her that day, and agreed with her for wages.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to give her?</p>
               <p>Floyer. I was to give her 3 l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her?</p>
               <p>Floyer. I was deficient in that in some measure; I asked her what character she had; she said she had little or no acquaintance in town; that she was just come from Staffordshire. I asked where she had been in town; she told me in Turnmill-street; and said she did not much like the people, and was desirous to get into a service.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you charge her with?</p>
               <p>Floyer. She came to me on the 5th, and the very next morning I found she was gone, and the things mentioned in the indictment missing. She came on the Friday, and was gone on the Saturday morning. I got up at six o'clock, and she was then gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did she lie in?</p>
               <p>Floyer. In a room on the same floor as I do. I have the whole floor On the Monday following I advertised the things, and a description of her person; and in consequence of that, on the Tuesday I had information sent me, that a person, answering that description, lodged at a certain house in Old Burlington-street, near Piccadilly. I immediately went to that house; she was not within, but in a little time she came in. I immediately taxed her with the robbery, which she ingenuously confessed. I asked her what she had done with the things she had stolen; she said she had sold two of the table-spoons in a street called Chapel-street; but, with her assistance, I never could find that silversmith out. The other table-spoon, a tea-spoon and strainer, she inform'd me she had sold to Mr. Bedeau, a silversmith in Green-street, by Leicester-fields. The silver laced hat (my child's hat) she said she had sold to a hat-man in the street; but she had, before she sold it, taken the lace off, which she gave to me, and I have it here; it was a new hat, not above a month old. I took her to Green-street; when we came there Mr. Bedeau said, I know what you are come about; I did buy the spoon of that young woman, but it is really gone, it is melted down. The tea-spoon and the strainer, he said, he had. I was a little surprized at the table-spoon being melted down, because he bought it but the day before. There was an old pair of silver buckles, which she informed me she sold to a man named Shittlecock. She was committed to the Gatehouse; she never denied the taking the things, neither to me nor the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever pretended you had given them her?</p>
               <p>Floyer. No, she never did; but the contrary, and said she had not the heart to deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she seen any of these things in your room?</p>
               <p>Floyer. She did drink tea after we had done.</p>
               <p>Q. After who had done?</p>
               <p>Floyer. After my wife, I, and the child. I remember I sent her to the closet where these things were, perhaps she might see the tablespoons, and the child's laced hat. The silver buckles were taken from out of my wife's shoes. My wife was not well. She lay with my wife, and I with my little boy in another room. This was not prudent to be sure to let her lie so, never seeing her before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bedeau. I am a silversmith, and live in Green-street, Leicester-fields; my maid's sister lives in New Burlington street; she is a widow. This girl coming out of place, somebody in the neighbourhood desired my sister to let her lie with her 'till she got a place; so she came with my maid's sister, and drank tea at my house on a Sunday, I think three weeks ago. The next day she came to buy a stay-hook, and offered a table-spoon to sell, that I bought, and melted down afterwards. She wanted to know the value of a tea-spoon and strainer. I did not buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her for the spoon?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bedeau. I gave her eleven shillings for it; there was a single letter on it. Had she offered me two or three, I should not have suspected her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her how she came by it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bedeau. I cannot say I did, I did not mistrust her coming dishonestly by it. [The teaspoon and strainer produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The spoon is my property, and I believe the strainer is also.</p>

She said she came from from a sister of mine, that desired her to come, and that I would learn directly. I told her I believed I should not learn, but she might come in, and I would look at it. She asked for some broken victuals, saying, she had three small children that had not broke their fast that day. I gave her some victuals. She said, she would teach me to do a little for nothing. This was on the Saturday; and on the Thursday following, we saw it advertised. We sent to enquire whether it was that or not. It appeared to be our spoon, and my master went and brought it home. The day afterwards I met the woman in Lincoln's-inn-fields, and told her of the spoon, and took her to the pawnbroker. At first she said she knew nothing of it. She confessed she offered it to pawn, but did not confess how she came by it. When I asked her that, she made me no answer.</p>

               <p>M. Thompson. She said they were her own; she looked very creditable, and said she lived in Dyer's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever pawned any thing with you before?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. Never but once before, and that was on the 8th of May.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times was she with you?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She never was with me but three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she pledge with you the 8th of May?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. I cannot say that, because she fetched it out again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she pledge the second time?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. That was the 25th of May, then she pledged a cardinal, ruffles, and apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. That was in the morning about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time she came to you?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. That was on the 29th of May, four days after she had pledged the cardinal and things; then she brought a pair of shoes, and an apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any memorandums at the times you took in the things?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. Yes, but I have not the book here.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. How long ago is it since the things were taken away?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is a month ago to-day (this being Thursday.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all taken at one time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They were, the door was broke open the 28th of May; I had seen them at three o'clock that day.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Thompson. What days of the week did you receive the things?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. I received the cardinal on a Wednesday, and the shoes and apron on a Saturday.</p>

               <p>Mr. Davenal. I am constable, the tongs and one tea-spoon I found in the man at the bar's pocket, the other spoon and strainer were found in the woman's pocket, by another man, in my presence.</p>

               <p>S. Salter. They were taken out of the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, As this transaction was entirely between themselves, when no-body else was present, I rather choose it should come from the witnesses mouths, than to make any paraphrase on the evidence, or endeavour to prepossess your minds.</p>
               <p>The case is this: the prisoner and the deceased were acquainted with each other. About two o'clock on the tenth of May they went to the <placeName id="t17610625-21-crimeloc125">Cardigan-head tavern , Charing-cross</placeName>

               <p>This is the sum of the evidence which I shall call and lay before you, and if it comes out to your satisfaction to be a murder, you will find the prisoner guilty.</p>

            . I was acquainted with Mr. Jasper, the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at any time on Saturday the ninth of May?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. On Saturday the ninth of May I met him at Mundy's coffee-house in Round-court,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250020"/> there were some other gentlemen there, we supped together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass particular?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. Nothing particular. I came away much sooner than any of the rest of them; I left him in company with several gentlemen, there was the best harmony that could be when I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Brice there?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. He was there to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you doubtful of that?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. I am pretty certain he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mr. Jasper afterwards?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. I called about two o'clock the Sunday following, Capt. Jasper was sitting there in the same coffee-house, I believe he was the only person there; he asked me if I dined there, I told him I did; he said he would stay and dine there too; then he proposed to take a walk to amuse ourselves till dinner was ready, but I objected to it, on the account of its being Sunday, and I did not choose to walk in such a publick street as the Strand, so I staid in the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Brice there?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. Mr. Brice came in some time after, Capt. Jasper was sitting on the table, and I on the bench by him. Upon Mr. Brice's coming in Capt. Jasper leaped from the table, and took him gently by the arm, and they walked to the other end of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that done in anger?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. No, my Lord, far from it; I imagined he was going to make the same request to him as he had done to me, to dine with him: when he asked me, he said he wanted company. They made a very short stay at the other end of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any words pass?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. I did not; they came down the coffee-room together, and went out together at the door, and did not return to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say any thing to you at going out?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. No, not a word. Just at going out Capt. Jasper was speaking to Mr. Brice, but nothing that I could distinguish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if there was anger betwixt them?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. Nothing of that appeared to me.</p>

            . It is very little that I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. I am a watchmaker, and live in Spring-gardens. On Sunday the tenth of May, between the hours of three and four in the afternoon, as I was going in at the Cardigan-head I heard the report of a pistol, I had just entered the room coming into the centre part of the house, the family was all in a flurry; Mr. Church, the master of the house, told me that two gentlemen had quarrelled, and one had shot the other, and desired I would go up stairs. When I came there I saw Mr. Jasper sitting on a chair, with a wound on his left-breast. Mr. Brice begged I would listen to some questions he should ask Mr. Jasper; he had applied to several, and they did not give attention: he applied to me, and said, You seem to be a little cool, I beg you will attend while I ask him some questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Brice before?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. I never saw him before that in my life-time, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Jasper before?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. I have known him twenty years, ever since the hard winter in the year 1740.</p>

               <p>Q. WHAT was Mr. Jasper?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. He had belonged to the navy, but he was broke about five years ago. He was captain of a man of war.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any family?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. I do not know that, I have not heard of any brother or sister; I knew his father, he was a great agent on Tower-hill, he used to receive prize-money for men of war.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the questions Mr. Brice ask'd Mr. Jasper?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. He said to Mr. Jasper, Have I used you like a gentleman? To which he gave no answer. Mr. Brice then said, Do you forgive me, Mr. Jasper? His answer then was, I was the aggressor, and immediately he slipp'd from the chair upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he bleeding at the time?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. Very much. On his coming on the floor he became speechless for some little time, then he began to mutter something, which I could not understand; his voice growing a little louder, I leaned down (he lay then on the floor) the surgeon declared, if Mr. Brice had any more questions to ask him, then was the time, for he believed he could not live five minutes longer. The surgeon had then hold of it's arm, but had not bled him. Mr. Brice repeated the same questions, as near as I can remember: his answer was then, I am the aggressor. There were more people in the room at that time that heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room the first time?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. I can't say, every thing was pretty much in confusion: there were three or four people, waiters and others, when I heard him the first time; I staid about five minutes after, then a coach was got to carry Mr. Brice before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Capt. Jasper die?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. He died the next day, as I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him bled?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. No, I did not.</p>

            , and several gentlemen that used the house, were there before: Capt. Jasper joined them, about twelve they called for a bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did these other gentlemen you have mentioned come in?</p>
               <p>Medley. They had been there three or four hours before Capt. Jasper came, they came about seven or eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250023"/>Q. Did Mr. Brice and Mr. Jasper use your house?</p>
               <p>Medley. They frequented my house very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the coffee-room, or up stairs?</p>
               <p>Medley. They were in the coffee-room, all at the same table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Capt. Jasper acquainted with the company?</p>
               <p>Medley. He was with all of them, they were all friends together: when the bill was brought in, they all paid together; then Capt. Jasper said, he was sorry they were all going, he should have been glad to have whipp'd sixpence  more round; upon which, three or four of the gentlemen said they were obliged to go; then he asked Mr. Brice, and he said he would whip six-pence with him; upon which, I made a shilling's-worth of punch: then all the rest were gone, and the door shut up: they sat close together at the end of the table, talking of different things, what I do not know; but I heard Capt. Jasper say to Mr. Brice, you may think yourself a very clever fellow, but d - n me if I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sober at that time?</p>
               <p>Medley. They had been drinking, but were not quite sober, nor quite drunk. Hearing him say that, I was at the upper end of the room, reading a book.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant from them?</p>

               <p>Medley. About three or four yards. I looked at them, and I saw Capt. Jasper rub his hand up Mr. Brice's face, and knock his hat off; the hat fell on the table, Mr. Brice took it up, and put it on again, and said, Capt. Jasper, what did you that for? Is it by way of fun, or is it to offend me? Upon which Capt. Jasper said, How can you think I should do it by way of fun to such a fellow as you. Capt. Jasper rubb'd his hand up his face the same way as before, and knocked his hat off again, and got him by the ear with his right-hand. Mr. Brice said, This is too much, and struck Capt. Jasper in the face. Capt. Jasper had his sword on, and he drew it about three parts out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr.

             any sword?</p>
               <p>Medley. No, I never saw him with a sword in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Brice?</p>
               <p>Medley. He is a gentleman belonging to the law. Upon this I went up to Capt. Jasper, and put his sword back again, and begged that he would be quiet. He said, This man has treated me with such indignity, that I cannot live; either his life, or mine, shall pay for it, and bid me leave the room. I told him I should not. Then he took Mr. Brice by the arm, and walked up to the other end of the room, and said to him: Sir, I insist upon your fighting me. Mr. Brice said: Sir, I think we are hardly even, you struck me twice, and pulled my ear, and I only hit you once; I dare say to-morrow you'll think yourself in the wrong. Capt. Jasper said, No, I never can forgive you; I live at Mr. Crow's in Scotland-yard. Mr. Brice said, he might live where he pleased, he never should call upon him. Mr. Jasper said, If he did not either call upon him, or meet him and fight him, he wou ld certainly put him to death wherever he found him. Mr. Brice told him he never wore a sword, and was not used to fighting; and that he would neither call upon him, nor meet him; and if he fought him, he should seek him. I said to Capt. Jasper, Sir, I beg you will go home, and I dare say you will think better of it to-morrow. He went away, and Mr. Brice wished him a good night, and I went to see him to his chair.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mr. Brice?</p>
               <p>Medley. He staid, I believe, ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and then went home. He said, He wished he had gone with the rest of the company, when he found him so quarrelsome.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say this?</p>
               <p>Medley. Just after Capt. Jasper was gone; I told him I once saved Capt. Gambier's life, when he drew his sword upon him, by going into the room.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Capt. Jasper?</p>
               <p>Medley. I have known him ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was he for temper?</p>
               <p>Medley. When he had been drinking, he was a very quarrelsome, proud, haughty man, as ever I saw in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he so when he had been drinking only.</p>
               <p>Medley. I have seen him quarrel at other times, when he has been sober, but he was not so bad as when in liquor; he was a very proud man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a passionate man in general.</p>
               <p>Medley. Yes, a little hasty and passionate, what we call a hot man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Brice of that disposition?</p>
               <p>Medley. I never knew Mr. Brice offend any body in my life; he is a very quiet man as can be.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250024"/>Q. Have you seen them very frequently together?</p>
               <p>Medley. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever observe any ill-blood between them?</p>
               <p>Medley. No, I never heard Mr. Brice have any words with any body; he was very quiet and peaceable as any man I ever knew in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to give an account of what led Capt. Jasper to this behavour? Had Mr. Brice said any thing to him?</p>
               <p>Medley. I did not hear Mr. Brice say any thing at all to him; Capt. Jasper was talking of forcing of trenches, and such like affairs; he was a military man.</p>
               <p>Bower Church. I keep the Cardigan-head tavern, Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what past at your house on the 10th of May last?</p>
               <p>Church. That was Whitsunday: a little before three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Capt. Jasper and a gentleman crossing the way, coming to my house; I was going to dinner behind my bar, I did not see them come in, they seemed to be in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe the manner of their coming, whether arm in arm, or whether one went before and the other after, or whether side by side?</p>
               <p>Church. That I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after?</p>
               <p>Church. I reckon it might be about half an hour after three o'clock, just as I had dined, I heard a pistol go off; upon hearing that, I ran out and called the waiter, and said there are some gentlemen fighting above; going up stairs I met a gentleman coming down; he called the waiter to go up and take care of the gentleman, for he was hurt. He was about half way down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that gentleman?</p>
               <p>Church. Upon my word, I was in such confusion, I do not know whether I went upon my hands or my head; I cannot tell who he was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Brice at that time?</p>
               <p>Church. I never saw him in my life before that time. I ordered my servant to go and call the Tilt-yard guard, which I always do if there is like to be quarrelling. I ran out immediately to call in the neighbours; people came in; when I came back I went up stairs, there Captain Jasper lay on his back bleeding, and as I thought then expiring; he was frothing on each side his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there then?</p>
               <p>Church. There was the same gentleman that I met on the stairs, and the guards were come, and I bid them take the gentleman to Mr. Fielding. Some time after that one of the gentlemen bled him, by the advice of a physician then present; upon b'eeding him, and giving him something to drink, he opened his eyes; I asked him if he knew me, he said yes; some time after that the gentlemen of the faculty desired me to send for some chairmen, and get a mattress, and remove him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after he had been wounded?</p>
               <p>Church. I cannot justly tell; then they moved him up stairs; I went up to him in the evening, and asked him how he did, he said indifferent, I have been to blame; this was as he lay in bed. He died the next day, I believe about six in the evening; I never saw him after that time till he was dead.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do, upon hearing the pistol?</p>
               <p>Terry. I went up stairs; I was the first person that went into the room, after the report of the pistol. I met Mr. Brice coming down; he desired me to step up stairs, and said, the gentleman was hurt; I said. Sir, by G - d, you must go up with me. I asked him where he was going, he said, for a surgeon; he turned, and went up with me, and the cook went with us. I found Capt. Jasper with the door in his hand, half open; he spoke to me very saintly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who spoke first?</p>
               <p>Terry. He did to me; he spoke very low. I was in a confusion, seeing the wound he had received.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250025"/>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Terry. To the best of my knowledge, he said, I hope he is secure. He spoke very low, but I understood it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean safe?</p>
               <p>Terry. I apprehend he meant secure.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the very words?</p>
               <p>Terry. To the best of my knowledge, the words were, I hope he is secure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it secured, or secure?</p>
               <p>Terry. Not secured, but secure. Mr. Brice went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the word secure mentioned before Capt. Jasper had seen Mr. Brice?</p>
               <p>Terry. It was before he had seen him, he was coming behind me. As soon as Mr. Brice came in, he desired a surgeon might be sent for immediately. I went and got one, the first I could find. I heard Mr. Brice say to Capt. Jasper, My dear Jasper, I hope you forgive me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the answer?</p>
               <p>Terry. I went out of the room for a surgeon, and did not wait for his answer, but went immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave in the room?</p>

               <p>Terry. I left the cook, and Mr. Dunlop there, and others; I brought Mr. Wollaston; when I came back there were several people in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When Capt. Jasper said he hoped he was secure, was any answer given by you to him at that time?</p>
               <p>Terry. I said, here is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Capt. Jasper say to that?</p>
               <p>Terry. He made no answer, but walked from the door; he said something very low, but I being  in a confusion, am not perfect in the words; it was immediately upon that, that Mr. Brice came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself about these words; was it I hope he is secure, or I hope you secured him?</p>
               <p>Terry. I have recollected as well as I can; it was, I hope he is secure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time understand that he wanted to know if he was taken up, so that he might be brought to justice?</p>
               <p>Terry. I have recollected and can make no more of it than what I have said; it was spoke very low.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend it, that he hoped Mr. Brice was got away and escaped? Which of the two did you understand it?</p>
               <p>Terry. I cannot tell how to recollect it, because he spoke very low.</p>

He desired me to get some water to wash him. I asked him if he would have any breakfast; he said no, he was going to breakfast at Mundy's coffee-house. He called for a waistcoat, I gave it him; and said to him, you never used to go abroad with this waistcoat, and asked him what time he would come in. He told me the waistcoat was good enough, I would never see him alive again. He said, I would either see him dead, or else hanged. I said, God forbid, the gentlemen at the coffeehouse will put you over that thought. He asked me, If I would rather see him dead, or hanged. I told him, I would rather see him dead; he said, A gentleman and he had a quarrel on Saturday night at Mundy's coffee-house, and he could not bear an affront from any man. He went out when it was just upon the stroke of two o'clock.</p>

               <p>M. Denevel. Never, that I declare before God.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wollaston. I attended capt. Jasper, I came to him on the 10th of May, between three and four in the afternoon, there were several people in the room when I went over to him; I found him lying on his back, with a wound on his left breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bleed him?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. I did, he was quite senseless; and as I thought dying; he spoke before I bled him of his own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. He said, I was the aggressor. There was at that time a great confusion and noise in the room. I said to him, Capt. Jasper, what did you say? He repeated it again; I did not imagine at first he would ever speak again, this was before I bled him. He acknowledged himself greatly to blame, and said, He was intirely to blame.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Dr. Groat asking him, whether Mr. Brice was to blame?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. Yes; and he said, I was solely to blame, I was intirely the aggressor. He repeated the words with different epithets, and said, It was intirely his own feeling. At another time it was, He was to blame. At another time, He was intirely to blame. At another time, It was his own seeking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue in this?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. He was invariable to the last moment. I was scarce two hours from him, at any one time; I was with him when he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any body asking him, whether Mr. Brice was to blame?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. Dr. Groat asked him, if he believed Mr. Brice had any malice against him, either before, or at the time, or after the affair. Capt. Jasper answered, he did not believe he had.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. His death was in consequence of that wound.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the time of the wound given, was you called in?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. I apprehend immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any pistol?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him about them, during the time you attended him?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. I asked him how it came about, that his pistol was not fired. He said, I do n ot know, I did not choose to fire; I laid it down on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the pistols?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. I do not know any thing about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came not to choose to fire?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. No, I did not care to ask him, for fear of hurting him.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then you had heard his pistol was not discharged.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask him who bought them?</p>
               <p>Wollaston. No, I asked him no question relative to that; I asked him, if Mr. Brice had behaved like a gentleman in the affair; He said, All I knew of the matter is, he fired at me. During the time of his illness, he expressed his concern to me, two or three times, that Mr. Brice was in confinement.</p>
               <p>Dr. Power. On Sunday the 10th of last May, between three and four in the afternoon, Mr. Church of the Cardigan head, came into a coffee-house, near Charing-cross, where I was, and said, a gentleman was shot in his house, and desired I would go up and see him. I went and saw capt. Jasper, he was wounded in the left breast; I thought then he was near dying, that he had not many minutes to live. In about a quarter of an hour after, there being a good many more gentlemen in the room, they wanted to know whether it was proper to bleed him. I felt his pulse, and ordered him to be bled. He was bled, upon which he opened his eyes, and stirred his lips; we gave him two or three spoonfuls of wine and water; he turned his head and looked about him. We met again by appointment, I believe about half an hour after six, when he was put to bed, and his wound dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more wounds than one?</p>
               <p>Power. Only one wound that past through the body. After having ordered what we thought necessary for him, I mentioned to the gentlemen, Dr. Groat, Mr. Ford, Mr. Wollaston, Mr. Davenport, and I believe one or two more physicians and surgeons, that as Mr. Jasper was then in his senses, and made distinct and sensible answers to every question asked him, I thought it might be proper to ask him some questions relative to the affair, in the presence of us all, as I heard he had made some declarations in favour of Mr. Brice; and Dr. Groat, who was his acquaintance, asked him the following questions. Captain Jasper, do you know me? He answered yes, I do, my dear Johnny, know you very well. Pray Capt. Jasper, how did this happen? He answered, I was in fault, I brought it upon myself. Do you believe Mr. Brice had any malice against you? - No, I do not. Do you forgive him? - - Yes, I do. Who was the aggressor? - I was. You say you was the aggressor. - Yes by G - d I am, Sir I was. Would you have me declare this in favour of Mr. Brice. - Yes, I would by all means.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got it in writing, did you write it down at that time?</p>
               <p>Power. No, not at that time; I wrote it down on the Monday night after he died, while it was in my memory. This was on Whit-sunday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions about the pistols?</p>
               <p>Power. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pistols?</p>
               <p>Power. When first I came into the room, I saw pistols lying on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both of a size, as fellows?</p>
               <p>Power. They were; I did not take them in my hand, they appeared to be so.</p>
               <p>Dr. Groat. I knew capt. Jasper near 20 years. On Sunday the 10th of May, about four o'clock, I was sent for to visit capt. Jasper, who was wounded at the Cardigan head tavern. [He looks on a paper.]</p>
               <p>Q. What are you reading?</p>
               <p>Groat. This I wrote for my own information; I wrote it that very Sunday. I believe I can recollect it without reading.</p>
               <p>Court. You may look on the paper to refresh your memory.</p>
               <p>Groat. When I came into the room, I saw him lying at full length on the floor; his breast exposed, and a wound on the upper-part of the left-breast. I asked Mr. Wollaston, the surgeon, what had been done for him? I was answered, Nothing, because they did not think any thing could do him service. I was of the opinion, at that time, he was in the agonies of death. I stooped down, and felt his pulse labouring hard, seemingly oppressed. I desired Mr. Wollaston might bleed him. I saw Dr. Power in the room, and called to him to give me his opinion. He acquieseed in it, and he was blooded; and by the time six ounces, or less, was taken away, he turned his head about, moved his eyes, and opened his lips. I desired the quantity of blood might be encreased to eight ounces; on which he seemed still to recover. Some wine and water was poured down his throat; and after that I prescribed a warm stimulating cordial, which prescribed was signed by Dr. Power and myself. He was put to bed, and between six and seven I visited him again, in company with Dr. Power, and Mr. Ford, a surgeon, who is a man of eminence, that Mr. Brice had sent to take care of Capt. Jasper. After we had mentioned some things proper for him, coming down stairs, I said to Mr. Ford, it would be necessary (as he was then sensible) to go back into the room, and ask him some particular questions relating to this affair; and at fortyfive minutes after six in the evening, I asked Capt. 
               <persName id="t17610625-21-person193">

             the following questions: I asked him first, if he knew me? His answer was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250028"/> Yes, my dear friend Johnny, I know you very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to call you by that name?</p>
               <p>Groat. Always; he frequently did, though my name is Robert. I then asked him if he thought Mr. Brice had any malice towards him, either before, at, or after the time of this affair. His answer was, I don't believe he had, for I never thought so. - How came you by this affair? - I was in the fault, it was entirely my own seeking. - Was you really the aggressor? - I was the aggressor indeed; and by G - d I was the aggressor; and I own I have brought this upon myself. - Do you forgive Mr. Brice, who shot you? - I do freely from my soul forgive him; for I say again, I was to blame. - Would you have me declare this for the safety of Mr. Brice? - Yes, I would, by all means. Sitting on the bed by Capt. Jasper, on Monday morning, a little after ten o'clock, I asked him if Mr. Brice had behaved upon the whole like a gentleman, and a man of honour? His answer was, Yes he has; but I could not live with the ignominy of having received a blow, as I was once a captain of a man of war. I knew him a lieutenant of a man of war, and a captain of a man of war.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Brice before?</p>
               <p>Groat. I never had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Brice, 'till before Mr. Fielding that night, when he was charged with this affair.</p>

            . About six o'clock that Sunday evening I received a letter from Mr. Brice, desiring I would go immediately to the Cardiganhead, to Capt. Jasper, who was wounded. I went there immediately, and found several physical gentlemen with him; Dr. Groat, and others. I was introduced to Capt. Jasper, as a person sent by Mr. Brice; he received me with great satisfaction; I thought particular satisfaction; he received me with kindness, being sent by Mr. Brice. This was my own opinion of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sensible?</p>
               <p>Ford. Quite sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before?</p>
               <p>Ford. I did not know him at all; he had been before that time dressed by the surgeons that attended him, so that I only felt his pulse, and asked him a few questions, as he seemed to be in a weak state. Then I went out with the other gentlemen, who had attended him before, to be particularly informed. It appeared unnecessary to vary the method, and we agreed to meet again that night at ten o'clock. Dr. Groat proposed to me to ask him some questions relative to the affair, and we returned, and they were asked him. The questions and answers were much the same as have been mentioned now. I observed, when the doctor asked him if Mr. Brice was the aggressor, he looked up with great vivacity, and said, No, by G - d, it was not he; I was. He spoke it with such particular emphasis, that conveyed more to me, I think, than the mere words. It was spoke with great earnestness. I observed his countenance at that time, it was exceedingly expressive; he confirmed by his looks, he seemed to have it understood, that Mr. Brice was not to blame. We met again that evening, and the next morning, but there was nothing more particular.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Brice?</p>
               <p>Ford. I have long had the honour of knowing Mr. Brice, and all his family.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character as to humanity?</p>
               <p>Ford. I never heard any thing said against Mr. Brice's character in my life, they are as worthy people as any I know; the character of the whole family is unexceptionable: I never in my life heard any thing of his being liable to quarrel, or being of a hot disposition.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On Sunday the 10th of May, between three and four in the afternoon, a porter came to my house, from the Cardigan-head tavern, and desired me to come away immediately to a gentleman dangerously wounded. I was in Pall-mall. I believe I got there about ten minutes before four. I was conducted into a room, where I saw several gentlemen, Dr. Groat, and others: Capt. Jasper was lying speechless, and with the countenance of a man expiring. After some little consultation among ourselves, it was agreed to take some blood from him, which was done. Soon after this, in two or three minutes, he began to open his eyes, and had some marks of reviving. A little wine and water was given him; and after that he revived considerably, and began to speak, and some persons in the room began to ask him some questions. They were most of them strangers to me. I remember in his answers, he said he was the aggressor entirely, and seemed to acquit him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that him?</p>
               <p>Davenport. I suppose he meant Mr. Brice, he entirely acquitted him from any blame. Somebody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250029"/> in the room asked him if they had each of them their pistols: he said, Each of them had.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked that question?</p>
               <p>Davenport. I do not know who asked it, they were all strangers to me. I believe at this time the last witnesses were gone out of the room. I remember he said, Each presented his own, and at the same time. I asked this one question, Whether each of them loaded his own pistol? He answered in the affirmative, that they did. I found the questions rather fatigued him, and I desired they would get him to bed as fast as possible. A bed was prepared, and he was carried up to it. Then I assisted in dressing him as he lay on the floor; his breast was bloody. The wound was in the left-breast, which had gone quite through the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask whose pistols they were?</p>
               <p>Davenport. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor who brought them there?</p>
               <p>Davenport. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pistols?</p>
               <p>Davenport. They were not there when I was there; I came in late; I never saw them; I never heard him say any thing material, more than what I mentioned; but he expressed himself, more than once, with great indifference about his recovery, and said, No matter whether  he recovered or not. It was expressed with a great deal of in difference. I was not present at the time these gentlemen asked the questions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am extremely sorry that I am obliged to appear before your Lordship in this court, for a crime of this nature. The evidence is such, that I hope will convince the whole world that I could not avoid coming to the extremity that I did, which was owing to the violence of the deceased. I shall not take up your Lordship's time any farther, but leave it upon the evidence that has been given. I have several gentlemen in court that know me, which I shall call to my character.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prisoner. I beg leave to submit to your Lordship, the distinction made by my Lord Hale, the greatest writer on this subject, between murder and manslaughter, and apply this case to that general occasion.</p>
               <p>His Lordship said, There was no doubt at all about it on this evidence.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prisoner. There is no occasion to call any witnesses to his character.</p>

            . I keep a goldsmith's shop in the Minories. On the 9th of May, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop with a silver pint mug. He was somewhat confused, and said, it was not to sell, but to be valued, and that he was going to buy it. There was marked at the bottom, 12 oz. 12 pwts. and the letter M on the handle; it answered to the weight, and I asked for the book to tell him what it was worth, but he took the mug, and went away directly. I called him, but I saw no more of it. Soon after, I was told the prosecutor had lost such a mug; I described the prisoner, and he was taken that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. to Millar. Did you ever get your mug again?</p>
               <p>Millar. No, I never did. Mr. Harding describ'd the mug just as it is. The prisoner left my house within ten minutes of three o'clock, and Mr. Harding's house is not a quarter of a mile from mine.</p>

They both acknowledged the same before the justice. [Produced in court.] It used to hang by rings, at the corner, by the door, to shew that we sold such things. It is a new one, but the rain had spoil'd the colour of of it. When new, it was worth seven shillings and six-pence.</p>

            . Some time in May, I bought a carpet of Wright, I judge this to be the same, but I will not swear to it I delivered it to the prosecutor; I gave four shillings and six-pence for it. I cry old cloaths about the street; I never saw the coachman before.</p>

               <p>Wright's Defence.</p>
               <p>I asked Johnson for a bit of waste oil-cloth, that lay about the warehouse. A little after that I was taken ill of the fever, and Johnson brought three or four shirts, wrapped up in this carpet. My wife went to washing next morning, she saw it, and said, What does this man bring this for? it is of no use to us. A little after that I took and sold it, and an old waistcoat together.</p>

               <p>He asked me for a piece to set his feet upon, and, when he was not well, I took this along with me. I did not know that he sold it, nor did I receive any money for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it full?</p>
               <p>Barrat. It was not quite full: then there was a purse found, in which was two guineas and a half, and eleven shillings in silver, the mark'd shilling was among them. She was asked how she came by that shilling; she said she picked it up about the house, and that she had done very wrong in not telling Mr. or Mrs. Calvert of it. She own'd she took the cordial out of the shop. Sometimes this cordial stands open in the shop in stone-bottles.</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all of this horse that I am accused with, I never saw or heard of any horse, I am lately come from sea, I have been to serve my king and country on board the Liverpool man of war, Capt. Davis; I got my clearance at Hallifax, and came home to Spit-head. I had a fall upon the main-deck, and splintered my arm, and now my arm is entirely well again. I came into this woman's house about nine o'clock at night, and was no sooner come there, but this woman and a man began with me about a horse that was taken out of the yard.</p>

I put my hand into his pocket, and found a quantity of tea loose in his pocket; then I got Mr. Harrison to turn out his pocket, and I smelt at it, and said it was our 16 shillings tea. I went to that cannister, and by it I found some tea spilt, which is very seldom the case: then he owned it came out of that cannister. I had a seal put on it immediately, and took him before my Lord-mayor, and he was sent to the Compter. I got a search-warrant, and went to his house, and in a drawer I found about thirty different articles, all in the grocery way. He confessed to the other things also, and owned the same before my Lord Mayor, and offered to go for a soldier, to serve the India company. [The tea produced in Court.]</p>

I was standing fronting the horses heads, the prisoner had got his body in the coach, on the off-side, and had got the two coats in his arms, but in pulling the coach-door open he moved the coach a little. I went up to him, he did not see me; as he had the coats in his arms, I took him by the collar, and called out for help; he dropped the coats in the dirt, we carried him and the coats to Mr. Fielding, and charged him with taking them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Savage, I was appointed to watch the ruins after the fire, where Mr. Savage had his cooperage. On the 23d of May, about 11 at night, the prisoner came upon the premises, and this beak-iron was standing fastened on a stake in the ground: I saw the prisoner take and shake and wriggle it about, and get it out; he got it out, and was walking off with it. I went and laid hold of his collar, when he had it upon him. He had got it across his knees, and was going off with it, stooping that I should not see him. Then he dropped it down. I brought him into my master's house, and charged an officer with him. [The house is joining to the yard.] He was put into the watch-house till the Monday morning; then he was taken before the justice, and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to him was you when he was getting the beak-iron out of the stake?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I might be about 10 or 11 yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you observe him at it before you seized him?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Not above two minutes, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property is the iron?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It is Mr. Savage's property, I put it into the stake myself, and rounded some koops that had been in the fire, and worked at it all day on the Friday, which was the 22 d. I asked the prisoner how he came there; he said he lost his way.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What is the reason you did not bring the beak-iron along with me into your master's house?</p>
               <p>Taylor. As the iron was pretty heavy, I thought proper to take care of the prisoner first; then I went and fetched that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner making off from you, or towards you?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He was coming towards me, that was his way out of the yard, he could not go backwards, without going into the dock, or by water.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When I was carried in, they let me go; he went out, and came in again, and brought this beak iron, and then charged me with taking it. I was fuddled, and I went there and lay down, slept, and got myself sober. When I awaked, I could not tell where I was; I saw this man with a lanthorn; he called, Hallos, and asked me what business I had there; I told him I wanted to get out. He said, Come along with me, and I'll shew you the way out. He took me by the hand to his master's house. Then he said, Here is a man was got upon the premises as far as the small-beer cellar. They examined to see if I had got any thing. He staid some time, then went out again, and brought this thing in, and desired them not to let me go; for he said, he found it where I had been. When I first saw him, with his lanthorn, I might have gone off; I had time enough, had I thought myself guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taylor. When you first discovered the prisoner, did he tell you he had lost his way?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you would shew him his way?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did; then I took him to my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of the house without charging him with any thing?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I left him in charge with another watchman before I went out.</p>

            , a servant of mine, informed me that one of them had got a piece of cloth under her arm, which was Ingram. [She was the purchaser.] I desired him to take no notice, but leave it to me. They went both out of the shop about three minutes after. I followed them out, and desired them to walk back. When they were in the shop, I threatened to send for a constable to have them searched. While I was doing that, some of the people said, She has dropped it; that was Ingram. Then the other prisoner took it up, and put it upon the counter. Then I threatened them, and turned them out of the shop, desiring them to come there no more. After they were gone, I recollected they had been in the shop before; I went after them again.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had they got that time?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I believe they had got about 300 yards. Soon after they had got into the shop, Ingram dropped a piece of clear-lawn, while I had her by the arm. Then I sent for an officer, and had them committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it drop from?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It dropped, I believe, from her petticoats; I felt it by my leg. [Produced in court.] It is German lawn, there is about seven yards and a half of it, my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know it by?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I know it by my book-keeper's writing upon it; and likewise by the mark that I put upon it, after it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they looked upon such lawn in your shop?</p>
               <p>Saunders. They had looked upon lawn of the same sort, I believe Ingram bought a small quantity of the same.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Saunders's shop at the time he wanted to take the prisoner Ingram to the body of the shop; but she would not go that way, but went towards a piece of red bays, and stood close by it. I had before been by it, there was no lawn upon it when I first saw it; when she stood there, I saw the lawn laying upon the bays.</p>

After we came out the gentleman followed us, and brought us back again; she opened her cloaths, and said she had nothing; he took her by the arm, and pulled up a bit of lawn, and said she had robbed him of it. I am innocent, and know nothing of it.</p>

About nine o'clock in the evening, I was leaning upon the bar-door, he said, Mr. Bulkley, how do you do? ( he was dress'd in the manner he is now) I said, Sir, I beg your pardon, you have the advantage of me, I do not recollect you; said he, Don't you know Capt. Johnson? I have been out of the kingdom three or four years, and now you don't know me! Said I, I am glad to see you well. He said, Shall we not drink together? I came from Portsmouth this morning, and am just got out of a post-chaise; and I am obligd to go off to-morrow morning on his majesty's business. I asked him after some people at Portsmouth, and Godalming; he said, he knew them extremely well. He said, Well, Bulkley, I am going up to Mr Clevland, and here is about three thousand pounds worth of notes. that I must deliver to him; let me have a few shillings, and I'll call to-morrow morning, and pay you; and if you have any demands to Godalming, or Portsmouth, I'll deliver them. I let him have six shillings. After that, I read an advertisement from Mr. Fielding, of such a person, that had defrauded several people; I went to Mr. Fielding's; I found he had defrauded Mr. Parker, who keeps t he Globe tavern, in the Strand, in the same way, and he happened to see him afterwards, and laid hold on him, and charged a constable with him. When I was at the justice's, I think there were about thirty-two of our business, that keep taverns and coffee houses, that he had served the same; and when he was committed, there were ten detainers against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what did you give him credit?</p>
               <p>Bulkley. Upon his saying he came from Portsmouth, and calling me by my name, and producing a book with a large parcel of papers; saying, there were about 300 l. that he was to receive in the Navy-office.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. In what manner did you grant me the money? Or whether ever I left London, or offered to defraud or dissemble with any man or woman in London? Did I speak any thing, but what I spoke openly at the bar? Or did I call you aside?</p>
               <p>Bulkley. I was standing at the bar; it was all done in a quarter of an hour, he was in such a hurry, and so fatigued, he pretended, just getting out of a post-chaise, and expecting the ship to sail the next morning. All these pretences appear'd to me as realities; upon which, I lent him the money. There were two mariners at the justice's, that knew him; they said, he once was before the mast, but never any thing else.</p>

               <p>Isabella Morgan. I had a dollar that my husband brought home from Spain, and gave to me five years ago; I gave it into the landlady's hand to be looked at, she gave it me back again; then I let the boy at the ale-house where we were, take it to look at, he put it into a jay's cage, the joy took it in his mouth, and the boy and he played with it, till it dropped through, then the prisoner took it; she was the last in whose hands I saw it, she was in company with us in the same box. When I asked her for it she said, Do you want to rob me? and she would not comply with us to give it me again: it was lost between the prisoner and the bird.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure she had it last?</p>

               <p>Q. Did she ever own that she had it?</p>
               <p>Is. Morgan. No, she denied it; I never found it again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it?</p>
               <p>Is. Morgan. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it worth half a crown.</p>
               <p>Is. Morgan. It was about the bigness of a crown-piece. I cannot tell whether it was silver or not. I was told it was worth about four shillings and six pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body tell you it was not silver?</p>
               <p>Is. Morgan. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body tell you it was silver.</p>

               <p>E. Cantlin. No, they did not, but they knew one another. There were nobody but them in the house, but myself and my boy. The prosecutrix had got a piece of money, she asked me if I would change it, I told her I could not, for I did not know what piece it was; I could not tell whether it was brass or silver. My boy and the prisoner looked at it, then they put it into the cage to the jay, it had it in its bill five or six minutes, at last the money was dropped through into the bottom of the cage, the prisoner took it out, and I never saw any more of it from that time to this; I saw her put it down her bosom.</p>

            . The prosecutor went out with a basket of images in very good health, when he returned he was convulsed, and very ill, and brought home several images broke to pieces; I endeavoured to find out where the affair happened, and he described it so as I could just understand it to be Clerkenwell-bridewell. Then I went there to Gings, he was the assistant turnkey; I understood Mr. Jones, the keeper of the prison, was in bed. I said I did not know but the man was so affrighted that he would die. After that I saw in one of the papers, that Mr. Jones was dead; I did not know who to apply to. Then I went to the men, and asked them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250039"/> if they would make the man satisfaction; they proffered me four little images.</p>
               <p>Gings. I proffered you a crown, and you would not take under ten shillings.</p>

               <p>I was in the tap-room when this man came in, I cannot say how long he was there; I saw he had a parcel of toys in his basket, I took out two, and looked at them, and went to put them in again, and he said, No, no, me have none of dem. I offered him them again, and he would not take them. Then I sent a person to the gate with them. He would not have them. They were taken from me directly, and put up in the tap-room, and there they are still.</p>
               <p>For Gings.</p>

            . I went to see a prisoner there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Jobson. Something above a fortnight ago, I cannot tell what day it was. This man had a basket, he came in, and Lamb went up to the basket, and took hold of the man's images, and fell to kicking the basket, and said to the man, What business have you here among prisoners? and played about them some time. He went a little way off, and soon came again, and said, Take your things away, we do not want them. The gentleman said, Now let me go out, I want nothing. This was what he said, as I understood, I think he said, he wanted to go out, he did not want the things. Then one Pearce, one of the jail-keepers, took out one of the images, and hugged it on his arms, and made game of it; and said, This is my Jesus, and took it away. The images that they had taken were delivered to Mrs. Jones.

             took none of them, he never touched them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him present?</p>
               <p>Jobson. He was in the yard, I cannot say where.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let the man in?</p>
               <p>Jobson. Gings did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there the whole time the man was there?</p>
               <p>Jobson. Yes, I was, I saw him come in, and I saw him go out; he was terribly affrighted, and all he wanted was to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he apply to, to get out.</p>
               <p>Jobson. He applied to Gings to let him out, and towards the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he with his images from the gate?</p>
               <p>Jobson. The gate is, I believe, 12 or 14 yards from where they stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow him towards the gate?</p>
               <p>Jobson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him first apply to Gings to let him out?</p>
               <p>Jobson. That was after Lamb had done as I have mentioned, and offered him his things again.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the gate was Gings when the man applied to him to let him out?</p>
               <p>Jobson. I cannot say, he was a good way from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gings near the images?</p>
               <p>Jobson. I believe he was not in sight of the images, he was nearer to the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these two images afterwards?</p>
               <p>Jobson. The jail-keeper was then very bad; he died soon after, and the keeper's wife took them all into her custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them delivered to her?</p>
               <p>Jobson. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom?</p>
               <p>Jobson. By Lamb: this was after the man would not take them again.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after?</p>
               <p>Jobson. I dare say it was within a quarter of an hour; I know Gings had never none at all, nor I believe never saw them taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the images since?</p>
               <p>Jobson. I saw them two or three days after that in Mrs. Jones's custody. The case was this, Pearce and Lamb made her a present of them, and she took them all; they are now in her custody, now standing over a cupboard.</p>

            . I went into see a prisoner that was there; I saw the man come in with his basket of images; he did not know where he was coming to. Lamb was in the tap-room; he went out, and took two images, one of the shape of a horse, the other a man. Then he went and made an offer at his basket, but did not do any damage. After that he wanted to return them to him again, and he would not have them. He said he did not want them, but he wanted to go out. Then the head-turnkey came and took out an image. They both gave them to Mrs. Jones, before the man went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not go with him towards the door?</p>
               <p>M. Barton. No, I did not, I said at the upper end of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gings take any part in it at all?</p>

               <p>Jobson. I think Mrs. Jones took up one, and offered him money for it; and he was so frightened he would not take any money for it; all he wanted was to be out.</p>
