Then she said she wanted some money, to get some liquor; and I gave her another shilling to fetch some; she went out and fetched some, and brought it back, and she wanted me to have some; but I never tasted it; so I don't know what liquor it was. Then I went to sleep, and somewhere about four o'clock I awoke; and she was gone from the room, and I missed the money and bank note, and I found my breeches had been taken from underneath my jacket, and put the other side of the bed, moved from where I left them; then I got up and went to the next door -</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to sleep had she left the room? - No, she was in the room. I went into the next door and asked them if they knew any thing of the woman? they said they knew nothing of her; and then I thought that she had taken my buckles as well as my money, and I went back to see, and I found they were there; she did not take them away. I told the people next door that she had robbed me of five guineas and a half, and a ten pound bank note: I then went and put my clothes on and went in search of her myself, and could not find her, and I set George Forrester to seek after her, and he brought her to me in about an hour, and he found five guineas on her.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was she brought to you after you got up? - I was two hours looking for her myself; it might be three hours in the whole, after I got up, before I see the woman again; I found five guineas and a half in gold, and the account with my name on it, and three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160004"/>shillings, and sixteen copper halfpence; the money was found under her right arm pit; I did not see the money on her myself, the tea paper was found on her that the money was in, but not with the money; after she was committed that gentleman found on her nine guineas, and six-pence besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your bank note? - No, but I found the paper that it was wrapped up in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she has the whole of this house? - I asked her whether she was a householder? she said she was.</p>

After that I searched her further, and I found this paper under her arm, that the prosecutor said the bank note was in, I found her at the chandler's shop, opposite the Thistle and Crown, in St. George's-fields, she lives in Elbow-lane, New Gravel-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it he first saw the woman? - In my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you was an officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce the things that were taken from her? - Yes; and he told her she was a bad woman; and she said she did it through distress; he said she had taken from him a ten pound bank note, and five guineas and a half in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak to any money at all? - He don't know any money at all; he has not swore to any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more money taken from her except the five guineas and a half? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Newport, of New Prison, the woman was delivered to my custody, and I took and searched her; Thursday last, and I found eight guineas and two half guineas, tied up in the bottom of her shift, tucked up between her legs; she said she was very sorry that I had taken the money from her, that the money was her own property.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. See whether this is the paper in which you put your bank note? - Yes, it is, I cannot swear to the money, but I can swear to this bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been at this time? - I was coming from Fox's rendezvous house, I had been pressed, and they had given me my discharge; I had not drank any thing, I was not at all drunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no lock to my door, it was broke open, and another girl lived along with me, and I went out for a quartern of gin, and before I went out I told that girl that this man had got property about him, and desired her not to go out; and while I was out I stopped to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160005"/>get a pint of beer, and she stole away from my company, and went back into my own room, and when I came into the room, she was laying over the man, and she had his breeches in her hand, and I asked her what she was doing there, and told her that she had a deal of assurance to come into my room, when I desired her not to come, and she shewed me something in her hand, and said to me, did not I tell you that he had some property about him, and I blamed her for coming into my room, and then she gave me the note and money.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you at any time see any other woman in the house? - Not a soul, but the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the other three? - I never saw nothing of them.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you by them afterwards? - I never had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know where he lived? - I did not, because he was secreted by another man. I asked him where he lived, but he said it was nothing to me, so as I had my work done.</p>

               <p>I am a gun-lock filer, I know the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160006"/>soner at the bar, at that time I was at work in the prisoner's shop, a shop which his master had furnished for him, one Mr. Shew, in East Smithfield; the prisoner's shop was in Long-alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you his servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was in partnership with me.</p>
               <p>Collings. He paid me my wages; I never took any work out or brought any In. One day when I was at work there, his house-keeper, the woman that he cohabits with, brings up six locks into the shop, they were marked I. K. and she told him that he must take them and repair them, and take them to the Tower and get them inspected, and then Mr. Knubley would give the remainder of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you understood that somebody or other had brought these locks to the house-keeper? - Where she brought them from I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand it so at the time? - I understood that he had sent her to Knubley's with them, and they were returned to be repaired.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just this moment that the house-keeper brought up the locks and gave them to the prisoner, and told him that he must repair them, and take them to the Tower; from that, the first he had seen of these locks was from the house-keeper? - He had made the locks, filed them, and sent them to Mr. Knubley, and Mr. Knubley gave a guinea towards the money, and sent them back again to be repaired.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month or week was that, that you saw these come up into the shop? - I never took any notice of the time; it was some time before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Were six cannon locks brought up there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say about them? - The prisoner said he should not repair them, he should take the names out, and take them to Mr. Shews.</p>

               <p>Q. Who began the conversation? - The house-keeper brought the locks up into the shop, and told him he must repair them; then she went out of the shop and left them; and then he said he should not repair them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first you ever saw of the locks? - No, the first time that ever I saw the locks was when they were made; the prisoner made the locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you understood that Knubley sent back these locks to be repaired? - Yes. It is the rule of the trade for the workmen to take them to the Tower inspector, and if they are returned the workmen repairs them till the inspector puts his mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the reason that he said he would sell them to his master? - No, only he did not like to repair them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he was in partnership with me or not? - I was not; he always paid me my wages.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He received the money and gave me what he liked.</p>
               <p>Court to Knubley. To whom did you return the locks to repair them? - To Tranter himself.</p>

I had my wife with me, I desired her to walk on, and I would pursue the prisoner, which immediately I did, and stopped him, and searched him; he had no hat on him then; as I was bringing him to the watch-house, he sadly wanted to stop, and begged that I would go round a turning in order that he might find the hat.</p>

               <p>Please your lordship, I was standing up by one captain Scott's, Sunday evening before last, about nine o'clock, hearing the harpsichord played by Miss Scott, in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is captain Scott's house? - In Stepney Green; and this man and two more coming by they stopped about five minutes, and the other two went up into a little place belonging to Mr. Jones's boarding school, and I spoke then to the prisoner, says I, this is very pretty music; yes, says he, it is; and then he took my hat off my head and went to the other two, and went down to the turning at the ship, and there he dropped it, and I went after him, and he went and stood behind a tree, and when I got close to him, as I am to you, I hallooed out stop thief! then this gentleman, Mr. Tipper, coming by taking a walk, he heard me cry stop thief! and he took him.</p>

William Leeson is the man that collared me; he catched me by the collar when I came to pass by him, and said, you are my deserter; I said, no, I never was a deserter, nor a soldier, and as I tried to get from him he struck me with a stick across my head, and they were all four on me at once; they were two of them behind me, and two before me, and Leeson held me up by the chin, and they took half a guinea out of my pocket, two half crowns, and four shillings and sixpence; then the other three made off, and ran behind the Play-house; then Leeson he drawed back, and I had a stick in my hand, and I held it to strike him, and he took a pistol out of his pocket, and took hold of me, and I called out watch! and the watch came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to run away? - No, he never attempted to get away; when the watchman came down he had got me fast by the collar, and the watchman he parted him from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchman take Leeson into custody? - No, not that watchman, he let him go, and I followed him under the Piazzas of Covent Garden, and I charged him with the two watchmen that he was talking with; and they said they were not watchmen; and I said, then if they were not watchmen they were patrols; they said they were not; and there came by another gentleman, and I told him of it, and he said they had a right to take him to the watch-house; and they said no, they should not, they should take him along with them, because he was a friend of theirs; and then the watchmen they guarded him away towards St. Giles's; they would not take him, nor would let any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that other person attempt to take him? - Yes; but the watchmen would not let any body take him; they took him away along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of Leeson after that? - I don't know what became of him till the officer of Bow-street took him; they found him with the pistol in his pocket, drinking with the two watchmen that were with him; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Leeson next after that? - Not till he was before the justice; that was the Monday morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him again? - O, yes! I knew him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he among others? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point him out? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to stay out so late at night? - We had been mercy together, all working men together, but I was as sober and sensible, and capable as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. When you see him at Bow-street, he was in custody then? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you break up at dinner? - I suppose it might be half past eleven, or near twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been from that time till two o'clock? - It is a good way from Peckham Rye to Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been sober, you might have walked it in an hour? - I did not hurry.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you walked in the common straight road to this place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you was three hours coming straight to this place? Where do you live? - In James's-street, Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not quite the straight way? - Yes, I believe it is as nigh a way as I can go.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you met with any company at all by the way? - No, I had not met with any company at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this man and the three men that were with him, were the only persons that were present at the time that this took place? - Yes, they were the only persons.</p>

               <p>Q. You perceived that they were robbing you? - I did not till they let me go; the prisoner forced up my chin.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said that that man, Leeson, put his hand into his pocket, and pulled his pistol out? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the watchman that they robbed you? - I did, when he came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you tell the watchman when he first came up, that they had robbed you? - I did not, I put my hand up to wipe the blood off my cheek, and I put my hand down again, and I found my breeches pocket was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first time the watchman came up, you did not complain of any robbery at all? - I had not time, and he went to take the other men that went off.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all before the watchman came, the prisoner and his companions took this money from you? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might have told the watchman that they robbed you? - I did not know then that I was robbed, I did charge him with the robbery as quick as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. He says, this man is a deserter, that is the reason I lay hold of him; you did not say this man has robbed me, you only said, I am not a deserter? - No, I am no deserter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the watchman say when you saw him the second time, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160010"/>would not take him, because you did not charge him the first time he came up? - He said he was out of his beat.</p>

            Mind the question, you told the watchman the second time, that he had robbed you? - Yes, so I told the watchman, and he said, but he is now out of my liberty, and you must follow him to Covent-garden.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman belonging to St. Martin's in the Fields; I had been the half hour after two, round my beat. I am a watchman in Russel-street, facing the Play-house; it was the 29th of June, I was coming down the court, that is called Crown-court, I hears a great noise, I hastened into Russel-street, to know what was the matter; when I came there, there were five or six men, I did not count them, and they were making a noise, and they were crossing each other, some on one side of the street and some on the other, as if they were at a game of play, and they were taking off one anothers hats, with a cuff first from one, and then to another, then I went up to them, and requested that they would not be so disturbing; I had no sooner spoke the word, but one of the companions came to me immediately, and laid hold of my stick, with whom I had a great struggle, but he did not get it from me, and I had like to have been down once or twice, but I held hold fast of the stick, the other man fell down on his bottom in pulling, and he would not loose the stick, and by pulling I pulled him up again from the stones, and when he was up he took to his heels and run, then I had a hand loose to take and spring the rattle, which I did, and followed him; I left the others all along with the prosecutor in the street, while I pursued this that had got hold of my stick.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any body call out for your assistance? - I did not hear any body; the man that had hold of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160011"/>stick, he ran past one of our watchmen at the corner, and I left off the chase, and came back again to the spot where this piece of business was; when I came back the prisoner at the bar had got hold of the prosecutor by the collar, challenging him with being a recruit, and a deserter, from which the prosecutor cried out aloud, and said, watchman, I am not a recruit nor a deserter, I have been ill treated by this man; says I to the prosecutor, are you sure that you are right? I am, says he, I am neither a recruit nor a deserter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other man about? - No, I see nothing of the kind.</p>

            When did the other men go away? - They dispersed at the spring of my rattle, some one way and some another; I stepped up to the sergeant, and says to him, loose your hold, and let the man go, what business have you with the man; I made him loose his hold; now, my man, says I, do you make the best of your way home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear in liquor at that time? - I cannot say that I see him any was disguised. The prosecutor then went towards Covent-garden, then I was left in Russel-street alone, no man there besides myself; in about five or ten minutes the prosecutor came to me, and told me that he was robbed by them men? robbed, says I, why had not you said so sooner, I would then have taken some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason why he did not say so sooner? - He did not give any answer to that, he asked me if I knew any of them? I told him I did not, they were all strangers to me, the same as he was, but I believed the sergeant, whom I took from his collar, belonged to Captain

               <p>Q. How long time had elapsed from the first time you came down to these people? - It might be five or ten minutes. So I refusing to go with him into Covent-garden, he goes by himself under the Piazzas of Covent-garden; he came back again to me, and told me that he had seen the prisoner at the bar under the piazzas of Covent-garden, but I did not go with him.</p>

               <p>Q. And they even throwed one anothers hats about? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You said that under the piazza you saw two watchmen and charged them with the prisoner and they said he was their friend, what piazza was that? - Under the piazza in Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Not the piazza in Drury-lane? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Axhall. If the man had made any charge against the sergeant for an Highway robbery, you would have taken him and done your duty? - Certainly I should; he did not say any thing to me about a robbery till he had left the street and come back again, about five or ten minutes after.</p>

Now from the time that you was in view of all the parties when they were at play together with the hats and so on, and when you parted the prosecutor and this man how long might it be? - That was at the last of all, there was none other then left but the sergeant and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the sergeant attempt to run away when you parted them? - No, I pushed the prosecutor one way and the sergeant another, and they both went on slowly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think the prosecutor was in liquor? - He must have been a drinking, but he did not seem to me to be drunk, he could talk and walk very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You never suspected that any highway robbery had taken place till this man came back? - No, I did not.</p>

I told him that I thought that I knew his face, that he belonged to our regiment, and the watchman came up while I was looking at him, and told me to quit him, and I came up to one of our houses in Covent Garden, and stopped there, and two gentlemen came from Bow-street, and took me into possession, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160013"/>prosecutor charged me with the robbery.</p>

            When did you next see the things? - I went and had a warrant taken out against the prisoner, and found the duplicates in his pocket; he was second coachman along with me about two months before; but he was then out of place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he used to sleep in the room where you did, when he was in Mr. Ellis's service? - Yes, in the same room, all the time he was in Town, in the same room where this trunk was left.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the other things found? - At the pawnbroker's; I went with the man who went after them; two coats were found at Mr. Mulcaster's; these that I now produce were found at the landlord's house where he lived; it was one of our servants who first found my trunk broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is she? - She is at the town house, Hanover-square; she is not here.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you the sole proprietor of the house? - Yes; I have got a lodger there, but I pay the rent myself.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 26th of June, the night the house was broke open, who was the last person up? - I was, I went to bed about half past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your door secured? - Bolted with three bolts; that I did myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The outer door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was you called up? - About half past two o'clock. There were then two bolts quite broke off, and one bolt hung only by one nail; my till was taken out of the place where it was, it was not locked as some tills are; it contained silver, halfpence, and farthings, I suppose, to the amount of twenty shillings in all, but there was only about four shillings worth taken out of the till of copper, and put on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the till itself? - It was taken from under the counter, and put by the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the money was not on the counter when you went to bed? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In the first place, I believe, you have a partner in your business? - No, I have not; I am a cheesemonger.</p>
               <p>Q. How many does your family consist of? - I have two sisters and myself; they went to bed before me.</p>
               <p>Q. The till you have been talking of was in the shop? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The till, you say was not locked? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever money was in the till was not removed out of the house at all; but there was four shillings on the counter? - Yes; and, I believe, there was a handful laid on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gold in the till? - No, there was nothing but halfpence and farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you counted your money the over night? - I had not; we very seldom count farthings and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You had several examinations before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The magistrate at one time was going to discharge the prisoners, was not he? - I don't know that.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you perceive that? - Yes.</p>

We immediately went out of Mr. Biddle's door, and me and my brother went and alarmed the watchman, and brought the watchman to Mr. Frankcom's door, and I beat with the stick against the window shutters, and I found the handle of the door turn in my had, and the person inside got the door open about two or three inches; I then thought it necessary that I should lay hold of it with both hands, I did so, and then I found that there was no more pulling for a long time, and I called to Mr. Frankcom, and he looked out of window, and then we went in after we thought the house was sufficiently alarmed; I did not go in, the watchman went in, and

               <p>Q. Where was the handkerchief at that time? - I got it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take it out of your pocket? - She locked the door, and I did not know for what; she then came into the room again, and snatched the handkerchief out of my hand, and ran out.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to know that this money was in this handkerchief, or in your hand? - I cannot tell that, I don't know if she see it.</p>

            Was there any light in the room? - No, I could not tell where I was; she got a light in her hand when she came in the second time, and I was on the floor of the ground when she took the money from me; she went out, and I went after her into another woman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. After she had snatched the money out of your hand, in the handkerchief, where did she go? - That woman, Hannah Roper, and another woman along with her, came and took her out of doors; they catched her by the arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the house? - Yes, they were in the fore room, on the same floor. When she snatched the money out of my hand, she went in where these two other women were; I went to her there, and catched hold of her there, and catched hold of my handkerchief, and she had the money then in her hand; she had taken it out of the handkerchief; I found nothing in it but the half guinea, silver money, which tumbled on the ground; then that woman, Roper, and some other woman put her out of the house, and an old woman catched hold of me, and said, stop young man, you shall have your money.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't understand your taking your money out of your pocket and putting it into your handkerchief? - I think I could keep it faster in my handkerchief than in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of her afterwards? - I came into the street and called the watch, when he called ten o'clock, and I went back to that same house where I had been, and the door was locked, and I went and asked for the girl that had got my money, of the old woman that took me by the jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mary Broke after this? Where did she go? - I don't know where she went; the officer found her, I don't know where; I did not get any of my money back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - Oh, no. I came from on board, and my captain he paid me my money at half past eight, and I went to Limehouse to pay two or three pounds for clothes.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner Burke the night following; I searched her, but found no money on her, only a few shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Burke. This man came to me quite in liquor, and I was rather in liquor myself; I was sitting at the door, and he came to me and asked me whether I would go to bed with him? I told him I would make the agreement, as it was late at night. I went with him backwards into the room, and he gave me four shillings out of his handkerchief; I gave the woman of the house one shilling for the bed; with that I went to bed with him, and I went to sleep; and I awaked, and he wanted to use me in a very violent manner indeed, which was inexpressible; and he said if I would not, he would kick me out of bed; accordingly he gave me a kick in the small of my back, and I got out of bed in my smock, saving your presence, my lord; and then he said he would have his money back; accordingly he got up and put on his clothes, and went away; and I went to bed in the same room; in the morning I got up and went towards Stepney, and I met him, and he said, for a b-dy whore, he would have his revenge on me. He has been seen by several solks sporting his money about; and he said he had lost six guineas before he came to me, and he was very groggy in liquor, and he wanted to use me very indecent.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Burke. Before he would take me up, he said he would swear to a mark on my breast, which he saw when I was undrested.</p>

Mr. Weedon, the next door neighbour but one, came to me and asked me what was the matter? I told him, and he pursued them; they were going down Whitechapel as hard as they could run; I told him the man in the blue jacket had got them in his breeches; I saw the projection of them in his breeches before he went out of the shop. Mr. Weedon brought him back to the shop, and when he was brought back, the prisoner took the handkerchiefs out of his breeches, and threw them to the ground; they are in Mr. Weedon's custody.</p>

            To Bingley. How was you employed when they were taken from the counter? - The other man asked me to measure the handkerchief, to see if it was square, and I took it up in my hand, and held it up by the corners, holding it before me to measure it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that covered there? - It did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along Whitechapel-road, and I met a man that I used to work with, and he asked me if I would go with him to buy an handkerchief? I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160021"/>said did not care, I would go with him; and we went to this shop, and he looked at a cotton handkerchief, and he did not approve of it, and we both came out together, and this gentlewoman in the shop said that how we had stole some handkerchiefs; and she had us taken, which there was never nothing of the kind, nor I never had the property in my possession.</p>

This day week, between three and four o'clock, I was at the bottom of Fetter-lane, and I observed three men running, and a chariot going on, two men on one side of the way and one on the other, and one behind the chariot with the great coat under his arm; the prisoners were the four men; I had the curiosity to follow them, and at the other side of the Bar James Clement got up behind the chariot, and stood on the foot board behind the chariot, where the man was standing with the coat under his arm; this was as they were running; I went as far as Catharine-street, in the Strand, and there they both got down, and went up Catharine-street, and the others followed after.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon was this after you left them? - In the course of a minute; they were the same men James Clements had got the coat then; with that I seized him, and asked whose coat that was He said a man gave it him to hold.

               <p>Q. Did they converse when they were altogether? - I did not stand to see; I seized the man that had the coat in the very instant. I enquired for the owner the next morning, and found him on the stand; I gave him the great coat; that is the same great coat.</p>

I have not seen them since at all; they have never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner with taking these spoons? - My servant came up to me and brought a note that a gentleman had wrote below stairs, and waited for an answer; I immediately got up and looked at the note, and read it; it purported that Mr. Orchard, of Hatton Garden, wanted to see me about some particular business, and wanted me to call about ten o'clock. I immediately sent word down, by my servant, with my compliments to Mr. Orchard, and I would wait on him. In two minutes, or one it might be, my servant comes up again, and says, sir, the person seems to have turned out to be a thief. About a sortnight after that I was sent for up to Bow-street, I don't recollect the day exactly; my servant swore to the prisoner's person; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came to Bow-street was he in the same dress he is in now? - O no, by no means; he had on a green coat then.</p>

               <p>I am in the service of Mr. Cooper; I am very positive that is the man that came the 1st of June; I knew him the first time I saw him at Bow-street. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160023"/>came about eight o'clock in the morning, as high as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear a sailor then? - No, he had a green coat on; he asked if he could speak to Mr. Cooper? I answered him no. He asked how long it might be first? I answered him perhaps in the course of half an hour. He said, he could not wait, but he must have an immediate answer, that he would leave a note, if I would let him have some pen, ink, and paper; which I granted him; I was in the parlour with him while he wrote the note; I never left the parlour till I took the note to my master; when I left the parlour the spoons were in the case, on the side board, open; I only left him while my master gave me an answer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner when you came down? - No. Immediately I found the knife case that I had left open was shut, and when I opened it a pair of table spoons were gone, marked H. T.C. the name of my master and mistress, and I had left the front door fast, and I went and looked at the door, and found it pulled too, but not fast.</p>

I had missed property to a very considerable amount, from the till; I had him apprehended by the constable, in consequence of suspicion, and I requested the constable to examine him. I was present when he was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he apprehended in your own house? - Yes; I was talking to him when the constable came in, and I gave charge of him; indeed I was charging him with the same when the constable came in. The principal reason that I had him examined for, was, to see if he had the key of the till about him; and he said, we need not examine him, for he had thrown it over the house that morning. I have since received some of the goods from two witnesses who are here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby At the time you asked the prisoner about this key, you gave him to understand, if he told you what became of it, you would not proceed any further against him? - I don't know that I said any such thing.</p>

I missed likewise a great coat, which justice Addington thought proper to put it by; I found them again in the possession of the prisoner at the bar, in Dove-court, in Gray's Inn-lane; I got the constable, and went after him the next day, and found the things, inserted in the indictment, in his apartment, in a box; he was there at that time; he made a denial in the first place, that he did not know any thing about them, and at last he produced the property.

Was the box locked that had these clothes? - To the best of my recollection the key was in the box, but it was not locked; he brought out the hat in the first place, and then he brought out the clothes; he made several excuses; he said, he hoped we would not take the advantage of him, and made some flight excuse.</p>

On the 4th of June the prisoner came in along with one Mrs. Sparrow, his aunt, who was a lodger in the house, and I saw him go in and out three or four times in the day, I took no notice of him, as he was an acquaintance of Mr. Sparrow's; about four or five o'clock I was going up to make Mr. Morgans's bed, and Mr. Sparrow and the prisoner met me on the stairs, and the prisoner went into Mr. Sparrow's room, and I went into Mr. Morgans's room.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find Mr. Morgans's room? - Locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - I stayed no longer till I made his bed, and done every thing necessary in his room; when I had done so, I came out and locked the door, and pushed it with my hand to see if it was locked, and the prisoner was in Mr. Sparrow's room at the same time; this was between four and five; about an hour after Mr. Sparrow came down, and says, Mrs. Williams, can you change me a guinea? No, says I, I cannot, but I will go up to the Fountain and get it changed. He said, no, it did not signify, if I could lend him a shilling. I told him, yes, I could lend him a shilling, but silver was very scarce, I would let him have six-pence and sixpenny worth of halfpence. A little time after that Mr. Sparrow went out, and his wife went out very soon after, and I thought to myself it must be some intimate acquaintance of theirs, that they would leave him up stairs; and in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour after, I saw the prisoner go through the passage with a bundle in his hand, but I said nothing to him, nor he to me; this was about six o'clock in the evening. Mr. Morgans came home about eight or nine o'clock, and went to go to his room, and found his door open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This young man you had seen come to his uncle and aunt before? - No, never before this day, nor I did not know who he was till then.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers have you? - Not a great many; three on one floor, and four on another.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I found these things in the apartment which the prisoner was in, in Dove-court, No.4. When we went into the prisoner's room, the prosecutor was not with me at first; he was pulling off his breeches; I called him by his name, Mr. Stanfield, says I, what have you done with the things that you took from the next room to where your uncle lives? He said he had not got any of them. I said, have you pledged the things, let me search your pockets; and I did so, and found nothing at all; and then he says, I hope you will take no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160029"/>particular advantage of me, and I will tell you where the goods are; they are here in a box.</p>

I told him I could not make it up, I could not compound felony, he must come along with me. These are the things I took out of the box.</p>

               <p>I am the daughter. On the 2d of June, my father went out about ten; after he went out Pitshold came and knocked at the door; my father had locked the front door and taken the key with him; I looked through the key hole and saw him perfectly; this was almost immediately after my father was gone, I should imagine he could hardly have got out of the buildings; I spoke to him through the key hole, told him my father had gone out and taken the key with him, and desired him to go round to the back door, and I would go and speak to him. Payne and Pitshold came to me before my father went out, to the front door; I see them both and spoke to them, they came to invite me to go a walking with them; and I rather objected to it; but they insisted on it in an agreeable manner; and I desired them to wait for me about a quarter of an hour, and then I would go; they agreed to go to the public house close to the Hospital, in Pitfield street, and there they were to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160030"/>wait for my coming. Immediately after my father was gone Pitshold came back to me to the front door, and I desired him to go round to the back door; when I opened the back door I asked him where his brother was? Which was Payne; he said he had left his brother waiting at the public house, at the Queen's Head I understood; I told him I was not quite ready. I look upon it at the time I went out it was near eleven o'clock; it was about half an hour after my father had left the house or better.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out did you lock the door? - Yes, I am perfectly sure of that, and put the key into my left hand pocket. When we came out instead of turning to the right, the way to the Queen's Head, he turned to the left hand; then I observed to Pitshold, what do you go that way for? He said, they had had a pint of porter at the Queen's Head and they did not like it, and he had sent Payne on to the White Swan; we went to the White Swan, Payne was not there; I look upon it we stayed there an hour or an hour and a half, waiting for Payne; he came at last, in about an hour or an hour an I a half; when Payne came in he asked whether we had any thing to drink? Pitshold answered we had had something; Payne complained that he was sick; and we took a walk altogether. I returned back to the Hospital the next morning.</p>

She said she saw me with six or seven shillings, and she wanted to run her hand into my waistcoat pocket; so at last I said, when I found her resolute, as that I had got but one guinea and a penny in my pocket; says she, let me have the guinea, and I will go and change it, and bring you twenty shillings good. I told her that I would not change it for her nor no other woman in England. I directly puts it into my breeches pocket, my fob as I thought; but instead of putting the guinea into my pocket, I put a halfpenny in, I drawed a halfpenny out of my waistcoat pocket and left the guinea in my pocket; accordingly she puts her hand into my pocket and takes this guinea and a halfpenny out; I thought it had been only a penny that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160031"/>she had got. I immediately turns down stairs and goes to the door, and goes about ten yards from the door, and puts my hand into my pocket to see what she had got, and I found it was the guinea along with the halfpenny; I immediately returned into the house again directly; and as soon as I returned into the house I saw her running into the necessary, and I followed her, and pulled her fast by the arm, and said, Mrs. Rogers, you have got the guinea that you took out of my pocket instead of the halfpenny; says I, will you give it me again? She denied having it some time; at last she told me if I would go to a public house and call for half a pint of rum I should find my guinea again. I went out of the house directly to go to this house, but she did not come; as soon as ever I came out of the house she tried to run away up into Rosemary-lane, and there I took her and detained her till I sent for an officer, and I had her taken into custody.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of William Dodson, the prosecutor. On the 24th of June, I heard somebody going along the passage very softly, I was in the front parlour; it was a few minutes past six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the back parlour that morning? - No, I did not hear him go up stairs, and I listened, and I went to look for the clothes that my nurse had told me, she had hung out in the yard the night before, (I had lain in three weeks,) and I went and looked into the yard, and saw the window was open, and I returned, and I heard somebody go from the yard to the street door, and I turned my head and saw a dish of clothes were empty; while I was in the back parlour I heard the steps of a person returning from the yard towards the street door; I then opened the front parlour, and turned my head towards the yard, and saw the dish of clothes empty, and turning my head the other way I saw the prisoner with something in his apron. The yard and passage is adjoining.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that linen with the dish before? - I left it about nine o'clock the over night, in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>

            Whereabouts was the prisoner when you saw him? - He was, I suppose, about two yards from me, in the passage, I perceived he had got something in his apron; I told him he was a thief, and he said, ma'am, I have either taken or got; I don't know which was the expression, and then he ran away.</p>

            Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge. I called to a neighbour and told him that I was robbed, and he pursued him, but did not take him, but he gave the alarm and he was taken, and I have seen the linen since, part of it I had in my own possession; here is one man's shirt, a man's night cap, a child's tippet, a handkerchief, a child's shirt, eight child's caps, a must a apron, and a child's callico frock. All these things were in the dish the night before; I received them at the justice's in Marlborough street.</p>
               <p>JOHN GUTCHLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am watch house keeper of St. James's parish. On the morning of the 21st of June, the prisoner was brought into the watch house by two butchers, Goodwin and Mason, about half past six in the forenoon; I searched him, and found on him this silk handkerchief, in his left hand coat pocket; the people that brought him in, brought in the other things.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know the handkerchief to be mine, it laid on a basket close to the dish.</p>

            on it, 17.</p>
               <p>Court. How came it to have that mark on it? - The Rev. Mr. Andrews, of Greathill, in Middlesex, made me a present of the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Dodson, who was that man that came with you to the watch-house when I was confined? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you recollect a man coming in to day to me, and you told me I wanted a silk handkerchief, but you would give me a bit of hemp.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a man came with him, I don't know who the man is, I rather thought it was his brother, and he said to him, you have got my handkerchief in your pocket; the man that came to me owned the handkerchief, and he said it was his property.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. How long had your husband had that handkerchief? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160036"/>I cannot say exactly, it is some months since.</p>
               <p>- BURDEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the young man, the prisoner at the bar, come out of the house of Mr. Dodson's with something in his apron, I was in my own house, it was about a quarter after six; I gave the alarm; I did not see the property taken from him, he ran away, and I ran after him, and called stop thief! I did not see him stopped; I live right opposite the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say you live right opposite the house; why did not you stop me when I came out of the house? - Because I did not know till Mrs. Dodson came out in her shift, and gave the alarm.</p>

               <p>I was standing at Carnaby Market, the 21st of June, about six o'clock, I heard somebody cry stop thief! the prisoner ran through the market; I followed him, and he turned into a court, and crossed Marlborough-court, and went into a passage; I came up to him, and asked him what he had in his apron? He gave me no answer; I looked into his apron and saw some linen; I asked him where he got it from? he made answer, he picked it up in the street; I got a blue apron of a lady that lives in our market, to tie up the property in; I tied it up and took it down to the watch house; a watchman took the prisoner to the watch house; I delivered the linen into Mr. Gutchley's hands.</p>

               <p>I tied up the things and carried it to the justice's in Marlborough street, the next day, and this shirt, and two handkerchiefs, he tied up in a sheet of paper and sealed it, and delivered it to me, and the rest of the things he gave to Mrs. Dodson to carry home to dry, because they were so wet, he was afraid they would be spoiled.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dodson. The shirt is my husband's by the mark W. D. and the linen handkerchief R. D. they were in the dish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutors they did not detain me at first without first settling who would be in it; that were the expressions they used, I don't know their meaning. I found these things at the corner of Marlborough-street; I was going about six o'clock in the morning to get a clean shirt of my aunt, who lives in Cranbourn Market; on going to the corner of Marlborough-street I saw that very silk handkerchief with the bundle tied up in it; I opened it to see what it was, and I put the things into my apron, and going on, this gentleman stopped me. I have no witness, I did not with my friends to know my distress.</p>

He left the halfpenny on the counter; as soon as he went out, a woman in the shop went round and see my parlour door open, and I went and see the property gone; I missed all the articles in the indictment. I found the boy afterwards as the watchman was crying the hour of ten; the watchman took him to the public house; he is here. I did not find any property on him; but he was seen with a bundle.</p>

By the different customers enquiring for the goods repeatedly, and the prisoner at the bar not coming to his usual employ, and the customers expressing that they delivered the goods into the hands of the prisoner, I suspected the prisoner to be the offender. I went in search of the prisoner in order to enquire about the goods; I found him in the Seven Dials, on the 7th of June, with the officer Manning; we immediately took the prisoner to the first public house, which was the corner house, we searched the prisoner and found various duplicates, the officer has them. I asked the prisoner whether these duplicates I refer to were my property or not? He said they were.</p>

               <p>Q. In what room were these clothes scattered? - Some in one and some in another, in my bed room. I sleep up stairs. I stood in my shirt till the watchman came up, and found me in the situation I have described. My watch was in the chest along with my money, in the room where I sleep; there was about forty shillings to forty-three shillings in my trowsers, and seventeen guineas in my chest; my trowsers were under my head in the bed. There was no lock to the chest; I did not see any alteration in it, it was not moved, the lid was down.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your watch and money in the chest when you got up? - No. I wish it was. The trowsers were gone from under my head, and they were laying on the bed; I had put them under my head myself; when the watchman came,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160043"/>I dressed myself and went down into the one pair of stairs room, the chamber where we live, we live in the chamber and sell coals in the lower room; then the watchman observed before I did, the tracking of a foot, and a naked bayonet laying on the table; then I took the bayonet with me, and went to a friends that I thought I had then, and told him I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else in that room? - No, only eighteen-pence that I had left in that room when I went to bed, they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice when you went down stairs how any body had got into your house? - No, I did not. All the notice I took was a track of a foot in the chamber.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever find your watch or money again? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I tell you before I ask you a question, I do not believe you ever was robbed; therefore you will be careful how you answer. I see you was pretty rich, seventeen guineas in your chest. How long had you had the money? - I had been collecting it as the customers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively that you had seventeen guineas? - I have done it already.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went to a friend as you thought? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. That friend that you mention is a man of the name of Drew, is not he? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you with that man about eight o'clock in the evening? - I was from four till nine, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the militia as well as Drew? Did not you go and ask your commanding officer leave to go to Ireland, because of your extreme distress? - I deny that. I went to have my protection renewed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Drew that you was extremely distressed indeed to make up a little money to pay your coal merchant, and had only a few shillings? - I deny it, or any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, though you have told us that there was no money left in your trowsers after you was robbed, was not there half a crown produced out of them? - Not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. So your wife was extremely ill of a fever and could not sleep? - I don't know, you must ask her that question; I know she was ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Your friend Drew returned home with you after this robbery to see the house? - He did not; he lives in King-street, and I live in New Gravel-lane; I was at home about half past nine; the watchman called two when I called him into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he return to you house at last? - Yes, he did; and he saw the track of a foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this wife of your's, did not you find her fast asleep? - No, that I deny.</p>

               <p>Q. These were very high minded thieves, they ran away with the silver and gold, and left the halfpence standing, they scorned to touch that? - Just so.</p>

            Then the duplicate of that watch was not among the other duplicates? - There was the duplicate of one pawned for seven shillings and sixpence, I can produce the letter that my mother sent it me from Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this Dempsey is a man that has served in the militia as well as your self? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I observe there was a naked bayonet in your room, whose bayonet was that? - That was mine; when I went to bed, the belt was hanging by the chamber window, and the scabbard in it, and the bayonet in the scabbard.</p>
               <p>Q. There is one thing more I would wish to ask you about Drew. Did not Drew tell you that perhaps your wife had laid up some money; and did not you tell Drew that you was sure your wife had never laid up any money? - No, I never said such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Your neighbour Drew deceived you before the justice, and gave you the lie to all these things? - He never came till the last.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was not so, Dempsey would not have been admitted to bail. Did not Dempsey come voluntary to justice? - That was not the way he came to justice, he came to the house where the officers are, I was going to the coal merchants the same time, to tell him I was robbed of his property; as I was going by, Dempsey says, d-mn you, don't you say that I robbed you. Says I you are the man that I want.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the magistrate took his word at the first hearing for his appearing again on Wednesday, at the further examination? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; I went to bed on the 6th of June last, between eleven and twelve, I was the last up in the house, I shut the chamber window when I went to bed, I am confident of it, because I was last in the room, our neighbourhood we live in is a very noisy neighbourhood, by which means when I heard the sash of the window open I paid no attention to it, I thought it was a neighbour, a woman that lives in the adjoining house, doing it to divert herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your bed room? - In the two pair of stairs room, the uppermost room in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any persons come into your bed room? - Yes, two men, the prisoner Dempsey was the foremost; about a quarter before one I heard the window open, and I heard a foot go down stairs, and the street door open, but I thought it was in the adjoining house; afterwards all remained still; after the watchman had gone round his beat of one o'clock, I heard them come from the lower room up into the chamber again, I thought it was in the next house, that it was the woman's nurse there, the woman being in a dying state; after the watchman was out of hearing I heard the feet come up into the two pair of stairs room; on hearing the feet I raised my head in the bed, the room door was only put to, it was not locked, I rise my head, and to my surprise I saw the prisoner Dempsey come in, he had a cap over his face, and another man at his back, that appeared to be something taller, he had lanthorn in his left hand, and a naked bayonet in the right.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a lanthorn was that, was it a dark lanthorn? - I never saw a dark lanthorn, the light only appeared from one pane, but whether it was horn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160045"/>or glass I cannot swear, my fright was so great; the pane from whence the light came was farthest from his body, the light did not shine on him, but from him, so when I saw the fight I was so frightened I was deprived of speech, and the first thing he did, was to present the bayonet to me, and said, if I made a word, he would have my bloody liver and lights out immediately.</p>

            Was you in bed with your husband at that time? - Yes. He drew quite near to the side of the bed, as near as possible he could; he spoke in a middling manner, so as to be very plainly heard, he then put the bayonet to my collar bone, fixed it right here, and threatened in case I made the least alarm that he certainly would put an end to me; he put the lanthorn out of his hand, on a chair on the side of the bed, then the other man came to the other side of the bed, and raises my husband's shoulder up off the pillow, while Dempsey, with his left hand, took a pair of trowsers from under his head, he then threw down the trowsers on the bed, and took the lanthorn up in his hand, and still stood to guard me; the other man let my husband's head gently fall on the pillow, and the other man then took the money out of the trowsers pocket, then Dempsey demanded my pockets; I told him I had nothing in them; he asked me then where was my money? I told him I had no money, he had taken all I had; he said he knowed better, and if I did not give it him he would have my life; I told him he might as well take my life as to take what I had to support it, and he called me most infamous names, and took up the bayonet again, and said, if I did not give him my pockets he would kill us instantly, I then put my hand to the head of my bed, and threw my pockets to him, I having been ill, there was no money in my pocket but a single shilling, which had been paid me that evening. He laid hold of my pockets, and shook them, and finding no chink of money in them he flung them in my face, then he took with the bayonet and put the bed cloaths over my face, and placed it in the same place as before; the other man then went to search the places about, he went to the foot of the bed and examined one chest where my clothes lay, and found nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he searched that chest? - Because I heard it open, for the room is so small that there is scarce room for the two chests, bedstead, and three or four chairs to stand. Then the other man examined the other, and there after he searched the chest, I heard the money gingle, and I heard the watch chain rattle in his hand; then I heard him walk towards the door. Dempsey asked him don't you mean to pack up? He made answer and says, no, d-mn it, it would be the way to blow the gaff. During the time of their speaking them words, the other man spoke, I heard the voice of another stranger, with a very distinct found, and he spoke twice in the irish language, and desired them to make haste.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the Irish? - The speech of the country. I was born in Ireland, but bred in England. Then they went down stairs, then Dempsey returned up again, and took the bed clothes off my face with the point of the bayonet, and told me in case I made any alarm or the least resistance, he would leave them in the house that would finish us. On that they went down stairs into the chamber, and stopped for about five minutes; from that they went down into the lower room, and might stop near ten minutes longer there, and I heard them go out of the street door, and the door was shut on the latch; during the time that they stopped in the house, I used every endeavour in my power without speaking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160046"/>to awake my husband, but it was all useless, I could not awake him; when I heard them go out of the street door, I screamed and made a great outcry to my husband, and acquainted him with our loss; I was a long time before I could make him sensible of what had happened; and when he became sensible, he was like a man almost distracted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober when he went to bed that night? - I cannot say that he was sober; he had been out a good part of the afternoon. Then he sat in the bed, and never got out of bed till such times as he heard the watchman cry two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other man? Did you know him? Did you ever see him before? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no cap over his face? - Yes, he had; they had both caps. I have known Dempsey some years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cap off his face any part of the time that he was in the room? - No, not that I saw.</p>

            Then you did not see his face any part of the time? - I could not see his face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mrs. Luddy, I think you have the most accurate recollection of any woman I know; you have given us a very particular account of the manner in which this past. Did I hear you right that as soon as you saw the persons coming into the room, you could not speak? - I was shocked at that instant.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, I observe, that from that time you have given a very accurate account; I observe you say Mr. Dempsey very glibly, you never hesitate; you was examined twice before the magistrate? - Four times I was.</p>

               <p>Q. The first time did not you say it was a person taller than Dempsey? - No. At the first examination Mr. Staples spoke in a very gruff manner, and asked me the reason why I could not stand up? I was very ill; they asked me what I thought of the prisoner, if I thought the prisoner was concerned? I told him that he was the man that held the bayonet to me, while I lay in bed. I said in my fright, as I lay in bed, they appeared to be taller than Dempsey, and he was a very stout man.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not you, at the first examination, say that they both appeared taller than Dempsey? - I said, that the man, as I lay in bed, appeared so, but his voice corresponded. I swear to his voice, and his back.</p>

            You know he put the clothes over your face, and he fastened it with his bayonet, and he was then afterwards so kind to release you, and to take the clothes off your face? - When he went he took the bayonet with him; if I had had courage enough I might have stripped the clothes off my face, but the fear of my life prevented me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have told us that after your face was covered, that Dempsey went and rifled the box for money; where in point of fact there was no money; but the other man went and took the money? - No, it was the other man that rifled the chest.</p>

            How often do you think these threats were repeated to you? - Almost as often as he could speak, his tongue had scarce any intermission.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet your husband lay snug in bed all the while? - When he has a drop of liquor in his head he is so stupified that you may take him where you please; whenever he is in liquor if he goes to sleep he never moves till he has had his sleep out; that is his disposition. It is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160047"/>shame that I should expose my husband's failings in an open court, but the occasion requires it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your second examination how came you to say that it was a man about the size of John Dempsey that came in? - If the clerk took down the wrong examination I cannot help it.</p>
               <p>Q. He read it over to you, and you swear to it, and signed it? - I signed it before it was read over to me; I signed it before I was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, woman, that you signed it before you was sworn? - It was read to me before I was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not read to you after you was sworn? - Yes, I had been sworn to answer true answers.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your husband use some particular words, that I should like to have explained. What is the meaning of blowing the gaff? - The meaning I take it to be, that if they took our clothes it would be the means of finding them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have heard the meaning of blood money too? - I don't know; I heard say, when Mr. Macarthy prosecuted a person, that he would not have the blood money, he would have a Tyburn ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the meaning of blowing the gaff? - In the neighbourhood where I live, I often hear the girls say that, it will blow the gaff.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Michael Connell? - Not perfectly well, I have not seen him above half a dozen times in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, had you never such conversation with him as this, if you will say that the prisoner and Macarthy passed by my door between eleven and twelve it would be a good thing for me, and I will give you a couple of guineas? - I never did.</p>

               <p>I am acquainted with both the prosecutor and prisoner; I have been acquainted with Luddy about five years, and Dempsey about the same time; we are fellow militia men together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the evening when this house breaking was said to be committed? - Yes; I was in company with Luddy that evening till about half past eight; he came to where I was at work, about five o'clock, he seemed to be down much at the heart, which I was very sorry for; John, says I, what is the matter? come and let us have some beer; says I, I will treat you with part of a pot: with that we called for a pot, and before the pot was half drank, he called me out, and said he must set off now: says I, where? Says he, on board a ship; says he, I must be off, for my wife has made away with the creditors money that I had, and I must be off; come to Black Wall and get a ship for me, and you will have crimpage money for me; he puts his hand into his breeches pocket and pulls out a few shillings and four half crowns, and one of the half crowns was marked the same as this. (Pulls one out of his pocket.) Then I advised him that he had volunteered once before on board the Tender, so I advised him to go into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160049"/>the country, as the harvest was coming on; and he asked me if I would go with him; I told him I would not go with him; but I advised him to go, and let his wife set off about her business. Then we parted about half past eight or it might be near nine; and then the watchman came to me; when he parted with me he agreed not to go to sea; then he asked me if I could get him the loan of two or three guineas from one of my lodgers, to buy two or three vats of coal; so that the coal merchant should not know that he was out of stock; then we parted; and he came to me before the watchman went two o'clock; the watchman was going about, but he did not cry the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any more questions before the second time? - I asked him whether he did not over hawl to see whether his wife had not some money hid in the house? He said he had not a copper but what he shewed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to you after the robbery, what did he complain of then? - He complained that he had lost all his things; I thought then it was his clothes; he declared then he had not a halfpenny worth in the world, but what he had been robbed of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention to you at that time what he had been robbed of? - No, he did not; I thought it must be his clothes, because he had told me that he had but these four half crowns and a few shillings to pay his creditors, and he took an unlawful oath about it. I went with him about, thinking I might see some people in the night houses with a bundle; we called at two or three, and we drank in each house, and he paid for what we had, except in one house, in which I paid for a pint of two-penny; we went to one house two or three times, because we could not meet with houses as often as he wanted to drink, then going with him about and finding nothing, I goes on board a ship to work that day, and the first thing I heard, was, of these people being taken, and Luddy was at work with me on the Monday following, on board the same ship; Monday afterwards we were at very dusty work, and wanted some drink, and we were short of money most of us, and he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a handful of money, and said that he would lend money to any one that wanted it, and I saw that half crown again in his hand that I saw the Friday before. I was his bosom friend, nor would I have spoken this, if he was not going to take away these persons lives. I said to him, in ShadwellDock, John, you know what I know of you, and you must not go to take away their lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of hearing that these people were going to be committed for an offence that would affect their lives, go and declare this story? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to Luddy to his house, after he told you that he had been robbed? - I did; and his wife was obliged to be called three times before she waked; at the third time he says, why don't you awake and tell Mr. Drew what happened to you? which the woman did not tell me any thing about, and I went down into their chamber, and I saw two heaps, about six or seven penny worth of halfpence laying, and I said, why, John, they did not take all from you: Says he that is the money that I put there last night. But I declare to you that a cat could not have come in at the window, without disturbing these halfpence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys. The money that was paid at the public house, how was it paid? - He had six-pence in silver, and the rest in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first heard of his being robbed of seventeen guineas and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160050"/>forty shillings? - I heard of it when he made a charge of it, at the second hearing before the justice.</p>

            Was not you there on the first hearing when the charge was made? - I may go up there, but not on behalf of either of these.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first hear of it? - A couple of days before he had the last hearing. I think worse of him than I do of the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>I live in Rosemary-lane; I am acquainted with the prosecutors, Mr. Luddy and Mrs. Luddy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Luddy make any application to you, or say any thing relating to this business? - Yes; it was the day that she came to serve me with a summons to attend at the justice Staple's office; she told me she would be obliged to me if I would attend there the next day at twelve o'clock; I went to the office, and in going to the office, I met her in the way, she over took me, and called to me, and asked me what I was going to swear? I told her that all that I had to say was, that I saw these two persons going to their lodgings between nine and ten o'clock at night, to the best of my knowledge, it was the same night that this matter happened; she told me, arrah, if you swear that you will do me over; swear that you saw them both going by my door between eleven and twelve o'clock, and I will handsomely reward you as far as two guineas; I turned about and had a mind to have hit her a slap of the mouth, and told her I would not do any such a thing for the world.</p>

On the 29th of last May, between the hours of five and six in the afternoon, as I was driving my stage between Stanmore and Edgeware, I saw a little way before me two or three teams, the driver of the first team had got hold of one horse, whether it was the foremost or not I cannot say, he had got hold of the halter, and he got pulling it in, beating it about the head, that is all that I saw.</p>

I am quite sure it was the prisoner that took my hat off.</p>

I desired my wife who was with me to walk on, and I ran to the boy, and asked him what was the matter? he told me that that person had robbed him of his hat, and I ran after him, and took him, I searched him and found no hat; as I was taking him to the watch-house he wanted sadly to stop, or go down a turning that he thought; he could find the hat, if I would let him go down.</p>

I told him I had bought some flour and it was not come home, and I wanted to set my spunge for bread; he said, he had got a little by him, and if it would be of any service to me I was welcome to it; I said, I did not want but little, he asked me to lend him a basket, and I lent him the basket to bring me the flour; this was between seven and eight o'clock I believe.</p>

               <p>Adams. Mr. Marsh desired me to give him an order when he came again, for some cut glass and cut falts, whereby he should be able to detect the prisoner, but he absconded before he brought these, because when he came the last time there was a man in the shop who knew him.</p>

               <p>Marsh. I believe it is my property, but I cannot swear to them, he told me that he stole them from me, and sold them to Mrs. Fleming and received the money.</p>

When they came in, Hatch and I went from the house with Johnson, we went off towards them, immediately as they came up to the stable door, Sample went between the two horses and made his escape, I left Hatch with Wood and pursued him with Johnson into Goudge street, from that into John street, and from that into Pitt street, I called out stop thief! and he was stopped there, I went immediately and laid hold of him, I took him to a public house and there I was informed that he had thrown something down an area, I found about him two guineas, nine half crowns, thirteen shillings and eight six-pences, and a remarkable Queen Ann's sarthin, and some other halfpence; I then went where I was informed he had thrown something down an area in Pitt-street, by the place where he was stopped at, I asked whether any thing had been thrown down there? they told me yes, there was two watches the servant had picked them up; the servant was bound before the magistrate but we could not get her forward, I went into the area myself, and there I saw some pieces of glass myself of watches, which I picked up. They were both secured till Monday morning when they were taken before the magistrate, Sample was dressed in black as he is now, and Wood had on a sort of a clergyman's grey, a sort of a Mixture, I brought them to Bow-street on the Monday, and there were informations there concerning several robberies.</p>

               <p>On the 5th of last July, I was coming to town from Pinner, a little before nine o'clock, just as I entered <placeName id="t17940716-39-crimeloc199">Harrow Hill-common</placeName>

There was a lady in the chaise along with me; I gave him about ten shillings; give me your watch, he says; I told him I had never a watch; he says, d-mn you, I know you have a watch, or some thing to that purpose, make haste and give it me, or else I will blow your brains out. I pulled my watch out and gave it, it was a silver watch with a steel chain, two gold seals, one with the impression of a head, and the other my own name in a cypher. After I had given my watch they turned up the hill, and went back again the way they came; they had both dark handkerchiefs over their faces, and both dressed in dark clothes, both in black, I took them to be. I see my watch again at Bow-street, on the Thursday after I was robbed.</p>

The watch was found by the officer in Tottenham-court road, when the prisoners were taken in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe how they were mounted? - I could not from the situation I was in; my attention was to see each pistol, whether they were going to fire or not, to avoid it; that on the left hand had no handkerchief over his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160067"/>face; I did look at him, but I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say positively that either of them is not the person? - I cannot say positively that they are not.</p>

I said, I don't know, I will step and ask my master, who was in the yard at the back of the shop. I took them into my hand and went backward; my master said, they are not stolen goods, are they John? I said, I think not, because I know the person; I was absent about two or three moments, the prisoner followed me backwards; I cannot say that he was out of my sight; my master and he agreed for the goods.

I had only gone into the other room with the door open, he was in view at that time; he went out, by then he had shut the door, Mr. Hillier came down, he said, he knew no such person as Mr. Orchard, I had had a sharper with me; Mr. Hillier opened the door of the closet, he did not perceive he had lost any thing; but I looked after him, I suppose, in the space of two or three minutes, and I missed a gravy spoon, three table spoons, and a small pepper castor.

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hillier; I saw the prisoner the 7th of June, on a Saturday; last month, about half past seven in the morning; he knocked with a loud knock at the door; I went immediately and opened the door; he asked me if Mr. Hillier was at home? I answered him, he was not in the way; I went immediately into the parlour and called my mistress, and my mistress came out; and he asked her if Mr. Hillier was at home? She said he was not stirring; she asked what it was o'clock? I looked and told her that it was half past seven; she asked him into the parlour, and said she would call him. I went immediately down into the kitchen, I heard my mistress go up stairs, she returned down in about two minutes; I was not in the parlour to hear what past; he went out by himself, I did not let him out, I was below stairs;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160070"/>I put the spoons in the ever night, between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock, they were all in a closet in the parlour, in a knife case; I was in the parlour five minutes after this person went out of the house, when they were missing; I was not certain of the pepper castor being in over night, I did not put that in, but the other things I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any spoons left behind? - One table spoon. There was no person in the house but the prisoner at the bar, from the time that I put them in the closet till I missed them. They have never been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray how do you know my person? - I took particular notice of him, he was not dressed as he is now, he had his hair tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Was my hair powdered? - A little powder in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Hillier, I think, in her evidence, said, that my hair was dressed? - It was dressed and powdered; I knew his person the moment I saw him, on the 24th, at the New Prison. My master went to the New Prison, and he came back again, and I went back with him to know if I knew him; he was shewn me in a little room, just going into the prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Hillier, and Mr. Roberts, the keeper of the New Prison, are acquainted.</p>
               <p>Court to Witness. Had you any doubt about his person at that time? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you equally sure now? - I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the spoons that are missing? - I don't know the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Hillier. Did you see this man before you have seen him now? - I see him in New Prison-yard; I see his back, and Mr. Roberts called him; and he answered with an oath, that he was coming; and I said, that is the man, I do not desire to see him. I was sure it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Hillier. Did you know the spoons were missing yourself? - Yes, by looking into the cupboard. I have had the fellow gravy spoon weighed, and the fellow of one of the table spoons, and the silversmith told me that the weight of the gravy spoon was better than sixteen shillings, the price of old silver; and the table spoon twelve shillings the single one; and the pepper castor five shillings, I value them altogether at fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Hillier said they were loose in the cupboard, and the servant said they were in a case.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hillier. I did not say they were loose.</p>
               <p>Court to Hillier. Do you know Mr. Orchard? - No, I do not; there is such a person, I believe, in Hatton-garden; but he is no acquaintance of mine at all.</p>

I said, I never knew the min my life before. I found the breeches again, the Wednesday following, they were at a pawnbroker's; I took the prisoner up the Thursday following, just a week after, at the same public house; I found my breeches a fortnight after; I took the prisoner before I found the breeches.</p>

On the 10th of this month, about ten minutes after five, I went into my master's field, and the men could not go to work for want of two barrows that were stole; in about five minutes after a man came down, and told me that the barrows, and the man that took them, were in the watch-house; one of the barrows belonged to Mr. Samuel Scott, and one to my employer, but they were both in my master's use; I see them in the watch-house, and I have seen them since; they are not brought here. I know my master's barrow very well, by one of the thimbles that the wheel goes in, being rivetted down; the middle of the barrow and wheel was pitched.</p>
               <p>Q. How many barrows has your master got? - About eight or nine in use.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labouring man, sometimes I work in the brickfields; I was standing talking at an acquaintance's door, and this man was coming out of my master's field with two barrows, and I stopped him; the field comes into a street; he came into the street with it, it was between ten and eleven at night, and I sent for a light, and while I was looking at the marks of the barrows, he ran away, and I ran after him, and catched him; I asked him where he had brought them from? he said, he brought them from Islington; I said, that was an odd thing to come that way from Islington.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the road from Islington? - No. I carried him to the watch-house; I never see the man before in my life that I know of; the wheel barrows were taken to the watch-house, I see the same wheel barrows there the next morning and the prisoner, I am not a labour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160074"/>er to Mr. Timmings; I don't know to whom the barrow belongs. The next morning I see Mark and Baker at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Mark or Baker claim Mr. Timmings's wheelbarrow? - Yes, they did in the hearing of the prisoner; there were two there the next morning, and those were the two that I took from the prisoner; he had got them one on the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked the other side of the water at brick making, and they were standing still for water, and I came over this side of the water to see some of my acquaintances, and I had been higher up the road, and had stopped there the evening a drinking; returning home at night I met a man that stopped me and asked me if I would drink, and he asked me whether I had a mind to earn a shilling? if I had there was a couple of barrows that he wanted to be wheeled round to the King's Head, in Kingstand-road, and she told me he should be round there as soon as I was, and if I was not, he would wait for me; and I stopped at my wife's father's, and dallied a little time drinking with him; after that I went into the field and saw two barrows, and took them out to wheel them into the road, and I was stopped. The man who asked me was a mere stranger to me, but he appeared as if he worked in the field. My relations are all gone down into Kent.</p>

               <p>I am an excise officer, I was so on the 11st of February, 1792. On that day between the hours of eleven and twelve in the forenoon, I was going along Old-street and I met a cart, and found John Ekars and William-Brown in the cart, I knew William Brown six years before, I surveyed poplar three years close by his house; I have been in a public house with him twenty different times, the Green Dragon; I knew him very well, the cart drove on as far as the corner of Golden-lane; Ekars got out of the cart, and when he got out of the cart I had an opportunity of passing by to see what was in the cart, I saw several bags, four or five, it seemed to me to be tobacco, and there were five or six half anchors in the cart, when I passed by Ekars gave Brown the whip and said drive on gently, I will go before and see that it is clear, they drove about twenty or thirty doors further in the street, to the door of

I turns round the cart and looks in and see some bags and a large W marked on most of the anchors, he was stooping down tumbling the half anchors towards Wiseman's door; I put my hand into one of the bags, and my hand came out all rappee snuff, this I did while Brown was stooping down, he did not perceive me, and at the same time I secured the rein of the horse and I said to Brown, pray, sir, what have you got in the cart? he immediately looks about at me and said, d-mn your eyes what is that to you? then he took the whip up and first of all he began to slog the horse to get off, it was a very good horse, the horse sprung but I had hold of the rein, and then he began to slog me with the thong of the whip, every stroke brought the skin off; my hat dropped off, I lost my hat, never saw it after, the mob took it away; I told him the consequence of obstructing me in my duty, and I told him what he had got in his cart, and that he had got smuggled goods, I knew him to be a smuggler for a great many years; on my telling him that, he kept on slogging me the more, then the horse, then me, till we got opposite the public house, when the horse sprung very violently against the windows and knocked in four or five panes of glass with the shafts, when he sees that, he turns the butt end of his whip and steps out to the shaft and struck me several times on the head, and gave me one blow which cut me two inches along here; the publican, Nixon, just then came to the door and I begged him to assist me, that I was an officer, and I found the blood come all over me and blinded me, in the contest I got the whip from him into my hand, with my pulling it the covering of the butt end rather slipped, and I saw the lead cast about the end of the whip some inches in length; Mr. Nickson unclinched my hands at last, being afraid I should be killed, and took me into the house, and the horse and cart drove away; Mr. Nickson laid hold of me and laid hold of Ekars, and said, I will be paid for the damage done, before I let any of you go; Ekars said, I will call another time, and pay for the windows, let me go, and he went away over a wall into a back alley.</p>
               <p>Q. The indictment was not preferred till last May? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any search after him from the time that you received she injury? - I have a dozen times, both with myself and the runners; the first time we went of a Sunday morning, and we watched about to see if we could see any thing of him, and we went to Brown's house, and the people knew me. In short we never could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you confined after this affair? - I was very ill, I could not do my duty for sometime; and there are the clothes I had on, that are nothing but blood all over; and sometimes I am affected now with the change of weather, the bone of my head is hurted as well as the slesh.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You say you knew Brown long? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is not likely you will be mistaken in him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And, I think, you never saw him from that time till this last fortnight? - Yes, I saw him going into Mr. Nelson's, in Whitechapel, but I had not the warrant with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him soon after this transaction? - No, not for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when you saw him first after this happened? - In Whitechapel, about half a year afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him without knowing him of course? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not have seen him and been with him, and yet not know him, since that time? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of all this business, speak to him by his name? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160076"/>am not sure; I said, I know you very well, and you will suffer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Ekars, the other man, very well? - Yes, and I knew Brown very well, and knew him tried for the same offence once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, as you surveyed so long where he lived, he knew you? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your apprehension, did not Brown know you? - I cannot say that. He knows I very near catched him with four or five and thirty bags of tobacco, and he turned about and carried the goods into the country again.</p>
               <p>Q. Though they knew you was an excise officer, yet Ekars said he would go and see that it was all clear before he would take it out? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at twelve o'clock in the day, was there any body there that day? - Yes, a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you have got some of these people here? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never was sitting down drinking with him at any public house? - Never, from that time to this; I have never been in a house with him since the transaction; I went into a house where Ekars sat drinking, but as soon as I went in he went out, but Brown was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Nuby? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting Nuby on this business? - Yes, at the Duke of Clarence's, Newport-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with him? - One Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no one else? - Nobody that I knew, nobody that had any thing to say about this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you remember saying concerning these people, that you knew one to be Ekars, but the other you could not be sure to? - I never said any such thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. It is unnecessary to ask you whether Brown was in company at that time? - He was not, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. How you might be quarters they sent for me in order business by a petition.</p>
               <p>Court. Nuby came to you with some propositions on the part of Brown and Ekars? - Yes, and I told him that I could not say any thing to it, the board of Excise had got it in their hands, and whatever they mean to do I was agreeable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Look at this petition? - This is the first petition of Ekars and Brown. (The petition read.)</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it perfectly understood by Brown that you was an officer of the Excise before any scuftle took place? - I told him at the first that I was an Excise officer, and would shew him my commission, I said that immediately as I laid hold of the horse's head, before any blow was given.</p>

            Did you tell him on whose account you applied? - I applied on Ekars account only; I did not apply for Brown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What business of life are you in? - I am a farmer at Poplar.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the neighbourhood in which Brown lives? - Yes, he lives close by me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Brown? - Sixteen or eighteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him about February 1792? - I have known him ever since; I don't know particularly the time.</p>
               <p>Q. From February 1792, how long was he absent from his home? - I believe I can tell by the account, because his horse grasses with me; I never knew him leave his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he leave his house about February 1792? - He might be away a week or more; or he might be at home a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was backward and forward the same as usual from February 1792, to March, April, and May, in the same year? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he went in September 1792? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any petition that Brown sent to the commissioners of excise? - Ekars and Brown were together, I told him about being along with Norman; and Ekars said, what can we do? I said, the only thing that you can do, will be to try a petition; you had better have the opinion of your attorney on the business, and I dare say, Norman has no objection to settle it; and I said, that I dare say four or five guineas would make him easy; I said, you had better pay him that then go to law, and into extremities of that sort. They seemed rather to agree, as Norman said he would not be ill natured.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time when you saw Norman at the Duke of Clarence, did Norman and you go into the house together? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160080"/>No, I believe I was in before him, and he came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you appointed to meet there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into the house, he and you fell into conversation? - Not immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you engaged before he fell into conversation with you? - We had some rum and water, and he had to go away to some brick fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other person? - One Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you think Brown was at that time? - Brown was sitting in the tap room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Norman came into the room where you was, and he did not stay very long? - He staid a good while; Brown came into the parlour and came in at the door, and had a pint of beer; he was desired to withdraw, and he did withdraw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Norman and he speak? - No, I don't know that they spoke at all.</p>

            When was this? - I cannot tell the day, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - A good while ago; I think it was some time last summer; I cannot particularly say; we met twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Brown did not meet him twice? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you mean merely to speak as to guess, that Norman might see Brown? - Certainly, I cannot swear that he did see him, but he was as plain to him as you are to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Norman. How came Ekars not be taken into custody before he died? - The runners were after him, but we could never take him. When I first went into the public house I went into the parlour, the door was shut fast, and me and another were sitting drinking of a pot of beer. After that Mr. Nuby came in, but Mr. Brown was not there indeed, he might be in she tap room, I did not go through the tap room; but on my oath he was not in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding replied on the part of the prosecution.</p>

How did you lose it? - I was going down Dean-street, St. Ann's, Soho, with three parcels, two under my arm and one in my pocket; it was about one o'clock in the day; as I was coming within a few doors of Compton-street I found an attempt at the parcel in my pocket, it was tried to be taken out; I found three men about me,

               <p>I know the timber to be Mr. Lackington's property.</p>
               <p>Jacobs. These are the two pieces of Wood he left with Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Rolfe. I see them at Mr. Davis's about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; they are part of the building that has been taken down to make an improvement in Mr. Lackington's shop in Finsbury-place; here are the notches in the Timber which sits with some in the yard, where it has been cut off, I compared it at the time we took it back; the prisoner worked for me at Mr. Lackington's, I am a builder.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those two blocks? - They were worth about four shillings and six-pence in their present state; he had not been at work for me more than a fortnight or three weeks.</p>

            When had you last seen your mo ney? - When I gave the half crown t the press gang man, not five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that accompanied you from the rendezvous house? - He was a seaman, he belonged to the press gang. I met, the man the next morning about six o'clock, he asked me how I come on the last night? I said, I lost my money; he said, if that be the case I will bring you to the same house where you was, and he did, and nobody would give an answer, in the mean time one George Forrester came up, and he asked me what was the matter, what I wanted with the house? I told him I was robbed the night before of my money, and Forrester knocked, and he got no answer; then the officer got in at the window, and he opened the door, then we came in, and she was sitting on the floor without her cap, but all her clothes on; and the officer said, I must over haul I your pockets, and he did, and he could find no more than a guinea and a half in gold, and half a guinea in silver, making altogether two guineas; and then he asked her for the rest of my money; she said, that the man that brought me in that night had got two guineas of it; well, says he, that is not all, where is the rest? and she said, I gave it to another woman, and she named her, but I don't know her name, Mr. Forreiter he knows her, and he said, where is that woman? and Mr. Forrester sent out to look for the woman and the neighbours said that she had gone to Portsmouth that same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the guinea and a half that this woman had in her pocket? - She told Mr. Forrester that the took it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive her put her hand into your pocket and take the money from you? - No, I did not, if I had done that she should not have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what pocket was your money? - In my right pocket and she was sitting on my left knee. she left me three or four times, sometimes she sat on my right knee, and sometimes she sat on my left knee.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Could you swear to my taking your money? you sat along side of me on the bed and you asked me for some salmon? and you asked me if I would have any thing to drink, and you said what will you drink? and I said, if I drink any thing it shall be a drop of porter. There was another woman in the room, and I left them together while I went for the salmon.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you quitted the house did you miss your money? - I missed it before ever I started on my legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else was in the house besides her and the man? - Nobody but us three. I was there half an hour or three quarters, no more altogether.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FORRESTER sworn.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday the 9th, as I was coming up Gravel-lane, between six and seven in the morning, I saw this man and one of the press gang that he mentions, standing opposite a window of the prisoner's lodging room.</p>
               <p>Court to Swan. Had you ever been there before? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Forrester. This man, the prosecutor, did not know me, but the press gang man did, and he said to him, here is an officer, you give charge to search the house; I went up to the room, and I knocked, and could not get in, and we got in by the window first, and then opened the door; and we found the prisoner in the house, with all her clothes on, but without a cap; this man that was along with him, says, that is the woman; pointing to her; accordingly I says to her, what have you done with this man's money? she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160087"/>said, she knew nothing at all about it. I searched her; in one pocket I found about half a crowns worth of halfpence, and in the next pocket I found a guinea and a half, and eight shillings in silver; she did then begin to cry, and I asked her what became of the rest? and she said, that the other woman that was along with her, told her that the press gang chap, had two guineas of the money, and the remains of it

Says he, I called to settle a little bill with you; Says I, I beg your pardon, I have not the pleasure to know you; says he, my name is Bromley; what I says I, captain Bromley, of Brompton; he says, the same. He lays me down the note, and I gave him the change; says he, I am coming to live at Union-row, I will be glad if you will call to-morrow for some orders for bread and flour; and that was all that passed, till I came to Bow-street.

I had been abroad for sometime; I returned on the 3d of June; I looked for my clothes when I came home, and I missed them; I missed all the articles in the indictment, and more. I left the house last November; she was the only servant left in the house; there was the counting house kept there, to which the clerks had access; one of the clerks resided in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered any of this property? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you impute it to the prisoner? - About ten days after my return, I came home one night, and found her in liquor, I was obliged, with the assistance of the other gentleman, to carry her to bed by force, and locked the door that she could not get out; before I delivered her in the morning, I looked through my drawers and other places in the house, one drawer in particular, which I knew to be full of table linen when I went away; the linen was taken out, and a large blanket was substituted in the place of the several things, that had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160089"/>taken out, and slightly covered over with table linen, which was sufficient to confirm my suspicions; I went immediately to Guildhall, and got an officer, and charged him with the prisoner. It appeared that she had got false keys by the blacksmith's bill that was found upon her, with some duplicates to a considerable amount.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any injury done at all to these drawers? - Some of them I cannot use again with the same keys as formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do those duplicates answer to any of these things in the indictment? - The indictment was drawn from these duplicates, and a table cloth that was taken from her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been with you before you went abroad? - Four or five months. I got a character from a near relation of her's; and she appears to have began this practice very few days after she came into my service.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I want to know, as you are a single man, whether this woman was not in the habit of advancing money for the things that were used in the house? have you never, for instance, paid her money that she had before advanced; as when you have ordered a dinner for your friends, she may have had some things of your green grocer, which she paid, and you paid for afterwards? - No, I don't know any such thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the clerk must pull to open the shop door? - They must; the pully from the counting house draws the lock of the door.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand that there was three or four pounds due to her; has she demanded that sum or not? - She has not; she asked for money after I did come home, and I gave her a guinea.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp objected to the indictment saying, St. John's, at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Witness. They called for a jug of ale; I asked if they chose some biscuits? they said, yes, bring three. In consequence I brought three up. When they first came into the room, Pritchard came down stairs, there was a gentleman and three ladies in the room, but they quitted the room half an hour before Pritchard came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the gentleman and three ladies went to? - No, I never saw them afterwards. Pritchard met me at the bottom of the stairs, and said, you are wanted up stairs, waiter; they want some more ale; with that I went up; they found fault with the ale, and desired to have some milder if there was any; and I brought them up a jug of milder.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person who asked for the milder? - I believe it was Mr. Smith, but I don't know exactly recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in the room when you went up in consequence of Pritchard's direction? - There were no others in the room then, then these two; the man who is absent, and Mr. Smith. When I brought up the milder ale, Mr. Smith he did not find it better than the last; but Pritchard he tasted it and thought it was very good. After that I went down stairs and walked about the garden, and I came up again about some things that were to be carried down, and I found that one of them was absent from the room</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160092"/>Q. Who were the two that you found in the room then? - Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Smith. I then went down stairs to see if I could find him in the garden, because not knowing their faces, I thought they wanted to cheat me out of my reckoning; I went up stairs looked into the room again, and still he was not there; I believe then Pritchard went down to the bar and had a glass of hollands; Smith remained in the room, but the third person was still missing; I then went out of the room again, and some notion ran into my head that I must look into this passage door, that used to be locked and shut, which leads to all the bed rooms, that used to be kept locked on Sunday and every busy day likewife, except when persons went up for corn; it certainly was locked at this time, because I had been up to get into my own room, but I could not get in; I am now speaking of the door through which the person got that took the money.</p>

            Is that door level with the tap room? - No, not quite; it does not open into the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it open on the stair case? - No, it is on further in the passage, about four feet from the tap room door. I went to this door to see if it was opened, and found a rebound against me inside twice or three times; in consequence of that I called who is there? two or three times; nobody answered, but on that Mr. Pritchard and Smith went down stairs out of the room, and immediately the man that I missed out of the company of Pritchard and Smith, came out of that passage door, and went by me and I asked him what he wanted there? he said he thought it was a place of convenience; and he went by me; I said to them, gentlemen, you have not paid your reckoning; and this man ran away, and I ran after him; at last a suspicion arose in my breast, and I hallooed out stop thief! and ran after them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they go down stairs, walk or run? - I could not perceive how they all went; the last man ran down very fast, faster than I could follow him. I ran after them all the way up the lane, and I saw Smith and Pritchard running before, and this third man running as hard as he could, with his hands in his coat pocket; then I kept following them till they got into the field, I ran as hard as I could, hallooing out stop thief! but the third man in company he separated from them in the first field or second. However, I lost sight of him there; he got clear off, and I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. He having got off, did you pursue the other two? - I did; I lost sight of them as they got into the lane, going to Clapton-road, and I hallooed out stop thief! some gentlemen asked me if I was in earnest? I told them, I was; I lost sight of them for about two or three minutes; the people kept running with me, some before and some behind, the people who were raised by my alarm of stop thief! at last they got across Clapton-road; from that time to when I saw the first man Prichard taken, it was not more than five minutes; he was taken in an oat field, across the Clapton-road; I was called over into the oat field to look at him. Smith was taken, I am not certain where, but I found him in custody in the oat field.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was pursuing these people, did you perceive any thing particular? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing afterwards? - Not I, I did not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to the third man, did you perceive him do any thing as you was pursuing? - I did; I observed him put his hand into his pocket and pull it out again, and appeared to throw away some thing, but I could not perceive what that was, in the lane, about twenty five yards from our house, before he had separated<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160093"/>from the other two, before he got to the first field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards search near the spot where you observed this man throw something away? - I did not; it was quite dark; I returned home again.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any persons running up this lane which led to the first field, besides yourself? - There were many pursuing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Pritchard it was that came down to ask for some milder ale; and when it was taken up he said it was as good as he would have it; you went then down into the garden, to walk about, when you came up Pritchard went down the second time, and during the time that you was down stairs it was that you found the door in the situation that you described? - No, it was when he came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. The ladies that were in the room, two, went off by themselves, and one was left with the gentleman; you had not the curiosity to see how the door was left at that time? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that escaped you have not heard of since? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. He is the man that you described as throwing away something? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. These men you never see inside of the door? - Never.</p>

               <p>I am sole master of the Robin Hood. On Sunday the 6th of July, I lost thirty pounds sixteen shillings, in gold and silver, and halfpence; eighteen guineas and a half in a silk purse, in gold; the silver was in a canvas bag, and fifteen shillings of halfpence, tied up in five shilling parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house was this money kept in? - In my own bed room, in the top drawer of a chest of drawers. I never see the prisoners in the house during the time they were drinking; I never saw them till they were taken and brought into the house.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you get to this bed room? - By a passage, a room door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that passage room door from the door of the long tea room? - About four or five yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your bed room immediately inside of that door? - It is the next room on the left hand side going in, and my servant's is on the right hand side; the door of my room was left locked, I locked it myself.</p>

            How lately had you been there before you was alarmed of having lost your money? - Some four or five hours. My direction is that the passage door should be double locked if any of my servants go there; I locked it when I went to my bed room four or five hours before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. After these men were brought to your house after this robbery, were there any keys found or produced to you by any body? - Not that night, but there was the next morning, some pick lock keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not try these pick lock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160094"/>keys to the passage door and bed room door? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able by these pick lock keys to open these two doors? - I was able both to lock and unlock.</p>

After pausing about five minutes I went into the field myself, and I saw a remarkable track, not made by a person's walking, but as if a person had been crawling; when I got into that track I began to be alarmed; I went back again, in coming out of this track there I perceived Smith crouching in the hedge with his hands and feet; I then immediately pursued him and gave the alarm; he recovered himself and ran across a garden ground as fast as ever he could, and went through another hedge; he then was pursued there, and he bolts back again, and a man, by my giving the alarm, pursued him with me, and we got hold of him, we had not taken him four minutes, and were leading him back, when the waiter came up and says, this is one, and I will swear to you, you had a watch; yes, says Smith, and I have lost it.

               <p>Prisoner Pritchard. Sunday evening, about four o'clock, I went from home, and went out with an intent to get a few gooseberries for my children, at Hackney, at my aunt's, and I was there rather too soon, and I thought I would take a walk a little further; I went as far as Lee Bridge, I met with this gentleman that is here; says he, will you have a drop of ale, and we walked down towards this house, by the river side, and we met another man; he comes up, and he says, gentlemen, how do you do? we went into a house near this house where the gentleman says the robbery was done, and we had a glass of peppermint a piece, as near as I can recollect; afterwards we came out, and says they, will you take a drop of ale together? says I, I want to get home; and says the man, this is as near a way for you to go as any, Mr. Smith said, no, and we went up to the Robin Hood, and we had a pot of ale; says he, where shall we sit? and we went up stairs; after drinking of this pot of ale, we did not drink it all out, somebody found fault with it, and said it was rather too stale; I went down and ordered a jug that was milder; I went up stairs, and the waiter went up with a jug that was milder; Mr. Smith said, he did not think that was better then the last; and I told him that I thought it was as good as ever I talled, to my opinion. I went down stairs and got a glass of hollands at the bar, and changed six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160099"/>pence for it, and paid for it; after that I was looking at my halfpence, long before I went out of the house; I went out of the house, going up this lane, that was nearest to my aunt's; I had not been out of the house above a minute or two before I heard the cry of stop thief! I was alarmed at hearing the cry, I set out a run, and a great many others set out a run, and I ran across two fields or three; in running across they said, there he goes, there he goes; and I runs across and runs into this hedge; the gentleman that was there to take me, says, don't run so fast; I says, I am no thief, I keep as good a house over my head as you. I stopped till a good many people came up; and the waiter and two or three more takes me and hauls me along ever so far, and a gentleman, a constable, came and took hold of me; they asked me who I was? I said, I was Mr. Pritchard, at the Three Compasses, in Dog-row, Bethnall-green; they told me I was not the man that kept the Compasses, for the man was a good deal bigger than me; and a gentleman comes up and pulls out a staff within a minute or two, and that gentleman laid hold of me, and they searched me, and found nothing but fourpence in halfpence, and some few more; I went down to the Robin Hood, and they kept me in the parlour some time; says a gentleman there, you had better take a candle and go up stairs, and see if any thing is lost, and then you will be sure; and the landlord went up stairs, and came down again, and says, secure that man till the waiter comes, for I know nothing at all of him; and when he came down stairs, he said, he had lost thirty pounds or more; and there I was kept till they brought this other gentleman in, I don't know how long after. That is all I have got to say; and I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Smith. On Sunday evening, about six o'clock, I believe it might be, I was coming from Lee bridge road, and met with Mr. Pritchard; I asked him how he did? and he said, he was going down to the river side, in order to get something to drink, and we met with the third man, who accosted us with how do you do, gentlemen? he then said, landlord, I have catched you, now you shall stand treat; seeming to know Mr. Pritchard, as if he had been a customer in his house before; Pritchard then said, he had no objection, and he asked us what we would drink? and we said, we would drink some ale, if he was agreeable. We then proceeded to this house, and there we went in, and had a quart of ale and three biscuits; the quart of ale being drank, the ale, I thought, was rather too stale; I then desired the waiter to bring me a tankard that was rather milder; he then brought a tankard of ale up, and I poured out some part into the glass and tasted it, and told him, I believed it was the same fort as before; in answer, Mr. Pritchard said, it was very good, and rather better than the other. The waiter then left the room, and Mr. Pritchard went down to get a glass of hollands, and then came up stairs; then the waiter returned and came up stairs again, and in a few minutes after he came into the room, the waiter cried out stop thief! with that alarm we ran down stairs, and running down stairs there was a number of people that seemed to be all running in pursuit of the thief, there might be a score, or less, or more, some went one way and some the other; when we got about half a mile from the house, as near as I can guess, somebody comes up and took hold of Mr. Pritchard, who it was I cannot exactly say; Mr. Pritchard was taken back to the

               <p>Q. Was you at Mr. Hamerton's Mills on Wednesday the 25th of June? - I was at Mr. Palmer's, Mr. Killick's foreman, last Wednesday was three weeks, I saw the prisoner and one of the needle makers going across the bridge, over the river of Mr. Palmer's, and we went on till we came to the needle mills.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the needle mills join these mills of Mr. Hamerton's? - Yes, they are within the same roof, Mr. Brightmore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160101"/>and the needle maker asked me to go up into the mills; they said, mother Sole, will you go and see the mills? I said, I did not care if I did, I had never seen them before; then Mr. Brightmore went up first, I next, and the needle maker followed, and the first thing I apprehended was, Brightmore said to the needle maker, why don't you sweep up this stuff, and give it me for my pigs?</p>

            Does he keep pigs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what this stuff was? - It was wheat and grain scattered about the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think there might be? - I cannot say, it laid loose about the floor like sand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it swept up as he desired? - No, they did not touch it, I walked across the room to the window, and kept looking out at the window, and I heard Mr. Brightmore and the needle maker whispering something together, and I turned myself, and looked and see the needle maker and Mr. Brightmore filling two bags with wheat, I could distinguish that, they were taking it out of a little binn, like a cornchandler's binn, and I thought the needle maker seemed a little shy, and Brightmore then said, never mind mother Sole; they tied up the bags, and they went away, Mr. Brightmore took one bag, and the needle maker took the other; this was in the needle maker's part of the premises. Mr. Brightmore went down first with the biggest bag, and I went down next, and the needle maker followed after me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the corn that you saw scattered on the floor? - I left it there; we all three came out together, and we went across the mill fields, towards Mr. Brightmore's home, near Clapton turopike.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Brightmore's home? - I went to my own home; but first I should have told you, going along the mill field, Mr. Brightmore was a good way before us, the needle maker and I were a little behind, the needle maker asked me if I would take his bag a minute?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet any body in the way? - Yes, we met Mr. Hamerton's miller,

               <p>I am the son in-law of the prosecutor, Mr. Hamerton, I have the concern and management of the nil's. On Saturday the 28th of June, when I returned home in the afternoon, our men told me that they had seen some wheat; on looking through a crevice of our room into the needle pointing manufactory, I there discovered a large quantity of unground wheat about the floor. Our granery is above the manufactory, and we have trunks or spouts, that convey the corn through the pin pointing manufactory, entirely inclosed from the top of the cealing to the hot house, where the corn is ground, which keeps them regularly supplied while the mill is going; on further searching the premises of the pin pointing manufactory, on searching these spouts I found there were little square holes made, stopped with a bit of leather, or cork, and immediately under these holes there was a binn, which received the corn when the leather or paper was drawn out; there were two funnels pierced in the way, but there was no binn directly under the other, they must draw it out with something under; then besides these holes there were several holes in the cealing, where they might draw out any quantity they wanted when they chose, they were stopped with little bits of wood or paper, the very least thing in the world would stop it when put in tight. I went to Mr Brightmore's premises with the constable, I was present when the wheat was found, it is of a similar sample with the wheat we have, it is a very high dried wheat, it is not to be bought at the corn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160103"/>market, nor any where else, it is for government service, for the use of the troops abroad, it is kiln dried for to make it keep a long time, I can clearly say to the best of my knowledge that it is Mr. Hamerton's, and it is kiln dried.</p>

               <p>Q. I see there sacks, are you able to speak to any of them? - A little time ago we ground a large quantity of barley for the Stratford distillery, and this is one of the sacks that was delivered with that barley marked

            S. for Stratford still-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any sacks of that sort on the 25th of June? - Yes, we had, and we have now some in the mill, they are worth about two shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this peck of corn? - About two shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted you have no share in this business? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. This wheat you produce is kiln dried, suppose you was to see a sample of any kiln dried wheat from any other manufactory should you know the difference? - I think I should know it from any other manufactory; our positive orders is, to dry it as high as possibly we can, even the East India company don't dry it so high as we do.</p>
               <p>Q. In this manufactory I take it for granted there are a great number of people employed? - Only two lately, Gamble and Low, they are both off.</p>
               <p>Q. Those who had access to this manufactory most probably were persons that played these practices? - I never see any man with them but this prisoner, I have seen him continually with these people.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My friend has been asking you about corn for exportation; is there any other person that has corn of this sort but yourself? - About nine months ago there was an order thrown out to a miller who lives about thirty miles off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel, I had nothing from the mill to the best of my knowledge at all, the sacks that were found, one of the millers left them at my house, when it thundered and lightened, and he asked me to carry them down to the mills when I went to work; he took it to shelter himself. Don't sling the sacks on me because I am not deserving of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

I hired the prisoner at the bar about August last, in the beginning; she had lived in my service twice before; I had missed a variety of silk handkerchiefs and shirts of mine, and a servant of mine that had lived with me a vast number of years, he informed me that he believed the prisoner was the thief; and it was determined that the prisoner should quit my service, in consequence of property that I had missed. On Friday, the 4th of July, I went out in the afternoon, and did not come home very early, it might be between twelve and one o'clock; when I came home I found that she had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160104"/>endeavouring to get away, in my absence; when I came home I found the prisoner up in a room, and I asked her to let me examine her box; this she refused to do; on which I called up one of the other servants, and I asked him to give me the poker into the room; she still persisted, and I broke open the box with the poker; when I had so broke it open, I desired her to let me see what was there; and after she had taken out several things, there were several sheets of paper appeared at the bottom of the box, white fools cap paper, and letter paper; I happened to have a cane in my hand, and I put it down on the paper, and I found it gave way, on which I desired her to take off the paper, which she did, and then I came to a parchment deed, which she had pushed down, round against the sides of the box; I said, I don't believe this is the bottom of the box; on which I put down my hand, and found all these things at the bottom, which I now produce, four silk handkerchiefs, a cotton window curtain, and a linen table cloth; they are my property, the handkerchief was marked W. B. she picked out the B. but it is plain to be seen; the window curtain I know the pattern, I have five or six of them; the table cloth was marked with my name on it, the W is picked out, but it plain to be seen. I called in the watchman, and she was carried to Tothill fields.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. How many curtains had you of that sort? - Seven, I have only three left; we found the fringe of the rest at the prisoner's father's house in Ryegate.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the other servant you spoke of just now, a man servant or a maid servant? - A man-servant, he is not here.</p>

               <p>I was present when the box was broke open; I saw these things taken out of the box, to the best of my belief, they are all my property; as to the curtains I have not the least doubt.</p>

               <p>When the prisoner at the bar was brought to the watch-house, in St. Margaret's Church-yard, about two o'clock Saturday morning, the 5th of this month, by the watchman, attended by Mr. Bryan; Mr. Bryan made a charge of felony against her; at the same time the watchman delivered a key to me; I have not the key now. These things were under lock and key that night, and I went the next morning, unlocked the place, and found this property; I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the watchman; Mr. Bryan called me between the hours of one and two o'clock in the morning, on Saturday the 5th last, I went to him and asked him what was the matter? he said, he had a servant that had robbed him. I went into Mr. Bryan's house, and went up stairs with him, and he shewed me some handkerchiefs, which I believe these are the same, that he said he had taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at that time? - No, she was up stairs above at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you any thing besides? - Not at that present time.</p>

            Did he at any other time? -  Not that night, but he did when the box was opened, and the things were found; that was about eleven o'clock Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know nothing of any other articles till the next morning eleven o'clock? - The over night he locked them up, and gave me the key, and told me there were other things; but I did not see them that night,</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160105"/>Court to Bryan. What time was it you took these things of the woman? - On the 4th of July, between one and two o'clock, between Friday and Saturday. The boxes that the watchman spoke to, were three other boxes, which were not examined that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it all to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Court to Bryan. Had you any character with her? - Yes, I had, of a gentleman, in the Borough, that she had lived with, and she had lived with me twice before, and I always considered her as a very good servant.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the key of the box found in her pocket? - She would not deliver it up, she had it in her pocket; the key I gave to the watchman was the key of the cupboard, where I locked up the things that night.</p>

I was very busy, packing up some goods for a young gentleman in the Temple; part of the things that belonged to that young man, were in a large press, and I went and opened a large pair of folding doors, to look for the remainder of the things, and the prisoner, in the interim, went away; I did not see him go. but as soon as he shut the door to, I missed him; I went to the window and see him pass; I live in the middle of the court, between Drury-lane and Bow-street, it leads out of one into the other, I see him run up into the court, I went after him; when he got to the top of the court, I missed him, but a person told me that that young man that came out of my shop, was gone in next door; I went there, and there I found him, and he was pulling a shoe out of his pocket; I said, you have taken some of my shoes; he said, yes, I have taken one, and here it is, I only took it in fun, and meant to bring it back; that is not all you have got, says I, I told him I had lost so many things, that I was determined to take him back. I took him back and I found these two shoes on him, one in one pocket and the other in the other; I took one out of his pocket myself; these are the shoes they are my property,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160106"/>I know them by the writing on them, they are not fellows, I have the fellows; he used very frequently to come into the shop, he is no business at all. I know nothing more than I have had some of his friends call on me since, but I never saw them before; I never saw one of his relations till yesterday or the day before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. That is half true and half not; it is true in words, but false in spirit. What value do you put on those odd shoes? - Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. If you was to purchase them, would you give five shillings for them? - More money; but I would with, from the intercession that has been made to me by his friends, that you would shew him every indulgence you can.</p>
               <p>Q. The question I put to you is, whether you would give five shillings for them two shoes? - Yes, I would give seven shillings for there two odd shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides these, I see there is a pair of mens upper leathers? - They were in one of the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to them? - I could if I was to see them; I finished them while the prisoner was in the shop; they went at the same time, but I never got them back again, and many other things.</p>
               <p>Q. I did my duty for you before; I think I recollect your face before? - Very possibly you might.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you think I recollect seeing your face? - I cannot tell; you may have seen me in my shop perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. I never dealt with you, and I assure you I never will. Cannot you guess some other place? - It may be a great many places, perhaps; you might have seen me in Covent-garden Theatre.</p>
               <p>Q. I may to be sure. Now I will guess where I see you, the last place an honest man should stand, at the bar of the Old Bailey? - When was that?</p>
               <p>Q. About four or five years ago? - What was it for?</p>
               <p>Q. I will try if I can guess. I can guess that a man, by the name of Disney, was prosecuted, by his own uncle, for forging on him, or something of that sort? - It was not for murder.</p>

            Do I guess right? - You do not, you guess wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a very fashionable man once, went by the name of Count Disney. Do you swear that you was not prosecuted in this place for forgery? - I have not had an uncle for these ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not by an uncle, then, perhaps, it was by a master; then you was prosecuted by your master for forgery? - Was I guilty of it? there is the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ask me my opinion of it? - No, I don't ask you any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you prosecuted by your master? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You was acquitted of the forgery, but your master indicted you for the fraud, at Clerkenwell? - My master did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did prosecute you for fraud, at Clerkenwell? - I was not prosecuted there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you prosecuted, on the oath you have taken? - I was not prosecuted there.</p>
               <p>Q. On the solemn oath you have taken, where was you prosecuted? - There was a bill of indictment preferred against me here.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the bill of indictment for? - I don't know what it was for rightly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you convicted of that or no? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suffer a year's imprisonment on it or no? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say it was for? What did they charge you with? - With signing a man's name, which I never did.</p>

               <p>Q. But, I believe, that man said that he never signed that name, and they said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160107"/>you signed it for him? - I don't know how that was.</p>

            Don't you know how that was, when you was tried and convicted. Why then we must try you and convict you again, for there is no other way to brush up your memory. I believe you undertook to prosecute this man for petit larceny? - I believe he was committed for petit larceny, but I signed nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. I see from a petit larceny you have changed it to a capital offence. Did not you authorise Mr. Dyke to go to the friends of this lad, and tell them that if they paid you two guineas, you would not indict him at all? - No, I did not. Mr. Dyke is at the door, call him in.</p>
               <p>Q. You will recollect that, I don't want to take you by surprise. To your knowledge Mr. Dyke never made such an offer? - No, he did not; they came and offered me any sum if I would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came to you, did not you acknowledge that you sent Dyke to them? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not then add that if the twenty pounds were not given, you would prosecute for a capital offence? - No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew this lad very well a long time? - I knew him from Christmas but I did not know his friends before.</p>

             very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a person that is backward and forward very often? - He very frequently called in.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the prisoner said, when you overtook him, and he was pulling out the shoes, that he was only playing with you, he only meant it in a joke? - Yes, after I found he had got the property on him, when he see me come into the passage, he put his hand into his pocket directly.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy was very well known, and you knew where to find him? - No, I did not know he had any lodgings at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a day in the week in which you have not seen him? - I believe if I had not seen him so often it would have been better for me; I see him very frequently, but not every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Another thing I would ask you, as you are a compassionate man; I believe before the magistrate you pitied him very much; did not you make great expressions of compassion towards this lad? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you was sorry for him? - No, not at all. I told the magistrate that I had been very frequently robbed, and amongst the duplicates that were found there was a brush that I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. The magistrate committed him for a petit larceny, and you have now compassionately indicted him for a capital offence. Was not you bound over to prosecute for a petit larceny? - I was not. I conceive that in law I was not bound over, for I signed nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not said to you that you acknowledged yourself to be indebted to our Lord the King, on condition that you should prosecute this man? - That was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you bound over to prosecure him for petit larceny at that time? - I did not sign any paper or book at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was committed for petit larceny? - He was.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am no relation to this lad, nor ever exchanged five words with him in my life; I am a watch-maker, in Cecilcourt, St. Martin's-lane; I live with my father, but I carry on the watch-making business distinct; I know a man of the name of Dyke, I was at Mrs. Moore's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160108"/>in Princess-street, Thursday evening last, I believe she is sister to the prisoner; it was the evening of that day on which the boy was committed; Dyke was there, he said, that he came from Mr. Disney, respecting the prosecution of Homeden, that Mr. Disney was concerned for the friends of the lad, and for the lad, and that he was willing not to prosecute, and that he would not prosecute him if Homeden's friends would pay him twenty pounds, as an indemnification, and that if the twenty pounds was not given, he would then prosecute him at the Old Bailey, that he would not find the bill according to the instructions of the magistrate, but he would value the goods at five shillings, enough to make it capital; he said, he would go as far as he would; and, I think, he said he would make it capital. This gave rise to conversation, whether he would ever be sued or have any thing to pay; it was mentioned to Dyke, if in case they had any inclination to give Disney the money, suppose they gave him a note instead of the money, whether that would do; Mr. Dyke said, that would be compounding felony, and we never can recover on such a note.</p>
               <p>Q. This gentleman is a precious limb of the law. Was the proposal rejected or acceeded to? - It was rejected.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this you was advised to go to Mr. Disney to know if Dyke came with his authority or not? - Yes, I went there with Mr. Homeden, a relation of the prisoner's, yesterday morning; I did not ask the business direct; in the course of a few minutes I asked him if he had seen Dyke since he was at Princess-street, at Mrs. Moore's house, since last night? he said, that when Mr. Dyke returned, he was not at home when he came in the first time, and when he came in the second time, he, Disney, had gone to bed, and that he had not seen him; Mr. Dyke was not in the room, I had not understood that he lived in the house till then; he afterwards came down stairs, from some part of the house, and came into the room. I asked Mr. Dyke if he would use his influence with Mr. Disney, to get him carried to the quarter session? he said, he had not spoke to him, but as I was there I had better speak myself. I mentioned to Mr. Disney that the magistrate had instructed him, and that he could not act wrong, if he abode by his instructions, for I heard the examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Disney admit or deny in the course of the conversation, that Dyke came by his authority or not? - He admitted it. The business was again resumed respecting the note, and the present of the note, Dyke directly replied it cannot be done, it will be compounding felony, it is against the law; he said, that two men could not enter into an agreement to murder a man; on Dyke saying this Mr. Disney took part in the conversation, and said, that he remembered an instance when he was at the Oldbailey, of a woman being brought forward who did not prosecute some person, and that a letter was fens to her, that he left Mr. Shelton talking to a woman, telling her the consequence, that it was very bad; I went on purpose to know whether Dyke came by his authority or not. When I said his friends would give no money, Disney replied, if I was to take money I don't know whether I should do right.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH BRADY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife. On Friday the 11th of July, my husband went into the City, and I, thinking he staid long, went to dinner without him; the apprentice was in the parlour with me, and the prisoner came in, and said, that I had a bill in the window, lodgings to let for single men. I said, yes; says he, can I see them? yes, says I, you can. I told the apprentice to go up and shew him; the apprentice went up with the young man, which was the prisoner at the bar, and shewed him the room; I still remained eating my dinner; when he came down, he said, what is it a week? I told him five shillings a week; says I, young man, what is your trade? I am afraid it is too much for you; says he, I am a painter and glazier; says I, if you had another young man to partake of half the bed with you it would make it better; he wished me good day, and went out. In the course of a quarter of an hour, he returned with a young man; says he, I have met an acquaintance since I parted with you, that will be partaker of the room with me; very well, says I, young man; says he, he wants to see the room; the apprentice was eating his dinner, and I was done, and I went up and shewed the young man the apartment; I had the child in my arms, suckling at the same time; I went up, and the other young man be followed me, and the prisoner at the bar went up two or three steps, he then said, I have seen it before, I have no occasion to go up; returning down again, I saw the prisoner sitting in a chair, in the parlour, and I walks into the shop with the other young man, and left the prisoner and apprentice in the parlour; I went into the shop to ask where I should get his character; and the prisoner at the bar came out before the other had quite given his direction, the apprentice hallooed lustily to me, ma'am, have you got your watch? No, says I, I have not; the prisoner flew out of doors, and I said, that is the man that has got the watch; and I flew after him, and cried stop thief! and the apprentice likewife. On considering myself that I had left one of his companions in doors, and thinking at the same time that he might do me more injury; returning again I met the other young man, his confederate in the street; says he, what has he done? says I, why robbed me of my watch, which hung over the fire place for many months. I went in doors and laid the child down that I had in my arms, and went out again, and met the prisoner at the bar with a young man that is here, bringing him back to the house, and I laid hold too, and said, that was the man; and he brought him back into the house; I saw the watch produced; I believe it was taken from him, but I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see your watch? -  I saw it at Bow-street, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160110"/>young man produced it who took hold of him, John Hutchinson.</p>

               <p>I was coming along Chancery lane, I heard the cry of stop thief! by a neighbour's boy; says I, who is it? he says, that is him; and he ran up White's-alley, and I went and caught hold of him; it was the prisoner at the bar, the boy said, that is him; in the interim Mrs. Brady came up, and said, that is the rascal that has got my watch; I brought him into Cursitor-street, to Mrs. Brady's; the prisoner told me he would produce the property, if I would let him go. After he had been in the shop a little time, I saw by his left hand a powder sieve, and it appeared to me he was putting the watch into the powder sieve; I took the watch out of the sieve into my hand, and asked Mrs. Brady if it was her's? she said, Yes; Mr. Brady immediately came in, and I asked him if it was his watch? he said, if it is not my watch, it is my wife's watch, and that is all the same; and a constable came in, and Mr. Brady gave charge of the prisoner; the prisoner was searched, but there was nothing else found upon him; he was examined at Bow-street, and I attended the examination.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see him put it into the sieve? - It appeared to me as if he was putting it out of his left hand pocket into the sieve, and there it was, I took it up, I dare say, as soon as it was in the sieve.</p>

Was the prisoner a lodger there? - I don't know that, I know when I came to my lodgings that night about twelve o'clock, I cannot tell exactly the day, I think it was the latter end of October; when I came into the house the gentlewoman told me that my trunk was broke open, I found it broke open, I lost three shirts, I value them at one pound ten shillings, they cost me fifteen shillings a piece, two shirts value fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they your wife's shirts? - No, I had them in my charge, they were none of mine; four neckcloths, two jean waistcoats, two pair of silk stockings, two cotton napkins and a pillow case, the muslin neckcloths are worth about ten shillings, they cost me four shillings more than that, two pair of silk stockings value eight shillings they are second hand; and the napkins two shillings; I saw them the morning before I went away from the lodgings, I have not seen them at all since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is a common lodging house? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. A great number of different lodgers continually coming and going? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different lodgers have you in the house? - About five.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body that wants a nights lodging may come there and have one? - No, no strangers are taken in the house, nor have been for many years.</p>

               <p>I keep this house, the house was broke open between seven and eight o'clock on Tuesday night, the prisoner took the lodging on the Monday, the day before that Tuesday; on Tuesday he came in with a large bundle of straw and rubbish, and took it up stairs, and left it there, and broke open the trunk, and took away Mr. Shannon's things.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - I am sure of it, because I was the last person that had been up stairs, and I was the first up there again after him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for thinking this man broke open the trunk? - There was no other person up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you saw this trunk safe? - When I was up stairs making the beds in the forenoon about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. To Shannon. What time of the morning did you go out? - About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first discover this trunk to be broke open? - About nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Whiston. What makes you think it was the prisoner? - There was no other person up stairs, neither man, woman, nor child at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear that there was neither man, woman, nor child up stairs besides the prisoner, from eleven o'clock in the forenoon, till nine at night? - I am sure there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers had you? - Five; they were all out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any servant? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any children grown up? - Three two boys and a girl. The eldest boy is twenty-three; the girl is sixteen, and the youngest boy is turned of twelve. The two eldest were out at work; the eldest son was at work in Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel; the youngest son was at home, he was the only person in the house with me; my daughter was at work in Moorfields. There was a lodger up the one pair of stairs, a woman with a child, her husband was out at work, she was there all the time.</p>

            What do you know of this cloth coat of Norman Meakins? - It was in the dining room I missed it out of; I saw it when I was up making the beds.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he came with a large bundle of straw; do you know for what purpose he made use of the straw? - No; when he brought it he asked for a candle, but he did not come into the room where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go up stairs? - Yes; he staid there about half an hour; he came down again, and blowed the candle out coming down stairs, and said he would be in about nine o'clock; but he came in no more.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time you saw him? - It is a fortnight ago last Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not break open any thing? - He broke open the trunk up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. But he did not break open any part of the house? - He did not at all. When I saw him the Monday fortnight last, he wanted to make his escape from me very much, before he was taken into custody, before I got an officer for him, and I followed him about an hour before I got a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented him making his escape? - I followed him all the time; if he had set up a run he might have gone; but I might have given an alarm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never saw this man before in your life? - Never before he came to take the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. And this man, whom you suppose to be the man, you did not see till about eight months after this happened?</p>
               <p>Court. How long had he been in your lodgings? - Only one night. When he came first to take the lodging, he said, he was a coachman; and at night when he came in, I said, you have not brought your clothes with you; he said, no he had not, but he should on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He slept that night, and went away early in the morning, and you did not see him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. And then he returned again at night? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. How much had you drank before? - Three pots between three of us, at the corner of Field-lane; then I bid them good night, after I had paid for the gin and made the best of my way home; and she followed me again, and she says, young man, as you are late, you had better go home along with me; I said, as I am late, I don't care if I do, if I could get a bed. So she pretended she could get me a bed, and she went to a house in Chick-lane, and asked for a bed, and the person he looked out of the window, and said, no, I will not have any such person as you; then she said, follow me, and I can get a bed for you; and I followed her to Black Boy-alley, and I took and set myself against the wall, and we talked together, and I felt my money while she was talking to me, and she went away from me; and I felt and found my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you feel you had your money? - In Black Boy-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman with her then? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you treated her with the gin that you missed your money? - I suppose about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your money in your pocket when you paid for the gin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are very sure you felt it afterwards in Black Boy alley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive her do any thing about your pocket? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she with you after you felt your money? - Not above ten minutes after I felt my money; I stood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160117"/>by the side of the wall, and she stood by the side of me.</p>

About half after two o'clock, on the 6th of this month, I was calling the half hour, the prosecutor and the prisoner came up Chick-lane, they knocked at Mr. Ford's door, and he looked out of window, and they asked for a lodging; and he told them he had got never a bed empty; and them they went down Black Boy-alley; about five minutes after the prosecutor came up the alley again, and told me he had been robbed; I told him to wait till my fellow servants came down, and then we would go and seek after the woman; as soon as my fellow servants came down we did go, and searched after her, and went and searched three houses in the alley before we found her; in the foarth house we found her in a room where nobody lived, it is a room belonging to one Mr. Clarke; we searched the room, and we found three shillings and sixpence, and in her stocking I found twelve shillings and six pence, thirteen shillings and six-pence in all, on her left leg, I pulled it off, and emptied it into the window, and I asked the man if he knew any money? he said he knew one shilling marked I. P. and a brass shilling. There was one marked I. P. among the twelve; this is it. I then took her into custody to the watch-house, and from thence to the justice the next day.</p>

On Whit- Sunday, the 8th of June, that day I missed money twice; on the 8th of June, I deposited my money in my bureau, about eleven o'clock in the morning, thirteen guineas, in gold, in one small canvas bag, and three pounds two shillings and six-pence in silver, in another bag, sixpences, shillings, and half crowns; and halfpence I had in two separate draw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160119"/>ers, to the amount of nine shillings and six-pence good, in one drawer, and nine shillings bad in another. After I had put my money into my bureau I locked it up and put the key in my pocket, it was under three locks where the money was, and the parlour was double locked, but the key left in the door, and the partition door was double locked, and I had the key in my pocket, Mrs. Bullen was gone to Church before I put my money there, and I went afterwards and joined her at Church.</p>

               <p>Q. What family have you besides this servant? - Only a baby I left at home, and an apprentice, but he went out at nine o'clock in the morning, and I always give him leave to be out till nine o'clock at night. We intended to dine at Piccadilly, at my wife's father's, we intended to proceed to there from church; we never dine at home of a Sunday, we always dine out, and leave the prisoner at the bar in possession of the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go from Church to your father-in-laws to dine? - No, we returned home, my wife being very poorly; she returned first, and I did not know it, and I saw my weekly porter, and he told me that his mistress was at the door, I came up to her, and found she had rung two or three times, and the door was not answered, I then rung for admittance, and about the second time the door was opened with the young child in the maid's arms, and she seemed very much in a flurry, my wife asked her the reason she had not come before? she said she had not heard the bell; my wife asked me for a key in the bureau, I went to unlock the bureau, and I perceived the bags were not precisely in the state in which I had put them, I gave my wife the keys of her drawers, she was on the stairs, I returned immediately to my bureau, and counted the money, and instead of thirteen guineas there were but twelve, instead of eight half crowns there were but six; it rather sturried me, and I put the bags back where I had put them before, and locked up the place, and put the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the key of the parlour in the same stale as before? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all at any time intimate any suspicion to the servant? - No, none to her, we went out afterwards to dine with my father, and returned in the evening betwen eight and nine, very near nine.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned had your apprentice returned? - He had just come in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you went to your bureau again, on your second time returning? - About a quarter of an hour; instead of twelve guineas which I left at dinner time, there were only eleven, another guinea was gone, I counted the silver, the six half crowns was the same as I left them when I went out to dinner, then I counted the remainder of the silver, and there were fourteen shillings deficient of the silver, the good halfpence tastied right according to the paper, but when I came to count the bad ones there were three and six-pence wanting, there was only five shillings and six-pence left.</p>
               <p>Q. On finding this loss did you communicate your suspicions to the servant that evening? - No, I did not, I took her up the next morning, I sent for at constable, Mr. Marsh, she was searched, there was nothing particular on her, except a key that will open a closet where I keep my candles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her boxes? - I was present when they were searched.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had sent for the constable? - Somewhere about eleven, or half after; she had several boxes, four or five; there was found in one box a small<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160120"/>purse, which contained sixteen guineas, the officer gave her leave to take out her own things out of the box, in doing of that the officer perceived her going to conceal a small purse, I perceived it likewise, and the officer took it from her, and it contained fourteen guineas and four half guineas; there was a smallscrew box that contained some silver, six pences and shillings, I don't know exactly the quantity; there was found a pocket with about four shillings or better, of halfpence, I think they were chiefly bad ones, there was a small bag with farthings, there was a kind of a small cap box, where there was a pile of half crowns, one and twenty; in the large box I found two pen knives, and two childs clouts, they are in the custody of the officer. Mrs. Bullen knows the things, one knife I knew particular, the green handle one, the other knife and clouts Mrs. Bullen will speak to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This girl lived with you at this present time, and had lived with you two years? - She has lived with me upwards of two years altogether, but this last time she had lived about seven months, she lived the time before, a year and seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had elapsed between the time she lived before, and the present time? - About five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she came to live with you again on your own request? - Mrs. Bullen seemed desirous to have her again.</p>
               <p>Q. The shop windows were all shut of course being Sunday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the bell ring hard? - It rings loud.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any difficulty of making it ring when the shutters are up? - I heard it myself, it comes even with the kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Q. Fleet street is a very busy street? - It was very quiet at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The maid servant must have come down stairs to have opened the door whenever she did come down? - She must.</p>
               <p>Q. The money you will not identify? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this green handled knife I take it for granted that you are only able to speak to it by its being green? - No, it is not; it is by knowing it a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife is this? - A small knife with two blades in it, of no value; Mrs. Bullen used to have it in her pocket; she had it when first I was married to her.</p>

               <p>On Sunday I went to church before Mr. Bullen, and I was taken ill in the church, and returned earlier then usual; I rung five times at the bell, and could not gain admittance, and he rung twice, double rings, before we could gain admittance; when she came I asked her why she had not come before? she said, she was in the cellar; I said, she must be either dead or deaf; afterwards she-said, she was in the kitchen; afterwards she said, she was gone up to fetch the child, which lay in the two pair of stairs room. I afterwards asked Mr. Bullen for my keys, which were deposited in the bureau because I would not be cumbered with them; he gave me the keys; soon after I had been up stairs, Mr. Bullen came to me and informed me of the loss. After that I went to my father; we came from my father about eight, and were at home between eight and nine. On Monday morning we took this girl up; I was present when the box was searched; Mr. Marsh was the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in the box? - Two childs clouts, and two knives which I know to be mine, I have the clouts now, the constable gave them me yesterday afternoon, I have likewife two that correspond with the pattern; there is no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160121"/>mark on them, but a particular method of making them, I know them by having loops at the corners, which is not a very usual way, there were two deficient, and I had repeatedly asked the prisoner for them, she said she did not know any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you made enquiry after them before this discovery took place? - I should suppose ten or twelve months; they were lost with my first child.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lost your knives? - A considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the knives when you see them? - I do, they are both pen knives, I had made enquiry about the knives repeatedly; she said, she did not know any thing at all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the money found? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mrs Bullen, we are to understand that you swear to the clouts, not from your own work, but from these loops; you say that loops to clouts are not very usual things; I take it for granted you may have seen them before? - I never see any before with loops.</p>

               <p>I am beadle of the ward; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, and search her boxes; I have a memorandom of what was found; in silver two pounds eighteen shillings and six-pence, in shillings and six-pences; in a little bag there was sixteen guineas in all, with some half guineas; I see her catch hold of something in her hand, which she endeavoured to conceal, and I catched fast hold of it from her; in that bag was the sixteen guineas, incloding some half guineas, I think four. There was farthings and halfpence in another part of the box, to the amount of four shillings and three-pence, among them was a silver sixpence. In another box there were twenty one half crowns piled upon one corner; there was five-pence farthing all in farthings in that box; in another there were fifteen pence in halfpence and farthings, and two shillings and three pence all in farthings; and in another place I see six tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any clouts? - Not that day; I think we took them out on Saturday the 5th of July, Mrs. Bullen said, she believed them to be her's, she had got some that tallied with them; and two little knives were found, which she said were both her's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bullen. I know them to be mine, they are the two knives that were missing.</p>
               <p>Bullen. I know this knife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never opened the place in my life, nor had I any key to open it; I never opened the partition door during, the time that my master was out, and I could not get to the bureau without it.</p>
               <p>Court to Bullen. Was it necessary, in order to get to this bureau, to pass through this partition door? - Yes, it was, and the key was in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were these nails kept? - In the workshop, in paper; I see them the 10th of July last, in the evening about eight o'clock, we leave off usually about night o'clock, and he was gone to the public house; I went after him, and told him I had some trunks to send out, desired him to come back to take out a truck and he would not come back; he said he must go into the cellar first; I told him he should not go into the cellar, and told him I would charge a constable with him; I insisled on his coming immediately with me; at last by violence, I brought him out of the public house, and brought him home; when he came home, I told him he had got two thousand of nails in his breeches; he said, he had not; I put him on the bench and unbuttoned his breeches; he then put his hand up and pulled them out; I see him, there was the paper. Then I immediately charged the constable with him, and sent him to the Poultry Compter. The constable has the nails.</p>

I did not see them taken from him; I came directly down stairs, and my master had got them in his hand.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to a Mr Riswell, a taylor. Last Thursday morning, I was standing the opposite side of the way, and I saw this Hannah Hall with something under her apron; I did not see her go in, but I see her go out with something under her apron, from my master's yard; my master lives at No. 1, Dake's-place; she was followed out by the servant, Mary Allen, who came back and told me that she had stole a quart pot, and that she had seen her at an acquaintance's of her's, Mrs. Jenkins's, in George yard, Whitechapel. We both went to this person's house, and she told me where, perhaps, I might find the prisoner; she told us, if we went to one Mrs. Neales, in Petticoat-lane, we should very likely find her there; when we came there, she told us the prisoner had not been there that day, but if we went to one Godfry's, in the same yard, in Whitechapel, we should find her there; we went to Godfry's, and she denied seeing her for several days; I went up there about half an hour after, myself, and I saw her there with two more women; she told me then that she knew nothing about the pot; then I insisted on her going with me; she said, for God's sake, don't hurt me, I will bring you out the pot; she went down in the cellar and brought it up half full of dirt. Then I took her to the Bull's Head, Leadenhall-street, and Mr. Wright took charge of her, and the pot was delivered to the constable.</p>

               <p>I see the prisoner Thursday fortnight the 3d of July, I saw the prisoner at the Mitre-court, Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her at all? - No; I was cleaning the parlour out, in the morning; I live with Mr. Riswell, a taylor; I set out these two pots at the step of the door, they were Mr. Goodman's; this was in the morning about eight o'clock, he has got a large yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160126"/>and I saw the woman about the court for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these pots in that yard? - Yes, at the door. When the woman found I turned my dack away she opened the yard gate, and came, I perceived her, I looked up on perceiving a dark shade against the window, and saw the woman take the quart pot, and run away with it; I followed her till such times as I came to the corner of Shoe-maker-row; she was gone before I could come to her; I came and told our apprentice that I lost the quart pot, and I said, that I had seen her at an acquaintance's of mine in George-yard, if he would go with me, I should hear of her; we went together, but I never see her any more.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the apprentice to know her? - Mrs. Jenks, in George-yard told me her name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him to Mrs. Jenks's? - Yes, I went there because I had seen her about there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have known that young woman a great while.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my pot, it has my name on it; I have been in business a year and a half; I never sold any; I have had many stole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in Duke's-place to work that morning, close by that young woman, I saw her as I came along; I lodged with her aunt two years; she told me when she had a bit of broken victuals, she would give it me; I locked down the kitchen, and told her, I am going to take your pot to get some pump water, I will bring it again. I took the pot to Aldgate and left the pot with Mrs. Godfry, on the second stair. The girl knows me by living at her aunt's a long time, and told me if she had any thing to give she would as soon give it to me as any other poor person.</p>

               <p>Allin. I never gave it her at all; I never spoke two words to her in my life.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 8th of May, between nine and ten, or at any time in the day, did you send this man with any order to their house? - I never did, nor I never saw him afterward. That morning he set off col<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160128"/>lecting large sums of money in the country. I never sent him for goods to this house. On the 6th he had goods there that he never brought to us; on the 6th he had not left our house. He had lived with me near three years; the first part of the time we approved of his conduct very well, but we soon thought very different, in the course of half the time perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did ever any of these stockings come to your hands? - None of them, till Mr. Hudson took them from him, when he apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he never sent me for goods more than once, twice, or thrice? - Never</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mr. Hudson. Are you sure you did not send him the 8th of May? - I am sure I did not. I apprehended this man at Liverpool; I pursued him on purpose, I went after him, hearing that he was collecting our money unlawfully. Afterwards I heard he was at Birmingham, and from Birmingham I pursued him to Liverpool. These were five pair out of nine I found, two pair of which he had sold to his taylor, at Birmingham; they are three pair of cotton, and two pair of silk and cotton: this and another pair was found in his trunk or portmanteau, which was owned by him, and has been brought up to town since with his pretended wife, and which he has had delivered to him by a peace officer, in prison.</p>
               <p>Blunston. These are the kind of stockings that I let him have, but they have no mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner I was a servant to Badger and Hudson, and had no notice to leave. In the morning of the 8th of May, I went to Messrs. Haynes and had nine pair of stockings, they never asked me who they were for, nor did I tell who they were for; I rather was afraid of going home again, afraid of meeting a person I did not like to see. It is not likely that I should go to this shop for stockings in an assumed name, where I had been more than twenty times; there are the rest of the young men in Badger and Hudson's house that can prove that I have been sent there many a time, an I those that I had on the 6th of May. I think I can remember who they were for.</p>
               <p>Court to Badger. Is there my entry of these on your journals? - Not that I know of, it is no matter to us.</p>
