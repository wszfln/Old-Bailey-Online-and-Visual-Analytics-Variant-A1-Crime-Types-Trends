I am an attendant at the Strand Theatre; I have been there about seven years—I am there to prevent persons selling tickets out<lb/>side—on 4th April I was in attendance, from half past 6 up to 7 o'clock, in the gallery, and a man came and told me there were two men selling tickets—I left, and went to the door, where I saw the prisoner and another man with him—I said, "You know you are doing wrong by doing that here" (they were selling tickets); "you had better go away; if any of my <hi rend="italic">governors</hi> see you, you will get me in a row"—the prisoner said, "Who are you?"—I said, "If you will stop till such time as the policeman comes, I will let you know who I am"—he said, "I suppose you are some b—detective," and he up with his fist and hit me a severe blow in the left eye, which gave me a severe black eye—he then ran for about forty-five yards—I ran after him, and overtook him; I caught him by the collar of the coat, and held him till the constable came up—before he came up the prisoner kicked me severely about the privates—when the constable came up I gave him into custody—there was a great mob—I said to the constable, "I give him in charge for striking me; he has been selling tickets at the door, my <hi rend="italic">governors</hi> will see to that; I will give him in charge for striking me in the street"—he turned and said, "I will give you in charge for robbing me of my purse and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., snatching it out of my hand"—I had not done so—the policeman caught hold of me—I said, "You know me very well, I am a man different to that; leave go of me, I will walk quietly to the station"—he let go, and I went to the station—I was searched, and nothing was found on me but my own <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>—I was committed to take my trial—the prisoner was let go—I was in custody up to the trial at Westminster—when the trial came on, the prisoner appeared as the prosecutor—I defended myself, as I am only a poor man—I put questions to the prisoner—I asked him where he lived, and he said at No. 6, Wellclose Square—I asked him whether he ever got his living at anything else but ivory turning, as he had described him<lb/>self as an ivory turner in the charge sheet—he said, "No"—I then asked him whether he ever got his living by selling sham sovereigns in the street—he said, "No"—I then asked him whether he had ever sold rings in the street—he said, "No"—then the Judge asked him a few questions—I asked him whether he had ever gone by any other name except Anderson—his answer was, "No"—the Judge asked him, in my hearing, if he had ever gone by or used the name of Barnett, or Moses Aaron, and he said, "No"—the Judge asked him if he had been in prison under the name of Barnett Aaron, or William Barnett, and he said, "No"—the Judge asked him if he had ever been in the House of Correction, and he said, "No"—he was asked if he had ever been convicted under the name of William Barnett, for having assaulted Eliezer Bath—he said, "No," he had never been in any prison at all; he had never been convicted at all, nor been in prison in any shape or form, in Whitecross Street, or otherwise—I was acquitted on that occasion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I told the inspector I had been struck by you; and after you got me by the throat, after the garotting style, you took my <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>, and gave it to another man. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, you said, "Two other companions"—there was no money found on me—the Judge did not ask if your name was Henry Anderson, nor did you say, "My name is Henry Barnett Anderson, but sometimes they call me Henry Barnett and sometimes Henry Anderson"—you denied being Barnett at all—the Judge asked if you ever went by the name of Moses Aaron, and you said, "No"—he asked if ever you were in prison by that name, and you said, "No"—I did not see a paper handed up that you had been in prison by that name—I believe Mr. Sawyer was asked a question by the Judge; I cannot tell what he said—he did say that you had gone by the name of Moses Aaron—I gave you in charge for striking me—I did not strike you, but I knocked your head against the rails—I never took your purse—I was honourably acquitted; I was let out of the dock, and as soon as I came out my <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> ordered me to give you in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. On 19th June, at 11 o'clock, I was in Cheapside, near the Post Office gates—I saw the prisoner, and on the opposite side from her were two men, about fifteen or twenty yards from her—I saw her speak to a gentleman who was passing along Cheapside—she left him, and went to the two men—they remained in conversation a short time, and the prosecutor came by—the prisoner then left the two men, and spoke to the prosecutor—she walked by his side towards Foster Lane—the men crossed over to the opposite side of Cheapside, and stopped—the prisoner and prosecutor stopped at the corner of Foster Lane, then went along Foster Lane, and the men followed at a distance, re-crossing Cheapside—they turned into Gresham Street, and then they all four went to the corner of Cheapside; the men walked at about twenty or twenty-five yards' distance, sufficiently near to keep the prisoner and prosecutor in sight—at the corner of Wood Street the prisoner placed herself in front of the prosecutor, and remained so not less than half a minute, then turned round in a hurried manner and ran across Cheapside, towards Friday Street, followed by the two men—I spoke to the prosecutor—he was sober, though he had had some drink; he was able to walk and talk—from what he said to me, I went after the prisoner, and found her running along Friday Street as hard as she could—I went after her, stopped her, and told her that I belonged to the police, and I suspected that she had robbed the gentleman she had just left—she said, "I do not know what you mean," and at the same time I saw her hands moving under her mantle—I laid hold of them, and found her left hand clenched—I forced it open, and found in it this foreign bill of exchange for 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a Scotch bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an envelope with the prosecutor's name and address in full—she said, "They are only some pieces of paper; the gentleman gave them to me"—the prosecutor came up—I told him what she had said, and he denied, in her presence, that he had given them to her—I took her to the station, and stated that I had seen two men in her company, and she said, "Yes," pointing to two gentlemen who came with me from Friday Street, "and there they are"—they were not the two men whom I had seen—she refused to give her address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital. On 1st June Lamb was brought there—I found an incised wound about an inch long, and about half an inch deep, on the right side of the head down to the bone—a chopper would have done that—there were also two abrasions on the forehead; they were not serious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The bone lies very near the surface there, does it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the apparent depth arose from the swelling round the wound—I should presume that a sharp chopper used violently would have effected a much more serious injury.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger at No. 37, Cannon Street, City. On the night of 2nd July, about 10 o'clock, I was in Cannon Street—the female prisoner spoke to me; I tarried with her a little while, or rather she accompanied me towards Suffolk Lane—she then asked me some question, which I answered, and stood for a little while, and when I was moving off I found that my watch was gone; it had a ribbon and seal attached to it—I saw her darting down Suffolk Lane—I tried to follow her, and immediately found that there was a man trying to trip me up—I could not recognize the man; there were two, one was behind me and the other in front; the one who tried to trip me up first did not manage it; the second succeeded, and I fell—I did not observe the features of the men, but the male prisoner is, I think, about the stature of one of them—I got up again at once, and followed the woman.</p>

On this Tuesday morning, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I went into the yard with my master's horses, and saw the prisoners run round the rick; one had a black coat, and the other a smock—I jumped off my horse, ran down to the stack of beans, and it was just on fire, and had only been burning a minute or two—I ran after them a little way, and then tried to put it out, but could not—I then ran after the men—they ran into a field and parted, one went towards Edgware, and one towards Harrow; I followed Dawson and took him—I saw Gardner in custody about 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning—the rick was burned down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the strips of copper removed from one place to another? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are removed from the wagon into one room, and again when they are sent down for shipment, but they are put into cases first—it is very seldom the case that the wires are cut by the bundle of copper bars in moving, and tumble off; I dare say it does occur—I have seen them broken sometimes, but nothing like this quantity; perhaps I may say that once a week I have seen one or two small pieces, such as you hare in your hand—different numbers of men are engaged at different times—I did not take notice whether the instrument the prisoner used was a chisel or a knife—I thought it was a very improper act, but did not wish to get the prisoner into disgrace, and did not mention it; I mentioned it to one man, but not to my superior officer—I mentioned it to Ratherbee—the prisoner came there after me—I did not know him before he came into the service—when he wrenched the copper off men were working in the room, a man named Anderson was there, and Dale; I believe they are not here—I said before the Magistrate and before the Grand Jury that I saw him wrench the wire off with an instrument—I cannot say whether I said so before I went before the Magistrate—the prisoner has said that I picked up the bands and appropriated them to myself and I wish him to prove it; it has never been suggested by anybody else—Ratherbee is outside.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wellington Road, Bow Road, and am a timber merchant. On 8th June, I went in company with Gover, a sheriff's officer, and some others, to some premises in George Street, Bromley, under a writ from the sheriff—I went into the ground, accompanied by the sheriff's officer, and his assistant, Mr. Phillips, and two men in my em<lb/>ploy—the sheriff's officer went up to the cottage door and knocked—no one answered—he looked in at the windows, and could not observe any one there—we walked round to the back of the cottage, and saw the prisoner at work in the garden some distance off, digging or planting in a market garden—the sheriff's officer hailed him, and he refused to come—the officer stated that he should break the door open unless he came to open it, and on that he forced the door open; by that time the prisoner came up to where we were, with a gun in his hand, very excited—he made some remark which I did not distinctly hear—Mr. Phillips, and the sheriff's officer, and others there, seized hold of the gun, and a struggle ensued amongst them for the possession of the gun—I saw that there was a percussion cap on it—the sheriff's officer took out the ramrod and put it in the barrel, and inti<lb/>mated that it was loaded—I then got out of the way, fearing that the pri<lb/>soner might do me some mischief—after some short time the gun was fired off into the air, each party having hold of it—the prisoner refused to give it up, stating that it was his own property—he walked into the cottage with the gun—I saw no more of him for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, or it might be longer—I was standing in the garden, some distance from the cottage, and of a sudden I felt a violent blow on my side and my arm—I immediately found that I was shot, and I exclaimed, "I am shot! I am shot! secure him"—I staggered some distance—persons came up and assisted me away—I was taken home and put to bed—one shot struck me in the chin, others in the body and in the arms—I have several in my arm at the present time, a good many have been extracted from me, I cannot tell the number—it was smallish shot—I have none here except in my arm—I cannot say exactly how far the prisoner was from me when the gun was fired; probably half a dozen yards, or it might be a little more—I was standing sideways, not looking at him—I did not speak to him at all that day; in fact, I never spoke to him, that I am aware of, in my life.</p>

               <p>shot, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not acquainted with shot; it is larger than mustard seed—I do not recollect ever having spoken to the prisoner in my life—I know that this little cottage and piece of land had been in his pos<lb/>session, and that of his family, for a great many years—it was previously in the possession of my father and his partners, and they let it to his father and mother as tenants—they have not had it upwards of twenty years, but a good many years—this is the waistcoat I had on—it is very thickly padded—I brought an action against the prisoner in the County Court—the Judge stated it was a case for a superior Court, and dismissed it, being a question of title—I subsequently brought an action of adjustment in the superior Court, and judgment went by default, and it was under that judgment I went with Mr. Gover and the officer, to take possession—I was standing near Gover when he called out to the defendant in the garden—I think Gover told him to come and open the door, and upon that the prisoner said, I think, that he must break it open—before that I did not hear him say, "What business have you got here?"—we were a long distance apart, and they had to halloo to each other to make each other hear—Gover did imme<lb/>diately afterwards break the door open—the prisoner was still in the garden—he then came round to the front with the gun in his hand—there is no back door to the cottage—I did not see him with the gun in his hand when we first went there—when he came up with the gun in his hand I think he asked who it was that broke the door open—he appeared very excited—he did not say, "What right have you to break open my door?"—the parties immediately rushed to seize the gun, and a sort of excitement took place amongst them who should take possession of the gun; the prisoner refused to give it up, and the others refused to leave go of it, and it was imme<lb/>diately fired into the air—the others said, "You must discharge it before we will leave go of it"—when he found they refused to part with it, it was discharged—I do not know that he said, "I will discharge it into the air;" I will not say that he did not, because when I found that the gun was loaded I got away—I saw Gover produce his authority; I will not say whether that was before or after the gun was discharged—I did not hear the prisoner say, "You know I keep this gun for frightening birds, I do not mean to hurt anybody," nothing of the kind—I did not hear him say, "Give me an hour to move away my furniture"—Gover and his men began to remove the furniture—they did not begin to take up the plants and vegetables; they commenced taking the furniture out, and putting it outside into the road—the prisoner did not speak to me; I had previously spoken to his mother—I went into her room where she was lying in bed; he and his sister stated that I had been the cause of his mother's death—he did not say in my hearing, "Pray do not ruin me, give me an hour to move my things out of the house, and I will pack up."</p>

On Monday, the 18th, I was watch<lb/>ing the prisoner's house in consequence of some communication made to me by King—King is now out of the country—I have looked for him, and cannot find him—about a quarter past 2 o'clock on the Monday I saw both the prisoners go out—the female prisoner had a glass bottle—I did not see them return—about a quarter past 3 o'clock I discovered smoke coming from the kitchen, through the area grating into the street—I called the fireman first, and then went into the house, gave the alarm of fire, and ran down stairs followed by Martin and the male prisoner—the door was locked—the prisoner took the key from his pocket and opened it—as soon as it was opened the smoke and flame rushed out so that we were obliged to retreat—the firemen came directly afterwards—I did not notice anything peculiar in the smell—there were persons up stairs at the time—I had noticed the kitchen window from the street—it was whitened over inside so as to pre<lb/>sent persons seeing through—I do not know when it was whitened—I was on that beat at that time—the window was closed—nothing could have been thrown in from the outside—after the fireman had been in, and to some extent extinguished the fire, I went in—I found the gas pipes down—pulled down from the ceiling—I cannot say whether the gas was escaping—I saw some lines hanging across the kitchen—one ran from the fireplace to</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer attached to the Well close Fire Brigade station. I went on the 18th to Cable Street where the fire was—I had some difficulty in getting into the kitchen in consequence of the dense smoke arising from it—when I did get in I found the greater part of the dresser was consumed—the rest of the things right round the kitchen were burning at the same time—the dresser was fixed to the wall in the usual way—I cannot say exactly how it was fixed, but it was a fixture in the house—I could not move it—I tried—there were lines lying in various parts of the kitchen as they had fallen, and parts were hanging to nails in the wall—there was linen partly on the lines, and partly off, also burnt—there was no fire in the grate—there was a very strong smell of a spirit of some description, and gas escaping with it—I should say from the smell that the spirit was most probably naphtha, but the mixture of gas made it doubtful—it was very strong indeed—nothing but spirit would cause such a dense smoke to arise—the gas was turned on at the meter—the pipe was melted—the pipe comes down through the flooring, and along the ceiling—that pipe had been pulled down—the staples which held it were pulled out—they must have been pulled out by some one—I found no other aper<lb/>ture through which the gas could come, but that which was burnt—the pipe had melted and fallen—about a foot or a little more of the lead remained at the meter, and there the gas was coming through—the effect of pulling down the pipe would be to bring it into immediate contact with the burning materials—the window was closed—there was no entrance to the kitchen but by the door—after the fire was extinguished I noticed the quantity of goods on the premises—I should say the value of the things when in a good state was not more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and somewhere thereabouts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Shankster, of No. 307, Oxford Street; we let furnished lodgings. Norriss lived with me for a fortnight as cook—on 27th June, about 5 o'clock in the morning, I was called, and found the house broken open—the front door was shut when I went to bed—I was the last person up except Mr. Wetherell, who had gone to a party, but the door was left on the latch; he came home at ten minutes or a quarter before 3 o'clock, and I directly went and shut up the bolt—that bolt was still up at 5 o'clock, I had to undo it to admit the policeman—I examined the apartments, and missed these articles, which I had seen safe over night—the trowsers, and boots, and slipper were taken from the room of the gentleman who was out that morning, and the other things from a second floor sitting room—this table cloth belongs to Betsy Thorne, a lodger of mine, who has the keys—Norriss had left me exactly a</p>

               <p>fortnight before, and I think it possible that she took one of the latch keys with her when she left my service, for I found this latch key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the kitchen window; it opens the street door; it was made on purpose—the kitchen window was left open as it was so hot, but nobody could get in, because the gate was closed—Norriss must have used this key to open the door, and thrown it in at the kitchen window to get rid of it—we have three latch keys, one of which is always left in the kitchen—I did not miss one the night Norriss left; I asked her whether she had left it when she went away, and she said that she had, but I cannot say whether she did; I did not miss it, having two—having found this one, I have not got more than my number—I heard the front door close as near half past 2 o'clock as I can guess; that was not more than a quarter of an hour before my lodger returned—I think it must have been a person who knew the house, because the other rooms were bed rooms—the house is in the parish of St. George, Hanover Square.</p>

I went to the police station at West Ham, on Sunday morning, 21st June last, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I did not see my father then—I went a second time about a quarter to 11 o'clock, and then saw him—he was in custody—my brother-in-law and the sergeant were in the room—I asked what made him do it—I said to him, "Father, why did you not hit her with your fist, and not take that weapon to her"—he said, "Boy, it began all through a pennyworth of nails"—I asked him whether he cut the pocket off—he said, "No"—I asked him whether he took the money out—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How much?"—he said, "18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I live with Hill—I remember his tools being safe on Tuesday, 23rd June, at 4 o'clock—this plough is mine, and was in another basket, but I had not seen it that day; I had on the 22nd—I missed it on the 24th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of health to the parish of Bermondsey, and have been in practice sixteen or seventeen years; I have been fourteen years in Bermondsey, and have had some experience. I know Mr. Burgess's premises—I have been there on several occa<lb/>sions during March and April—I found heaps of bones there in a dried</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185707060063"/>
               <p>condition—there were other smaller heaps of joint bones with cartilage and matter hanging to them, and there were what are technically called glue pieces, with trimmings, and skins, and ears, and tongues, and nose pieces, and tails, and matters of that description—there was also a great heap of gas refuse within a building which had been partially erected and stopped, and also in the open air; the building was uncovered—there was a boiler on the premises, but they were not boiling when I saw it—it presented the appearance of having been used for boiling bones; there was some fat at the bottom, which induced me to believe that—I saw a cask with the remains of fat in it, also a quantity of carboys, which had contained sulphuric acid—I had seen that on Mr. Burgess's premises on previous occasions; that is used for the manufacture of manure; mixed with what I believe to be bone powder and coprolite powder, it forms a soluble manure, super phosphate of lime—in March and April, when I visited the premises, I formed the opinion that mixing sul<lb/>phuric acid and boiling bones would be a nuisance, but I did not see it, and therefore did not certify it as a nuisance—it was in a latent condition—there was no active operation going on—if sulphuric acid was mixed with bone dust it would cause a nuisance, by giving off a suffocating vapour—in consequence of directions I received, I went in May to the defendant's premises—they were placed under my inspection by the vestry, in consequence of complaints which had been made—I first went on the 11th; or 12th, for it was at half past 1 o'clock in the morning—when I got within 200 yards of the place there was a light vapour coming in a direction from the premises—it was a very fine night, and the atmosphere was very clear—I was in a patent safety <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and when within 200 yards of the pre<lb/>mises the vapour became perceptible—on reaching the premises there was a great noise; the steam engine was at work, and vapour was all round me, clear and distinct—the gate was closed—on the eastern side there was not much smell, but on the western side (the wind was coming towards the west) the vapour came—it produced with me difficulty of breathing and headache, and it was excessively offensive—there was a vapour hanging over the ground for a considerable distance from the premises; I saw it from the arches of the railway, and on the other side of the railway, the south side, the atmosphere was perfectly clear—there was a great steam arising from a ditch, which I imagine to have been caused by the waste water of the steam engine—the vapour was almost entirely on the western side—it appeared to come from the erection close to the railway—operations were going on there—I experienced a peculiar metallic taste in my mouth; I believe that to have arisen from the use of sulphuric acid; that would pro<lb/>duce headache—the vapour gradually dispersed during the half hour I was there, and in dispersing, it became more diffused and less dense—I did not at that time smell anything that I think arose from gas finings—in my opinion the smell I smelt at that time would be injurious to health—it was not a pleasant smell—you could not enjoy life in that vapour—the ditch round Mr. Burgess's premises runs on the west, and a little to the south—I did not perceive any smell arising from it at that time—on 4th June I went to the premises again—Mr. Shepherd came to me that morning, and Dr. Aldis accompanied me—there was then a different smell—the steaming process, the extracting of fat from the bones, was going on, and vapour was escaping from the building, which caused a very bad smell, just as there is from a bad cook's shop; I do not know anything more sickening—I do not think the defendant has had any fish there of late—the vapour that escaped was from two chambers, called extractors or digesters, by means of the appli<lb/>cation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185707060064"/>
               <p>of steam; the defendant is a very skilful man, and he has made engines to extract fat from these bones, which have been cleaned beforehand, and during this process there is a sickening vapour given off—the gas finings were at that time in a state from which there was not so much stench—if it was wetted, and the sun came on it, there would be a very disagreeable smell; it contains a quantity of sulphur; it is what has been used for the purifying of gas—I saw bones lying about in a semi-putrid condition; the cartilage attached to them was wet—I wanted to take away a sample of them, and of the gas refuse; I asked Mr. Burgess's permission, and he declined—Dr. Aldis was not with me at that time; he stopped till Mr. Burgess told him to go: that was at the entrance of the premises; Mr. Burgess came up; I told him who he was, and he told him to go, that he had no business there, and I think he walked away quietly—I remained—Mr. Burgess was very civil to me—I was on the premises about an hour on 4th June; the smell was different on that day to what it had been before, and I can swear that it was a different process—I do not think it was acid that was being used—I made this report (<hi rend="italic">handing it in</hi>)—the vapour on 12th May rolled over the market gardens, and no doubt contaminated the atmosphere—I noticed on one occasion that the leaves of the fruit trees in the neighbourhood were shrivelled and scorched, and brown at the edges, whilst at some distance from the premises they are in a healthy condition—I attribute the difference to the vapour on Mr. Burgess's premises—he has been on those premises for more than a year, for it is more than a year ago since I was ordered, under the Metropolitan Management Act, to inspect the premises with regard to fish.</p>

METCALFE</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you first went? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> More than a year ago—at that time there was a shed on the premises; the steam engine was being erected, I am not certain as to the large building being commenced—the mixing of sulphuric acid with manure went on in the shed—I have not the date of my first specific visit after Jan., but I have no doubt it was very early in the year—I have not noticed this smell over and over again particularly, when I have travelled along the railway—I have not said that it might be offensive in Belgravia, but that it was nonsense to talk about its being a nuisance there—I have said that there was a difference between a manufacturing district and St. George's, Hanover Square—Dr. Aldis lives in Hanover Square—the manufactories between Mr. Burgess's and London Bridge are all improved very much, and some are removed—there is a manufacturer of manure not from coprolites, I believe they use sulphuric acid; and I believe they use natural manure with plaster of Paris—they are not very particular about the animals that the manure comes from—not far from Mr. Burgess's they have been baking fresh manure; I cannot prove that they bake night soil—Mr. Hale has been summoned before the Magistrate, and we are preparing an indictment—I believe they dry the manure under the arches—it makes a very bad smell, but I do not think it is so bad as the smell from Mr. Burgess's—it is stink<lb/>ing and nauseous; it is baked by means of heat—I have reason to believe that night soil is carted and carried there at night; sometimes that makes a very bad smell—I have reason to believe that is constantly going on dur<lb/>ing the night—there is a fellmonger's yard close to Mr. Burgess's, and the arches of the railway there are used for varnish boiling—there are two arches at the back of Mr. Burgess's which almost abut on his premises, where they carry on the varnish making—I have managed to get into them, so as to see</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185707060065"/>
               <p>the process that they carry on, but they are generally locked; it is at night that they carry on this manufacture, and there is a very suffocating smell emitted; I believe muriatic acid is used—my attention was directed, more than a year ago, to the tops of the arches which are left open to allow the vapour to come out; the manufacturer closed the arches, and I told him if he did so he would kill his men—I have never had any complaint made to me since about the arches—I do not know the name of the person who com<lb/>plained at that time; it was not Mr. Sheppard—I had expressed my readi<lb/>ness to go there at any time, as they complained that I had not been active—I believe there has been a dispute about a right of way—the varnish manufactures would poison plants, supposing the vapour to go that way; they have each an appliance to consume the vapour in the shaft, but I do not think it is quite effectual; in fact I do not think they like to use it, they are afraid of explosion—there are a great number of tanneries in Ber<lb/>mondsey—as you approach these premises there seems to be a legion of them; in some of them they use what is called "pure;" that is, a solution of dog's excrement—it is used in pits, the nuisance arising from that is simply when the solution is let off into the sewers, but that has now been remedied by the use of deodorizing powder, and by the free use of water; it is not used so much for the heavy as the lighter skins, such as are used for ladies' gloves—some have endeavoured to get rid of the nuisance, neverthe<lb/>less the air is impregnated wherever the deodorizing process is not used—besides that, the soaking of putrid skins would produce a smell, but lime is used—the smell from the fellmongers' yard would not be agreeable—in spite of all this, it is one of the healthiest spots in the metropolis; we have less consumption in Bermondsey than in any district in London, the open ground near the railway is the best spot for a Consumption Hospital—my printed report merely speaks of the great prolificness of the neighbourhood—Mr. Burgess's premises are open in one direction; you can get in with ease—I was not aware that I could have got in on this night, when the vapour was spreading—I did not go on the premises, and I have been since informed by Mr. Burgess's legal adviser, that I had no business there at those hours—I do not know the name of the person that guided me on that night, but I believe it was Clark—my report, in substance was, that I could not certify it as a nuisance which was injurious to health—I have said that I discovered nothing till I got on the premises, but then it was in a state of repose—on the previous occasion it was the bones in the heaps and the bones in the tubs that were complained of, with the ligaments and cartilage attached to them stinking—I thrust my stick into the gas refuse, and then took it out and put it to my nose, and discovered that it was not a nice smell—I took up a bone and smelt it—I wanted a sample of the bones—I believe the fish that I con<lb/>demned was taken away instantly, at least, a portion of it—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">here stated that Mr. Burgess had removed the fish</hi>)—on 12th May, when I was called at half past 1 o'clock in the morning, the parties were waiting at my door when I came home—I had been dining out—I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the parties followed after me; I went along Blue Anchor Broad into Drummond Bow—I alighted from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went to the gate, the vapour was almost a flame, it was dense smoke which could be seen from the Drummond entrance—the steam engine was at work, and the machinery for grinding the coprolite and the bones was working at a great rate, and there was a very great noise—I went up close to the gate, and walked up under the railway arches in company with a policeman—I attempted to look over</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185707060066"/>
               <p>the gate, but could not see over the premises—I then came down to the end of the shed which abuts on the railway and comes up above the railway, that took me not very far from the varnish manufactory; I stood there some time, within a very few feet of Mr. Burgess's—I did not pass under the arches—none of the persons suggested to me that I might go to the back or open part of the premises where there was no wall—the vapour was not coming directly towards me, but more towards the market garden ground it left a metallic taste for some time, an astringent taste, acid and copper together, more like acetate of copper—I think I was within seven or eight yards of it—I am positive that I was not actually on the premises, but I was within seven or eight feet of them—it was after waiting there some time that I discovered the metallic taste as well as the smell, and I said, "I can not stand this any longer"—I think the smell would come from sulphuric acid mixed with gas refuse; there was gas refuse, and there were receptacles for sulphuric acid there—Mr. Burgess refused me a sample of what I call the gas refuse, and therefore I could not ascertain what it is—I had an opinion that it was oxide of iron purifier, but my notion is that there was some lime also, but I will not venture to swear it—oxide of iron is used in the London gas manufactories to separate the sulphurous hydrogen from gas, in preference to lime, but it is objected to by Dr. Letheby—I was informed by the defendant's foreman that the large heap was gas refuse—there are two kinds of gas refuse, and I am inclined to think it was the iron—I do not think it would have been so offensive if it was the lime—I have never tried the experiment of pouring sulphuric acid on the oxide of lime purifier; and I would rather not give an opinion on what would be the effect of it, as you have Dr. Odling by you, prompting you; I have not tried it, and do not know, and therefore cannot give any opinion upon it—I will not swear that what I call gas refuse was not oxide of iron purifier—my impression is that sulphurous acid gas was given off, and that that caused the stench—I was there about an hour or an hour and a quarter—I was walking about, trying to see if it came from any other source—I smelt it for about twenty minutes, and yet they never took me to the open part of the premises with the policeman—the ditch round the premises was not clean, the steam engine was at work—I have seen the refuse water from the steam engine run into the ditch at a high temperature, and that makes a thin white vapour—I should not have complained of that alone—in fact the surplus water from the engine in some respects makes the ditch less offensive—there was an offensive smell on 4th June like steam from bad meat—I took up a bone then, and smelt it, but not the same bone—there was a vast quantity of bones all decomposed; there must have been several tons; they were dry; you could break them with your hand—I did not object much to anything except those great heaps that become heated, and smell—I should not object to them alone in the state in which I saw them, but if you were to cook them they would become offensive—what I call the wet bones were in receptacles and tubs; they stank—I had to go up to them before I found they were not fresh, and I took up one to be certain of it—I was successful with the second one I smelt in getting a stinking bone; that was a wet bone—I should think there were somewhere about a dozen tubs and other vessels—there were four extractors or digesters—I do not know the process of charging them; I have always been told that they were not used—I believe they are a very great improvement upon the old boilers—I believe there is an attempt to make them perfectly air tight, but there was vapour escaping from them on that day—there</p>

               <p>must, of course, be the means of allowing the steam to escape, or there would be an explosion; the object is to make them perfectly air tight—I have no doubt they were erected with the intention of preventing any vapour or smell coming out—I did not go close to them; I saw the vapour coming from them when I was in Mr. Burgess's premises; it appeared to come from the top—it was a smell of melted fat; it was not strong; I did not say it was slight—there was a smell from the arches on that day—that is a very filthy smell, and extends some distance—the inspector of nuisances was with me on that occasion—Mr. O'Brien, I think, was the first to suggest that there was a different smell, and we hunted it out; it was distinct and different from that which came from Mr. Burgess's—they did not mix together—when I detected the fatty smell, we stood opposite Sheppard's ground, close to the borders of Mr. Burgess's, and about thirty yards from the spot—it was not a slight smell, it was a very decided one—it was not a wholesome smell, I swear that—I have not said that it was not at all injurious or unwholesome—I have said, as to the fat in the casks and receptacles in Mr. Burgess's yard, that I could not certify that that was injurious to health in the condition in which I saw it—I had noticed the trees before that—I have not been on the premises lately—I was shown some peas and some cress that looked very well—they were on the foreman's ground—I believe Mr. Jennings grows peas—there are market gardens all round—the vegetation looked very flourishing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it that you complained of that would be uncomfortable and unpleasant in the neighbourhood on 4th June? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The vapour escaping from the extractors—they are fourteen or sixteen feet high, and about four feet in diameter—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">stated that they held two tons of bones at a time</hi>)—there are four of them, worked by steam—the vapour was perfectly perceptible from the market garden ground—it was a sickening smell—it might make a person with a delicate stomach sick—if it went into the bed room of a person either sick or well, it would make the person well sick, and make a sick person worse—it would make a healthful person uncomfortable—there was also a smell from the gas refuse—it was not a strong smell—I put my stick into it—it was a faint sulphur<lb/>ous smell—the bones had the meat all cut off—they were bones collected from the butchers' shops—I said they were bad—they were small in quantity in proportion to the others, but I should think there must have been a ton or two on the premises—no doubt heat would cause them to produce an un<lb/>pleasant smell—supposing some tons of these wet bones, on a hot summer's day, were lying in the open air, they would have a tendency to infect and impurify the atmosphere—I am quite certain that the sickening smells, and these sulphurous smells, on 4th June, came from the defendant's premises—a shower of rain with heat afterwards would produce that—I know Row house—it is a detached, gentleman's house, I should think a third of a mile from the defendant's premises—I passed it to enter the premises that morn<lb/>ing—I smelt a distinct smell at 200 or 300 yards from the premises—it be<lb/>came stronger as I neared the house—I noticed it for twenty minutes—it was a dense vapour coming in one direction towards the open market ground on the west—I have no doubt at all that that vapour came from Mr. Burgess's premises—a portion of it came from the shed—it appeared to me to come from the mixing process of the sulphuric acid and the bones—it was something similar to what might come from a varnish factory—I inves<lb/>tigated in every direction with the policeman to ascertain where it came from—I do not believe there were any varnish smells—there is no tannery</p>

               <p>for half a mile—steps have been, and are being taken at the present mo<lb/>ment with reference to those—in my judgment, the vapours arising from the premises of Mr. Burgess would lower the health of persons living in the neighbourhood—I think I have been to the premises five times altogether—three times before the last two months—it would depend on the wind and the state of the atmosphere as to how far that vapour would be carried before it would be entirely dispersed—that night was a very still night and rather warm—I think it might be carried a quarter of a mile.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of health to the parish, of St. George, Hanover Square. I have practised as a phyician about thirty years, and am senior physician to the Surrey Dispensary—the subject of nuisances comes very frequently under my attention; within the last year, constantly—on 11th April I visited Mr. Burgess's manufactory, about 1 o'clock in the day—I remained there about three quarters of an hour—I did not examine the manufacturing process—I visited them at the instance of Mr. Spanton, Mr. Claridge, Mr. Armfield, Mr. Jennings, and Mr. Sheppard, persons living in the neighbourhood—on entering, I observed immense heaps of animal matter, consisting of slips of sheep skins, and other things, in a very offensive state—one heap was only from sixteen to eighteen feet from the houses of Mr. Spanton and others—they are small houses, on the left, very nearly adjoining Mr. Burgess's premises—I also observed an immense accumulation of bones and skulls, and the bones had animal matter adjoining to them—some of them were in an offensive state—there were large stacks, there might be 300 tons—there were stacks of dry bones, and I smelt offensive smells from them, and from the animal matter also—I smelt that at the entrance of the yard, and there was a smell coming from a copper—it was a fine day, and rather cool—rainy weather would increase the offensive smells, they would be almost intole<lb/>rable, I should think—there was a large copper there, about 6 feet 5 inches in diameter, and about 6 feet deep—that was in the open yard, without a shaft or chimney of any kind—they were boiling bones in it—vapours were issuing from it almost at right angles to the house—the vapours were very nauseous, and, of course, this was increased on their being stirred—I was there while they were being stirred—they were calculated to have a sicken<lb/>ing effect—they did not have any effect upon me at that moment—the wind carried these vapours directly towards the houses that day—I did not at that moment feel any sickening effect from it, but I did on a subsequent occasion when I went, and was not permitted to go in—the copper had no lid to it, I saw none—it was in the open air; it was a large copper, and there were, close to it, two receptacles containing the skimmings from this boiler, very nauseous—I saw twelve receptacles, like small tubs; some were full, and some half full, of bones and green foetid water—there was an offensive odour from them—of necessity, from the wind blowing, these vapours would be carried into the neighbourhood—I saw animal matter—I counted eight pieces, which the men called glue pieces; they were sheeps' ears—I saw an open ditch, and vapours issuing from it—I tried some of that water, and I found fat in it—I have no doubt those smells were carried into the neighbourhood—some of that water came from the steam engine, but there was other water I have no doubt—from what I saw of the pre<lb/>mises, and the matter there, I am of opinion that the vapours arising from this factory are dispersed in the neighbourhood, and are injurious to health—I</p>

               <p>noticed the vegetation around there; a great many of the leaves of the trees were withered—I will not say the whole, but those nearest the pre<lb/>mises were; others, at a greater distance from them, looked healthy—I heard Dr. Challice describe the gas finings; I had no opportunity of examining them—my impression was, that they were oxide of iron—pour<lb/>ing sulphuric acid on bones, I should say, would produce an injurious vapour—I heard Dr. Challice describe what he saw on the morning of 12th May—I agree with him as to that vapour producing illness and sickness—it would produce the acrid taste which he described, and tend to the injury of health, and to lessen the enjoyment of life very materially; in fact, it would destroy all comfort—after a time the oxide of iron is put in the open air to purify itself, and so nauseous is it that, in my own district, they are obliged to purify the vapour from it by drawing the atmosphere through it—I went there on 4th June, the same day that I saw a large wagon going into the premises—I went with Dr. Challice, and saw Mr. Burgess; I told him that I was the medical officer of St. George's, Hanover Square, and I came at the request of Mr. Grey—I went into the yard—I did not smell anything on that day—a great number of the bones and the animal matter had been removed; it was, comparatively, in a clean state that day, as far as I saw—I did not go into any examination—I discovered a smell in the Drummond Road, which is about 100 yards off, which was very offensive—it caused me nausea, and sickness, and headache—I can distinguish the smell arising from the digesters from the varnish smells—I took as much pains as I could, and can distinguish them—I went in the market garden, and there was the smell there.</p>

               <p>open, the houses are small—a number of families living in the same house are more likely to be affected—in a neighbourhood like that, a vapour such as I have described would be more injurious than in others—the families of the poor live generally in small houses, and are more crowded—the bones I saw were in a semi-putrid state—I smelt a very offensive smell indeed from the bones throughout the premises, and from the animal matter—the slips of sheeps' skin, and bullocks' ears and skulls, with the flesh adhering, were in a semi-putrid state, and the smell from them was very offensive.</p>

I live in Elizabeth Place, near Mr. Burgess's factory—he has been there about eighteen months—I did not perceive any very offensive smells before he came—there are varnish makers, but they are farther from my house—since Mr. Burgess has been there I have perceived offensive smells; the bone boiling began last March, I think—I have seen vapour issuing from his factory—the smells have been very offensive on those occasions—on 11th April I went with Dr. Aldis and two other per<lb/>sons to visit the premises—I saw heaps of bones, many of them as high as the ceiling—on the left hand, as we went in, were wet glue pieces lying all about; I should call them bits of skin—there was a nasty faint smell from them—I saw a copper boiling, and a man stirring it up—I went close to it, vapour and steam was coming from it—it went right to my house—the wind was blowing north—I smelt a very bad smell—there were lots of bones, some dry, some had been boiled, and some were wet and stinking—they had been there months, and many of them I believe twelve months—on 12th May I went there again, but did not go into the premises—I was there about an hour—I saw vapour issuing from the factory—we went up the arches a little way opposite Mr. Burgess's—the vapour arose from Mr. Burgess's and extended all over Mr. Sheppard's ground like a fog; it came out of the loop holes close by the steam engine; it had a nasty faint smell, it made me sick—I had been to Dr. Challice before 12th May—I fetched him that night—I was called out of my bed to go, by Mr. Clark at half past 12 o'clock; he said we should be all poisoned—I have frequently been outside the premises during the night and have perceived that smell and vapour—I know the difference between the smell of the varnish maker's and Mr. Burgess's—I cannot say that I felt sick before 12th May, but I have had the headache very badly—I smelt the gas finings, I sat down close to them.</p>

I have been there eight or nine years—after Mr. Burgess came there, I smelt smells dif<lb/>ferent to what had been formerly in the neighbourhood—they were faint smells which would cause sickness—I have felt sick from them at times; it has not been constantly, but occasionally—I should say I have smelt it 150 yards from the factory, and more strongly when I have been nearer; different smells—I have not seen bones and fleshy matter lying there, but it smelt like that—I have a family, they have been ill; I cannot say whether the illness was occasioned by the smells, but the smell has existed at the time they have been ill—I am quite sure the smells I complain of have come from Mr. Burgess's premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a cabinet maker, and have lived at No. 4, Elizabeth Place, for fourteen months—I smelt a putrid stench from Mr. Burgess's factory, it came from the boiler—I have seen them stirring up a composition, in an open vat, from my back room window, and when they are stirring it up it is most offensive—but not this year, I saw that before September—the vapour does not come from the vat, but from the boiler in front—the smells make me feel faint, languid, and sick—carts going into Mr. Burgess's have stood before our window for twenty minutes at a time—some wagons had a slushy matter in it—I cannot describe it—that was this year—it had a putrid smell, and went into the factory, and I afterwards smelt the same smell from the yard—I have seen dry bones in carts—the smells made me retch violently—I have been obliged to keep the doors and windows shut to keep the stench out—I have been sick in the night from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Burgess. I first went to work in Nov., 1855—he began to erect the building near the railway in which the steam engine is in January—there is a steam engine and a mill for grinding coprolites—we began to grind coprolites about Oct. last—the copper in the middle of the yard was erected in April, this year—the extractors were put up eight or nine months ago—we began to use them on 4th June—I recollect the dispute about the wall—I had heard complaints before that—several of the neighbours complained, but I told them there could be no cause, because we had not began business—they com<lb/>plained while we were erecting the building—I told them it could not come from our premises, as we were not in business—we began to have bones in in March, 1856—they were dry—we deposited them in the open yard—there could not be any smell from them; they were cooked bones; all animal matter was taken from them—they were street bones and rag shop bones, and beside that we had calcined bones shortly afterwards—it is impossible that there could be any smell from them—the gas refuse came somewhere about May or June, 1856—it is in large heaps—there is never any unpleasant or unwholesome smell from them—if they were moved or stirred, there might be a vapour arise from it, but as it lies there, there is not—we received the fish in the early part of last year; we received it from collectors, in tubs—it was put in pure</p>

               <p>sulphuric acid; it was covered over with gypsum, which prevented any smell—the inspector of nuisances came several times there—Dr. Richards afterwards came from the Vestry—there could not be anything that was offensive in the fish after it came on the premises, we protected it so well it could not be offensive—Dr. Challice came at one time—he put his stick into it, and then smelt it—I do not think it could be smelt off the premises, even when it was stirred up; however, the whole of that was removed very shortly afterwards, on a notice being given—we began in May, 1856, to make super phosphate, that is artificial manure—that is made from bones, coprolites and animal charcoal diluted with sulphuric acid—at that time we had not got our mill at work to grind the coprolites—we received them first in a fit state, and mixed it up—a vapour arises in making that—when the air is clear, you may see that vapour at a very short distance, only a few yards—we continued to make that manure from May till the latter end of June, last year—when the mill was erected, we ground our own coprolites—after we had made the super phosphate, we cleared the mill for coprolite grinding—we did not begin to make the super phosphate after that—the first lot of wet bones and flesh bones was brought in about Dec.—the wet bones laid in a heap, the weather being cold, and after that we sawed the ends off, and put them in pickle in the tubs, in sulphuric acid, and that prevented them from smelling—I recollect Dr. Challice coming before we did anything with any of those bones—he saw the bones in the tubs—he took up one, and smelt it, and then another—they began to put the long bones into the copper about the middle of April, shortly after it's erection—other lots of fresh bones did not come in after that—the copper was used five or six times—there might be a faint smell coming from it, but nothing offensive—I think we have boiled about half a ton or 15 cwt. of bones there—there were some of the other bones from the pickle—the object of putting the long bones in was to sell them—the fat is skimmed off, and put into the tubs—in the course of skimming that fat there is the smell of fat, but nothing offensive—those long bones are used for knife handles and tooth brush handles, so that you must not boil them down, but preserve the texture of the bones—we put other bones in merely to boil them, and sell them as bones—those extractors are charged from the top—I have known two of them to be used—we did not begin to use them till 4th June; they have been used four times—so far as I could tell, there was no foul smell emitted from them except by accident—the gelatine comes out at the bottom—it keeps dropping into the tub below—there is no disagreeable smell in that dropping—when that process is gone through, and we have extracted the fat and the gelatine, the bottom is dropped down by a hinge, and the bones tumble out—there is a steam from them, but nothing offensive—that steam does not rise into the air; it extends but a little way, and only lasts a few minutes; it would not go out of the premises—the copper is only a temporary erection; it could be taken away in a few hours—it was set up for a temporary purpose while another was erected—the first building we erected was near the railway—we afterwards began to erect another building near Jennings and Armfield's; we got it to a considerable height, and had to suspend it about the right of way—the fire in the copper was lighted last Saturday, as there was a little fat in the copper, and we wished to sell it—we boiled no more bones—it is a great object to put fresh bones into the copper as soon as we can—the fresher the bones are the better the fat is, and the whiter are the bones—if they are kept, they</p>

               <p>would get discoloured, and you could not sell them—Dr. Aldis came in the beginning of April, and Spanton, and Jennings, and Armfield—I was not on the premises when they came in; they sent for me—when I went to Dr. Aldis, he told me there was a nuisance—I told him I would rather he would come when Mr. Burgess was there, and I said to Jennings and the others, "You have no business here"—Dr. Aldis said, "Then you would not like us to go on?"—I said, "Certainly not, I would rather you would come when Mr. Burgess is here"—there have not been any entrails or offal brought there since: there have been glue pieces, which are the only animal matter—I never saw such a thing as bullock's heads with animal matter on them—the horse's legs were in a dry state, such as you have seen to-day—flies would collect anywhere, especially on bones—there could not be any offensive smell from dry bones nor from calcined bones—it is the custom when we receive raw bones, to cut the ends off, and boil them as soon as we can—I never observed any unpleasant smell to go off the premises—I live in Drummond Road—I have never experienced any inconvenience there from the manufactory—I am glad to have my window open—the varnish factories are frequently at work; there is an unpleasant smell from them—I believe they boil oil—it is a nasty, heavy, nauseous smell—when our neighbours have come to complain of our factory, I have told them it was the smell of the varnish—Mrs. Shepherd lives very near this varnish place—there is a great deal of decomposed vegetables there.</p>

                  </hi>., M. D. I am professor of chemistry at Guy's Hospital. I have recently given my attention to the subject of nuisances for some considerable time past—I have been employed by the Home Office in refer<lb/>ence to bone boiling and other nuisances—I went to Mr. Burgess's premises with Mr. Wagstaff, on 3rd June and 3rd July—it differs altogether in it's nature from what is ordinarily called a bone boiling establishment—I have seen a great number of them—the bones are chiefly collected from rag shops and boiled in open coppers—there are large accumulations of these bones, after they have been boiled with the gelatine contained in them, they are allowed to decompose—they continue there a long time while this process is going on—in bone boilers there are exhalations which cause uneasiness—I looked at the copper on the furnace in the yard; it was in the open yard; it was not at work; but I have seen the process frequently elsewhere—it is boiling the long bones—it is a very great object to put in the bones as fresh as possible—assuming them to be placed in tube, diluting them with sulphuric acid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185707060096"/>
               <p>keeps them in a fresh state for a considerable time—the effect of boiling the long bones is not injurious, noxious, or unpleasant—when you are near the boiler, there is a smell which I should compare to the smell of cooking—if carried on as stated by the last few witnesses, it could not produce an injurious or unpleasant odour—the long bones are the only ones that would pay the manufacturer—I noticed the four extractors, they are to extract the gelatine and fat; the bones are let out of the bottom—there is an accumu<lb/>ation of fat which is let out into tubs—that is a very excellent process—open air boilers were formerly used—if these extractors are worked properly, there cannot be any escape from them, and then there would be no smell—I saw one at work, no smell came from it—I found on the premises about a ton and a half of bones, and also bone black, that is, bones when they have been burnt, what is called animal charcoal; and there was also about three tons of calcined white bones—that was on 3rd July; I found the same kind of thing there on June 3rd—there would not and could not be any smell from calcined bones—if you hold dry bones up to your nose you can smell them, but not in passing—I saw about twenty bones that had been in the earth—all the animal matter had been taken away, there was no un<lb/>pleasant smell from them—I found very few ordinary rag shop bones—there were four or five tons of bones from which the animal matter had been removed in the extractors—they were in a good condition, dry—I saw some long bones that had been through the copper, they are used for knife and tooth brush handles—there were some dry glue pieces, and some pieces drying on the ground—they would emit an unpleasant smell if you held them to your nose, but not when walking on the premises—I walked among them—I found no animal matter but what I have spoken of; no entrails, or anything that could be called offensive to persons on the premises—the gas refuse was in large heaps—partly under the new shed, and partly in the open air—I examined a portion of it, it was spent oxide of iron—they use that to purify the gas—in doing that they remove certain stinking smells from the gas—there is no unpleasant smell from those heaps as you walk along—I put my stick to them, and could smell them then—I saw some carboys, but did not examine them—I looked at the coprolites—they are used for making the super phosphate—if it is made solely from coprolites, there is very little vapour; but if from bones, especially bones containing animal matter, there is a considerable sour smell—it is a smell which some of the witnesses have described as an acid taste—that might arise from mixing up the materials, if done on a large scale—I do not know that my attention has been called to the manufactories in the neighbourhood—I have been to several japan manufactories where they japan leather; sometimes there is a very suffocating acid smell from those, and sometimes rather a fishy smell, from using train oil or fish oil—fumes of considerable volume might come from that—I do not know that I have ever seen it in the night; I have in the day—I saw that there was a ditch with foul water—I can<lb/>not say that it smelt until I got close to it and stirred it with a stick—if steam water were thrown into the ditch, I should not think it would make much smell, independent of the temperature.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been inspector of nuisances to the parish of Bermondsey for seven years. I hold that office under the Vestry—it is my duty to examine the different manufactories in Bermondsey, and report to the Vestry when complaints are made—we do not act unless complaints are made against manufactories—I know of a complaint being made in May, 1856, by Mr. Sheppard—I had visited the factory before—the first visit was on 19th Feb., 1856—there was a complaint made, and I visited imme<lb/>diately—I then found twenty-five hogsheads of fish offal—I examined them and found only a faint smell—the offal in the casks was in vitriol—I did not find anything calculated to produce a nuisance on the premises, except the fish offal; and that, in the state in which it was, was not a nuisance—there was no smell of a very serious character on the premises—I did not see a large quantity of bones—the next time I went was on 3rd March—there were then forty hogsheads of fish offal—they were not calculated to produce any ill effect—they were in a preserved state—they could not produce any injury, or serious inconvenience—I could not smell them outside the pre<lb/>mises, nor on the premises, only I went there for the express purpose of finding fish offal—I did not notice any other matter on the premises at that time—the next time I went was with Dr. Richmond, on 7th March—I found the place in the same state—there was the fish offal—there was no inconvenience from it—I went again on 9th May, 1856—that was in con<lb/>sequence of a complaint made by Mr. Sheppard, I believe—I accompanied Dr. Challice there on 9th May—the fish offal smelt more offensive then than on the former occasion—I stood where I was—Dr. Challice went to the wind<lb/>ward to catch the smell—before I went on the premises, I did not find any smell; I did not notice the smell on the premises till we came to the casks of fish offal, and they did smell then—I did not smell the effect of the vitriol on the bones, off the premises, but as the men mixed it, I did smell it—it was an irritating smell—I believe Dr. Challice smelt it more than I did; and he, being a medical officer, I left it to him to describe it—I had seen vitriol poured on calcined bones before, that was more offensive than this, but I am quite clear that when outside I did not perceive it—after the report made by Dr. Challice, I received a notice to examine the fish offal, and on the morning of the hearing of the summons, I went and found all the</p>

               <p>fish offal was gone—there was no complaint made on the subject of mixing at that time—I do not go to the premises without I hear a complaint—all complaints are brought to my attention—from that time to the end of the year, there were no complaints to the Vestry of Mr. Burgess's factory—I did not visit the premises this year till the order was given—that was on 30th April—I did not give notice to Mr. Burgess of my intention to visit him—I did not know it till the morning that Dr. Challice said to me, "Go for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and we will go to Burgess"—on entering the premises, I did not notice any stench—I found the gates open and walked in—there was an iron boiler there—there was a large accumulation of dry bones, which were not offensive—there was nothing from them that would be injurious or seriously unpleasant—there was a large heap of gas finings, but we took no notice of them—we were near them—I did not notice any effluvia from them—there were some wet bones—there was a moisture about the bones—Dr. Challice took one piece—he asked the foreman's consent—he first gave his consent, and then he said he would not wish it to be taken away without Mr. Bur<lb/>gess was there—there was some matter on the joint of the piece that was taken up, but with respect to the mass, it was not in a putrid state—there was no such smell as arises from putrefaction arising from that mass—there was no smell that could be smelt several yards outside the premises—there was nothing that would justify Dr. Challice in making any complaint to the Vestry—the premises appeared to be properly kept, and care taken of them; they were then unfinished—they were drying some glue pieces, that did not produce an offensive odour—glue pieces are carted about Bermondsey every day—I was on the premises half an hour on that occasion—I visited the premises again on 7th May—I went to the factory, and found a faint smell—it was, I think, from the wet bones—I found that on going through the premises, not outside—that could not have extended outside, and been strong enough to annoy the neighbourhood—I went again on 4th June—Dr. Challice informed me that I was to accompany him to the Hibernia Chambers, and there we met Dr. Aldis—we came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Mr. Burgess's premises—on that occasion I saw, for the first time, that the digesters were at work, and outside the premises I found a fatty smell—immediately after<lb/>wards we joined the witness down at Jennings's warehouse, and I found another smell—I said that that was not from Mr. Burgess's premises, it was decidedly a varnish smell—the smell only came from the digesters on the premises—I cannot say whether that would be injurious to the health—it would not materially inconvenience me, only a fatty smell, such as might be found from any one boiling trotters, or from boiling a leg of meat—I cannot say that I discovered anything of putridity about it—I have passed the premises very frequently within the last two months—I have not discovered any external nuisance, only on 4th June, and that was the fatty smell which, I suppose, came from the digesters—I should say it was a smell from boiling bones—I never smelt any smell on the railway—there are unpleasant smells coming from other factories in the neighbourhood.</p>

I am a glue piece and hide merchant, and live at Brixton—my business is carried on in Russell Street, and also in Long Lane—I have seen the glue pieces which are frequently on the defendant's premises—they do not make any disagreeable smell in the state in which they are, they are saturated with lime to preserve them—that decidedly prevents the smell—I have called there, on an average, twice a-week on business, for the last six months, but have not experienced any disagreeable smell on approaching the premises, nor when I got in; there is, of course, a smell from the steam engine and from the mixing of manures, there is a little dust, but certainly nothing offensive—I have been within half a dozen yards of the gas heaps, but never smelt anything from them—I have seen a large heap of bones on several occasions, but they were dry ones—I was present once when they were using the copper, there would be a vapour from it, but not at all annoying, and certainly not unhealthy—I have seen the extractors at work, but never experienced anything offensive from them—I know the nature of the process—after the bones are steamed, there will be steam or vapour for a quarter of an hour, but it would be quite confined to the premises and not be offensive; nothing remains but the lime of the bones when the fat is extracted—the notion of their smelling less than a leg of mutton would, is the truth; the smells in our kitchens are certainly not pleasant, but they are not unhealthy—the fat being got rid of, there might be a smell while they were warm, but when they were dry there would be no smell.</p>

               <p>for preservation eight or ten days; a good shower of rain would not wash it off—I never smelt anything annoying on the premises, but a large factory will smell sometimes—I have never found a fatty smell from the steaming or boiling of bones—I was present once at the boiling of bones in the open copper; I smelt the vapour arising, but nothing offensive; I do not dislike it—7 cwt. or 8 cwt. of bones at boiling heat was not unpleasant at all.</p>

There are many large manufacturing premises as you approach Mr. Burgess's, going along the railway—I do not know of any special premises before you come to Burgess's along the railway that would emit any disagreeable and unpleasant smell, but I have experienced unpleasant smells two or three months ago—there are some japan places, and manure places, going along the railway, and there are open ditches in the immediate vicinity of this factory; they are made use of as sewers, and I believe they are shown in the ordinance plan as sewers—the railway arches are used for several purposes of a very objectionable character—I have been round and through Burgess's factory a few times, and have not found anything objectionable—I am frequently in that neighbourhood, in consequence of the intended new street, to see that there are toll gates put there, to prevent an evasion of toll; and these houses on the ground marked</p>
