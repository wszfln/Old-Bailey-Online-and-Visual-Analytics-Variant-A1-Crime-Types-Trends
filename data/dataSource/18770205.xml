I am the son of the landlord of this house—on the morning of the 7th January, I heard an alarm and ran upstairs with a light, and I took the knife out of the prisoner's right hand—it was shut up; he was delirious, but he gave me the knife when I asked—I brought him down<lb/>stairs and gave him in charge of the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Westminster Hospital—the prosecutor came on the morning of the 7th—there were two incised wounds on the inner side of the right wrist, about half an inch long—the back one was shorter than the front one—they were very near the artery and bled a good deal, not that day, but afterwards; I saw a small wound on the side of the face, and another small wound on the back of the other wrist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When they say I was drunk it is a falsehood. I went to bed by myself. Two men stood on the stairs and said "Come along old chap." I said "I know my road and I know my bed." I had not lain long when I felt my pillow move. One man caught hold of my trowsers, he got hold of my leg, he crouched down. Then he let go into me and another man gave me a kick in the side. I said "Will you leave go?" but he kept pulling my trowsers, and I hit him on the hand or wrist, for it was dark. He then let go, but he never holloaed "Murder! "nor said a whimper. I put my trowsers on and went downstairs, and there was reading and he said "What's up?" I said "enough's up, I've had three of them on to me and one tried to get my trowsers and I gave him a prick in the hand." He says "You'll have to go to the station," and I gave the knife into his hand. Then we met the constable and he told him about it. The constable asked for the man that was cut, and he said "He'll follow, but he is gone to the hospital," and he came. If Reading had taken the knife out of my hand I could not have brought it downstairs and given it to the constable. One constable says I was sober.</p>

               <p>1875, I became acquainted with the prisoner, and in that month I took her into my employ—I entered into an arrangement with her; it was a free house, gas and all rates and taxes, and 7 1/2 per cent, on the returns—she told me she was married, but I never saw her husband, she said he was a painter, at a guinea a week—her duty was to receive goods brought to the shop, enter them in a book and send them on to Manchester, they were then returned, each with a bill pasted on, with the name of the customer and the amount due, and as the goods were applied for she had to give them out, receive the money and enter it in the cash-book; there were two cash books—we have a stock-book at Manchester as against Ux-bridge, containing all particulars, every item separately—we have to post to the credit of Uxbridge in the stock-book from the cash-book—she kept one cash-book at a time and sent the other to us—from the time she entered my—service to September, 1876, she professed to act according to that rule—I have the books here—between Lady Day, 1875, and September, she paid me 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at different times—I saw her at Uxbridge several times, and spoke to her about the outstand<lb/>ing accounts every time; I urged her to get in the money as I did not pro<lb/>fess to give credit; all 1 said about the credit was at the beginning "If you know any persons in Uxbridge whom you know to be reliable and trustworthy I would not object, but my system is not credit"—when I called her attention to the outstanding accounts, she said "It is no use, we can't do business in Uxbridge without long credit, everybody in Uxbridge gives credit"—she has never accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mrs. Hardy on 25th July, or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 17th August from Mr. Packer, or—16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 15th September from Mr. Birch-towards the end of Septem<lb/>ber, 1876, I went to Uxbridge and saw her—I told her that I could not go on any longer in the way we had been going, because I could not get the money, if she saw her way to take the thing on her own account I would do the work on terms to be arranged—she said she should be very glad, and thought she could do very well, and she could make arrangements whereby she would be able to pay every week as the goods were received; so the matter was arranged, and afterwards invoices of a different class to our own were supplied-from that time she commenced to trade on her own accounts nothing was determined between us at that time as to the amount due from • Uxbridge to Manchester, I simply urged her to get in the monies that were outstanding—on 12th December, in consequence of a telegram from a friend, I went to Uxbridge and found the place shut up; I found the prisoner in the house, next door—she appeared to be in dreadful distress, she said that her husband had run away, had sold up everything and taken the children—I asked her if she could see her way to go on now her husband had gone away;. she said she could, and if I would send on my account and her account under the new arrangement, a Mr. James would pay—I saw Mr. James then and there for the first time; he had lodged with them accord<lb/>ing to her statement—it" was then agreed that she was to go on with the business, and accounts were to be supplied—I told her that a hamper of goods was coming off that night to my own order to Uxbridge—I took her to the station, and said "I will give an order at the station for the goods to come to you on their arrival," in the meantime I sent up Mr. Passmore, my clerk, next day before the goods could arrive—I went back to Manchester, Mr. Passmore communicated with me, and in consequence of that I applied for a warrant—I afterwards received this letter from the prisoner; it is her</p>

               <p>had been drinking on this occasion; she was not so drunk as I have seen her, but she was quiet drunk—the prisoner was decidedly sober; he drank sometimes, I never remember their quarrelling if the wife was perfectly sober—I con<lb/>sidered her disordered in the head, and when she took a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> drink she was very quarrelsome, and with her tongue she was very aggravating when she bad had drink, but with' no one else than her husband—she seemed all right when she had her tea—I should think that Wren had no idea she was hurt—she had frequently complained to me of her side before.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, Elizabeth Wren, believing myself about to die, do hereby solemnly declare that I had been out with my hus<lb/>band this afternoon, that we returned home between 4 and 5 p.m., and that we had a quarrel about some money affairs, my husband being in drink at he time. I was quite sober. He was very angry indeed; came up to me while I was standing beside the table and struck me on the face and then in the stomach with his fiat. I fell on the floor, and then he struck me several more blows in the stomach; cannot say whether he used his hand or his fist. I swear that I did not strike him first, but she flew at him afterwards and scratched his face. Severe pain in the abdomen came on about half an hour after the accident. My husband is frequently in the habit of beating me. I left him in the house when I came away. Signed, Elizabeth Wren, X</p>

She died about 10 o'clock the next morning—the cause of death was rupture of the <hi rend="italic">aorta</hi>—such an injury sometimes arises from natural causes—it did not in this case—I am certain it was produced in part by violence, but had the vessel been perfectly healthy perhaps the violence would not have been suffi<lb/>cient to cause a rupture—any violence might have caused it—a fall, blow, or anything over the region of the injury—a blow inflicted where I found the bruise would have been likely to produce it.</p>

The <hi rend="italic">aorta</hi> is a large vessel of the heart, the rupture of it might not cause immediate death—it would depend on the extent of the rupture and the amount of blood that escaped—the rupture was not di<lb/>rectly through it, but it extended between the coats to some distance—it was an extensive rupture, but still it was obliquely through the walls of the artery—I found a bruise outside the chest, and between that and the inside, by the artery I found the tissues buried in extravasated blood—the time between such an injury and death would be very variable; they generally die directly—there was nothing inconsistent with what I saw in her walking to the hospital—I mentioned before that she had some brain changes; I don't think that appears on the evidence.</p>

I happened to say that the boy said he was hungry, and she began to blackguard me, and him too, and I said "Why didn't you come home instead of going about the streets all day?" She was very near drunk at 12 o'clock, and so she was at 2 o'clock. It was all in a few minutes; she nearly pulled me to pieces. I have had to stop at home for two or three days out of the week.

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer of 8, Northumberland Street, Strand—on 29th December I went to the office of Messrs. Abrahams—&amp; Roffey; and on Saturday, the 30th, I went to Marlborough Street police-court and swore an information against a man named Kerr and others, for fraud and conspiracy—on the Sunday evening I was sent for to Islington police-station, and saw Kerr in custody—I had had frequent opportunities of seeing him before and knew him well—on Monday morning, January 1st, the prisoner Stenning called at my house—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—he did not ask my name; my name is on my door—he said "You recognised the person who was arrested last night at the Islington police-court, but you recognised him by gas-light, don't you think it is quite possible that you have recognised the wrong person?"—I said "You allude, of course, to Kerr, one of the four parties who formerly occupied the suite of apartments in this house?"—he said "Yes; Kerr and I have often been taken as brothers, in fact, I have known him from his youth up, he is a very good fellow; have you any-animosity towards me? and could you not go to the Marlborough Street police-office to-day, when the prisoner Kerr is brought up, and say that you have mistaken the person's identity?"—he also said "You could not positively deny the identity, might you not say that you are not quite sure about the identity?"—my reply was that Kerr, with others, had been visiting those chambers at 8, Northumberland Street for nearly a month, and were in and out five or six times a day; that Kerr was a very tall man and so easily to be known, that I could not possibly fail to recognise him—he said that if I would go to the Court and say that he was not the right man, or that I thought he was not the right man, he was prepared at once to pay any reasonable amount of money for my doing so, and asked me to accompany him to the Northumberland Hotel close by, to carry out—his plan—I refused to do so—I told him I could not possibly contradict the information, to which I had sworn, which had led to the arrest of Kerr—that conversation took place shortly after 11 a.m., and by 11.30 I had communicated what took place to the police at Scotland Yard, and at 2 o'clock that day I went to Marlborough Street—I saw the prisoner outside the Court about 1.50—he spoke to me—he brought up a gentleman who I had not previously known—he did not introduce him to me, but I after<lb/>wards found him to be a practising solicitor of that Court, called Froggatt, who repeated the offers to bribe me, but he put it in a more definite shape—I told him that it was impossible that I could state anything but the actual facts, that I had been called upon by the prosecution to simply identify the party, and I could not deviate from my proper course of action—the Court opened at 2 o'clock, and Mr. Froggatt followed me into the Court, and to make the conversation, as I suppose, much more secret, invited me to the passage leading to the cells of the Court, by the goaler's room, and he there offered to give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Stenning was not there—after that I went into Court and identified Kerr—I had no further conversation with Stenning—I had never seen Stenning or Froggatt in my life before January 1st.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> His Lordship and the Jury <hi rend="italic">were</hi> not at the police-court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every word I have told you to-day came out then, but not in the same words—by being frustrated I mean that in the middle of the charge Mr. Froggatt jumped up in the Court and the legal gentleman for the Crown seemed to fancy that he was a privileged person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean to assert that you brought that charge against Mr. Froggatt at the police-court, and that Mr. Poland, acting for the Crown, stopped it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was Mr. Newton suggested that the attorney was an agent, and that matters between an attorney and his client could not be dealt with; that was the inference; I do not mean to say that Mr. Newton said that after, I said that Mr. Froggatt had attempted to bribe me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now you are making accusations against the Magistrate, do you mean to say that you told Mr. Newton that Mr. Froggatt, outside the police-court, had put this attempt to bribe you in a more definite form and that Mr. Newton refused to hear it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not tell him the exact words, I was stopped—I have given it in evidence that Mr. Froggatt attempted to bribe me—I never said a word at the police-court about Mr. Froggatt offering me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was in the brief—I have not sworn it in any court of justice before to<lb/>day, I had no opportunity, I should if I had had an opportunity—this is the first time in my life that I ever heard that a reward was offered for the apprehension of Kerr and the others; that I swear.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 99, Stanley Street, Pimlico, and am the widow of the deceased—I have known the prisoner, I should think over twelve months—the first time I saw him was in the Harrow Road, talking to my niece Carry Stephens, and she introduced him to me—I saw him twice after that at Mrs. Stephens'—the first time he came to our house was to fetch a hamper to take into Cornwall—I think that was sometime in October last year, be came in Mr-Stephen's trap and took the hamper away with him; that was the first time Mr. Collins saw him, I introduced him to him; he stayed somewhere about half an hour, they sat and talked some time, I don't know what about, I was there part of the time—the next time he came was on Thursday, 14th December, he had only been to the house once before that, that was when he came for the hamper; to the best of my recollection, that was the only time—on 14th December he came a little before 12.45, I let him in—after wishing me good morning, he said "Is Selina here"—she is a sister of Carry Stephens—I did not know that "he was engaged to be married to Carry but I knew that they kept company—he said he had had a letter from Selina to meet him there at 1 o'clock; he looked up at the clock and said "I am before ray time, it now wants a quarter"—he did not show me any letter—Mr. Collins was at home at that time, and he asked him to stay to dinner—we were in the front kitchen; he marked some new linen for me—I said to him "It is no use to have friends, Mr. Treadaway, unless you make use of them," and he said "No, what is it?"—I said "To mark some new linen for me, will you do it?" and he said "Yes"—all this took place in the front kitchen, which we use as a sitting room; he stayed to dinner with Mr. Collins and me—after dinner he wrote a letter, Mr. Collins gave him paper and envelope, and I gave him a stamp—after that I told him I was going to Paddington if I could get my work done—I went to Paddington about 4 o'clock, leaving him and Mr. Collins there, talking very comfortably together—I returned about 10.45 the same evening; the prisoner was then gone—Mr. Collins met me just outside the gate, waiting for me to come home—I saw the prisoner again next morning, the 15th, he came to our house about 10.30; I let him in at the area door, which we generally use—after wishing me good morning, he said "Is Mr. Collins in?"—I said he was not in, but he would be soon, and asked him to walk in—I put Mr. Collins' easy chair for him to sit down in the front kitchen—he said he was very tired—I asked him if he had got the letter in his pocket that he had told me the day before he had from Selina—he said "No, I have not been home all night, I have been walking about. I have not been to bed"—I said "You must be very tired," and I gave him a cushion to his back, and asked him to get a doze before Mr. Collins came in; but he did not seem sleepy—I then told him who I had seen at Paddington, and what passed there, and who took me to the 'bus—he asked how they all were; he meant my neice, and the Stephens—I told him they were all very well, with the exception of Mrs. Stephens, and as he knew she was never very well—he asked me if the workmen had—their meals there, if the workmen were there to tea—I said no, I never saw any workmen have any meals there; he said they did—Mr. Collins had not come in 'during that time, he came in about 11 o'clock, and came into the front kitchen; he</p>

               <p>wished the prisoner good morning, and asked him if he had had his break<lb/>fast—he said he had—I told Mr. Collins that he wanted to speak to him—Mr. Collins had been to the butcher's for a piece of mutton to boil for dinner, and he brought it in with him and put it on the dresser, and I went to prepare the dinner and left them talking together in an ordinary way, as people would—I did not hear what they were talking about, I did not pay any attention—I went in and out a good many times—I was cooking the dinner in the front kitchen, as we had no fire in the back kitchen that day—there is no door communicating between the front and back kitchens; you go out of the front kitchen door into the passage, and then a step or two into the back kitchen—they were talking together all the time I was getting the dinner ready—it was ready about 1.30 as near as I can think, I could not tell justly—before the mutton was quite ready Mr. Collins asked me to prepare him a basin of broth, and he said to the prisoner "Are you a hand at broth"—he said he was not hungry—Mr. Collins had his broth; I poured the prisoner out a glass of ale, and he drank it, and I ate my dinner—I did not wait for the mutton, I had a chop, which I had prepared separately—when I took up the dinner I asked the prisoner to come, and I saw Mr. Collins carve for him and likewise for himself—when I <hi rend="italic">left</hi> the kitchen he was still sitting in the armchair; I took up the dinner and left it on the table, and went into the other kitchen to make a pudding—whether he ate the dinner or not I don't know; I was out quite long enough for him to have done so—when I came into the front kitchen again he was still sitting in the chair, and Mr. Collins had finished his dinner and moved round, sitting in a different position talking to him; instead of sitting at the table eating his dinner he had turned himself round, talking; they were very near together—I then cleared away all the dinner things off the table, and went into the back kitchen—I was backwards and forwards clearing away; there were a great many things—during all that time they were in the kitchen talking together—once when I went in I saw the prisoner looking at a fiddle that Mr. Collins had hanging up on a nail on the wall; he was standing with one foot on the sofa and reaching at the fiddle, as though he had been looking at it; he was hanging it up again—when I left them there was only the distance of the table between them; Mr. Collins was sitting, and the prisoner was standing at the side of the table nearest the kitchen door—I saw him standing, hat in hand, as though he was going; I could not swear whether he was sitting the last time I saw him or whether he was standing, hat in hand, but I saw him both sitting and standing at different times—when I went in Mr. Collins was still sitting in the chair in the same place—up to that time I heard nothing to notice, they were talking in an ordi<lb/>nary way, nothing loud or anything to attract attention—the last time I went out of the front kitchen I went into the back kitchen to fetch a pan to get some hot water to wash up, and I had scarcely got to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> table when I heard a loud report; I turned momentarily round to go to see what it was, and I met the prisoner in the doorway of the back kitchen, he was coming towards me; that was not his way out, he was coming into the back kitchen—I said to him "What's that"—he said "I don't knew"—the words were scarcely uttered when be fired again; I saw the flash and heard the report, it was like a hot, heavy blow, it struck me in the ear, and I felt the blood trickling down my neck—I reeled round, but I did not fall—I saw the prisoner go along the passage to the area door—I don't know whether he had his hat on—I went after him and caught him by the coat</p>

               <p>at the area door; I opened my mouth to cry murder, and he put his hand in my mouth so that I could not speak, and with the other hand he took me by the neck and threw me down outside the area door, and he beat my head on the pavement stones; he did that several times—I struggled hard for life as he knelt upon me, and I got one of my hands loose—he still held me—as he was leaning over me I took him by his shirt-front, or something, I don't know what—I then found that I was regaining my feet—I tried to get up—he loosed me and went up the area steps rather quickly, at least it seemed quick to me—I put my other hand to the floor to try to get up, and I did get up, and I put my hand in a pool of "blood—I went up the area steps to try and catch him—I went a few steps on the pavement, and begged of the passers by to send for a doctor, and a policeman to take him, as he had murdered my husband and had shot me—I then turned back and went into the front kitchen—I could not tell you justly the time between my hearing the first shot and the time he ran up the area steps; it was not long, it seemed long to me, but it could not be many minutes—when I went into the front kitchen I said "What has he done? what has he done? has he shot you?"—my husband was lying down on the kitchen floor on the oilcloth—I knelt over him and begged of him to speak to me, but he was gone; he did not speak; I felt he was dead—the only sign of life I saw was just a slight quivering of the lip, and my only hope on earth was gone—there was no one living in the house with my husband and myself but a very aged lady, who was in bed at the time in the back drawing-room—we had a gentleman lodger, but he did not come home till late, after 6 o'clock in the evening—there was no one else in the" house at the time—I have no children—Mrs. Stephens is Mr. Collins' sister; her husband is a ladder-maker—my husband did not do anything in business lately, he was formerly a builder, he only did little odd things for himself in his own houses; he would have men to look after the houses, and he superintended; he had some house property—sometimes his nephew collected the rents from those houses, and sometimes himself—as a rule we kept the money upstairs—when there was any large quantity (<hi rend="italic">it</hi> was seldom there was any large amount in the house) it was kept upstairs in the room we slept in—there has been some hundreds sometimes, there was at one time; Mr. Collins bought two houses in Winchester Street, and he paid it all away, the last large amount we had I think that was more than a year ago—he wore a belt to strengthen his back, he was very weak in his back, he made use of it when he went into Cornwall to take some money with him, and I put a little brown-holland pocket in it to carry his money in—he never used that afterwards for the same purpose only when he went there, to save me the trouble of sending money to him.</p>

               <p>he was there about half an hour—on Thursday, 14th December, I left home bout 4 o'clock, leaving the prisoner alone with Mr. Collins; before I left I had gone several times into the room an I sat there while they were talking—I did not pay the least attention to what they were saying—the prisoner never asked me to lend him any money—I never heard him ask my hus<lb/>band to lend him money—on the Friday when he came in and said that he was very tired I did not observe that he looked very tired; I thought if he was tired a doze would do him good—after dinner 1 was in and out several times before I went with the pan—it was when I was taking something in or fetching something away that I saw the fiddle—at one time I fancy he was standing with his hat in his hand, as though he was going; Mr. Collins was not standing up too at that time, he was sitting—I could not swear whether the prisoner was sitting or standing the last time I was in the room—I never heard any high words or noticed any angry looks either about Mr. Collins or the prisoner, or any loud talking—I had just left the room to fetch a pan to take into the front kitchen to draw-some hot water—I had just got into the back kitchen when I heard the noise.</p>

I am the wife of John Gibbons, of-Westmoreland Street, Pimlico—on Friday, 15th December, about 3.15, or from that to 3.30, I was in Stanley Street, Pimlico, walking along on the opposite side to Mr. Collins' house—I heard a cry of "Oh, oh;" I saw nothing; it was a female voice in distress—I then heard another cry of distress a little louder and then I saw Mrs. Collins partly up the area steps, the head and shoulders; she was the first I saw; there was no one else there at that moment; she ried "Stop him! Stop him!"—at that time I was crossing the road towards the house, and as I was looking a young man opened the door and came out of the street door—by that time Mrs. Collins was at the top of the area steps—the young man came out of Mr. Collins' street door, the front door with steps to it; he opened the door and came out and left the door open after him—the area gate is at the further end of the area—at the time I saw them there was the length of the area between them—a female came up and Mrs. Collins was speaking to her as she came past, and I came over sideways and met him, I was about 2 feet from him—I recognised him when I was at the police-court, I had never seen him before; that is the young man (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>); he went down Sussex Street, turned the corner into Sussex Street, and passed into Cambridge Street, he was running very swiftly; he had a soft crowned hat on and he had his right hand to it, his left hand was under his coat—when he ran J saw something bright in his left hand when the flap of of his coat was blown aside by the wind—I saw his face as he was coming out; I have not the least doubt" that the prisoner is the man.</p>

In the course of Friday, 15th December, I received a communication at our station, in consequence of which instructions were given to watch various parts of the metropolis—on Saturday night, 16th December, shortly after 12 o'clock, I arrived at the Isleworth police-station, in company with Sayer—I found that the prisoner had been only charged with the murder of Mr. Collins, and I caused him to be charged with the attempted murder of Mrs. Collins.; when the charge was entered on the sheet, he was brought in from the cell, and I told him that he would be so charged—at first he made no response; he seemed partially stupefied, as if he did not hear what I had said to him, and I said "Did you hear me, do you understand what I am saying to you?"—I then re<lb/>peated the substance of the additional charge to him, to which he replied "I don't know how I came to do it; it seems a blank to me"—a four-wheeled cab was obtained, and he was put into it, and we brought him to London—on the way from Isleworth we passed through a dirty lane; I mentioned it to Sayers, and the prisoner said "Oh, yes; I know that place; I came through that lane on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> way to see Mrs. Wiggins; I know this part part very well; I know my way about here very well"—in the course of our journey to London, I asked him where he got the revolver, adding that his father had told me that he never saw such a thing in his possession—he said "I bought it on Thursday morning, shortly after leaving home, at a pawnbroker's shop in the Seven Sisters' Road; I intended to use it;" I am not positive whether he said "for," or "on myself; things were very miserable at home, and I could obtain no employment"—he said "After the affair, I went towards Hyde Park, and so across the Regent's Park, and then to Kentish Town; I had been out all the previous night, at least,</p>

               <p>from 5 o'clock in the morning; I felt tired"—he then spoke of the follow<lb/>ing morning, Saturday morning, and said "When I left Kentish Town, I did not know where I was going, or what I was doing; I only had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., with a penny of which I bought a newspaper, to read about the affair; it was all wrong. I did not take a cab, or go to Victoria for the purpose of going to Dover; I had no money; with the other penny I bought 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of returns—when I went out that morning, I went through Finchley and Barnet, towards St. Albans, and finding at what place I was, I retraced my steps towards London, thinking I should like to see Mrs. Wiggins once more, and I did not want to be apprehended in London; on reaching Kentish Town, I found a pair of spectacles, which I put on and wore through Kensington and Hammersmith"—that was all that took place in the cab—on reaching the station, he was placed in a cell with a man in care of him—on the Sunday evening, he asked me for pens, ink, and paper to write a letter—I told him he could have them, but that I should read • what he wrote before sending it away—he said "I only want to write to Mrs. Milton to explain to her why I cut off my whiskers at her house as that seemed to surprise her"—I said "You had better not write the letter if you wish to see Mrs. Milton, or any other friend, I will send for them for you"—no letter was written, nor did they come.</p>

I am a physician and surgeon, and live at 55, Gloucester Street, Pimlico—on 15th December, about 3.25 in the afternoon, I was called to 99, Stanley Street—I knew the family—the area door was open—I saw a pool of blood on the steps downstairs, so I went down the area steps and into the front kitchen—I there saw the deceased John Collins lying on his back, dead—Mrs. Collins was kneeling by his side—I first took notice of Mr. Collins—there was a small wound on the outside of the left eyebrow, about half an inch in length, and six or seven small spots of blood on the front of the shirt—the wound was on the external angle of the left eyebrow—my opinion at that moment was, hearing that he had been shot, that the bullet had entered there—I made do further examination of him at that time, with this exception, that I undid his dress and unbuckled the belt that was round the waist; it was a broad belt, partly elastic and</p>

               <p>partly leather, used for supporting the body—I handed that to the police<lb/>man, and I think he said there was a pocket to it, but I did not see it myself—I then turned my attention to Mrs. Collins; she was bleeding fast from the left ear, in great pain and distress; I got her seated and endeavoured to stop the hemoarrhage—there was not any visible wound at that time, the hemoarrhage prevented my seeing it—there was also a little blood at the back of the throat and in the mouth—there were finger marks in front of the neck as if from attempted strangulation, and there were two or three places where the skin was taken off as if by the nail of a hand—he head was very much bruised, and there was a swelling beginning to appear under the left ear; before I left, in fact, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> became a large lump—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body of Mr. Collins, on 18th December—I found that the wound outside the left eyebrow was not a penetrating wound, and in all probability had been caused by a fall; there was a large chest of drawers on one side of the body and a table on the other—there was a small wound on the left side of the upper part of the neck behind the sternum mascoid muscle, which, on dissection, I found went inwards and backwarks a little to the spine—a bullet had penetrated the first and second vertebrae of the spinal column, fracturing those bones; that was where the bullet had entered—it had penetrated the spinal column wound<lb/>ing the medulla oblangatae, and so causing instant death—I extracated that bullet and produce it—there were no other marks of violence on the body—subsequently, on 9th January, I made another examination of Mr. Collins, which resulted in an operation, and' I extracted a bullet from under the scalp at the back of the head; I—produce that bullet; it is very much battered and grooved, and there is a small portion of the-bone of the head still remaining in the bullet—it had taken off just the edge of the trachis of the ear and then passed under the scalp, travelling about 4 inches—Dr. Oates was present at that operation and also at <hi rend="italic">the post-mortem.</hi>

Before I lived there—I don't know what kind of fits they were—she used to struggle very much, and she was quite black in the face when she was in them—she was very violent; it used to take me and her father to keep her down—she used to bite pieces out of the glasses—she was ill before the fit came on—she used to be very strange about the place—I could always tell because. I used to watch her; she would be so, perhaps, for a day, or perhaps only a few hours before the fit came on—she used to be very strange in her eyes, and in her manners; I could—tell from that when they were coming on—she complained of pains in—her head before they came on; she did not describe the pains at all, no more than that they were very shooting pains, darting—she did not complain of anything <hi rend="italic">else</hi> in particular; the was very ill after the fits for days—she was not able to be about after a fit; a fit would last sometimes an hour and sometimes more, and afterwards she looked very haggard about the eyes, very worn, and very wild—she had a very wild look for days—she was not at all conscious during the fit—she used to foam very much at the mouth; I was not with her up to her death—the mother was a very great invalid; she was very curious in the head; she used to say all sorts of horrible things, and sometimes throw things at me; she used to swear at me sometimes—she has thrown a cruet-stand "at" me—she was never able to do anything, because she always had some one with her nearly—she was passionate—she could not manage the house at all; she would care for nothing of that—I knew the prisoner's father—his name is George.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Eastwood Terrace, Hornsey Road, and carry on business there as an outfitter—the prisoner is my son—he was twenty—one this month—he was brought up in the country until the age of seven, on account of his health, at Isllingdon—he afterwards lived with me in the Harrow Road, Paddington—he went to the Philological School until he was fifteen years of age, and then he was in my shop with me for a year or two to learn business habits—he was for two or three years in several situations down to August, 1876—he used to come home occasionally; up to the time of his going into those situations he was very kind and good-natured—on a Saturday, I think in July or August, he came home from his situation to stay till the Monday, and on the Sunday morning I was out walking with him in the Holloway Road close to the Liverpool Road, we were on the left hand side of the way approaching the Liverpool Road, when I felt him stagger against me—I said "What is the matter, Fred, don't you feel well?" he mumbled something indistinctly, I could not understand what it was, but I noticed that his eyes appeared as if the sight was going; he then fainted; he lost his muscular power—he did not fall to the ground, only up against me—I dragged him into a door<lb/>way, and rubbed his back and opened his hands and rubbed them, and kept speaking to him, but he was not conscious—I took his hat off—he seemed to be quite unconscious of what I was doing, he could not speak to me—this lasted altogether, I think, as near as possible twenty minutes—he trembled very much, and shook violently and turned deadly pale, and then afterwards seemed gradually to recover—the first words he said to me were "I am burning in the throat, do get me something to drink"—I could not get anything to drink, but I got two oranges, which were the nearest things I could get, and he sucked the juice of the two oranges, and it seemed to make him much better; he gradually recovered—this happened about a mile from home—I walked home with him—we stopped once under the railway bridge for a few minutes—he was very weak, and he complained of, his head burning very much—he managed to walk home all right—he had slept at my house the night before—when we got home he complained of feeling very bad in his head, and he laid down on the sofa some time, and stopped in all the afternoon—I think he was asleep all the afternoon on the sofa, I know he was upstairs—when we started on our walk he appeared to be quite well; I did not notice anything unusual—once when we were living at 28, Harrow Road, he was sent to a chemist's, and he came home with his face cut and said that he had had a fit in Doctor Watts' shop—that must have been in the year 1873—there was a mark on his face, a graze, not a cut—he did not make any complaint particularly to me, he did to his mother—I did not attend to him then—he complained of his head all that day afterwards—he left his last situation in September, 1876, or the last week in August—during the last months that he was there he complained—frequently of his head aching very much, and he frequently</p>

               <p>affinity between insanity and epilepsy—the hereditary transmission of insanity applies also to the hereditary transmission of epilepsy; I mean to say that epileptic vertigo is transmissible—it is possible that a person may have a taint of insanity and be subject to epileptic vertigo—a person out of his mind may have epileptic vertigo—I have seen specific instances of persons with epileptic vertigo acting automatically—on one occasion when I happened to be travelling abroad it was brought to my knowledge that one of the officers of the ship attempted to commit suicide on several occa<lb/>sions, and on conversing with him on the subject he denied all knowledge of the facts stated against him, but witnesses were produced to show that he had done so on several occasions; what I actually saw was this, I was called to him in a hurry, and I had reason to believe he was suffering from opium poisoning; upon applying the stomach pump I extracted about a pint of laudanum out of his stomach, and while performing this operation he was perfectly sensible, and denied all knowledge of having taken it—I believed that; I questioned him as to what he had taken; he was not able to answer me; he told me that he was quite unconscious of having taken anything—my attention was called to the fact that he looked ill, and when I went to him he complained of being ill, but when I asked him why, he said he did not know—I afterwards saw that the laudanum bottle in the doctor's cabin was quite empty, and there were dregs of laudanum in the bottom of a tumbler—I believe that was a case of epileptic vertigo—I believe from all the circumstances of the case that on all those occasions upon which he attempted to commit suicide he was unconscious of the fact that he had done so—that is a symptom of epileptic vertigo, and that was my conclusion from what he said—I have known other cases of automatic action in persons suffering from epileptic vertigo, cases of a similar character, and I came to the conclusion on much the same grounds—while I was house-physician I remember one case of a man who was brought into the hospital suffering from some slight complaint of his lungs, and various complaints were made against him for assaulting the patients in the wards at different times—I was informed by the nurses that this was done appa<lb/>rently while under the influence of a fit—I did not see them absolutely myself, but I was obliged to dismiss the man for his conduct—besides the cases that have come under my observation, I have, in the study of the profession, become acquainted with this disease of epilepsy divided into its various forms of epeleptic vertigo and epileptic fits; that is known to medical science; it is not a recognised form of mental derangement; all those fits of unconsciousness are included under the term epilepsy—the fact of a. man being epileptic does not necessarily mean that he is insane, but epilepsy may frequently be associated with insanity, and frequently it is; it may not be so necessarily, it may so wear out the brain as in time to make the person insane—at the time of the attack of vertigo the patient is unconscious—during the time of an attack of epileptic vertigo the person can perform acts of which he is unconscious, and speak, but not rationally; he may speak apparently rationally—I have not known such an instance—it is a part of medical science, known to medical men, that a person labouring under epileptic vertigo can talk rationally; they can answer questions—they may answer questions to the point, although it may not be rationally—there are a good many writers upon this subject, eminent medical men; among the English there are Doctors Maudslay, Jackson, Russell, and Reynolds, and among the French there are Trousseau, Fabret, and Esquirol; they</p>

               <p>are the principal writers upon epilepsy, they are living men and have had experience—it is after an acquaintance with the writings of those authors that I have given the last answer—I was requested by the solicitor conduct<lb/>ing this defence to attend at the Westminster police-court when the accused, was under charge; that was on the second examination, I believe, on the 26th December—I did not see the attack spoken to by Inspector Foignett; nothing occurred to attract my notice, I did not see anything the matter with him then; I have seen him on five occasions, including that time—he has answered any question that I may have put to him—on the first occa<lb/>sion I saw him at the Westminster police-court and on three occasions at the House of Detention and had three interviews with him—on the last two occasions I saw him in Newgate—during those interviews I had occasion to examine him physically and as a result of that examinational did not dis<lb/>cover any unhealthy condition—I then interrogated him as to his past health and he stated that he had been in good health till two years ago; he said that about that time he had what he termed a fainting fit in a chemist's shop; he described the fainting fit to me—he said that since then he had six or eight seizures of a similar character, and that in addition to those he had been subject during the last two years to very frequent and violent headaches—he said also that during this time he had been in the habit of occasionally passing water in 'bed during sleep—he also said that he had be liable to various nervous pains, more especially that which is medically termed angina pectoris, that is the name I give from his description—he said that since August last he had been in a very depressed and melancholic con<lb/>dition; he said he brooded over his troubles to such an extent that he sub<lb/>sequently formed the idea of committing suicide—he further stated that several plans of performed suicide suggested themselves to his mind, but that he finally determined upon a pistol as being the most expeditious and one that he was likely to have the resolution to carry out—finally he stated that on the morning of the 15th he had a very severe headache, and that while sitting with Mr. Collins he was seized with a violent shooting pain in the head, with giddiness, and with the sensation of a black cloud coming over his senses, and from that moment his mind was a blank until he found himself in the street—most of this was told upon the second interview that I had with him—he also stated that for the remainder of that day he felt head<lb/>ache and confused in his ideas, and towards the evening he felt quite well—these statements came out in the course of conversation with me—I did not tell him what I came to see him for, I told him I was a doctor come to see after his health; I did not in any way suggest the answers to my questions—supposing all these statements to be true, it indicated a form of disease known as epileptic vertigo—it was at the second interview, but the first that 1 had at the House of Detention, that he spoke about a dark cloud—I had an opportunity of conversing with him freely there—I think the 3rd of February was the last time I saw him—I saw his illness yesterday in the dock—the fit itself was somewhat of an anomalous character, but, in my opinion, it was decidedly of an epileptic form—I mean to say that it did not represent the characteristic symptoms of an epileptic fit; some of them did, but not all; it was somewhat more prolonged than is usual, and some of the symptoms were varied from what is common in that disease—I accom<lb/>panied him into the cell—total insensibility is one characteristic sign of epe<lb/>lepsy, and dilitation of the pupils and a seeming unconscious stupor, which for some time succeeded the attack—I tested the Question of total insensi<lb/>bility</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The learned Judge read to the witness that portion of the fathers evidence which referred to the illness of the prisoner when walking with him.</hi>) It is impossible for me to give an opinion from the description of one attack; I should not care to do so; some of the symptoms so described are quite consistent with epileptic vertigo, but the same symptoms might, to a certain extent, belong to other affections; there is nothing definitely characteristic—I could form an opinion if I had more than one fit described to me—the involuntary passing of water at night in sleep is a common symptom of epileptic seizure during sleep—the shooting and throbbing pains in the head are quite con<lb/>sistent with an epileptic attack, they are very frequently associated with it—an epileptic attack is very frequently followed by headache—fainting fits occur without being followed by headache, but very frequently they are—the symptoms which he described to me and which I term angina pectoris, was a pain and a sensation of a cord being drawn tightly round his chest, that very frequently accompanies epilepsy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Epilepsy is a disease of the brain—the patient is un<lb/>conscious during the attack—it always takes away consciousness—a violent act, of which the person knows nothing afterwards, is not necessarily an indication of epileptic vertigo, but during an attack of epileptic vertigo a person may do violent actions—in my own personal observation I have never seen an attack of epileptic vertigo last more than two or three minutes, but the effects usually last for many hours afterwards—it may show itself coming on—during that state of unconsciousness a person may do acts, not necessarily of violence, but an extraordinary act which he may not be able to recollect when he recovers; he would not be able to say what he had done; that is the characteristic; I mean to say that when he comes to himself after this unconscious condition he will answer questions intelli<lb/>gibly—it has not come under my own personal experience to ask a person questions in that condition—in the case of the man on board ship, he was, not given to opium eating, nor was he a hard drinker—I had watched him for some months previous to this, during which time complaints were being brought to me that on several occasions he had attempted to commit suicide—I had not myself seen him attempt to commit suicide—when I went to see the prisoner at the House of Detention I did not intimate to Dr. Smiles that I was going to see him—I wrote to the Governor telling him I was going to see him—Dr. Smiles was not present—there is nothing in the description I have heard read to me in reference to his appearance on the Sunday that is inconsistent with an ordinary fainting fit—the prisoner is not delicately framed—he seemed to me of fair organisation—he does not appear to me to be at all of a delicate frame.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D., and member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.; I am resident physician at Bethlehem Royal Hospital, and lecturer on mental diseases at St. Thomas's Hospital—in my personal experience I have come across many cases of epilepsy—the medical profession recognise epileptic vertigo as a disease—some years ago I saw a gentleman who simply suffered from headache occasionally; at that time I had no suspicion of epilepsy; one morning suddenly whilst at breakfast he made a violent attack upon his wife; when I saw him shortly afterwards he could give me no account of it, nor any reason for so doing, he did not after that show any symptoms of mental disease, but he had subsequently at various intervals, some nine or ten epileptic fits—he had one about a month after he made the attack upon his wife; he continued under medical care about fourteen months; I heard of him about two years ago, he had then resumed his ordinary occupation and was perfectly well, and had no return of the fits, and he had-had ten or eleven in all—I heard of him about eighteen months ago, he was then well—I have not heard more recently—that is the only case I have seen that appears to me remarkable; I have seen others—a person attacked with epileptic vertigo is unconscious while he is committing the act, unconscious of what he may be doing, not insensible—from my own observation I can't say whether they can speak, they do acts automatically—all they do is automatic, that is the state they are in; I ground my opinion upon that; that is the definition of it; they act as mere machines, and when they recover they are utterly unconscious of anything that has happened—sometimes there may be perfect conscious<lb/>ness, perfect sanity before the attack—while under the influence of the vertigo they know not what they do, but I have seen cases where there is an impression afterwards of having done something, but they cannot tell what—the length of the attack varies very much, the longest I have ever seen lasted about an hour, the party being unconscious the whole of that time, but as a rule they are of very much shorter duration—I have been present during this trial; the symptoms described of constant headaches, passing water unconsciously during the night, and the pains described, correspond exactly with cases which I have had under my care, and which have been undoubtedly epileptic vertigo—I think they are characteristic of it—epilepsy, I think, would tend to shorten life, but not insanity—epilepsy is a disease of the brain—if there is an heredi<lb/>tary transmission of insanity, there may very probably be an hereditary transmission of epilepsy—yesterday I went into the jail and saw the prisoner in his illness—unfortunately I did not see him during the attack, only after, and he had been taken down before I got into the jail—he was unconscious when I went in—the pupils of the eye were dilated—I was not present when the unconsciousness was tested—an attempt to thwart or</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and am medical superintendent at Hanwell Lunatic Asylum—Mary Stilwell was in the asylum from October 12th, 1874, and died on 13th January, 1875; she was of unsound mind, she was not dangerous, except to herself; she was reckless and would get into mischief; she would tumble about and be liable to break her bones, not liable to suicide, or dangerous to anybody else—I have had many epe<lb/>leptic patients under my care for the last five years; I have averaged about 115 at a time constantly in the asylum, epileptic lunatics—I have seen several persons afflicted with epileptic vertigo, where it did not go beyond vertigo—I quite agree with the last two witnesses that a person in a fit of epileptic vertigo is unconscious at the time of any act he may commit—I have on several occasions had patients afflicted with epileptic vertigo who have attempted violence upon myself; I can recall to mind one that occurred about twelve months ago, a woman of the name of Fanny Sheward who was an epe<lb/>leptic, but who, before the attack of epilepsy, used to have these attacks of epileptic vertigo—on one occasion she was talking very agreeably and sen<lb/>sibly, and suddenly I saw that her mind seemed to get vacant; she did not look at me in the face, and she suddenly hit out at me, and as soon as that was done she went on talking in the same agreeable strain—I said to her "Why did you hit me?"—she said "I don't think I hit you, I don't remem<lb/>ber anything about it at all"—I have had other attacks made upon me by others, but I cannot recollect them so distinctly; those persons were afflicted with epileptic vertigo, alternating with epilepsy—this Sheward, some day or two after that had a violent attack of epilepsy and was much convulsed—in the other cases where the attempts were made upon me the patients, after recovering from the fit, were quite unconscious of what they had done—I saw the prisoner yesterday as he was coming out of the fit; he was uncon<lb/>scious then, but was not actually in the fit; from the symptoms I saw I formed the opinion that it was an epileptic fit, with some modified symptoms.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Jeffery, and live at 1, Wellington Place, Old Woolwich Road—I did not know the prisoner before Thursday evening, the 9th November last, when she brought a child to me—she said she had brought the baby to me to nurse—she did not say it was her own, but my daughter had previously told me so—she did not say how long I was to have it, she was to come every Sunday evening to see it, she came the following Sunday evening—she appeared to be very fond of the child—I found I could not manage the baby with my family, and on Sunday, 10th December, I told her to take it away as soon as she could—she said she would come on the" Thursday, the 14th, if she could—she did come and took it away, she said she had got two persons who were going to adopt it, she did not tell me who they were; I asked if it was far off, she said "No, not far off"—she said she was not to see it very often—I did not ask their names—I put on the child's outside clothing, it had been dressed all day—I had dressed it myself except its frock which I put on that night; it had on a chemise, flannel stays, a flannel petticoat with a body to it, a white petticoat, a red cotton frock with a body to it, and a pelisse; it had no roller; the flannel stays were of a double thickness—the child was six weeks old when I had it—it was very well when it was' taken away; it had been very well all day; ft seemed easy—I had not used any needle in dressing it, it was all hooks and buttons, and ties—the prisoner went away with it, just before 7 o'clock—she brought it back again just before 10 o'clock, the child was then screaming and crying very much; she knocked at the door and said "There is something the matter with this child"—I said "I don't know what can be the matter, perhaps the night air has made it ill"—my husband was—in the back-room and hearing the child scream, so he called out to me to take it to the doctor's—the prisoner said she had got some medicine to give it, a teaspoonful every four hours—I saw the medicine in a bottle in her hand, but I did not give it any, none was given to it in my house, the bottle was full, I don't think any had been given—she gave it to me to give to the baby—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said she had it from Dr. Cavanagh's, at Deptford—I told the prisoner she had better come with me with the baby to the doctor's, and we both went to Mr. Howell's, he was not in, I waited for him, but the prisoner went home and left me there with the baby—I knew she was in service; she had to go home—I waited till Mr. Howell came in, and he gave me a powder; I then took the child home and began to undress it; it was crying and screaming all his time—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187702050084"/>
               <p>it was an irritable child—the prisoner carried it to the doctor's, when she left I brought it home—I had no needle sticking in my dress, I had not used one that day—when I undressed the child I found something at the side; I thought it was a bone; that its ribs were broken—I felt it through the clothes; I did not see anything till the doctor came—I unfastened its clothes, I sent for Mr. Howell directly, he came and in my presence be took a needle from the body of the child at the spot where I had felt a lump; there was some bleeding, it was fresh done, it was not dry—after the needle was drawn out, I poulticed the side and she was quiet—it was a little drowsy when it came into the house, but it woke directly and screamed very much—on the following Saturday, I was fetched to go to the prisoner with the doctor; I heard her say that she did not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had the child under my charge about six weeks—during that time the prisoner gave me some nursery pins in order to pre<lb/>vent the pins running into the child; that was when she first brought the child—needles are used to mend a child's clothes, but I never mended them, they were all mended before they came to me; they were nearly all new; they did not want mending—it had on a new frock that night; it was brought with the other things, but it had not been used—I had not used a needle on this night to sew up the roller band—the stays were tied—the child was often cross; I thought it was ill by the screaming—I did not know Dr. Cavanagh—I never saw him before—I don't know anything about him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had put the new frock on myself with the other things—I did not notice any needle sticking in it.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am practising as a surgeon at Lewisham and Deptford—in September I was called to see the prisoner at St. Donnett's Road, where she was in service—I discovered that she was in the family way, and advised her removal to the infirmary—T was sent for by her mistress; she gave her a very good character, and said she would take her back after the affair was over—that was the first occasion on which I was called to the house—I attended the family next door, where Eliza Jeffery lives—after she came out of the infirmary I think I met her in the street, or she came to my surgery—I can't remember where I saw her—I had a few moments' conversation with her—she told me she was all right; nothing was said about the child—on Thursday, 14th December, she brought the child in her arms to my surgery about 9 o'clock—she said it was suffering from convulsion fits—it was screaming, and its screams were uncontrollable—it was not Screaming then; it was quiet—I examined it, and prescribed some medicine for it, and told her to bring it again—she had it in her arms—I did not take it from her—the medicine was made up in my surgery, and she tendered half a sovereign to pay for it—it was chloral and bromide, a mere sedative, supposing the child was suffering from irritation of the spinal cord and brain—my dispenser made it up—I did not notice whether it was full—I have seen the bottle since and tasted it—I have no reason to think that it is anything else than the prescription—it tastes exactly as it would taste—I should think none had been given; there might have been a dose—it might evaporate if the bottle was frequently uncorked, or it might not have been full when it was made up—I told her to give it every four hours, and to begin directly she went home—she did not give it any in my surgery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Matilda Place, East Greenwich—on Thursday, 14th December, I was sent for to the house of Mrs. Jeffery—I had seen her at my surgery previously about 10 o'clock, with the child—it was suffering from some pain that I could not at all discover—it was screaming—I gave her a composing powder to take away—the powder gave it no relief, and I was sent for about 10 o'clock the same evening; it was then screaming—I could account in no way for the violent screaming—finding no appreciable cause, I ordered it to be stripped—it was in Mrs. Jeffery's arms—I then examined it, and found between its ribs a small projection, at least a small spot, as if something had been inserted—I placed my finger over it, and while the child screamed the needle pressed against my finger; it was on the left side, between the sixth and seventh ribs—I then made an incision, and the violence of the scream forced the needle out about half an inch; the other part was held very tenaciously indeed by the integuments beneath, and I extracted it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187702050086"/>
               <p>with some little difficulty, comparatively speaking, with my fingers—the needle was about an inch and a half long—it was not immediately in the region of the heart; if it had been an inch longer it must have gone directly into the heart—it had entered perfectly straight, as if it had been thrust in, at right angles with the body—I did not feel anything of the needle before the child was completely stripped—I did not make any minute examination of any of the clothes, except when it was stripped, I saw some fresh blood—that would come from the aperture; the needle was closely embedded in the skin; it must have been forced in with considerable violence—I could not have seen any hole, that would not have been possible—I cannot conceive how it could be possible for the needle to be pushed in through the clothes; it would have gone in the direction of the ribs, and gone in a slanting direction into the integuments—that was the opinion I formed at the time, having extracted a number of needles in my practice, and I never met with one passing in that direction; it has always been in a sloping direction in accidental cases—in my opinion this could not have been an accident; if the needle had been pushed through the clothes I cannot account for its being embedded right to the head in the skin—I feel certain it never could have entered so deeply if it had gone through the clothes first, because the point of the needle must have entered the dia<lb/>phragm, or it never could have been held so tenaciously, and the screaming of the child would have prevented the needle passing so deeply, because the moment it was released it sprang out to the extent of half an inch—I do not think the needle could have been pushed through all the clothes and been in the position in which I found it—the clothes must have been raised up and the needle put in underneath—it had on a roller tied with tapes, the usual band that children wear—the needle was underneath that—the band could be raised sufficiently high to put the needle in; the clothes were so loose that before I had to strip it they could be raised half the width of the band; they were loosely tied; the only thing in the shape of a pin was a brown pin in the napkin—I examined carefully to see if there was any other needle about the clothes, and there was nothing of the kind—I communicated with the police within half an hour, the conviction on my mind was so clear—I heard at the police-court the expression of opinion from Dr. Cavanagh, but I still hold my own opinion.</p>

               <p>course of my great experience I have never known of a needle entering into a child's heart and not causing death—I do not know that on many occasions such a thing has happened—I never heard of a needle being extracted from the heart, and if I did, I should not believe it; I heard Dr. Cavanagh make the statement, but not upon his own experience, it is the experience of another that he states—I never read of it, and I have read as many medical works as any medical man ever read—I never heard of a case where a needle has entered the heart and had been extracts d—great force must have been employed here, it must have been a strong thrust with the hand, because a needle will not enter so readily into the integuments as people imagine—I could push it in with my finger and thumb so that it would be covered by the skin—you could do it easier with a thimble on—I should not like to attempt to do it with my bare thumb—I will venture to swear that more force could be applied with the finger and thumb than by the child being pressed against the mother's breast, and a child's bowels would not be likely to be against a woman's breast.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I have heard Mr. Howell's evidence, in my opinion this is perfectly consistent with accident—if the needle was in the clothes of the mother or nurse; if it was in the shawl of the mother I can understand it being driven in by the arm of the mother in fondling the child, and if it once entered the skin I can fancy it being driven to very readily by the mother's arm; or if the needle was between the mother and the child it might be driven in by the stay bone of the mother—it would run through the dress and right into the body of the child, they are very common accidents; there are no more common accidents—they have come under my experience scores of times during my practice—why on earth should not a needle run in at an obtuse as well as at an acute angle?—supposing the needle was in the mother's shawl pointing inwards or outwards, what is to prevent it going in at a right angle or at an obtuse angle—I suppose it to be pointing towards the child, but in the matter of an accident it might be any way—in the course of my experience I have seen a needle sticking into the dress of a mother, head first; I have seen needles in every position looking inwards or outwards—a needle may get into a woman's dress without being put there at all, it may get there accidentally—about a month ago I took a needle out of a woman's belly pointing inwards, it was head outwards—I brought Mr. Colt to the Magistrate to give evidence, but his evidence was refused by the Magistrate, I don't know why; he is not here now—a month or six weeks ago I took a needle out of a woman's body which was driven up home with</p>

               <p>the head under the skin—in my opinion it would enter as readily into the inter costal muscles as into the stomach, because of the tenderness of the muscles.</p>

I said to the prisoner "There is some<lb/>thing deleterious in this medicine"—I did not use the word "poison"—from it having so strong a taste of medicine which is deleterious, I consider that if the child had taken it, it would in all probability have destroyed its life, if it had taken the whole of it.</p>

If it had taken a teaspoonful at a time in those tea<lb/>spoons which they possessed, which were small dessert-spoons, and it had been followed up every four hours as directed, it would have destroyed the child—there are 54 grains of chloral hydrate in the prescription—those large spoons will hold two teaspoonsful, if not more—I say that a table<lb/>spoon filled up would have killed the child.</p>

I live at 180, Tooley-Street, and a waterman, lighter-man, and pilot, I work in my own boat—I know the ships that come in and go out—I know that in September-and October, no Mary Ann came into the port of London, or any Captain Brown—I know the Cestrian well—she had been discharging onions when I fetched her from the wharf down to Pickle Herring Tier, to get her ballast out—that was about 21st September—I had charge of her till her ballast was out—I applied to Hamilton, to remove the ballast, I told him there were 25 tons of freshwater sand, and asked if it would do for him as it seemed good sand—he said that he would go and get a sample, which he did—the captain would pay him for it—the captain's name is Hughes—one of the other vessels laying-at the tier was named Elizabeth—I do not know the names of the other, there were only three ships there at the time—I well remember the two lads taking the ballast from the Cestrian, I was at breakfast when told that the barge had sunk; I am positive there was no Mary Ann there.</p>

I saw no trolly nor omnibus there. Before I got to the Artichoke I crossed the tramway; I crossed it on the land; I only crossed it once. I saw no omnibus then on the metals As soon as I got across the collision occurred, smash. My left fore wheel came in contact with the milk van, but I do not know what part of it, as I was thrown off the van. My horse and van was straight with the pavement, about 2 yards from the kerb. I was going to-stop at the Artichoke to get a glass of ale. I always called at the Artichoke I was some distance from the milk van when I crossed the metals. At the time of the collision my hind wheels were not on the tramway, nor in the gutter by the kerb. My horse and van were straight in the road.
