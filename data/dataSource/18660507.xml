I am a police-constable, stationed at Arlington, which is, a village between West Drayton and Hounslow—on 19th April, in conse<lb/>quence of information, I went on the road to Hounslow—I saw two carts loaded with hay in front of the White Bear public-house, in charge of the prisoner and his brother—they were baiting their horses—I spoke to the prisoner's brother Emmanuel in the prisoner's presence, and said I wanted to look and see what he had got in his cart—by his permission I got on the load, and there found six dead fowls in a bushel-basket, with the name of "Steptoe" upon it—that is the prisoner's stepfather, for whom he works—the basket was down in the hay, covered over with a little bit of green stuff—I got down into the road with the basket—the prisoner's brother had then gone—I asked the prisoner how he became possessed of the fowls—he said, "I brought them from home, and am going to take them up the road to sell"—I took him into custody, and took him to Arlington police-station in a fly—he opened the door of the fly on the road and wanted to get out, but I prevented him—I put him in a room at the Arlington station—there is no look-up there, and he managed to slip out unawares, and ran across the fields—he was taken in about a quarter of an hour after and brought back—I produce the heads and legs of the fowls, and a wing of each—Mr. Naylor saw the fowls when they were whole.</p>

I am the wife of Edmund Magee, a clerk, and live at 2, Skinner-street, Shoreditch—on Tuesday evening, 17th April, about 9 o'clock, I was alone—I was about entering the Commercial hotel, and a fellow stood on to the step of the door, and put his hand down my face, and before I had time to resent it, the prisoner knocked me between the shoulders, and sent me forward—the other man hit me back again, and I was hit more than a dozen times, and was kicked in a most violent manner—the prisoner struck me in the eye, and cut it, and the blood oozed out very much—I caught hold of the other fellow's arm, and said I would hold him till a policeman came—his coat sleeve gave way in my hand, and in wrenching himself away I fell back—I am quite sure the prisoner is one of the men—I saw him under the gas—I could see his features—he had a white coat on—I lost my brooch, half a crown, and a key—I screamed very loud several times during the struggle—my cloak was torn, and my dress too—I should known the other man again—I saw him the first day after I left Worship-street, and my husband went with me to secure him, but there was no officer near.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I have been a traveller for a gentleman in the City. On the morning of 17th April I left him about 7 o'clock; I proceeded along the road and came to a wood. I got over a stile, and saw a man running away; I went into the field and found these things; I had two straps in my pocket; I intended to keep these things in my possession. After I proceeded along the road some distance I met two policemen; one of them asked me some questions, and I gave him straightforward answers. He then left me a second time; I walked along the road about half a mile, and turned round and saw the policemen coming along. Would a man if he had entered this house have fallen into the trap and not make an effort to escape? Do you not think if he could have got away a dozen times be would not avail him-self of the opportunity? The evidence is circumstantial and contradictory; there was no person seen on the premises late at night or early in the morning. <hi rend="smallCaps">

               <p>like a fog—I did not know where it was coming from—it cleared away about 6 o'clock, and we got up at 7 and went down stair, and I found the sofa in the drawing-room burnt—the fire was out then—I went down stairs into the kitchen and told the prisoner that the drawing-room sofa was burnt—she said, "What a dreadful thing! we might have been burnt to death. Did you tell your mistress?"—the sofa had an antimacassar on it—that was burnt as well—I went and told my mistress—the night before this the prisoner had asked me if the plate was all marked alike—she did not ask me where it was kept—it was kept near my mistress's bedroom, in her dressing-room; not in a basket, but in a large chest of drawers—we had out what we wanted for use, and it was taken up at night, and taken down in the morning—we had the other plate out if we had company—we had no visitors while the prisoner was there, so as to call for the use of the other plate—the night before the fire the prisoner said that I had been very restless the night before, and she took all my clothes and put them on the bed before I got into bed—she asked me if any one could get out of the bedroom window—we could do so and get along the parapet—I told her the man who cleaned the windows got in there to clean them—the lower step of the fire-escape was near the bedroom—the prisoner once asked me why my mistress did not wear a watch—she did not wear one—I do not know where it was kept—there was a watch kept in the room, but I did not know whether it was what the mistress used—I think she used to wear it occasionally.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 260). On 20th March, I was on duty in the East India-road about eleven o'clock, and saw two omnibuses opposite the Sailor's Home, one coming from London and the other from Blackwall—I heard a smash, they were then both together on the off-side—there is a tramway in the centre of the road—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a very good plan of the road—there is about twenty feet on each side of the tramway for vehicles to pass—I have not measured it, but the road is about fifty feet wide and the tramway about ten feet—no other vehicles were near—one omnibus belonged to the General Omnibus Company, and the other to a person named Emanuel—when I heard the smash I ran towards Emanuel's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> which was going towards London—it had extricated itself and was drawing off on its journey—I spoke to the driver, it was the prisoner Payne—I saw the deceased, Haffler, outside the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he called out, "Oh! my leg is broken"—I saw blood and a wound on his leg—his trousers and stocking were torn—he was taken to the hospital—I took the number of the other driver, Carter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barman—I was on the front seat of the General Omnibus Company's omnibus—it was coming from town—I saw the other omnibus coming along the tramway—it was about twenty or thirty yards off when I first saw it; I cannot exactly say—they were both driving at a moderate pace, rather slow, four or five miles an hour—Carter cried out, "High, where are you coming to?" and after the accident he said, "What did you go and do that for?"—I did not know at the time that they were opposition buses—I think the darkness of the night caused the accident, but they might have been wider apart—I was examined before the Coroner—they did not do it on purpose in my opinion—I did not say before the Coroner, "It seemed as if the driver did it for the purpose"—I said to Carter, "Is the man drunk, or have the reins slipped out of his hands?"—I do not say that Emanuel's man could have avoided it; it was the result of accident—no doubt I gave the same evidence before the Coroner—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's depositions being read, stated</hi>, "It seemed as if the driver did it on purpose")—I never mentioned those words.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver—I was on Payne's omnibus, next but one to Haffler—the apron was over us, but I believe both his legs were hanging down the same as mine were—the apron was not pulled over him, not fastened behind him; it was over me—I did not see the other omnibus until it was about ten yards off, but there was plenty of time for each omni<lb/>bus to pull off if they had liked to—the accident could have been avoided if either of the drivers had been inclined—it was a wet night, and rather dark, but there was plenty of light to see the omnibus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident medical officer at Poplar Hospital—I first saw Haffler on 21st Feb after I came from the country—he was suffering from a lacerated wound of the right leg—he died on the 31st, of uremic poison; that is a blood poison, caused by the transferring of the constituents of the urine into the system, and causing death—if it had not been for the wound in his leg I think he would have been alive now—I think that was the exciting cause of the decease.</p>

               <p>in the Mercantile Marine Office, established by the Board of Trade in Poplar—the prisoner is a seaman in the Royal Naval Reserve—on 30th September, 1864, the prisoner came to me—I know the date from the document—he came for a quarter's retainer—by the Act of Parliament passed in accord<lb/>ance with a Commission which sat for the better manning of the Navy, this force was brought into use—the men were to receive 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. annually, and were required to perform twenty-eight drills in the year—in order to show that they have done their drill they produce a book of this kind—the prisoner produced this book to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a certificate book, and is handed to him when he joins the force—it is on the entries made in that book that he is paid the retainer—on the faith of entries as to drill we make the pay<lb/>ment—on the day the prisoner came he presented this book to me—I looked at it to see whether he was entitled to the retainer for which he applied—it appeared by the book that he had then performed twenty-eight days' drill for that year—fourteen at one time and fourteen at another—on the faith of that entry I paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 17th September—he had been paid at our office before, but not by me—I was not present at the time.</p>

               <p>four more retainers—a person who receives these retainers is entitled to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year after fifteen years' service—I do not know whether the prisoner has been discharged from the Naval Reserve—I am not aware whether he would be discharged in the event of a conviction—these accounts are examined by the Registrar General of seamen—I should suppose the accounts of Septem<lb/>ber 30th, 1864, would be audited a very few days afterwards—when this 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was obtained, it was a quarter day, and we are then unusually busy; we have from two to three hundred come on that day, which we do not have on other days, otherwise I should have noticed this alteration—I did not detect the alteration—of course our accounts are kept, and we cannot send them for a few days—it may have been a week before the Registrar General would have it—when he got it into his possession, he would have an opportunity of observing—he would have detected that inaccuracy.</p>

I am a process server of 5, Peter Street, Horsley<lb/>down—on Friday night, 20th April, about ten minutes past 10, I was in High-street, Borough, passing the corner of a narrow court, and the prisoner seized me by the collar with one hand, and in front with the other, tripped my heels up, and laid me on my back—there was another man with him who put his hands into my trousers pocket, but there was nothing there—he then put his hand into my waistcoat pocket and took out three penny pieces and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am positive the prisoner is the man—the other man sprang away to the left towards London Bridge—I should know him again—I was struggling with the prisoner, when a policeman came down the court—the prisoner <hi rend="italic">bobbed</hi> from me to the right towards the Mint and into High-street, and the policeman after him, who caught him and brought him back, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I was present at the prisoner's examination before the Magistrate on 17th and 20th April, and also before the coroner on the 16th—I heard Jane Bone give her evidence in the prisoner's presence—he had the opportunity of cross-examining her—I saw her sign her deposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of Jane Bone was here read as follows</hi>:—"I am single—I lodge with Mrs. Kendall—I have known the prisoner some time to speak to—I was keeping company with deceased—I was with him and Mr. and Mrs. Kendall on the 8th instant in Westminster-road—the prisoner called him—he went to her and stooped down to hear what she had to say—they were not together above three seconds—I called him to come on—she struck him in the lower part of his person—he doubled up and turned all manner of colours and leaned against the wall, and said, "I do feel bad"—they were not quarrelling, but I heard prisoner say to Mrs. Kindall, "I don't want your b—y man"—I went with the deceased to his house—he could hardly walk and seemed in great pain—on 10th instant, at night, I met him, and. he complained that he felt very bad—I never saw him alive after that—I have seen the prisoner in his company two or three times, but not for the last eight or nine months, during which time he has kept company with me.</p>

I am single, and am in service with Mr. Barrett, at Mortlake—this is the first time I have been examined—my mother was dangerously ill at 33, Frances-street, Westminster-road, where the prisoner lives, and I was sent for to go up from Mortlake—I went up on Sunday—it was as near as possible 4 o'clock when I arrived at home—I sent for a candle at about half-past 10 or a few minutes later—they were putting up the shutters and closing the shop—the prisoner was sitting on one side of the door, and Mrs. Shields at the other—the prisoner said, "Shall I bring you the candle?"—I said, "If you will be so kind"—I did not go out—I did not go back till the Thursday—I had seen the prisoner sitting at the door before that, when I went out for some milk to make some arrow<lb/>root—I saw the prisoner again at about twenty minutes to 9, when I let a friend out who had come to see my mother—I think it was the prisoner who knocked three times at the door for me—when I wanted the candle, I sent the prisoner for it—I do not think it was quite half-past 10—she brought it from the corner shop—I saw her after that, when I went across to the beer-shop, the corner house, to get a pint of beer for myself—directly I left the candle up stairs and got the jug I came down—the prisoner was then sitting at the door with a shaw! over her head—I had occasion to go into the yard after 11 o'clock—the street-door was then locked, and the house was quiet—I bolted the back door after me.</p>
