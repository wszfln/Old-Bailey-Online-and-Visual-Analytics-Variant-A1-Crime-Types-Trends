I am resident medical officer at the Royal Free Hospital—I saw the prosecutrix late on the Saturday night; she was suffering from fracture of both bones of the right leg, between the knee and the ankle; there was considerable bruising; the fractures were caused by some direct violence—I put the leg in splints—she was there a fortnight, and was then transferred to the infirmary—it will be some considerable time before she is able to use the limb as before.</p>

I went to the prisoner's cell and found he had stripped himself; I told him to put his trousers on, as I wanted him to be dressed to be identified—he asked if I was a Catholic—I said, "Never mind what I am, put your trousers on"—I just turned my head, and he dealt Mr. a violent blow on my left jaw—I threw him on the slip, Sergeant McEllistrim seized him, and he bit his left arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Harrison; we live at Dane Road—on 18th May I was travelling in a third-class carriage on the Metropolitan Railway from Westbourne Park—at Aldersgate Street the prisoners got in; we were very much crowded, and the next compartment was quite empty—at Bishopsgate Street I got out—I had in my dress pocket a purse with 15s. 3 1/2 d. in it; I felt that it was safe as I got out of the carriage—I went to the barrier to give up my ticket, as I was going by the Great Eastern Railway—France got between my husband and me, and passed his ticket in front of me, and then went back on my left hand and joined Harris, who was behind me, and who said, "Have you got my ticket?"—I heard no reply—they went up the steps—as soon as I</p>

               <p>was through the barrier I put my hand in my pocket, and found my purse was gone—I spoke to my husband, who called out, "Stop thief!"—when the prisoners got to the top of the steps they were stopped, and were brought to me at the station-house—this is the purse, with the money safe in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by France.</hi> You got out of the train and got to the barrier first, and hindered my going through—I did not hear Harris call you back; you should have gone through the barrier, but you came back to him, and then went up the stairs—I was barely two yards through the barrier before I came back; you had just got over the first landing, half way up—you were the only two persona on the stairs; there was another person on the bridge—I did not keep my eyes on you—I never saw the purse in your possession, nor did I see you make any attempt—you would have-had more opportunity of putting the purse on the stairs than the man on the bridge would—the purse was found where you stood, where I gave you in charge; the officers afterwards had hold of you on the bridge—I did not call attention to the other man's trembling—Harris said ho trembled—I had my suspicions about you in the train, and I sat on my pocket; I told you to sit closer to me to make room for the other people—you walked sharply up the steps like ordinary passengers would.</p>

I am an inspector at Bishopsgate Street—on 18th May I was on the platform when this train came in—I saw the prisoners stopped on the bridge—one other person who had preceded the prisoners was on the bridge—the prisoners remained where they were till the last witness gave them into custody—when the third man was brought back I asked the lady if she wished to charge him, and she said, "No, these are the two that have got my purse, one of these two "—the third man was allowed to go—after the constable had taken the prisoners off the bridge I found this purse, with fifteen shillings in it, three or four yards from where they were given into custody on the bridge.</p>

I am a dealer in jewellery, of 27, Thomas Street, Blackfriars—I have known the defendant about eight years—on 20th March, 1890, I had business dealings with him, and for about four years previous to that—he owed me £61 10s. at that time—on 20th March, 1890, I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Brooky,—If not otherwise engaged, come over here on Saturday evening. I may trade with you, and endeavour to square up the account. Let me know, and say what time; evening will do quite well.—Yours sincerely, <hi rend="smallCaps">W. G. IMPERIALI</hi>")—either that day or the next I saw him in Bond Street—he then said, "Try and come up on Saturday evening, and bring your bag with you"—I went on the Saturday, the 22nd, and saw him; I took my bag with me, with some jewellery, which I showed him, and he selected a gipsy brilliant cluster ring without the centre, value ten guineas, a brilliant horseshoe pin, £8 15s., and a brilliant amethyst ring; they were the principal articles chosen; there were also four pins, eight rings, and part of a brooch—we then had a chat and a smoke—he got out his cheque-book, and offered to settle up past liabilities; he wrote two cheques, both dated 22nd March; one I could pay in on the following Monday, the other I was to hold over till the following Monday week—I did not leave the goods on that occasion; this is the invoice, it is dated the 15th; I must have seen him on the 15th—on the 13th May I was present at a sale at Debenham and Store's, in King</p>

               <p>elapsed I spoke to him, and asked him for payment, and he made an excuse that Vokins had not finished stocktaking yet—very soon after that he left our employ—I asked him two or three times for pay<lb/>ment; I can't say how many times; I saw him continually—he said I should have it as soon as he got it from Vokins after the stocktaking; always the same answer—I have never seen the property again—I have since ascertained that it was pawned with Mr. Ellis, with other things; a diamond and sapphire ring, which he had on 14th March—I have seen a diamond ring, produced by Mr. Brabbington; I believe that to be one of the two rings.</p>

I am manager to Rebecca Smith, pawnbroker, of 10, Pembridge Road—I have known the defendant some years—it is quite possible that I may have had some conversation with him about rose diamond stars about 12th February—I do not remember it on any date—he might have asked me to purchase from him some diamond stars about that time—I have not made a statement to the Treasury, or to anybody—I did not give any evidence to Inspector Tunbridge; I had a conversation with him—he came to see me about it; I have given no evidence at all; any statement you have was based on our conversation—I did not make a statement to him that was taken down in writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I stated that I knew nothing at all about any stars associated with the name of Mr. Phillips—about February, 1890, I had a lady customer buying largely in diamonds, and I remember the prisoner coming and mentioning diamond stars to me, without telling me where they came from—at that time I was stocktaking, and I did not go into the matter with him—he handed me a case, which he said contained those stars—he asked me to lock them up in my case for him—I have been in the pawnbroking trade about twenty years—I have been with two of the largest houses in the trade, Attenborough and Smith and Dymond—</p>

               <p>I do not always make a difference between dealers and jewellers in the terms of pledging; it is done, a little less interest—it is a common thing among dealers in jewellery to pledge right up to the market value—I know that goods are taken in by pawnbrokers from dealers, and instead of being put in the safe are put in the window—if put in the safe they are locked up for a twelvemonth; if put in the window they can be sold to anyone, and the dealer can call and get his profit—that is a well-recognised custom among dealers in jewellery.</p>

On 3rd March, 1890, Imperiali had from me on credit a diamond, ruby, and sapphire butterfly brooch, value to us about £38, and he was to pay for it, together with other articles he had at the same time, £53. He had had. several other dealings with us before that. After the transaction of 3rd March the total amount owing to us by Imperiali was about £282; the amount due to us at the time of the bankruptcy was £199 11s. 6d. Between 3rd of March and the bankruptcy the account was very much reduced; on 24th March the account stood at £182. I afterwards saw a brooch at Debenhara's Sale-room, very closely resembling the one I had sold to Imperiali; it was put up by Mr. Starling, a pawnbroker; it was bought in, I believe. I was never paid for the brooch; it went into the general account. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—Defendant paid it into the general account, and I deducted the amount paid from the total owing. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi>—Between the 3rd March and the date of the bankruptcy his debt to us was never reduced below £53.

I am manager to Mr. Brabbington, of 27 and 29, Wardour Street—I have known the prisoner about eighteen years, and have done business with him for about eight years—he has been in the habit of pawning articles with my employer, and selling—I produce a contract note, dated 25th March, 1890—he did not execute it himself—Taglioni pawned the articles, a bracelet, six rings, five pins, a snap, and other things—I advanced £100 on them—this is the contract signed by Taglioni—I knew Taglioni; this was his first transaction for the prisoner—the articles were pawned for one month—they were not redeemed—No. 960 and 962 in Debenham and Stores catalogue of 13th May relate to the articles in the contract note—I had a number of transactions in February and March with the prisoner, in pawnings by himself—I knew him in the name of Imperiali—he was in the habit of pawning in the name of Walton—on 1st March he pledged a brooch, necklet, a pin and ring, for £150; they were not redeemed—on 13th May they were put up to auction with other articles in Nos. 982 to 985 in this catalogue; the necklet and other articles were bought in and were afterwards sold, I don't know to whom—on 22nd March there was pawned by him a bracelet, a scarf-pin, two rings, and a pair of earrings, for £165—some of them are sold; I have two of the articles still in my possession—I produce a diamond and sapphire ring, and a diamond and pearl bracelet; that was originally a scarf-pin—on 25th March he pawned a snap, with other goods, for £100.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The snap is the same article as is described as a pendant, it never could have been pendant to a bracelet—I have known the prisoner fifteen years, under the trade name of Walton—it is usual for dealers to have two names, their own and a pledge name—the articles Nos. 969 and 970 refer to articles pawned by the defendant with me on 25th March—I have been in the business nearly twenty-five years—Mr. Brabbington deals principally in diamonds; to a large extent—it is a custom in the trade for dealers to pledge their stock with pawnbrokers, and to get for it as much as they</p>

               <p>possibly can—I have often known instances where they have pledged for more than the pawnbrokers have realised by the sale—it is sometimes a great advantage to jewellers to pledge, in order to get an immediate ad<lb/>vance; although called a pledge, it is a sale—we make a difference in the interest to a dealer—I recognise the defendant as a dealer; he pledged these articles in the ordinary way of his business—articles so pledged by a dealer would not be deposited in the safe, but put in the window for pale; the pawnbroker has a right to sell at once, that is an old recognised practice in the trade—I have had hundreds of transactions with the prisoner—I have allowed him to take out jewellery which he had de<lb/>posited with me, to show to a customer, allowing him to put the differ<lb/>ence in his pocket; he has always returned the goods or the money—a great number of his creditors have subscribed for his defence, they do not sanction these proceedings.</p>

               <p>brooch and ring for £55—the description in the catalogue No. 867 corre<lb/>sponds with those—they were never redeemed; they were put in Debenham's sale; I bought in the brooch, and afterwards sold it privately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A butterfly brooch is a very common ornament; I could not say whether this had a ruby body and a diamond wing; the description of the brooch pawned with me was a brilliant ruby and sapphire; that is the only way in which a butterfly ornament is made up—you can see plenty of them in shops—I have had more than 33 years' experience of the trade in a good house, where dealers in jewellery are dealt with considerably—it is very usual for dealers in jewellery to pledge their jewellery with pawnbrokers, and they lend up to the full value; it is a recognised custom—it is really a sale to the pawnbrokers, with option of redeeming, and a lower rate of interest is charged—if Imperiali pledged a brooch with us, and wanted to show it to a customer, I should allow him to do so, and I have done so many times—there was a general account between him and us, and any profit shown on the account would be handed to him—pawning to a pawnbroker for the full amount, with option of redeeming, is equivalent to selling to a customer, only that in the latter case there is no option of redeeming—we should put the article in the window at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the rule on the card that in bets made with Buckley on all minor races there was to be a limit of 10 to 1; so that the amount would be £26 17s. 6d. according to his card—he did not contend on that occasion that he made the bet directly with me—my solicitor is Mr. Lucius O'Brien; I sued the prisoner for £37 17s. 6d., and swore in my affidavit he was indebted to me in that sum, and according to his first arrangement he was—I believe his defence to the action was put in, denying he owed me £37 17s. 6d.—I accepted the £26 17s. 6d.—I sued for £37 17s. 6d. because of arrangements the prisoner had made with Chipper that he would pay 14 to 1—this matter was referred to the County-court—I obtained judgment for £26 17s. 6d.—I know Mr. Lucius O'Brien attended to tax the bill of costs; I did not instruct him to say that unless all these costs were paid which were disputed I should prosecute the prisoner for perjury on this affidavit, or proceed with the prosecution which had been instituted—I got my judgment for £26 17s. 6d. on April 23rd, I believe—I did not instruct my solicitor to say to the solicitor taxing the costs, "If you don't pay up all these costs I shall make it warm for your client, and go on with the prosecution for perjury "—if he made any such statement I was no party to it—the prisoner's statement has always been that it was not a commission, but a bet he made with me, and that he was willing to pay £26 17s. 6d., but not £37 17s. 6d.—he admitted before the County-court Judge that he was liable for £26 17s. 6d., but not for £37 17s. 6d.—I saw Beard several times; only once to speak to—I did not know the odds before the race; I do not think I have sworn, "I had told Chipper to take 14 to 1 on the horse "; I may have.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, at 28, Cursitor Street—I have acted as the prisoner's agent; he asked me to take commissions for him from anyone who wanted them done—on 30th October I received from Hempel £3 2s. 6d. and a piece of paper, on which the name of a horse was written—I took the money and paper to the prisoner, and laid it on the table and said, "Can you do this for Bruno? "meaning Hempel—he said, "All right "—the odds on that horse, the <hi rend="italic">Devil's Own,</hi> were returned after the race at 14 to 1—two or three days before that the prisoner had said, with reference to the limit of 10 to 1 on minor races that he would make Hempel no limit—I saw the prisoner on the evening of the day on which the race was run, and he told me he had not got more than 10 to 1 about it—on the following Friday or Saturday I saw him again in Hempels presence—the prisoner then said he had £26 17s. Cd., I think the amount was, in his pocket—a dispute arose as to the amount; ho did not hand it over—he said to Hempel that he must take him for a by fool, and he walked out of the shop.</p>

Ship or order," and endorsed "F. ship"—the City Bank is in Great Eastern Street—I said, "Did you brings this cheque from Mr. Ship?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "When did Mr. Ship give you this cheque?"—he said, "Just now; and he told me to come on to the bank and get the cash for it "—I said, "Well, there appears to be something wrong with the signature"—he said, "It is all right, sir; Mr. Ship just gave it to me, and told me to come on and get the cash for it, and one of his men has come with me,</p>

M. 80,536—the preceding counterfoil is dated 19/3/91, and the succeeding one 20/3/91—the cheque was delivered to Messrs. Dredge, and not to Mr. Ship—on May 1st I picked out Passmore from eight or nine others at Hoxton Police-station, and said, "To the best of my belief that is the person who presented the cheque"—he said, "It is all right sir," or "You are all right, I did it," and a little later he said, "I won't give you much trouble, sir, I did it"—these nine cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were delivered out to Mr. Ship; the first is dated October 29th, 1890, and we paid it on the 30th; the others are for £40, £18, £15, £17, £17, £17, £18, and £30; £159 altogether; they are all on Mr. Ship's forms—I remember Agonbar coming to the bank to stop some cheques; he brought this message (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we did not discover that these nine cheques were forgeries till after March 29th; they are very clever imitations of Mr. Ship's cheques, but the one I stopped was much clumsier, and I can see by a magnifying glass evidences of tracing underneath—there is no tracing on the cheque of March 20th; that was done from memory, and being clumsier it did not succeed—on the nine cheques I find with a magnifying glass traces of pencilling, but there is no evidence of pencilling on the cheque in the case which is being tried.</p>

Agonbar first suggested that if I could get anyone to write a cheque we could get a big shilling. He gave me several cheques from time to time, also Batten, who used to get them from the safe. I used to hand them to Harry Passmore to copy. It was a stranger who passed the first £10 cheque, and me and Harry Passmore passed the others. It was Harry who attempted to utter the cheque stolen by Batten from Dredge. The second cheque of Dredge's has been destroyed. I saw it destroyed at 63, Fanshaw Street; Harry Passmore did it because the forgery of the other had been discovered,"—Gray looked at the cheques at the station and said, "Those are the cheques"—I found Batten at the station, and said, "Gray says You stole a cheque which has been uttered, and you are detained for inquiries "—he said, "I know nothing about it"—when the prisoners were charged next day I read Gray's statement to Batten, and Gray said, "It is all lies what I have told you "—Batten said, "I know nothing about it.

About a month or more ago I came out of the shop to go to dinner; it was about twenty past one o'clock when I met William Gray, when he (Gray) said, 'Harry, I look too shabby to go into the bank, will you cash this for me?' handing me a cheque on the City Bank for £30. I said, "Who's is it?' he (Gray) said, "The governor's, of course.' I said, "I will take it with pleasure.' I took the cheque into the bank and laid it on the counter; a dark gentleman first took it, and called the gentleman who picked me out at the police-station (meaning Mr. Childe), who said the signature was wrong, and asked me who sent me with the cheque; before I had time to answer, he (Mr. Childe) said, "You go back to Mr. Ship's, I will come on. "I said to the gentleman (meaning Mr. Childe), "There is one of Ship's men outside,' when he (Mr. Childe) said, 'Oh! wait a minute, and I will go with you, go steady.' I walked slowly out of the bank; when outside the bank I lighted my pipe, when Gray came up to me and said, 'Is it all right?' I said, "The signature is wrong, and the gentleman (meaning Mr. Childe) is coming down to see Mr. Ship himself.' I looked at Andrews' clock, and said to Gray, 'I must hurry up.' I walked towards Pitfield Street. I said to Gray,'I have not much time,' when Gray said, 'We will walk sharp' I left Gray at the corner of Fanshaw Street, when Gray said, 'I will go straight back to the shop.' I afterwards saw Gray; I asked him if he had found the mistake out, when Gray said, 'I have been talking to Mr. Ship about it, it is all right. 'I have seen Gray on several occasions since, but he has never mentioned about it. About a fortnight after I took the cheque into the bank I went into a public-house at the corner of Fanshaw Street to have a drink with Agonbar and Gray. Agonbar said to Gray,</p>
