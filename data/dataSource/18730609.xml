                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have a great many customers in the course of a week—I am certain Harrington is the man who came in six or seven weeks before, if I had not seen him for ten years I should have known him—I said "This is not the first time, or the fourth time, you have tendered bad money in this house"—he told me he got it from Mr. Draper's, in Covent Garden, and was not aware it was bad—a woman with him paid for the ale—Brennan asked for his change in the evening, and said that he gave it to save a <hi rend="italic">row.</hi>

I am parcels clerk at the Bull and Mouth receiving office of the Great Northern Railway, Angel Street, St. Martin's-le-Grand—the prisoner was parcels porter in the office—he has been in the employ of the Company two years—about 2.30 on the 6th May, Mr. Whiffen brought me a parcel—the prisoner received it and signed for it—I have the book here—shortly after that I had occasion to send the prisoner up stairs—whilst he was up stairs, I saw two pairs of trousers under a desk in the outer office—soon after that I had to go into my own room to see some one—I returned to the office shortly after and saw the prisoner, who had just come down stairs—I said "What about those trousers that were lying under the desk table"—he said "What trousers?"—I repeated "The trousers lying under the table there," assuming they were still there—but on looking under I found they had been taken away—I then observed the prisoner had a small parcel in his hand, roughly done up—I said to him "What is in that parcel?"—he said "What business is that of yours?"—I said "Well, if that is the only answer you can give me I shall certainly take means to ascertain," and at once passed through my private office and brought in the foreman with me from the yard, but as we entered the outer office we both saw the prisoner was leaving with the parcel in his possession, and he ran up Angel Street as fast as he could away from the office—I sent the foreman after him, and some few minutes afterwards they returned together—after the prisoner came back I found Whiffen's parcel had been tampered with—I afterwards saw this parcel in the possession of Hollis, the officer, which contained two pairs of trousers.</p>

                  </hi>, I am the prisoner's father—in consequence of information I received, I went to this pawnbroker's shop—I produced a ticket, and asked to see a watch, and this watch was produced to me—I requested them not to part with it until they heard from me, and I left a written paper to that effect—this is the ticket that was given to me—I know that my son was charged and convicted at Brighton—it was for giving a cheque at a bank where he had no assets, through a mistake on his part; with that exception no charge of dishonesty has been brought against him, to my knowledge, that was four or five years ago.</p>

I live at 32, St. Peter Street, and am a qualified midwife—on 23rd March the prisoner came and said that his wife was in labour—I was very ill and referred him to Mrs. Elam—on the same day, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I went to the house where his wife was and visited her—I asked her how she was and when she was confined—she said that she was not confined, but <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> had kicked her—the prisoner made no reply—I told him to go out of the room—I then examined her and found she was in a very dangerous condition—I afterwards fetched the prisoner up and asked him how he came to commit such a fearful act on his wife, that she would die, and he would be tried for manslaughter—he made no reply—I had attended her in her confinements—she always had good con<lb/>finements—I was to have attended her on this occasion.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 55, Green Street—on Sunday, 23rd March, the prisoner came to me, and I went to Alma Road between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening and examined his wife—I found a great swelling on the right labia and a lacerated wound about four inches long—it was a dangerous injury in her condition—I could see she was in the family way—a violent kick would cause what I saw—I sent her to the hospital in a cab.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Deposition of Sarah Preston was here read as follows:</hi> "I am the wife of the prisoner.

She said "Yes, I have been with that dirty w----." I threw a beer can at her, and some of the beer went down the children's necks. I said "If you are going to try on that little game I will go out," and I did so. She kicked the panel of the door clean through, I picked one child up to kiss it, and my wife slipped down five stairs into a little nook, I passed her there and she said "Will you go, you b----s----, I will come out and show you up." I said "I will go up stairs with you," and she went up and sat down. I took up one of the children and wiped the beer out of its neck. She then hit me three times over the face with a broom, and said "You shan't be my b----y master." I pulled it out of her hand, and she fell on the landing; I thought she had gone into the back room; I rushed out after her and fell over her as there was no light, and must have kicked her in that way. I did not get up at first because I was stunned. She called Mrs. Abbott, who came up, and said to her "My husband has kicked me. "Mrs. Davis came and said "Have you got any brandy in the house?" I said "Yes, a quartern." I poured out a glass of brandy, and my wife said "I don't want your b----s----brandy." We all three had dinner together at 2 o'clock, and then Mrs. Mitchell told me to fetch a doctor, but my wife motioned for Mrs. Mitchell to go, and as soon as she had gone, my wife said "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, help me out of bed" I did so, and helped her in again. We kissed each other, and she said "Don't fret, my dear, it is more my fault than yours, if I had not drank so much rum last night it would not have occurred."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a joiner by trade, and live at 78, Rich<lb/>mood Road—I am 25 years of age, and am married—in June or July last year there was a strike in the building trade in London—at that time I was in the employ of Messrs. Alden, builders, at West Brompton—I had been three years and a half in their employ—the hands there were locked out, union men as well as non-union—I was locked out amongst the rest—I was out of work a month or two—I then went and obtained employment at Jackson and Shaw's, in Page Street, Westminster—I remained there a month and more—at the end of that time, in consequence of something that had taken place, I left—I remained out of employ a week or so—I then went into the employ of Messrs. Weeks, the horticultural builders, in King's Road, Chelsea—their men had had nothing to do with the strike—I remained there about six months—in March, this year, I made up my mind to go back to Jackson and Shaw's—on the 20th I went and made inquiries, and on the 21st I went to work there at 7 o'clock in the morning—Mr. Young is the foreman, I was taken by him into the back shop, and set to work at a bench—there are two men at each bench; I believe a man named Nix was my partner at the bench, but I could not say—there were twenty or thirty other men at work in the shop—I set to work at my bench at oak work—Tamblyn and Pyle were two of the men at work there, at the same bench—there were also two men named Moulton and Camp; they were not at the same bench—I continued working till 8 o'clock, breakfast time—nothing particular had happened to me up to that time—I returned from breakfast at 8.30—as I came back into the shop I observed the men looking at me, and saying "That is the man"—I did not make any observation upon that, I went to my bench and began to work again—after I had been a little while at work they began "Baa! Baa!" all over the shop—I asked the man who was working with me some question—I did not know what it meant at the time, I know now; it means what is called "a black sheep"—after this "baa-ing," some lumps of wood were thrown at me, ever so many struck me and hurt me—some were as large as my fist, and some smaller—after that Moulton came up to my bench and took a mallet off it; he also</p>

               <p>took my bat, which was lying underneath the bench, and passed it away—I saw it in the hands of both Tamblyn and Pyle, and then I never saw it I again—Tamblyn and Pyle were the busiest of all the lot, they had more to say than any, "baa-ing" and throwing the lumps of wood—some papers were passed about with me <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> upon them, a sort of likeness of me—Tamblyn wrote two of them; this is a part of one—(<hi rend="italic">This was a rough sketch of a man</hi>, I <hi rend="italic">underneath which was written "I want my money, please, Mr. Jackson, they have made me a black</hi>")—I asked Tamblyn for my hat and things, and he said he would knock my b----head off if I did not get out of his bench's way—I said I wanted my hat and umbrella—he said he knew nothing about it—I said I saw him with it—before that he was "baa-ing" and swearing at me—he said he would make me go; if I did not go out of the shop and leave my work, he would make it too hot for me—Tamblyn, with others, said so—Pyle was going to fight me; he said I was no b----man if I did not go—he came to the side of the bench where I was when I was asking for my things; he said he would make me go, he would knock my head off, and was no man if I did not go—this kept on till I went away at 4.30; most of it took place after dinner—sawdust was also thrown at me, tied up in pieces of apron and paper, and old hats; they tried to blind me—I missed some tools, but they were brought back again; they said I should lose my tools if I did not go—I could not say which of them said that—we all find our own took—a man named Camp was working at the next bench to me—about 3 o'clock he asked me to go down to the mill and help him fetch up some work—I went down stairs with him—he took me into a water closet; he went straight in and asked me to follow him—I did not know where I was going to—it is a place about 10 or 12 feet long, and there is a passage running up to it—in the closet there is a long trench and two bars or rails, one as a seat and one for the back—when I got in there were fourteen or fifteen men there—I could not say that Tamblyn or Pyle were there—Walker was there and Moulton, and others came in afterwards, I should say fourteen or fifteen more—some stood behind the door, whilst the others threw me about against the wall, backwards and forwards—they tried to throw me in this place, but they were too think on the rail, I could not be thrown in there—Walker then got hold of my legs and held them up whilst I lay on the floor, and others were kneeling on me and knocking me about—whilst Walker was holding my legs up he struck me many times behind, at the bottom of my back—I could not say whether with his fist or open hand—the others were kneeling on me, knocking me down and trying to squeeze me to death—a man named Mack was there; I can't speak to Tamblyn and Pyle—Moulton and Camp were in the room at the time—I don't know whether they were doing this—it went on for nearly half an hour, at the end of that time some one said "The b----has had enough of it"—I don't know who was there then; they tried to kill me—I was insensible at the time—I was then let go—I was suffering pain—my coat was torn to pieces—I had not got it on at the time, I had left it in the shop; I had got a cap on, that was broken all to pieces; my hat and umbrella were gone—my shirt was torn and my braces broken—I felt pain all over—I can't say how long I remained in the closet—I ultimately went back to my work in the shop—the greatest part of the men were then back in the shop; they began again "baa-ing "and throwing the wood; they thought I would not go—both Tamblyn and Pyle called out to me, "baa-ing" again, saying they would make me go, and would make it too hot for me—I did not make them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="1873060900025"/>
               <p>any answer—when I went down with Camp I left my coat hanging np at the head of my bench, and when I came back it was still hanging there, but the collar had been cut off, and it was torn almost to pieces—I have I never seen my hat or umbrella since—about an hour and a half after I came up from the closet, Mr. Young came into the shop, and I made a communication to him, and showed him my coat—in consequence of what he said, I went to Tamblyn and asked him for my hat—he said he would knock my b----head off if I did not get out of his way; he knew nothing about it—shortly after that I took my things and went away—I left the service before the day was over.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. The master builders are prosecuting this case—I believe it is an association of masters—they took it up a fortnight after—I believe they read the papers—I suppose they applied to me; some gentleman did; I don't know him; I had never seen him before; I have seen him once since; I don't know his name—I have seen him once or twice; I know the man by sight—previous to that I had laid an information on the Saturday, the next day after this happened—I did not say anything against Tamblyn or Pyle; I knew I should do so; I said there were ever so many that I could pick out; I did not mention any names, I did not know them; I said there were eight or nine that I could pick out—Tamblyn and Pyle were about the worst in the room; I noticed them at the time as being the worst in the shop—I could not say that they were or were not in the water-closet; I have not sworn that they were not, that I knew of—I won't swear that I have not—I did not knew Walker's name when I laid my information; I pointed him out at the works when I went there with Davis, the constable on the beat; I went first with him and afterwards with a warrant officer, on two different days—I was told by the Magistrate to pick out three or four of the worst—I first wanted the ones that were in the closet—I did not, in my information, say that the reason I did not lay information against Tamblyn and Pyle was because they were not among the worst; I will swear I did not—it was not until the person from the Masters' Association came to me that I applied for a warrant against Tamblyn and Pyle—I wanted to see how I got on with the others first—I had not made any complaint then of what had taken place up stairs in particular, no more than my clothes; I did that—it was not the gentle<lb/>man from the Society that put me up to making the complaint about throwing the pieces of wood—I swear that I made a complaint to Mr. Young; I don't know whether he is here, I have not seen him—I saw Tamblyn once at the Police Court, on the examination of Walker—I said there was a man in Court that I wanted; I did not know his name; I was told I was to get his name; I afterwards got a warrant and went to the works with the officer—I did not see Tamblyn'and Pyle seated at their bench; I saw one of them, I could not say which of them—I don't recollect whether I saw them when I went with the warrant officer; I went twice with him—I said there were two there; I did not exactly point them out at the bench, but as I went through the shop I said "There are two here"—I did not speak loud; I did not let them know it; we then wanted Moulton, Camp and Knapp—I knew that the officer at that time had a warrant to apprehend two persons, names unknown, and that I was taken there for the purpose of pointing them out—I don't know that Tamblyn and Pyle were those two—I will swear they were not—Moulton and Knapp were the two; Knapp is a labourer—he was not in the shop—I believe</p>

               <p>Moulton was; I had not got the warrant then for Tambyln and Pyle, and I wanted the others first—I intended to charge them about my clothes; I was not going to lose them for nothing—I asked the officer to take the names of Moulton, Camp and Walker; that was when we went through the shop the first time; that was before I had got a warrant—the Magis<lb/>trate sent me—I did not ask him to take the names of Tamblyn and Pyle, because I could not swear that they were down in the closet—I had no idea at that time of making any charge except for what took place there—the pieces of wood they were throwing struck me in ever so many places, about the head and shoulders; I was seen by a doctor, the next day—I was hit in the mouth; I did not point that out to the doctor—I was all colours; I could not say that I pointed out anything that had been done by the pieces of wood—I saw Tamblyn write this paper, I was looking at him all the time; I swear that; it was passed from bench to bench to mine—I can't say who produced it; it was produced before the Magistrate; I don't know who produced it, I did not—I can't remember who I gave it to—the Magistrate saw it—the first time I was at Jackson and Shaw's I was dis<lb/>charged—every night as I went home there were Society men outside, offer<lb/>ing me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to leave my work and not stop there—I said I would let them know—the very night I was discharged I had my tools in my basket ready to leave when I went away, and the foreman came and said "I don't want you any more"—on my first examination I said "I was asked to come out by the Society, and I came out after I had been working about a month or five weeks"—I also said on cross-examination "I was discharged from Messrs. Jackson and Shaw's in September; I don't know that that was because I was a useless workman; the foreman gave me no reason for dis<lb/>charging me"—I thought I was discharged through the Society—I do not know a person named Lambell (<hi rend="italic">he was called in</hi>)—I do not known that man; I might have seen him; I never talked to him as I know of—the day Tamblyn and Pyle were arrested I passed by some church near Belgrave Square, and a man came out and asked me how I got on; it may have been that man—I don't know that I said "All right; they have got two more to-day"—I did not call him "Bill;" I never knew the man—I don't know whether he asked me who the men were; I forget all about it; I think he did ask me—I don't know whether I had the names then or not—I wont swear I did not mention Tamblyn and Pyle—I don't recollect his saying "What have you got them for?" he may have said so—I don't recollect saying "I do not know, but they want them;" I might have said so—he may have said "Who are <hi rend="italic">they?</hi>"—I did not reply "The lawyers and them"—I will swear I did not; I did not mention the lawyers or the masters, or any one—I did not say "<hi rend="italic">They</hi> want them;" I will swear that; nothing of the kind—they were wanted for my clothes and for insulting me in the shop—he did not say "This job will cost you something; if you like I will take a hat round for you;" nothing of the kind—nor did I say I did not want it, as they were paying the expenses—he did not offer me a job, or say he would get me one—I never heard him say so; he was not speaking half a minute to me.</p>

I did not know Camp's name when I was examined at the Police Court—I had applied for a warrant for two persons, who turned out to be Camp and Moulton—I have not seen Camp since; we went to his bench and got his name—I mentioned at the Police Court about his asking me to follow him into the closet—I mentioned the man—I</p>

               <p>did not know his name at the time—Walker held me up by both legs—I laid at the Police Court that he held me up—I meant by the legs—I asked Elm to let me go, ever so many times—he held my legs up all the time I eras down, I should say 20 minutes—I was underneath the whole lot of them—Davis was the constable to whom I pointed out Walker—I believe I mentioned to Davis about my legs being held up—I might not have said for 20 minutes—I spoke to Mr. Young and showed him my coat, and what took place in the shop—my chief cause of complaint was not what took place in the water-closet, it was in the shop as well, at the time—those in the closet were the worst in one way, but I spoke of the whole—that was the chief cause of my complaint—that was the first charge I made—I don't think I told Mr. Young that Walker, or anybody, had held me by the legs for 20 minutes—Moulton was in the closet—he was at work after that and Camp too—I have not seen him since he left—I swear that Moulton and Camp went into the closet, but I don't know that I saw them afterwards—I did not mention Moulton's name at the Police Court on 22nd April—I said Walker and Knapp were the only two could swear to—I was kicked in ever so many places, not very hard, I was knelt upon mostly, I was kicked in the mouth; I had a bad lip—that was not the only time—I was kicked and hit both—I did not tell the doctor or Mr. Young that I was kicked—I said I was knocked about, I did not say struck—I believe I have said before to-day that Walker struck me on the bottom of the back, I cannot say where; I know I have said so, and I will swear that he did—they left me insensible—I forget whether I have said that before to-day—I was not right, I had not all my senses as I ought to have had—they were kneeling on me, shoving me backwards and forwards against the wall, and scratching me, I was hit and smacked and knocked about, and crushed against the wall, and they were trying to stifle me whilst I was on the floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I first made an application to the Police Court it was for an assult, for what took place in the water-closet—I did not say any<lb/>thing about my clothes then—the officer went with me that I might point out the men that were concerned in what took place in the closet, and I pointed out Walker, Moulton, and Camp—I did not tee Knapp, they found out his name—they first of all took Walker, and I gave evidence against him—I never saw Knapp or Moulton after that—I believe I saw one of the others afterwards—I have not seen Camp since he left the shop, not since he was wanted—I had no attorney at first—the case was reported in the newspapers, and after that someone came to me on behalf of the masters, and Messrs. Wontner were instructed—I then gave Mr. Wontner a full state<lb/>ment of what had ocoured to me, in the shop as well as in the closet, and he did what he thought proper—when I said that Tamblyn and Pyle were the worst, I meant the worst in the shop—I was not discharged from Jackson and Shaw's in September as a useless workman—a man named Charteris was the foreman who discharged me, I had seen him in communication with the Society's men outside lots of times.</p>

I am a M.R.C.S., 141, Finborough Road, West Brompton—Coffin came to see me on Saturday evening, 22nd March; I had previously attended his wife in her confinement; she had been very ill; he was apparently very ill—he seemed to be suffering a great deal, in a very excited state, particularly nervous, and quite hysterical; he appeared to labour in his breathing, and to have great pain in taking a deep inspira<lb/>tion—my attention being called to the nature of the accident, I examined his chest and his body generally—I found marks, particularly about the buttocks, as if the hand had been applied very freely—there were marks on his chest, on the back, and about the shoulders—very slight marks—there was no abrasion of the surface, very slight discolouration—it gave him great pain to take a deep inspiration—he could not bear me to touch his chest, it seemed to inflict a great deal of pain upon him—I apprehended that in<lb/>flammatory action might supervene, and I treated him accordingly—he went on very well, and is now convalescent, much sooner than I anticipated—I consider that the appearances upon his body were the result of rough handling.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi>). On 8th May I was in High Street. Camden Town, and saw Plume and another man; seeing that Plume had something in his pocket rather bulky, I was induced to follow him—they went up High Street, Camden Town, to Rowley's, the pawnbroker's—the other man went as far as James Street, While Plume went into Rowley's and pledged a Church Service, which has been produced, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then came out and joined the other man, and they went together to Mr. Hampson's, in Chalk Farm Road, where Plume went in and offered another book for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but they refused to take it in—I went into another compartment ald heard what was said—I then followed them to Great College Street, where the other man pledged a book while Plume remained outsider-previous to the other men going in, a ticket passed from one to the other, also a little parcel, which I believe to be a book, and that was done at each place, the one who waited outside always had the stock of books and the fickets—I followed about two hours and a half to different public-houses, and at last to Mr. Starling's, where Plume went in—I then got the assistance of a constable in Uniform, but before I could do so the other one escaped—I went into the shop and said to Plume "How do you account for the possession of this book?"which was handed to me over the counter—he said "It is my property"—I said "Where did you get it from?" he said "From a friend who has gone to Australia"—I said "What about the other books that you and the other man have pledged?"—he said "We have pledged no books"—I told him they had pledged one at Mr. Rowley's, and that the other man had pledged</p>

               <p>one at Mr. Parr's, in College Street—on the way to the station he said "I bought them in Paternoster Row, I cannot remember the number, but I can produce the catalogue of them"—he has not done so—he was remanded to the 15th and again to the 22nd—when I was conveying him to Guildhall he said "Have not you taken the other man, he is worse than me"—I asked him if he would give me the other man's name and address—he said that he would, but he has never done so—he was then remanded to the 28th—twenty-two books were pledged, and Plume had one in his possession—I think the man who has escaped had one, I saw something bulky.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on the Saturday the prisoner's wife was on the landing, abusing my husband; she called us all manner of foul names—my husband went out and asked her to go away—she said she had as much right to stop there as he had—she went up and came down again with a small fire shovel in her hand, and began abusing him—he went out to tell her to go away, and she struck him with it, and the prisoner came down with a hatchet in his hand and said "Leave him to me," and struck him on the head with the back part of the hatchet—blood streamed from the wound—I went to take the shovel from the wife, and she said "You b----cow, I will serve you the same."</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S., 254, Bethnal Green Road—on 5th May I was sent for to see the prosecutrix at the police-station, she was very faint and excited at times, also hysterical—I found on the left side of her throat a cut made by a sharp instrument, extending across the centre of the throat from left to right, partially through the skin, about five inches in length—also a cut on the right side, extending midway between the collar<lb/>bone and the right cheek, over the lower jaw—that had penetrated the skin entirely for about one inch under the jaw, from whence blood flowed—they were skin wounds; none of them were serious—they were of such a character as might have been inflicted with this knife, they could not have been done with a great deal of force, except the one under the jaw.</p>

The witness Coote says I was perfectly sober; he says he saw blood flowing, which was impossible where my sister was standing; the doctor says the wound was on the right side, and Coote could not have seen that from the bar. I recollect going into the Green Man with my sister and standing there talking, but upon what subject I have no recollection. I recollect flying into a passion about something and seizing her by the throat, but I had the knife in my hand at the time, and she caught hold of my hand, and she was as likely to cut it as me. I have no recollection whatever of using the weapon to her throat. When we got outside the public-house, she caught hold of my arm. I said "Go away, don't follow me, you will get locked up." I called to somebody to take hold of her and then I saw that her throat was cut. I said "For God's sake, take this woman away; she is my sister, her throat is cut. "If I had wished to do her any harm there are dark places at the back where I could have inflicted a wound upon her, but I had no</p>

On this night, about 8.45, I saw the prisoner coming towards the shop, followed by a little girl, who asked for a bundle of wood; I served her, and going round the counter to get a candle, I saw the pri<lb/>soner take a bundle of wood, and put it in his pocket and walk out—he said to the girl "That is nice bacon you have there, I will have a rasher right along, but I have not got the money to pay for it, I will pay when my wifes comes home"—as I was cutting the bacon, I saw him go towards the window, put his hand there, and put something in his pocket—he said "Make it just half-a-pound," and I saw him put his hand into a basket and take some potatoes; he whistled to his dog and went away—the potatoes were about 2 yards from the egg-basket—I do not know why he did not wait for the bacon—I went after him, after calling my wife—I said, "I saw you put some things in your pocket; you have</p>

               <p>got some potatoes and wood, and I think some eggs"—he strongly denied it a great many times, and I struggled with him—I know of no con<lb/>tract between his wife and me for the supply of wood and potatoes—I do not know of his taking wood away before—at the station I saw the wood and tea taken from him; it was tea which he took from the window, which I thought was eggs; the packets lay close to the eggs—I gave him no authority to take away the tea—he said at the station "I will pay for them."</p>

I live at 10, Marigold Street, Bermondsey—the prisoner's wife is my sister—on 9th March, I came out of a beer-shop and saw the prisoner pulling my sister about in a brutal manner—I asked him to leave off, but he would not—he pulled her across the street, and I went across and stooped to pick her up—he struck me on my forehead with a knife, and twice on my face, and twice on my coat—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my coat—I was in Guy's Hospital three days, and thirteen days at home—I am still under the doctor.</p>

I am a hairdresser, of Dover Street, Southwark—up <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Monday, May 20th, the prisoner was in my employment—I gave him notice on the Saturday previous to leave in a week; instead of that he left on the Monday night, when I was absent—I saw him on the Tuesday, talking to the errand-boy, just as he had closed up the shutters—I told him it was very unhandsome of him to leave me in the way he did, he ought to have stayed the week—I said "It would serve you right if I gave you a months' imprisonment for so doing"—he went away, and told me he was going to work at Barnes—my shop was closed a little after 10 o'clock that night, with, a lock, two bolts, and a piece of wood jammed in as well—I saw it fastened—about 1 o'clock I was called up by the police ringing the bell, on going down I found the inner door of the shop open, which I had locked before going to bed—I missed about a half-dozen bottles of perfume, and about a dozen 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bottles, twenty-two hair brushes, a dozen brilliantine bottles, and a quantity of hair which had been tied up in paper and in an old apron of my wife's—I also missed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money and some small articles—on the Saturday following, in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Thomson's, a hairdresser, in Goswell Road—I had not been there a minute before I saw the prisoner offering the hair for sale—I identified it—it is worth about 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—it is natural hair—as the prisoner passed me he said "All right, Mr. Wheatcroft"—a policeman was there, and took him off in custody—the total loss of property was about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are eight brushes of mine which are produced by the police, and which were in my shop, and these scissors which had been ground the week before—the prisoner had been with me two or three months, he lived in the house and knew it well.</p>

I said I was waiting for a young man who had given me the bag, and I went home at 1 o'clock. I did not look at the bag for two days; I then looked, and the eight brushes, the scissors, and apron, and hair, were all packed together. I went to try and sell the hair.</p>
