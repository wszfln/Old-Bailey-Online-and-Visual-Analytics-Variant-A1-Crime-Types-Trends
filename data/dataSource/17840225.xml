Gentlemen, you are first to judge whether this house was broke open in the night time, which is necessary to constitute a burglary, the woman went to bed at a quarter after eight, that is the night certainly; and the property is found at Kensington Gravel-pits, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, therefore these things must have been taken away in the intermediate time, now you are to judge at this season of the year, whether it was in the night; the distance is near ten miles.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, in the first place this is a crime as charged in the indictment which the law has made equal to burglary, but in this case here had been no breaking at all; he came in by the street door, and got out by a window, which the prosecutor does not know but it was open: the next thing charged here is, that he stole a pair of bed curtains, now you hear he had got them half off, but they were not all removed; if they had been separated from the bed and had been removed but a foot, that would have been a felony; but in this case it is not so; therefore in point of law, the evidence does not support this indictment.</p>

Gentlemen: Upon indictments of this sort, there are in general three questions very material to be attended to, the first is, as to the fact of breaking into the house, and to that Mr. Garret says he left the house perfectly secure when he went out, and when he came home the door was broke open, the lock forced, and the staple wrenched out, if that he so, it must have been done by force, then there is no doubt but the house was actually broke open; the next question is, whether there was any person in the house at the time, to that you have the prosecutor's evidence also: the next question is, as to the value; now where the house is broke open in the day time no person being in it, it makes a very material difference as to the degree of guilt and the degree of punishment, for if the value does exceed five shillings, in that case it is capital; the articles now produced are much above that sum, and therefore, if you are satisfied with this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250007"/> evidence, you will find the prisoner guilty, if not, you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, the 31st of January last, about half after ten o'clock, soon after the opera was over, I was attempting to get into the tea room, but there was such a prodigious number of people, and the room was so crowded, I could not get in without great inconvenience; I leaned against the door way; I had a new gold watch chain, which had caught on a lady's clothes, and I took it in my hand to put it into my fob, in doing which, I felt a silk purse in my pocket, which contained a fifty guinea note of Hamersley's and ten guineas and a half; a part of my hand rested slightly on this purse, and barely touched it; I felt in half a minute a person lean against my right shoulder, which was next the passage; that was the prisoner; I looked him steadily in the face, and while I was so doing I felt a gentle pulsation just above my right cuff; I thought it was singular that any body could be so cold to tremble at the opera; in a very few seconds after, I perceived my purse was gone; my Lord Westmorland was standing by me, and I told him I was robbed; that person that leaned against me had walked away.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you perceive your purse go out of your pocket? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What was there in your purse? - There was a fifty guinea note of Hamersley's, payable at sight, and ten guineas and a half in gold; from feeling the purse in my pocket a very few seconds before that person leaned against me, and missing it a very few seconds after he walked away from me, and before he was out of my sight, I was thoroughly convinced he was the person that took it; had I known his name and his former character I should without the least hesitation have seized him on the spot, but his dress and his appearance put him externally so much above committing a crime of that sort, and not wishing to make a riot and bustle in a publick place, I resolved not to disturb the society at that instant, but to follow him; I followed him from the passage door where I stood by the outward lobby, between twenty and thirty feet to the outward lobby where the stove is, and where the money is received from people that come to the opera; he turned into the inner lobby that leads to the front boxes to the right; he there addressed himself to a little man in a dark brown, or a snuff coloured suit of cloaths; and I think laid hold of his arm, as I do of Sir

            's now, and said, is the carriage ready; whether that person made any reply to him or not I really cannot take upon me to say, he then turned short about, passed by me, and went into the outward lobby again; he then made a semblance of joining some ladies, who were going into the great hall where the servants were, he proceeded with them till he came to a slight of seven or eight steps which were very much crouded with servants who wait there, and as he descended the steps through a line of servants on each side, he rather raised himself a little as if looking for his domesticks, and cried, are my servants there; the door which goes out of the opera faces the upper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250010"/> of the three arcades; he went through the line of servants, but instead of proceeding strait forwards which he should have done, he deviated to the right and went out of the center arcade; I followed him without saying a word, or making the least gesture or hint of suspicion, at the distance of between four to six feet; when he came to the centre arcade, he took rather wider steps across the stag pavement, but he did not run; the moment he put his foot on the kirb stone of the pavement he set off, stooping under the pole of a carriage that had two bay horses, into the center of the Haymarket; I pursued him down the middle of the street through the carriages, as they were going on, to very near the bottom of the Haymarket, in Pall-mall, where he attempted to throw himself under a coach; I threw myself upon him and caught him by the skirt of his coat; finding I laid hold of him I believe he said, zounds, Sir, what do you mean, but however he said, Sir, what do you mean, I am a gentleman, or words to that effect; I said to him, Sir, it is an aukward thing to mention, but I think you have robbed me of my purse, or that you have stole my purse; he rather made some effort to get away; I took him by the collar and shook him, and said, Sir, do not compel me to be rough with you; a great concourse of people naturally got round us, and we were some how or other carried by the press opposite to Pinchbeck's, and a coach was called, which he was half way forced into, and my foot was on the step, I objected to going into the coach, and said, I should carry him to the Opera-house; I did so; and at the Opera-house and frequently after, he said, Sir, have a care, I am not the sort of person you take me for, you will get yourself into a scrape; pray Sir, do not expose me; take care what you are about; but whether he said it before we got to the Opera-house or after I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. You had no knowledge of him before? - No, Sir, I never saw him before; when I took him to the Opera-house I asked for the constable, who seeming to be a a stupid ignorant fellow, and I had my doubts whether he was quite sober; I called to the corporal of the guard, as I wanted to find my buckle, which I had lost, and likewise to caution the company there; I think the corporal's name was Bridgen; I bade him be answerable for him as a military man, for me, a Member of Parliament; Mr. Breadhill offered to walk up with me to the Rotation-office; I returned to the corporal and said, can you spare me a couple of men to take this man up to the watch-house, he said, yes, and gave me a file of soldiers, and I went up with him to the watch-house; in the way to the watch-house he repeatedly said, Sir, have a care, you will get yourself into a scrape, I am not the person you take me for; I was rather irritated, and said at last, if you have any friends that can speak for you I do not wish to expose you, I will take you to a tavern or coffee-house, and you may send for your friends, but I will never quit you; upon his again repeating it, I said, to him, if I have done you any injury I will beg your pardon or do any thing you wish; I am the last man in the world to do a thing of this kind unoffended; he bowed his head and made no answer to that; when I conducted him to St. James's watch-house, I gave the soldiers something, and left him in the custody of the constable of the night, and at the same time desired him to tell me his name, which he did not refuse, but made a sort of waving his hand and a bow; when I had given in my own name, and he had declined giving his, I was going, not being used to transactions of this sort; but one of the constables said, Sir, would not you have him searched; the prisoner then walked up to me and said, Sir, I am sure you are a person of too much feeling and delicacy to have me searched by vulgar fellows of this sort, my dress and appearance do not make that necessary; but however, he was searched without the least scruple; they stripped him, and upon him were found a few shillings, some papers, and a lancet, which lancet I can swear to, and I think there were a small pair of compasses, and a box of Irvin's lozenges for a cold;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250011"/> he had on a white marcella quilted waistcoat, an under waistcoat, a new plain blue coat, black sattin breeches, and clouded silk stockings; he was perfectly well dressed, and there was a sort of bandage under his waistcoat: they searched him very minutely, even to his hair, but nothing of mine was found upon him; I went to Mr. Breadhill's house to get my hands and face washed, and a fresh pair of shoes, and a message came there to inform me, that the person who robbed me was

               <p>Was there any body within your touch, or near you, that you suppose could be guilty of a fact of this kind? - There was nobody near me; there were many people to the left; the room was as full as it could be; the prisoner leaned against me, which I thought so extraordinary a thing that I looked him full in the face; my left arm was to the room which was very full, my right arm was next the passage, I had a little gold chain doubled up in my hand, my purse was in my right hand pocket, I felt it not three seconds before that person leaned against me, and I missed it not three seconds after.</p>
               <p>Court. There was no person near you but the prisoner on the left-hand side? - No, I fancy nobody within five or six feet, somebody might be standing behind him, or retired where I could not see them, but I saw nobody but him, and he leaned against me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Pray Sir how long had you stood at the door of the tea-room before you observed any thing at all? - I fancy about a minute and a half, I had been at the other side of the house, the tea-room is the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Did nobody pass you in that time, Sir Godfrey? - I rather think not, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>They might, but nothing struck you? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>You say Sir, you had wrapped up your chain? - No, I held it loosely in my hand, my hand rested on my pocket, and in putting my hand into my pocket, which I did when I went into the door-way, I felt my purse.</p>
               <p>I think you said just now that you thought you felt your purse? - I said so then, but I mean to say now, I am sure I felt my purse.</p>
               <p>Court. I took it so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. This person leaned against you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you was going into the room, and was prevented by the crowd, may be you leaned against somebody? - No, I did not, there was a lady next to me, and I should not lean against her.</p>
               <p>You did not observe him do any thing? - Yes, Sir, I felt five or six very slight pulsations over my right cuff, like a person shaking.</p>
               <p>It was a very cold night? - Yes, but it was exceedingly hot in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250012"/>You was not in the room? - No, in the door.</p>
               <p>Then in the passage the air draws; you saw him move off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you keep your eye upon him? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>And you saw him speak to a person to ask him if the carriage was ready? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see that person afterwards? - I never saw him before or since, I should not know him now, I saw the prisoner speak to him.</p>
               <p>What I mean is, what you may understand, Sir, did you observe him give any thing to the man, or was it possible he could give any thing to that man? - I am perfectly well aware of the insidiousness of that question.</p>
               <p>It is not an insidious question, Sir Godfrey; had you him in your eye all the way till he came to the door? - I did not see him for three or four seconds, I saw him go out of the door, and I did not see him for three or four seconds after.</p>
               <p>Was you by when he was searched and nothing was found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From the time you missed your purse, had you him so much in your eye all the time, that it was or was not possible for him to deliver any thing to that person? - What he gave to this person in the snuff-coloured coat I cannot take upon me to say, I did not see him give any thing; he joined some ladies, I did not see how his hands were employed at all; nothing of mine was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you did not see him for a few seconds? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the same person? - I have not a shadow of a doubt, if I had I would not say it was the person, I am perfectly clear that was the person, perfectly sure of it.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. What have you to say?</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury: I had an opportunity to see the opera on this Saturday night, through the means of a performer belonging to the house, who received from me at the same time surgical assistance; when the opera was over, I had proceeded as far in my way home as the outward door, and I found the foot-way to the right and left so taken up with chairs, chairmen, and link-boys, that it appeared to me the best way to go strait across if I could; I had another reason for this choice; I had appointed to meet an acquaintance at the Orange coffee-house, it was a fine moon light night, a very severe frost, and the ground in the middle of the street as dry, or drier than on the foot pavement; I had got about half way across the street, when one of the many carriages which are assembled there on such occasions, driving very hard, obliged me to use my endeavours to avoid the danger of being run over, I proceeded some little way down the Haymarket, within about one hundred yards of the Orange coffee-house, when Sir Godfrey laid hold of me, I had never seen him before, and he charged me with having his purse; I did not make any resistance, or endeavour to avoid giving him every satisfaction in my power, I advised him to go into the coffee-house, and I hope I shall not offend in informing the Court, that he swore in the most violent manner that he would not be convinced; if I do not mistake, he damned his heart and his blood, and expressions of that kind, that he would not be convinced; I was brought to the watch-house immediately, and when I was there, previous to my being searched, I told him he was mistaken, he told me he suspected me, and if he was mistaken he would give me every satisfaction, he would fight me or any thing else; I was searched as you have heard, and neither his property, nor the property of any other person was found in my possession; you observe gentlemen,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250013"/> the prosecutor has not said that I ran till I reached the outward door; he has said, that after he had missed his purse, he followed me first in the inner lobby, then into the outward lobby, from thence down the large flight of stone stairs, and then through a large stone hall; he followed so close that he heard, or fancied he heard me say something about a coach or servants, expressions which might have been made use of by some gentleman that was there, and mistakenly attributed to me: You will perceive, Gentlemen, that in all this time of his following me, he did not accuse or molest me, thought it is evident, and I hope will appear to you evident, that he might have done it ten times over; I do not know whether you have been able to perceive the temper and disposition of the prosecutor; but this is certain, that he is fiery and hot, and of that I could give many convincing proofs; you will be the best judge, whether if his suspicions were well grounded, he would not have charged me on the spot, and taken me into custody; as to my running, I hope it may be accounted for, the coldness of the night, or a desire of being home by times, may induce a person to make more than ordinary speed; This is my case, and I most humbly hope that the Court will hear me with patience; it is not my interest or my inclination to offend any person in this honorable Court, and if I should happen to let drop any expression which may not be strictly proper, I trust it will not be construed into an offence, but that it will be imputed to arise from that anxiety and desire of vindication, which every man in my unhappy situation must naturally feel. Gentlemen of the Jury, if you were to be asked whether any rumour or report to my disadvantage had reached your ears, unconnected with the present, you would perhaps say yes; if you were asked again, whether you would suffer yourselves to be influenced in the smallest degree by such a rumour or report, I am sure you would with one voice cry God forbid! I trust therefore, Gentlemen, that no insinuations, or rumour, or suggestions, from what channel soever you may have received them, will induce you to deprive me of life, or to condemn me without clear and substantial proof; but as prejudice from such reports, will sometimes penetrate into the minds of the best and wisest, and make an impression before they themselves are aware, of it, you will do well, Gentlemen, and I most humbly and earnestly beg of you, before you determine your verdict on this occasion, to ask yourselves one question; would you on the evidence you have now heard, condemn any other person of whom you had never heard any thing before the present time. Gentlemen, my life is in your hands, and I do not address myself to your feelings, but to your candour and impartiality.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you have a trial that requires your very serious attention, and you will divest yourselves of all prejudice that might arise from any thing that you have heard before concerning the prisoner at the bar, and confine yourselves to the evidence in this case: Gentlemen, the prisoner is indicted for a capital offence, in privately stealing from the person of Sir

             a purse and money: the question for your consideration will be, whether, upon this evidence, you are of opinion that he was the person that actually took the purse or not, and whether there is sufficient evidence for you to be sure, and to conclude, that he was the person without any hesitation or doubt. The evidence for the prosecution is that of Sir Godfrey, the prosecutor only. [Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence and then added] Gentlemen, this is the whole of the case, and upon this evidence there is no pretence to say, that this purse was not taken privily from his person, therefore, it is either a capital offence or no offence at all: I told you before that you must divest yourselves of every circumstance that you have heard relating to the prisoner, you are to judge whether he was the person that took the purse or not; the evidence appears to me to carry presumption with it, but there is not such proof in a case of life as appears to me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250014"/> to be satisfactory: there is strong reason of suspicion, but you must be satisfied in your own consciences, that the prisoner at the bar was the person; it was a place crouded, it was at the Opera House, Sir Godfrey was at the door of a room full of people, there might be other persons behind the prisoner at the bar, on his right side; the prisoner was immediately pursued, Sir

             the prosecutor had his eye upon him and observed him, and saw him shift no property to any other person, and the prisoner is searched minutely at the watch-house, and no property found on him: it seems to be such a sort of a case, that whatever your suspicions are, there does not appear to me sufficient grounds to convict him of a capital offence.</p>

               <p>Did you see any man on horseback come out of the inn at that time? - I saw a man on horseback go into the house, and give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250015"/> the hostler his horse, he came out and went behind the coach and spoke to the coachman, he came from behind the coach, and mounted his horse and rode off, the horse was held at the door; the coachman came and told us we should be robbed, and the young man that was in the coach asked him what reason he had to think so, and he told him that a man on horseback had just called behind the coach, and asked the coachman whether he had any body in his coach that could stand against him, the man gave the coachman a glass of brandy, we begged to get out, but the coachman said he would run all hazards, and we had not gone twenty yards before he stopped us, he had a pistol, and he presented it, he asked us for our money, and said, if we did not give it him he would blow our brains out.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe whether Campfield gave him any thing? - Yes, he gave him what silver he had, and I put my money into my glove, but the highwayman was so quick upon us, that I gave him my glove and money together; he robbed us both, he asked the young man for his watch, and the young man said he had never a one; he said if he did not give him it he would blow his brains out, but on my giving him my money in my glove he rode off.</p>
               <p>Did you take such notice of the person that robbed you to know him again? - No, Sir, I would not pretend to swear to him.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing of his clothes? - He was dressed in brown clothes, but I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the horse? - No, I was sent for to the Justice's, but I could not swear to him.</p>

               <p>Did you stop at Hammersmith? - Yes, at the Red Cow, about half after eight.</p>

               <p>Court. What in anger? - I do not know, I did not see him till I felt him. I took him a bit of a push with my arm, and took him I did not like it; he then asked me if I knew him, I said, no.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you not know him at that time? - No, I did not know him till he told me who he was; he asked me to have something to drink; I told him I had had enough; he desired me to have a glass, and said it would not hurt me; I had a glass and he had another, I thanked him, and was coming out of doors, I took hold of my reins to get upon my box as usual, then he called to me, and said he wanted to speak to me, and I went by the side of the coach, rather behind; he then asked me who I had got inside; I told them there were two poor people going to Brentford, that I had plenty of room; I thought he wanted to tie his horse, which the hostler had in his hand, and ride withinside; I never looked at the horse to take any notice of it; he then asked me if the passengers had got any money; I told him no, I did not think they had; he staggered up against the windows, and said he warranted they could stand a guinea, and he would give me half; he seemed to me to be very drunk; I told him I could work for half a guinea as well as he could; he then mounted his horse and rode away; I stopped about ten minutes, but I spoke to my passengers first, and told them if they had any money to leave it with the landlord.</p>
               <p>Court. Should not you have done well to have seized this fellow, and taken care of him? - It was impossible for me, we are afraid to do that, because often times a passenger will run away, and not pay us, and if we go to hold them, they summons us before a Justice of Peace.</p>
               <p>Court. What was your opinion of it? - I could not tell whether he was romancing; I drove on, and in about fifty or sixty yards I was told by the prisoner to stop.</p>
               <p>Was it the same man that you drank the glass with, and had this discourse with, was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250016"/> he the man that stopped you? - To the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>Look round and see whether the prisoner is the man? - To the best of my knowledge he is.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other man before you saw him? - I saw one other man before I saw him, there was another man came past before he rode away to London.</p>
               <p>When this man that you talked with mounted his horse, which way did he ride? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Which way did the man come from that stopped the coach? - He came from Brentford.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He told me to stop, or he would blow my brains out; I went on, he had something in his hand, then he rode up rather before me again, and told me to stop, then I stopped; the man rapped at the coach, and told them to put down the blinds, and I heard him ask the people in the coach for their money; he staid about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Was you before the Justice? - Yes, on the Saturday following, it was on Monday the coach was stopped, and the next day I was rather in liquor; on the Saturday following I saw the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - I did not think I could be certain of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you such a discernment of his face at Hammersmith? - I did not stay any longer than my liquor was poured out, and he drank his.</p>
               <p>Then you did not take sufficient notice of him at Hammersmith to know him again? - I did not take great notice of him, I rather had doubts of him, I do not think I can be perfect as to the man.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol on the Brentford road, on the 9th of February we were out about eight o'clock, and I met a post chaise and four between Kensington and Hammersmith turnpike gate, and the gentleman that was in the post chaise informed us he had been fired at by a single highwayman, giving us a description of his clothes and horse, which was a bay horse with a switch tail.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Does that answer the description of your horse? - Yes, the horse I found in this man's possession is my horse, my horse is called a bay chesnut, with a switch tail, commonly so called.</p>
               <p>Maynard. We went to Hammersmith, and enquired for such a person, they said there had been such a person; after that I returned back to Kensington turnpike-gate, and when we had got within three hundred yards of Kensington gate, we heard a horse coming very fast; we then set off, and ran three of us, and left two men behind, there were five of us all together, and in a few minutes the horse came up, he did not ask for the gate to be opened, but ran against it, and it almost dismounted him, and I laid hold of him and saw a pistol stick on one side of his pocket; I seized him, that was the prisoner at the bar; he was about to lay hold of the pistol that was in his pocket, and I took it out of his pocket; we then took him off the horse, and took him into the turnpike house to search him, there we found another pistol in his other pocket, and in his right hand coat pocket there was found a woman's glove, with two shillings and threepence halfpenny in it, I did not take that out; in his waistcoat pocket was found some powder and balls; in his breeches pocket there was two shillings and sixpence and half a guinea; the pistols were loaded with powder and ball; he was taken the next morning before Sir Sampson, the two passengers were there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250017"/> but I believe they said they could not tell whether it was the same man; we took the horse to the George in Long-acre, and it was there when Jones claimed the horse; the coachman was at Sir Sampson's the next morning on the 10th, with his coach, he saw the prisoner, and said he could not stop, but that that was the man that had treated him with brandy.</p>

               <p>Court. What do you say to that, you told us you was not there till Saturday, you said you was fuddled the next morning; was you at Sir Sampson Wright's the next morning, recollect yourself? - I was not had before any magistrate, I was up at the office, I was up there, and took up some passengers from the the Brown Bear.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, the 17th of January, French came up to the office for a search warrant, to search a butcher's shop in Exeter-street; it was granted, and I, in company with another officer, went down; we searched as narrowly as we well could search; while French was searching up stairs, I and another officer was searching below, and underneath the stairs, I stepped my foot in a puddle of water, it was a very nasty place, and there were four sheep skins underneath the stairs; I immediately called down French, he came and looked at them, and said they were his property; I found nothing else in the house but what Mr. French found above; there was a vast quantity of mutton.</p>
               <p>When was Davis apprehended? - That day, while French was getting the sheep skins and best part of the mutton which he said he believed to be his; one of the prisoners whom I knew before, and another man in company with him, came near the shop; says I, what is the reason of their lurking about the shop; I came up with them, and they whipped into a public house, and I brought them before Mr. Justice Gilbert, but there being not a tittle of evidence to affect the men, they were discharged; that night I was in search of Davis but did not find him; one of the captains of the patrol knew Davis, and Davis sent him a note that he would resign himself up upon conditions of no harm coming to him, and he would tell of whom he got the five sheep; and in consequence of that the two prisoners were apprehended afterwards; it was the patrol that gave him the promise.</p>

             the witness, because he is the man that ought to be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Townsend. I do not know whether the patrol promised him any sort of favour if he would resign himself; the patrol is not here.</p>
               <p>Court. Davis was a man known by the patrol, was not he? - Very well, he had been abroad with him.</p>
               <p>You could have taken him up in a few days? - Yes, my Lord, unless he had left the country.</p>
               <p>Where is that patrol? - He is at the office, his name is Allen.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The wife of Davis said that he was going to Portsmouth, but would return if I would shew him favour, for he said, death was preferable to exile, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Court to Townsend. How came any of your officers to presume to do any such thing without the advice of the magistrates? - I cannot say, I was not at the apprehending of either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Do you know what answer was sent to Davis's information, or how he was taken up? - I believe that he came to the office the very day that Allen sent for him.</p>
               <p>But how could Allen presume to send for him without the authority of the magistrate?</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, in this case it is certainly, at least unnecessary, if not improper, to examine Davis; there is full evidence against him from these witnesses to prove him at least an accomplice, if not a principal in this fact himself, therefore the evidence of him as an accomplice, stands in such a light in point of law, that it cannot be received, as the law will not admit any person to be convicted on the single testimony of an accomplice; there is not now one tittle of evidence against either of the prisoners, and you could not, in point of law, convict them on the evidence of Davis, there being no other circumstance against them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I have known multitudes of these improper instances.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Magistrates should be very cautious who they admit as evidence, not to admit those against whom there is clear evidence, unless they have reason to think important discoveries can be made.</p>
               <p>Court to Davis. There is the most clear and satisfactory evidence to the Court, that you, whatever the other prisoners might be, are guilty of this offence, and if you had been in the situation of the prisoners you would have been convicted, therefore take warning; but having surrendered on the assurances of this man, however improper, the Court will not now proceed against you, but it will be remembered if you should be found guilty of any thing again; for you are much more guilty than these men, as you are a shop-keeper yourself. - Let him be discharged, but let the officers keep an eye over his conduct.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. The officer ought to have gone to the magistrate and asked his advice about it.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice GOULD.</p>

               <p>Court. Who was the man that you carried it for? - He was dressed like a painter, I do not know the man.</p>
               <p>Have you him here? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to prove that? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to your character? - No, I am a stranger in London.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This prisoner was found with stolen goods in a suspicious manner, and the usual course is, that he should satisfy you that he came honestly by them. The question is, whether this is within that act of parliament of King William, which takes away the benefit of clergy, and makes it a capital offence, where goods are stolen out of shops and warehouses, that is, such sort of goods as are usually kept there in their course of dealing, that sort of commodity in which they deal, to the value of five shillings, privately and without the knowledge of the party, then it shall be a capital offence. Upon all these acts of parliament the construction has been always exceedingly strict; in the case of a private pick pocket, the act of parliament says pretty often in the same words, privately and without knowledge of the party; if they feel but the slightest sensation before the property is removed from the person, it has been the constant rule, that that takes it out of that act of parliament; so in my apprehension, in the present case, this was not absolutely without the knowledge of the prosecutor, because he heard a rustling in the shop, and if he had gone out the first time upon that alarm, he certainly would have detected the offender; therefore, I think that the same construction should be put on this evidence, and you should acquit the prisoner of stealing privately.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol belonging to Sir Sampson Wright on Uxbridge and Kilburn roads; on the 27th of January about a quarter before seven, we came off the Kilburn road, and when we rode to Tyburn Turnpike, we heard that three footpads had committed a robbery on the Uxbridge road; we went down Park-lane into Hyde-park, there were six of us, and as soon as we came to the Bason, I saw the three prisoners coming towards us, and towards Grosvenor-gate, I then made up towards the prisoner Jacobs, and he took to his heels and ran away, I pursued him, he then took a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250024"/> a pistol out from withinside his coat, and turned round to fire at me; he turned just half way round, he presented the pistol to me, and he found I was rather too much on the left side of him, and he threw his pistol down, and as it fell it flashed in the pan; he was still running, and I pursued him and laid hold of him; I tied his hands and searched him, and found on him this watch, which was in the fob of his breeches pocket, with one seal and two keys.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the other two prisoners? - My other partners took the other two, I held him fast, and kept him in custody till we came to Covent Garden watch-house; we all came into Oxford-road, and there we took two coaches and went to Sir Sampson Wright's, and about two days after I saw the prosecutor there, the watch was then produced: I found on Jacobs one shilling and sixpence, and one penny.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you see the other prisoner taken? - No, he run off, I searched Selshire, the man I had hold on, and found this pistol loaded upon him, I have the balls in my pocket, and eight pence in halfpence. There was a loaded pistol found on M'Donald.</p>

            ? - In about half a minute, as soon as I had hold of Selshire, I turned round, we took them to Sir Sampson Wright's, they were sent to different prisons; I was present on the Thursday following when Mr. Chapman came, he then saw his watch after the charge was laid to the prisoners; Sir Sampson asked them, what they had to say, and they then all of them acknowledged the crime, and Selshire in particular desired to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Did Sir Sampson take down any thing in writing? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I have heard that a question did arise which was pretty thoroughly debated, whether evidence should be admitted of a confession by a prisoner before a Justice of the Peace; the law is, that the Justice of the Peace is to take the informations of the witnesses, and the examination of the prisoner, and shall reduce them into writing, and return them to the gaol delivery.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Reynolds. Was not there some question whether parole evidence might be given of confession taken before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. It has always been understood that where no written examination had been taken, parole evidence may be admitted; but if the Justice takes the examination in writing, then they cannot give in evidence his parole examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. It is his duty to take it in writing: the rules of law are the things that you should steer by, but I want to know whether something of the kind has not been thought of, and considered here, and under that distinction the parole proof admitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. My Lord, the parole proof has been admitted where no written examination was set up; a very little while ago a witness asserted in his evidence, that an examination had been taken in writing, and the examination was not returned, but that having been asserted by him, the Court would not admit the parole evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I understand by Sir Sampson, who sits by me, that he really thought that this evidence had been taken down in writing; indeed the Justices have hardly time to take down the examinations, but yet the law is not to be departed from, and the Act of Parliament says, the Justice shall take the informations of the witnesses, and the examination of the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250025"/> and shall return them. - Mr. Reynolds. In London, unless it is a very special case, Examinations are never taken in writing, as only one gentlemen sits there, and they could not do the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould what is said in other places may be received, but before the Justice of Peace, there it should be reduced into writing, therefore I cannot admit this.</p>
               <p>Bowyer. The prisoners were taken in about half an hour after the robbery.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol; I can only say what the others have said, except just as we came into Hyde-park and went down walnut tree walk, I thought I heard somebody say, damn my eyes, here is somebody a coming.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear it, or did you not? - I did hear somebody say so, and I mentioned it to Captain Bowyer; we had scarce got a yard farther up came the three prisoners, Jacobs was the first man I saw; I went to make up to him, and he immediately advanced from me, and attempted to run, he clapped his hand to his side instantly to draw out this pistol; the moment I saw it I called to Creedland; says I, Creedland! Creedland! take care, he has pulled out a pistol! the instant moment I said so, it flashed in the pan, and he threw it away; I then called out, pursue him, and I will wait here and see whereabout he has hove that pistol; I saw him throw it away; then we took him to Sir Sampson's.</p>
               <p>Court to Creedland. Was not the pistol thrown to the ground before it flashed in the pan? - As it fell it flashed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. It is a very different thing as to the conduct of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PRISONER JACOB's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been out that afternoon, and as I was coming up to the Lock Hospital I found a red and white pocket handkerchief, with two pistols in it and a watch; I found it almost facing Mr. Tattershall's; Selshire was with me; he said, says he, I will have half; I gave him the pistol and the handkerchief, and I had the pistol and the watch; coming to the turnpike we met M'Donald, and as we were going through Hyde-park he came with us, and just coming through Walnut-tree Walk we met three gentlemen, so I threw the pistol away; I thought, may be they would take me up or something.</p>
               <p>PRISONER SELSHIRE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was along with this man coming from Battersea, he picked up this handkerchief, and he gave me that pistol.</p>

               <p>I had been with an acquaintance of mine, and coming by Kensington turnpike I met these two young men; I had the pistol about me, and the bullets, which I found in Hyde-park the day before; I carried them about me for my own defence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bearcroft, of Council for the prosecution thus opened the case:</p>

I doubt not but you are well apprised of the necessity of a law of this nature, and that you are disposed to put it in force if the facts are proved to your satisfaction; I shall therefore state to you without much observation, for I am afraid the grounds of bringing the guilt at least of uttering this note by the prisoner at the bar, will be but too clear. Gentleman, the prisoner has of late appeared in the character of a <rs id="t17840225-13-deflabel70" type="occupation">farmer</rs>

Gentlemen it is clear that they should identify the bank note that is produced to you, and the witnesses Hayward and Wagstaff will speak to it by particular marks which they observed on the face of it; by such obliterations which were remarkable, but which I shall not attempt to point out to you, because they come in the fittest way from the witnesses themselves; they will tell you what struck their observation when it was first produced to them, and with what certainty they can prove it be to the same note: I understand that they will prove that the note was first delivered from the Prisoner to Wagstaff, and afterwards from Wagstaff to Hayward, and by him to another person who will be produced to you, and he found it was a forged bank note: I shall perfectly satisfy you of that by the usual evidence, so as to leave no doubt on your minds; that person returned the note to him, and as soon as he found it was forged, he called upon Wagstaff, as was perfectly natural in his situation, and upon consideration together, they determined to go to Newland to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250029"/> make enquiries on this business; they settled to go on Sunday; they went to his place of residence in the country, and they found him at home; immediately they entered into conversation with him, and told him the notes, or rather I will confine myself to the note, which is the regular and proper way, was a forged note; the expressions he made use of, and I mean to state correctly the expressions he made use of, in the several conversations he had, and to desire you to attend to that and to his behaviour, when he was first apprised that this was a forged note; you will attend to these circumstances in order to settle in your minds whether his behaviour and conduct was that of an innocent man, or whether he did not manifestly shew a consciousness of guilt; for it is in that way that you are to satisfy yourselves of the guilt of the prisoner at the bar. On his being told they were forged, his expression immediately was, I am surprised at that, for I had them from a man of property; this was in conversation between Wagstaff and the prisoner, he told him he had brought Mr. Hayward down with him, and he was waiting at some little distance, and he desired him to go to Mr. Hayward; they went to Hayward, as soon as he appeared, Mr. Hayward addressed him in this manner: he said, Newland, you had no right to expect me without a number of armed men to take you into custody; I might have been dragged out of my bed to gaol: Where did you get these notes? the prisoner's answer was, as it had been to Wagstaff before, I had them from a man of property: Hayward immediately asked him, from whom: now what would have been the answer of an innocent man; if he had known of whom he had them, would not he have directly told the person's name for his own sake, and for the sake of public justice: that ought to have been his conduct, and for his own sake it would have been natural; for if an innocent man, which certainly may happen by accident, becomes possessed of a forged bank note, and he is told it is a forged bank note, his own personal safety, and common prudence dictate, that if he knows of whom he received it, he should instantly disclose it: therefore as the prisoner, when first asked, acknowledged that he knew the man of whom he had it, it remains for him to tell you, if he can, why he did not immediately disclose that person's name; he was pressed to tell, but he refused, and he was desired to go to town with Wagstaff and Hayward in order to find this man in particular, from whom he received these forged bank notes; his answer was, I cannot find him if we go now, and I promise I will come to you at ten o'clock tomorrow to your house, and still expressed himself saying, I cannot suppose these are bad notes; Hayward had a strong suspicion of the prisoner, and he again made use of expressions importing that suspicion, even so strong as to say, Newland, I will certainly hang you; the answer the prisoner made, is little like the answer of an innocent man; his answer was, all you want is your money, you shall have your money, that is what you want; he promised to call on Hayward again, but before they parted they had other conversation, and it will appear, I am told, by the further conversation, that there was a great deal of reservation, and much equivocation, utterly inconsistent with the behaviour of a man intirely innocent, and who by misfortune (for it is a very great one) had got hold of a forged bank note; there was further conversation between them before they parted that day; and Hayward charged him with the actual forgery; his answer was somewhat singular; no, I could not forge them, as I can neither read nor write; Hayward told him the law is the same for uttering them: upon this they quitted him, he promising and they believing that they should have the money produced. On the 8th of December Wagstaff met the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, he asked him if he had been at Hayward's, no he said, he had not been there, upon which Wagstaff desired him to go. They went to a publick-house, and he said he had not been to Hayward, because the gentleman he had them from was gone to Stratford, and would not be at home before the evening;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250030"/> he said was then under a necessity of going home, but promised to meet the next day: Wagstaff and Hayward were both together at this publick-house, and they both pressed him extremely to name the person from whom he had the notes, but he declined that, and said he was perfectly sure that the gentleman from whom he had them did not know they were forged, and he begged in the most earnest manner that they would not disclose this matter, but keep it secret. Now you will consider gentlemen, as I go along, whether this was the conduct of an innocent man: the prisoner did not come as he promised; he promised another day to come, and he did not: therefore Wagstaff and Hayward both together went again to his house, he excused himself with some frivolous excuse for not having kept his promise of coming, and then promised again to come the next day, and again intreated them not to mention it, for that he was just got into an extraordinary farm, and begged for God's sake that it might not be buzzed abroad. On the Friday this prisoner met them both again, and then Mr. Hayward insisted upon it that he should tell him where and from whom he had the notes; then his conduct appeared more suspicious, (but however of that you will judge) for being pressed to the wall by Hayward, he said he would not tell in the presence of any witness but if Hayward would retire alone with him, he would disclose to him the name of the person from whom he had them, then the prisoner and Hayward went into a room by themselves, and he extorted from Hayward a solemn promise not to disclose it, and then he asserted that he had this forged bank note, together with the other from Mr.

            , a potatoe merchant, as he is described, in Spitalfields, and he undertook to Hayward that he would either bring him or the money by times the next morning; for he told him that Davis, from whom he had received the note, was gone to seek after the money; and he again begged of him to keep it secret, and if Davis of the money was not brought him the next morning, he should be welcome to disclose it. Gentlemen, In short not to take up more of your time, after many enquiries about Davis, and talking with Davis, (for what Davis said will not be evidence against the prisoner at the bar) it was found that the prisoner and this Davis were gone off: a proper enquiry was made to get at them if possible, and you will find, that after a great deal of diligent search, under many suspicious circumstances which I will not state, at a great distance from London, the prisoner and Davis were found by the sea coast going by different names from their own; if you attend to these circumstances, you will see from the beginning the prisoner at the bar insisting that he had the note from a man of property, and though pressed, declining to declare the man's name, in a way that an innocent man, I should submit to you, could not possibly do, but you will form your own judgement; at last, however, he consents to tell Hayward alone (for he would not talk to Wagstaff) that he had it from Davis, and he undertakes to produce

             the next morning, but he never comes himself, nor does Davis come: search is made after both, and both of them are found by the sea coast of this country, for what purpose you will judge.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, this is the case we have to lay before you, we shall endeavour to prove before you, that the prisoner at the bar uttered this forged note; and the question for you to determine therefore is, whether it was a forged note to the knowledge of the prisoner at the time of the uttering; and in order to determine that, you will consider whether this conduct, and these expressions of his can at all be made agreeable to the conduct of an innocent person, and added to that, after this promise to produce the party to the person injured, from whom he had it; his failing of that promise and attempting to elude any search, and coupled with that promise, and also to his being at a distant place by a feigned name; it seems therefore to me, that a clearer case cannot come before you to satisfy you of the guilt of this prisoner at the bar, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250031"/> uttering this note knowing it to be forged. Gentlemen, it is a question as to his knowledge, it is a question of conscience, it is a question concerning what passes in a man's mind, and it cannot be proved by any thing but circumstances; and I conceive the circumstances we shall lay before you are incompatible with the conduct of an innocent man. Gentlemen, this is our case, and if you are satisfied by the testimony of the witnesses, of the guilt of the prisoner at the bar, your duty to the publick requires that you should find him guilty; if you are not satisfied, it is no less your duty to the individual to acquit him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow Council for the Prisoner. My Lord, on the part of the prisoner I am instructed that all the witnesses, except those that belong to the Bank of England, to whom your Lordship cannot easily believe my instructions were to extend, may be examined apart.</p>

               <p>Look at that note? - This is one of them.</p>

               <p>Did any thing else pass at that time? - Nothing particular, only we drank together.</p>
               <p>What happened afterwards? - In about a fortnight, or something more, I believe it was, Mr. Hayward came to me and told me the notes were forged, and we agreed to go down to Mr. Newland; he lived at Chinkford-hall, in Essex; I called him out of his parlour, and told him there was a sad piece of work had happened, for those notes were forged that I had of him.</p>
               <p>What did Mr. Newland say? - He said he was surprized at that, he had them from a man of property.</p>
               <p>Did he say who that man of property was? - No he did not.</p>
               <p>What then passed? - Then we came to the chaise to Mr. Hayward; I told him he was in the chaise; Mr. Hayward got out of the chaise as soon as he saw him, and told him he might have expected that he should have brought some persons down to have taken him into custody; he said he knew nothing of their being forged; I then told him the man must have his money back again; he said, yes, certainly he must, and he would come the next day and go to the man whom he had them of, and get the money returned back for them, he did come the next morning at ten o'clock and said he could not find the man, he was gone out of town somewhere.</p>
               <p>Did you ask who the gentleman was? - Mr. Hayward did, but he omitted telling him, he said he would come the next day; but did not, and the next day, or the next day but one we went down to Chinkford<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250032"/> again; when we came to Chinkford, we were very angry with him, both Mr. Hayward and me, for not coming according to his promise; he said he was vexed that he did not come, but he had been busy, he had been to some market at Waltham; on Friday he came to town, and we met at a publick house in Camomile-street; he had then told Mr. Hayward who it was he had them of, but he would not let me hear him.</p>
               <p>How came you not to hear him? - He desired me to go out of the room while he told Mr. Hayward, for he said he would tell him but he would not tell any body else.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing else? - No, I had no discourse with him that day.</p>
               <p>Had you any discourse with him any time afterwards? - No, I asked Mr. Hayward whether he said any thing satisfactory.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You must not tell us what Mr. Hayward said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Had you any discourse with the prisoner after? - I do not recollect I saw him till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Could you find him at all after that? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You never went to the place where you was likely to find him? - No.</p>
               <p>This man was but a slight acquaintance of yours? - I have known him four or five years.</p>
               <p>You knew Davis, the potatoe merchant, in Spital-fields-market.</p>
               <p>I knew him about the same time I knew Mr. Newland, but I have not seen him above ten months.</p>
               <p>The prisoner applied to you at a publick house, and asked you if you knew any body who could give change for two one hundred pounds bank notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he deposited with you as a pledge, two notes of one hundred pounds each, receiving from you one hundred and twenty pounds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was a fortnight before you had occasions apply to the prisoner again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner then for all that you know on that subject, was, during that fortnight, residing at Chinkford, in the usual way of his trade as a farmer? - For ought I know he was.</p>
               <p>He had met with no obstruction from you or the governors of the Bank? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you it was for a friend of his? - No.</p>
               <p>But on your telling him they were forged and there had been sad work, he said directly, I shall apply to the gentleman from whom I had them, and I will endeavour to get the money returned? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your object and the object of Mr. Hayward was, in truth to have got the money for these bad notes? - He wanted his money again.</p>
               <p>And if the prisoner at the bar had had the discretion to deliver the money, you would have given him the notes? - I did not hold the notes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not avail himself of this opportunity to escape, but put you off from day to day, with always telling you he would get the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say he did in fact come to town and meet you more days than one? - Two days.</p>
               <p>And he returned of course to his own house for any thing you know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. When he offered you these notes, it was for you to give him cash for them, was not it? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Did he say the reason why he wanted cash? - He said he was going into the country to buy some goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long was it after the time that you found these notes were forged, that he was apprehended? - It was some time more than three weeks, but he was in the country.</p>
               <p>What distance from town? - At Yarmouth I heard.</p>
               <p>That you know nothing about to your own knowledge?</p>
               <p>Court. But from the time that you first gave intimation that these notes were forged, what space of time intervened? - From the time I had the last interview with him at the Coach-maker's Arms, I did not see him afterwards; he did not go out of town directly after, I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250033"/>He might have gone any where? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you know these to be the two notes which the prisoner gave you? - There is a particular mark, there is a word blotted in the word Schutz, in both of them, and one more than the other; when they were opened by Mr. Hayward he said, how they have blotted them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it your custom to write the name of the person from whom you received the bank notes upon it? - I am not much accustomed to bank notes.</p>
               <p>Then there is no other mark whatever that you know them by, save that of the blot? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you a master weaver? - What goods I make is my own.</p>
               <p>You are not extremely conversant in bank notes? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Therefore, whether they are frequently blotted or not you cannot tell? - No, I thought it was no harm to them.</p>

               <p>What passed between you after that? - Wagstaff went away, I did not see the notes the first time, he returned again in a very short time with the notes, and said that would do, that Mr. Newland was going into the country, and I might have the use of the other eighty pounds for about two months.</p>
               <p>What passed then between you? - Nothing more, than that I advanced him the money, and I had the notes, and I observed a blot.</p>

               <p>When was it, and to whom that you paid the other note, No. 76? - No. 76, the other note, I paid sometime in November, but cannot tell the day, I called upon Mr. Buxton, a haberdasher, and asked him to change me that note.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - In Bishopsgate-street, he said, he had but about thirty pounds, he gave me that, he was busy in the shop, he took the note and put it by seemingly careless, I called again the next day, as I call in generally most days in the week, says he, you may take back your note, for I do not know when I shall have enough give you change for it, and you may give me the thirty pounds in a day or two.</p>
               <p>Had you indorsed it at that time? - No, Sir, there was no mark at all.</p>
               <p>When did you indorse it first? - At Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What negotiation did you put the note in? - None at all, I kept it from that time, the other note I passed away to Mr. Ellis.</p>
               <p>When was it that any notice of a suspicion came to you, that these notes were forged notes? - The latter end of November, I cannot be positive, as soon as Mr. Ellis told me it was a bad note, I applied to Mr. Wagstaff.</p>
               <p>When was that, as near as you can recollect? - The Saturday, but I cannot tell the day of the month, I found him at home, and said to him, Wagstaff, these two notes that you have brought are forged, and we concluded to go to him the Sunday; this was the Saturday evening, we thought it more likely to find him the Sunday; the Sunday morning we took a chaise and went down to Chinkford Hall, in Essex, there I sat in the chaise while Wagstaff went into Newland's house, I cannot positively say the day of the month, but it was of a Sunday, Wagstaff and Newland came out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250034"/> house together, I got out of the chaise and met them both; the first word that I said to Newland, was this, says I, Newland, you had no right to expect me by myself, without five or six armeds men to take you into custody, I added, I might have been taken and dragged out of my bed, and dragged to a gaol; then I told him the notes were forged, he said, if they were forged, he could not forge them, for he could neither read nor write, I told him he was as liable to be hanged for putting them off, as the man that made them, I asked him who he had them from, he said, he had them from a man of property, I asked him, who that man of property was, he did not chuse to tell me.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not tell you? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How do you mean that he did not chuse to tell you? - I asked him several times and he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>He was silent upon it? - Yes, I asked him to go with me to town, then I told him it was a matter of a very serious concern, and that certainly his life was in danger, if he did not produce the man in a proper manner; he begged I would not mention it any where thereabout, he would not have it mentioned for five hundred pounds; that he had just got into a farm of two hundred a year, and it might be the ruin of him; I still pressed him to let me know from whom he had them, he told me the money was all I wanted, and I might depend upon having it; he asked me what was to be done in case the money could not immediately be had, I told him, I would hang all that was concerned, he said, he hoped, I would not talk about hanging any body, and appointed to meet me at my own house the next day at ten o'clock; I then left him, and he came according to his promise, I told Wagstaff to watch in the street, and he came at eleven to the Coach-maker's Arms; as soon as we had got into the back parlour, I asked him if he had brought the money, he said, no, he had not, I asked him who the man was again, this man that he had got them of, and he then refused to tell me, he said, the gentleman was gone to Stratford, and would not be at home before the evening, and that he wanted to go home, but would not me the next morning, and would bring me the money; I let him go away; he did not come the next day, on the Thursday, Wagstaff and I took a chaise, and went down to Chinkford Hall again.</p>
               <p>Did you find him there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you speak to the day of the month? - I have not got the day of the month down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then you went to Chinkford Hall? - Yes, I told him, I thought he was run away, he pretended he had been to some market just by, and had not had an opportunity of seeing the gentleman whom he had the bills from.</p>
               <p>Did he make use of the word gentleman? - Yes, Sir, he always treated him as a man of property.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he say the gentlemen or gentleman? - He did not call it more than one, I did not stay but a very little while, but I told him, that if the matter was not settled, that he must expect to be taken into custody, this was on the Thursday, he appointed to meet me the next day at the Coach-maker's Arms, Camomile-street; accordingly he came at the hour he appointed, but I cannot tell the hour, I believe he was there rather before me, Wagstaff came much about the same time, he rather refused then to tell me or give me any satisfaction, then I told him, I would not part from him till he did tell me who he had them from, he said, he would not tell me before any witness, meaning before Wagstaff, and we went up stairs into the club-room, Newland and I, and nobody else present, and there he made me promise in a very solemn manner, that I would not mention the man's name, and he would tell me, I told him that if he did not bring me the money that night or the next day, he could not expect me to keep my word, but that he must expect that I would divulge it, he then told me that he had them from

            , he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. We must not have any conversation between you and Mr. Davis; where did you see the prisoner after the Friday? - On the Monday morning following, he called at my house pretty early, then he brought me ten pounds, in delivering me the ten pounds, he said, as I understood him then, it was all he had got by him, but when he was at Bow-street, he said to Sir Sampson Wright, there is Mr. Hayward, he cannot deny that I told him at the time, there was ten pounds, and that was all the money I got by them.</p>
               <p>What did you understand this to be when he delivered it to you on the Monday morning? - I did not pay any credit to what he said, I am hard of hearing of one ear, and I might misunderstand him, but when we were in Bow-street, he insisted upon it, that he said, and he dared me to contradict him, that it was all he got by them.</p>
               <p>What passed between you when he brought you the ten pounds? - I told him ten pounds was nothing, says I do not trifle with me any longer, but set your time and keep it, for I will be shuffled with no longer; he appointed that day three weeks, it was a great deal of money, but I did expect to get it as I could; through I may be blamed, before that day three weeks he was gone away, I could not find him at all, I never saw him after that Monday till he was apprehended, I then went to one of the gentlemen belonging to Sir Sampson Wright's, and asked him whose hands it was proper I should deliver the notes to.</p>
               <p>At what time was it that you applied to the Gentlemen of the Bank, and informed them of this matter? - I cannot tell how long, they were gone a long while, but when I heard that he was apprehended, I was determined to deliver the notes up, I delivered them to Mr. Acton's hands at Sir Sampson Wright's office.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What day did you first go to Chinkford? - The day that Wagstaff first applied to me was on the 11th of November, the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you first went in search of him at Chinkford? - I cannot be exact.</p>
               <p>How long was it between the time you received the notes from him, and the time he appointed to meet you? - It might be a fortnight, it was either the 30th of November, or the 7th of December.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you delivered this note to Mr. Ellis, and the other to Mr. Buxton, before you received notice that these notes were fabricated? - About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Court. From the time that you first had a suspicion that these notes were forged to the time that the prisoner absconded, what was the portion of time that elapsed? - He absconded before the time he fixed to come to me, but I cannot tell, for he living eight miles off, I was tired.</p>

               <p>Court. Then from the Sunday you first went with Mr. Wagstaff, to the Monday when he paid you ten pounds, that was but a week? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of Newland? - I did formerly know him, when he was a hay broker at Whitechapel, I understood he had borrowed three or four hundred pounds to stock his farm with, and I understood this was part of the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You have told the Court very candidly, and I dare say, very truly, that this being a considerable sum of money, one hundred and twenty pounds, and a great deal too<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250036"/> much to lose, you was very anxious to get it? - I was.</p>
               <p>In consequences of that you had four or five interviews with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had seen him in the course of a week four times, sometimes he kept his promise, sometimes, he did not, but you however had several interviews with him on the subject, and the first time you applied to him, you informed him of his situation, told him how his life would be affected, that he would be hanged, and that any body that had a hand in uttering forged notes were as guilty as the forgers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But his anxiety however did not seem to keep pace with your advice, for he only says, for God's sake, do not mention it hereabouts, for I am just got into a farm of very considerable extent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was the sort of anxiety that seemed to press on the mind of the prisoner, neglecting all that you told him: he appeared to you to be a man of some property, renting a considerable farm? - He did.</p>
               <p>It would not have been very difficult, one would have thought, for such a man to have raised such a sum as one hundred and twenty pounds? - I believe he could have raised it.</p>
               <p>Aye! if he had been anxious so to do, I dare say you would have been very glad to have got good security for your money, you would not have insisted on hard cash? - I wanted hard cash, I gave him my hard cash.</p>
               <p>Now the last time, after he paid you ten pounds, you gave him perfect latitude for the payment of remainder, that was your conversation, and he took three weeks; now did you hear that the prisoner living in Essex, had been in a situation which I must mention, had not you heard that he was a smugler? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>That note is No. 76, that you lodged at Mr. Buxton's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He gave you thirty pounds, and the next day he returned you a note for one hundred pounds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you, or can you not, in a case of life, venture to swear that that note, whilst it was in the hand of Mr. Buxton, might not have been changed? - I took such particular notice of the notes, I remarked them to be blotted in such a manner, that I could have known them again from a thousand.</p>
               <p>If you had seen a bank note, No. 876, payable to Mr.

            , for one hundred pounds, dated the same day, could you have distinguished it from this? - I do in my conscience believe that to be the note, and as such I do declare it.</p>
               <p>So I understand you, you are of opinion that you had the same note back again? - I am pretty sure of it.</p>
               <p>You have told us that even when he made the last appointment with you, he was endeavouring to gain time? - I think he never meant to give the money at all.</p>
               <p>You told him the second time you would hang all that were concerned? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know Davis? - I should not know him if I was to see him now.</p>
               <p>Did you know him by reputation? - I know nothing at all of him.</p>
               <p>You told us that the prisoner seemed not desirous that you should call on Davis? - When he enjoined me to secrecy, he said, he would bring me the money himself, and said, he would not wish me to call on Davis, he did not wish I should call on him.</p>
               <p>Now during the whole of this month you say you did not disclose to the Governors of the Bank of England or any other person, that you had these notes in your possession? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You felt that your situation was an aukward one, if he had run away, and you had been found with these notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then for a whole month you did not apply to the Governors of the Bank? - There is one word I remember now, he told me it was put in such a train, that the money I should be sure of having.</p>
               <p>My question is whether you did not keep these bills, and did not disclose to any body that you had them in your possession during that month, that is so, is not it? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250037"/> I believe I did mention it to a friend or two, I did want to get my money.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner's absconding, you found him at Chinkford? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go at any other time? - I went after he was gone, and I was very well informed that he was gone to Norfolk.</p>
               <p>Do you know that the prisoner was taken at his own house? - I have heard that he was.</p>
               <p>You said it was your wish to meet at your own house, but the prisoner chose a public house? - We was in a private room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know whether he had a farm or not at Chinkford, or whether it was his brother's, was he a tenant to farmer Lott? - I have heard so, his appearance looked very wretched when I went down first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. This note had remained in your possession till you gave it in to the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then this is the note you received from Wagstaff? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. When did you go down to the prisoner's house, after that Monday that he had paid you the ten pounds, and was to pay you the remainder in three weeks? - I was informed that he was at Norfolk, therefore, I did not go down, but I was there on the Thursday that he was apprehended; on the Saturday or Sunday, I went to Chinkford, a few days before he was apprehended, after the three weeks had elapsed, his wife told me he was at Norfolk or somewhere there, and as I understood he was gone upon a smuggling party.</p>

               <p>Take this note in your hand, and tell me whether you believe that is the same note? - I cannot say positively to it, but I believe it is.</p>

               <p>Did you change away the note you received from Mr. Hayward, or did you return the not you had from Mr. Hayward to him again? - I returned the same piece of paper, it was only out of the counter into the drawer, and out of the drawer into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will your Lordship indulge me with a question or two to Mr. Lander.</p>
               <p>What are you, Sir? - One of the cashiers of the Bank.</p>
               <p>You are authorised to subscribe notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you give security to the Bank of England for your fidelity? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I take the liberty of submitting an objection to the competency of Mr. Lander, I take it for granted the gentleman is called to prove that the note produced is not his hand writing, I trust, my Lord, that the situation in which I stand, and the situation in which that unfortunate man at the bar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250038"/> stands, will apologize for me to your Lordship, for taking the liberty of troubling your Lordship; and if, ultimately, it shall be the sate of my objection to be overruled, yet I trust I shall be forgiven for having made it, when it is considered that the defence of the prisoner at the bar is to be conducted by my inexperience and inability, against the first abilities and most confirmed experience that this country affords. I intreat your Lordship to believe that in this, and every objection I may take, I shall endeavour so to conduct myself, as to convince the Court that it is not my purpose to sport with their time, to trouble them with frivolous objections, or to impede the course of justice: the objection which I take the liberty of submitting to your Lordship is, that Mr. Lander is interested in the event of this trial, and I beg leave to premise that this objection does not go one single tittle personally against the character of Mr. Lander; I mean to argue it in the general, without suggesting an imputation on him or any of the gentlemen of the bank; and I say this, that not one individual here should entertain an idea, that criminality is imputable to those gentlemen, whose conduct and integrity raise them above suspicion; but it is my duty to submit to the Court, that an interest, the smallest that can possibly be conceived in nature, is objection enough to the examination of a witness, this is the law in civil cases, and therefore, I submit it is an objection, which applies a fortiori in a criminal prosecution: the case of a commoner, who comes to say that a common is not commonable but to such a number, or by such a description of persons, is extremely minute: yet such a man's evidence is uniformly rejected; the evidence of a corporator, who would confine the exercise of a franchise, is liable to the same objection; and even in questions about the settlement of a pauper, it is every day's experience that the parishioners can not be examined; I have heard it from the first authority in this country, recognized in this Court by great authorities on the trial of Mrs. Rudd, that Courts of justice do not fit to weigh what degree of temptations the minds of men may resist, but to take care that they shall not be exposed to any temptations whatever. My Lords, if a gentleman is going along the street, and his servant is assaulted, and an action is brought by the servant, the master is not bound to pay the costs, so says the law; but if the master is tendered as a witness, he is asked, do you pay the costs? the master will answer as a man of honour and generosity, I think I ought not to let my servant pay them; if I were stating such a case to the common understandings of men; of such a man as this, I should state, that he was actuated by principles of the first standard in morality, principles of justice to his servant, and acting under the influence of those principles, it is impossible that he should be biassed, to the commission of perjury, yet a witness standing in in this situation, is rejected in a Court of law. In the case of Mrs. Rudd, Mrs. Perreau was called as a witness, and it was asked of her, whether she had a hope that if Mrs. Rudd should be convicted, that conviction might have some effect to procure the pardon and discharge of her husband, who was already convicted: on her answering she did hope so, the Court refused to receive her evidence; what was the supposed bias on this woman's mind, viewed in the light of a legal objection. It amounts only to a hope, which might be fallacious, that if Mrs. Rudd should be convicted, that event might tend to induce a belief, that Mr. Perreau had been improperly convicted, and that mercy might be extended to him as the result of that belief; in the case of a common forgery the objection would be certainly unanswerable, we all know that a man who has subscribed a note, and is therefore prima facie liable to pay it, cannot be examined as a witness; but it will be said that Mr. Lander is not personally liable to pay this note; but my Lords, I conceive his interest in this question may be no less considerable, for he has told your Lordships, that he gives security for his fidelity, and I am entitled to suppose his bonds<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250039"/> are to the amount of twenty thousand pounds: if Mr. Lander, or any officer belonging to the bank should receive ten pounds, or any other sum, and issue a note without carrying the amount to the account of the Bank of England; if the Bank of England should have no value for that note, so issued by the officer, but if the officer so intrusted should subscribe his name, putting the money into his pocket, he would come here under this bias, if this is proved to be my hand writing, as it is not carried to the account of the Governors of the Bank of England, I am liable to a civil prosecution, on my security bonds for a breach of duty, and to a criminal prosecution, for a fraud on the bank. My Lords, when I stand here as council for a prisoner, and address myself to your Lordships, I am intitled in this state of the prosecution, to say, that the prisoner is as innocent as the witness tendered to be examined; then my objection is that this witness comes under the bias which I have taken the liberty to state, and I assure myself that if this objection should not meet with an insuperable answer, from those gentlemen whose answers I dread extremely, and the weight of whose abilities have almost deterred me from troubling your Lordship; I assure myself your Lordships will not receive the evidence of Mr. Lander, but will leave the fact to be proved by other and better, and less exceptionable means.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bearcroft, Council for the Prosecution. My Lord, it is certainly very proper for a Council concerned for the prisoner to make any objection that may occur to him; and I am the last man in the world, as Council for a prosecution, that will even complain of the exertion of the ingenuity of an advocate in such situation: it is only my duty to submit to your Lordship the answer, which is, first, and it is a very strong answer, that the constant current of practice has been to admit such a witness as is now objected to, and I am only to appeal to your Lordship's experience, and that of the other learned Judges upon the bench for the truth of this assertion; that of itself my Lord is a strong answer to this objection: but however, there is another circumstance I am ready to admit, that it is the clear law of the land in civil cases, as well as in criminal, that whensoever a witness is called to prove a proposition in which he stands directly interested, to say yes, rather than no, he shall not be admitted as a witness to say yes; and I also admit that the question is not on the quantity of the interest, for if the interest amounts only to five shillings, it is as complete an objection, as if it amounted to twenty thousand pounds; the difficulty is to see how the learned gentleman applies the reasoning to the present case: Mr. Lander is a clerk of the Bank, but his signature does not bind himself, his signature professes to be for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England; if he were to offer himself here, upon an indictment for a forgery of Mr. Lander's note, beyond doubt he would not be competent a witness; but here he can never be sued civilly, because he professes to sign for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England; and whoever therefore receives that paper, must call on them and them only. The learned gentleman then raises another objection, in which he is forced to make a presumption, and a violent one it is, and contrary to the very first principles of law; he asserts that this Mr. Lander has given security to exercise his office faithfully, and then says, he, now I will presume he has not exercised it faithfully, but that this is his handwriting; that is, I will presume he is guilty of a capital forgery, in order to make him an interested witness, and to repel his evidence. My Lord, the law never presumes guilt, the law presumes innocence, and the learned gentleman cannot state his objection but in that form; by possibility, says he, it looks likely, or you are to take it for granted, that Mr. Lander has put his name to bank paper issued by the Bank, for certain purposes, and that he is guilty of the forgery: state the case, that here is a genuine bank note, that Lander puts his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250040"/> name falsely without authority, and add some other circumstances that do not exist, and that is the foundation of the objection. Take it for granted that he is guilty of the forgery himself, and most undoubtedly by he is guilty of the forgery; but your Lordship sees the objection stands on the illegal assumption, contrary to the first principles of law: nevertheless, it is no reflection on the learned gentleman who has taken the objection.</p>
               <p>Court. This objection is taken by the Council for the prisoner to the testimony of the witness Mr. Lander, as an interested witness; I remember in the case of Doctor

            , my Lord Chesterfield, whose bond it was supposed to be, and whose name was subscribed to it, before he was examined as a witness, he executed a release which made him a competent witness; now I take it, that to repel the evidence of a witness, it must appear that they would be liable to be sued or prosecuted: you are not to presume that a man is guilty of a capital crime in order to repel his testimony, and Mr. Lander has by no means engaged himself, and I think his testimony ought to be received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. I am of the same opinion; the answer seems to be this, that in order to allow this objection, it is necessary to presume the criminality of the witness; the interest must therefore be either apparent on the nature of the transaction, or come out from his own examination: if the witness is interested, or if he admits himself to have an interest that operates in his own mind, in either of those cases, to be sure it would be an objection.</p>

               <p>Is it? - Yes undoubtedly.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Sylvester.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time go to Norwich, or the sea coast? - Yes, I believe it was about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - I went from London, a young man and I, to Swolen in Norfolk, there we met Newland and Davis; it was about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after Christmas? - After; we staid there that night, it is about thirty miles from the sea coast, we went from there to Southwold, which is close joining to the sea, I believe we staid there seven or eight days.</p>
               <p>Who staid with you? - Davis and Newland, and one Handby that went down with me, and Newland's man.</p>
               <p>What name did Newland go by? - By the name of Brown.</p>
               <p>What name did Davis go by? - By the name of Pitt; we continued there six or seven days, then we went to a place called Cuthie, it is about three quarters of a mile from the sea, we staid there I believe much about the same time, eight or nine days.</p>
               <p>Where did you go from thence? - From there we came home to London.</p>
               <p>Court. What was your business in going there? - We went there to assist him to get the goods away from the water side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Master Patman, there is some good moon-shine at Southwold, is not there? - I do not know what that is.</p>
               <p>Lord bless me! I thought you had learned that in the Exchequer long since; do not you know what white brandy is? - I never sold any.</p>
               <p>Oh! you only carried it, you was a sort of huckster then; pray Master Patman, what might your travelling name be in this expedition? - My name was Smith.</p>
               <p>Pray Mr. Smith, alias Patman, what was your reason for exchanging your name? - That the Custom House officers should not lay hold of us.</p>
               <p>It is very common you know, for gentlemen and nobleman to go incog. so the cutter did not come in sight, and you came away to town, is that it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Who desired you to take the name of Smith? - I do not know whether it was Newland or Pitt, or who it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250043"/>Mr. Garrow. It was some of the gang? - We expected some smuggled goods that Woodin and Thurston went over to buy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What were they to pay for the goods? - I understood it was paper.</p>
               <p>Who was to pay for them in paper? - Woodin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, is it proper for us to hear the whole journey of this gang to Bruges. What did Newland say to you about these transactions or this journey? - Very little.</p>
               <p>How came you and Newland to leave the coast? - I went down to Yarmouth, and I heard they were taken up for a forgery on the Bank, I told Newland, that I heard a man on the other side of the water was taken up for forgery, he seemed to be surprised, and said, he knew nothing about it; we came about fifteen miles the next day to the place were Davis took coach, and Newland and I came up in his little cart.</p>
               <p>What name was there on the cart? - I do not know, I believe Newland, I am not sure whether it was upon it or not, I cannot read.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bearcroft. Why did the party break up? tell the whole, upon your oath? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What was said about parting company? - Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>How came you to leave the coast and part company? - Upon the account of the other man being taken up on the other side of the water, for a forgery on the bank, that was what I understood at Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Somebody told you these men were taken up for forgery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you told Newland so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he afterwards came up to his own house? - He came to Rumford near to it.</p>
               <p>You cannot read? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor Newland neither? - I believe not, I believe he can neither read or write.</p>

               <p>I went to Chinkford to apprehend the prisoner, it was on a Sunday morning, and very snowy; we saw a woman come from Chinkford Hall, to light a candle at that man's house, as soon as the door was open we went in immediately, I went up stairs, there were two people in bed, a man and woman, he said, his name was

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will your Lordship take the account of what all these people said to the witness.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was he found? - I came into the wash-house, and I saw a man come out, and I asked him where he came from, he said, down that stair-case, I immediately went and clapped a pistol to his head, and said, if you stir, I will blow your brains out! says he, I shall make no resistance, he said, he supposed we wanted him; we brought him down from there, and he asked what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Did he know you before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass after that? - He asked what it was for, I told him it was for making bank notes, and he said he could neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bearcroft. My Lord, there is a piece of evidence behind which I did not open, I have a witness to prove, that previous to the time of delivering these bank notes that have been produced; the prisoner at the bar offered to sell eight hundred pounds in bank notes for four hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think I should receive that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I wish Mr. Bearcroft had contrived any way that the Jury should not have heard it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord I never offered any bank notes under the value in my life, here I stand, my life is at stake.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. There is no evidence on that subject, these bank notes you were to have received the full consideration for,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250044"/> though part of them only were to be received at the time.</p>

            , I told them I had them of him, for he was a man of property; I am as innocent of the forgery as a child unborn, I said that Davis had lent me ten pounds of the money, and I put my hand in my pocket and gave it him; he said he was very glad of it, that is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord I am ready to call several witnesses to prove the purpose of going to Norfolk; but I take it to be proved that this man went into Norfolk on a smuggling party, and that he came back again to his own house.</p>

               <p>In what manner did they stop you? - The first man just passed me, and the other immediately spread out his arms and stopped me, the prisoner at the bar turned about, and put his hand on my mouth, and said if I spoke a word, he would kill me immediately, I pushed him off me, and begged he would let me alone, and let me go about my business.</p>
               <p>What did they do or say about that? - They said if I spoke a word they would kill me immediately.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing from you? - Yes, my Lord they took a black sattin cloak from me.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing else? - The prisoner took my patterns out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Did they go away when they had taken them? - They went away, and then I was going after them, and they turned about and saw me going after them, and they came up to me again and threatened me if I stirred; the prisoner put something to my face, and said, did I see that, I said yes and they desired me not to stir, and I said I would not.</p>
               <p>What was that he put before your face? - I do not know, I was so frightened cannot tell.</p>
               <p>They did not attempt to any thing else from you, did they? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they ask you for any money? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards was the prisoner taken? - They both of them set a running again, and I run after them, and as soon as I saw somebody coming, I called stop thief; the other was taken and tried last sessions, the other man was stopped just by the Queen's Palace; the prisoner was taken the 26th of January.</p>
               <p>How came he to be taken up? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was your cloak and pattens ever found? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you when you was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250046"/> robbed? - No, Sir, nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>What light had you by which you saw these two men? - It was just under a lamp where they robbed me, just by the Queen's Palace, that side next to the Queen's Palace, not in the Green Park.</p>
               <p>Had you any light but that lamp? - No.</p>
               <p>You was very much frightened at his stopping you? - I was not so much frightened then.</p>
               <p>The prisoner passed you and turned back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then at first your back was to the prisoner? - He was not above a yard or two from me.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened when the prisoner put his hand over your mouth? - I thought it was some man that had a little liquor, and so I did not mind it.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to say that you had opportunity enough to observe the prisoner by the light of that lamp to know him again, at above a month's distance? - Yes, they stopped so long with me, they were with me six or seven minutes, the Justice sent for me, there was a cloak found in his pocket, and I went to see if it was mine, but it was not, and then Mr. Bond told the man to take me over to the publick-house, and there I saw the prisoner, there were a matter of thirteen or fourteen prisoners with him, I knew him as soon as ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that he is the man? - Yes, I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When that woman came to Bow-street when I was as a prisoner, she came into the office backward, and was asked if she knew any person that were present, she looked at me several other persons, and said she knew nobody, Mr. Wright said, what, do not you know any body? she then came and looked at me, and when she looked at me, she said I was not the man, she was present when I was examined, the man was brought to swear to me, he declared I was not the man, he should have known me.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutrix. Is this so? - No, he was in the middle, and I knew him direct.</p>
               <p>Did you say at first that you knew nobody there? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>How long might they be with you; - Not above a minute and a half at most, I made no resistance, I had not so much as a stick; in the City Road I saw the watchman in his watch box, and I gave him information, and a description, soon after that, some of Sir Sampson's Officers Bow-street came after me, I was then going with the patrol in the City-road, they asked me if I was the person that had been robbed, I told them yes, and what I lost, I gave a description of the persons of the robbers, the officers said they would let me know; the next evening I was informed that a person was taken into custody; near the same spot where I was robbed; I went to Bow-street on the Monday after, when I came to the office there were five people at the bar, and Sir Sampson asked me to look at the five, and see if I knew any of them, I saw the prisoner who was one of the five.</p>
               <p>Did you pitch upon him immediately? - I did; I knew him very well before this transaction, I have known him from a child, I am sorry to say it, he is one of our own parishioners.</p>
               <p>Did you know him by sight only? - I knew him by sight, I knew the whole family; I was not confident at the time I was robbed that it was this person, but when I saw him at the office, it struck into my mind directly that he was the person that stopped me, I was clearly convinced he was the person that stopped me.</p>
               <p>Was not you flurried at the time? - I was very much flurried at the time, one run after me very hard, and laid hold of my collar, but I had opportunity enough to observe them afterwards; and it came into my recollection before I went to Bow-street, that it was this lad which I knew.</p>
               <p>Are you clear now that that was the man? - I have not a doubt in my own mind about it, I believe he is not the person that took the money from me.</p>
               <p>What was this lad? - I do not know what business they were, but the family had lived in a street near me for years.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say at the office when you first pitched on him? - He did not say thing then.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to the last witness, we lost part of the lace that was in the box, and two cards of lace, between four and five on Monday the 9th in the afternoon; I know the prisoners; Davis and the other prisoner came about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, and said they wanted to look at some lace, for they sold it again, and ought to have an allowance; they were at our shop in the morning before, and I shewed them some lace, and I missed a length of lace then, but could not be sure they had taken it then, therefore we concluded if they came again to be very cautious in serving them; Davis bought three yards at nine-pence; she paid me a part and Talbot paid the rest, they said, they would buy some more if I would shew them any thing of bargains, I shewed them several afterwards; and they made a hesitation about the price. Davis took one card in her hand, she undid it till she came to the joining where it was pinned: she unpinned, and took the lace.</p>
               <p>Court. All this in your view? - Yes, but she did not know I took any notice; she took the lace and put it between her body and the other, and dropped it on the ground, she then took another card up.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make any objection to this? - No, I saw her put the card into the box, and I was convinced she had dropped the rest on the ground; but she had done the lace up so as if there was the whole on the card; I did not see them take the other two cards, nor I did not miss them at all; at last they went out of the shop, and said no more would suit them; I went out about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250050"/> a minute after, and went into Mr. Agar the confectioner's two doors off, who was constable, and gave him charge of the prisoners, they were taken into Mr. Robert's, an ironmonger.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure of the prisoners? - Yes; their hands were tied together, and we took them to the watch-house, just as we were going to take them out, Mr. Roberts's young man said, here is a card of lace, that was about two feet from Talbot, and immediately after, he said, here is another card, that was about four feet from Talbot, the prisoners were still in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoners been in that part of the shop where the cards were found, or were their hands so much at liberty, that they could have thrown the cards there? - They had been moving about, and I suppose they dropped them there; I then saw the two loose lengths on the ground, underneath where Davis stood; I know the lace, it was the same pattern and quality, and every thing with that which remained.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure those two lengths of lace were on that card when these two women came into your shop? - Yes, I saw them do the fact, and I strongly thought, I was sure Davis had the property about her, I did not see the other two cards in the box, and I cannot swear either of them had these two cards in their possession, but these two cards were my master's property, there is my own private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Court. Had Mr. Roberts's family purchased any lace of you that day? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were those two cards of lace, when they came into your shop? - If they stole them at that time, it must be out of that box, but I will not swear they were in that box; the prisoners were taken to the watch-house, I had the lace in my possession till the constable came, he searched them and found nothing on them, but a bit of lace in Talbot's bonnet, which was not ours.</p>
               <p>Court. You found the three yards of lace that you sold them? - Yes,

               <p>Jury. I received a letter from Mr. Agar, and sent to him, to tell him, the necessity of his attending.</p>
               <p>Court. I have mentioned it to my brother Gould, and he thinks it would be too much to estreat his recognizance, therefore let it be discharged.</p>
               <p>(The lace opened and deposed to by Barnes)</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, it appears the shopman observed every thing that was going forwards, therefore this is certainly not the case, that the act of Parliament provides against, which is privately taking from the shop, for it was an open taking in the view of the person: I have mentioned it to my learned brother here, and he concurs with me in opinion, that notwithstanding the two cards were not observed to be taken, yet he observed the first taken, that was the first act, and the other will not vary the case at all: your verdict will therefore in my apprehension be, that they are guilty of stealing, but not privily out of the shop.</p>

               <p>The Witnesses examined apart by the request of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams of Council for the Prosecution, opened the case as follows.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, it is a painful circumstance to any person of feeling, who has attended this Court on this sessions, to think of the number of culprits, that are brought here for such a variety of crimes; in the morning we heard of burglaries, of highway robberies, of pocket picking; we are now about to prove a crime, which you have just heard named in the indictment, a crime of a very different, and of a most enormous nature: a crime which has been held by the laws of all civilized countries, justly deserving to be punished with the most extreme rigour. But it would ill become me, Gentlemen of the Jury, who am of Council on the part of a criminal prosecution, and would also be utterly inconsistent with my feelings as a man, to attempt any appeal to yours; I shall therefore barely mention the facts, I am instructed to say, will be proved in evidence before you, for it is from them alone you must decide.</p>
               <p>The prosecutrix is stated to me to be a girl of about fifteen years of age, a poor, country, fatherless child, who was left with nine more to be maintained by a poor widow in Hertfordshire, and one Skelton a coachmaker, who married an aunt of this woman's, merely out of charity, sent for this girl, and recommended her as a <rs id="t17840225-19-viclabel107" type="occupation">servant maid to the Hospital for Inoculation for the Small Pox</rs>

The girl as soon as she could get away, came directly to her mistress, Mrs Connolly, who, one would suppose, would have been irritated at the thoughts of such a thing being committed on a poor fatherless child, but instead of that she says to her,</p>
               <p>"Well Betty,</p>
               <p>"if Mr. Longlegs (meaning the prisoner)</p>
               <p>"has got you withchild, he will be a rare<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250052"/> " father to it, for he is worth a good deal</p>
               <p>"of money, and you need not be afraid." The girl then fell a crying and wanted to go home, but her mistress sent her to bed: in the morning the girl wanted to go home, but however soon after Mrs. Skelton came to the house, and the girl told him the whole story, and he upon hearing it thought it his duty to bring this prosecution forward. Gentlemen, it is proper for me to inform you that you will find one material piece of evidence wanting on the part of the prosecution, and of which we are deprived by an accident; it is the evidence of a Mr. Hall, a surgeon, who examined the girl; he had the misfortune on Friday last to fall down in Chancery-lane, and hurt his leg; upon this event I meant to have moved the Court to have put off the trial, but Mr. Skelton, who prosecutes only for the sake of publick justice, said he could not afford to put it off. Gentlemen, these are the facts which I am instructed to lay before you, and which will be proved in evidence. I am well aware that prosecutions of this nature are, with great propriety, very cautiously attended to by Courts of criminal jurisdiction, as they are prosecutions which may be very easily made, and which are very hard to be defended: but however, gentlemen, when you see this poor girl, and hear her give her evidence, you will be able to judge whether a rape has or has not been actually committed by the prisoner: if it has been committed, the offence is certainly, as a great man has said, a very detestable one; if the crime has not been committed, if this is a mere trick, a mere conspiracy, to bring an innocent man to this bar, you will then acquit the prisoner, and I am sure he is extremely fortunate, in having such respectable gentlemen as you, to decide on his life.</p>

               <p>Relate to the Court what happened to you? - On Thursday the 15th of January last my master ordered me to take a pot of beer to Mr. Costello.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I took it to his shop, and he bid me set it down on the compter.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does the prisoner live? - In Monmouth-street.</p>
               <p>What is his business? - A saleman; I set the beer on the compter, and coming out again, he caught hold of my arm, and doubled me neck and heels together.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not understand that doubling neck and heels together? - He put my head to my legs, and took and carried me neck and heels together.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tie you neck and heels? - No, he did not tie me, but he held my head and my heels together, that I should not proceed to call out.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the house at that time? - There was nobody in the parlour, nor yet in the shop.</p>
               <p>You saw no person in the house? - No, then he took me into the parlour, and locked the parlour door; he then downed me on the bed, which was in the parlour, and I got up again; then he forced my legs open with violence, and entered my body with violence; after he had his will of me, he wanted me to lay hold of his private parts, and he would not let me go till some time after? then our man came to the door and asked whether Betty was there, he asked what Betty, and the man said Betty that lives at Mr. Connolly's, and he said she has been gone half an hour, and he stood doubling his fist at me, and swearing in such a manner that I durst not halloo out.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there afterwards? - Then he swore God damn me for a bitch, he would ravish me, he would ravish me.</p>
               <p>Where did you go afterwards? - I went home to my mistress.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250053"/>Did you say any thing to her? - No, she began to hall jeers at me, so I did not think it was fit to tell her.</p>
               <p>How soon did he let you out? - In about half an hour; I did not say any thing to my mistress, because she said, Betty, never mind it, never look down, if long legs has got you with child; but cast yourself up, and make yourself as brisk as you can, I will be bound he will be a good father to it; this was as soon as ever I got into the house.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it before you saw your aunt? - On the Friday night the day after.</p>
               <p>Did you complain to her of this outrage? - Yes, my mistress took my aunt into the bar, and said, Mrs. Skelton, here is a very bad accident happened to Betty.</p>
               <p>Court. Then your mistress first told your aunt of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Say what you said yourself to your aunt? - I told my aunt the first beginning of it, and every thing; she came to me and insisted on my telling her, and I told her how Mr. Castello used me, and every thing about it; she went home directly to my uncle, and I saw my uncle, and I told him the same.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner at the bar afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you accuse him before any person? - My mistress fetched him and I face to face, and I told him it was so, and he denied it.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he never meddled with me.</p>
               <p>Court. You say this happened on the Thursday night? - Yes, between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>You say you came home in a quarter of an hour after, and you never mentioned it till the Friday, at what hour on the Friday did you mention it? - About six in the evening.</p>
               <p>From the night preceding, when you returned home, till six o'clock the next evening, was you confined in the house of Mr. Connolly? - My mistress made me go to bed.</p>
               <p>But when you got up in the morning, had you not free liberty to go to your uncle and aunt? - I got my hat and cloak on, and my mistress would not let me go, but said she would send for my aunt.</p>
               <p>At what time did you make an attempt to go? - About twelve.</p>
               <p>Court. You might have gone before that, and it was natural that you should have given the earliest intelligence to those persons that you thought your relations and friends, you should have gone immediately; how came you to debate on this matter for such a length of time, was you ballancing in your mind whether you should make any complaint or no? - My mistress would not let me go.</p>
               <p>That was at twelve o'clock, but previous to that you was at liberty to go, and especially when your mistress treated you in the manner you have represented, and laughed at you; I should have gone to my friends, to my uncle and my aunt; but the manner in which you have described this thing is not sufficiently explained to the Jury; you must be more explicit; you have said that he forced open your legs with violence, and entered your body with violence, but you should describe the manner of it, because if there was not compleat carnal knowledge, the prisoner cannot be convicted of this offence; he might enter your body with violence, and yet not have carnal knowledge of you? - He had knowledge of me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250055"/>Did you do your work and go about house as usual? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have told this gentleman that he threw you with violence, and forced your legs open with violence; do you remember, when you was asked that question before the Justice, your saying no; when the Justice asked you whether he threw you down with violence, and you made any resistance, you said no, no? - I made as much resistance as ever I could.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a plain question that the gentlemen puts to you; while you was before the magistrate, did not he ask you whether the man, charged by you with this offence, had thrown you down with violence, and whether you had made all the resistance you could and you answered no; recollect now, did you say no, to the Justice, or yes? - I did not know what resistance was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You know what resistance is now - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who told you that you must say now it was done with violence? - Nobody told me.</p>
               <p>How did you hear it? - I heard somebody say so.</p>
               <p>Now pray who was that somebody? - A woman going by.</p>
               <p>What did that good woman say to you? - She was talking about resistance.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - As I was going by some woman was telling another woman what resistance, meant.</p>
               <p>So two women were talking together about resistance, and there you learned what resistance meant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you did say, before the Justice, that you did not resist; you answered no, when the question was put to you there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, I understand, is a man of some property, is not he? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Some of your friends have made enquiries about that? - No, none of my friends that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did you understand likewise, that this house of his he lets out in lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now when you said there was nobody in the shop and in the parlour, do you mean to tell my Lord that there was nobody else in that house, either above stairs or below? - I did not know there was any body.</p>
               <p>Then you only meant to say that there was nobody in the front shop, and in the back shop, which he occupied? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by being doubled together neck and heels? - He put my head and my heels together.</p>
               <p>What so? (doubling up his brief.) - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he laid you on the bed, there he left you, and you staid, I hope, till he shut the door? - No, I got up again.</p>
               <p>Did you call out? - No, I called once, and nobody came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Did not this hurt you, being doubled? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Very much? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And yet you did not scream out then? - I could not scream out, he laid his hands so upon me.</p>
               <p>Why you know he doubled you like this sheet of paper, and carried you ill, and you never cried out? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell Barnet your fellow servant of this? - No, Sir, I did not, I want to see some of my friends to tell them first.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Grant my young woman? - He is a lodger of my master's.</p>
               <p>Who is he, he is a good likely young man, is not he? - He is a sailor.</p>
               <p>You and he are acquainted I understand? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - No other than giving him a candle to go to bed by; I know nothing of him no otherwise.</p>
               <p>How otherwise do you mean that you you might know him? - I never had nothing to say to him, nor he to me.</p>
               <p>Never? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>No conversation? - No.</p>
               <p>No acquaintance, no connections at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And even to him you did not tell this? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250056"/>Why, I thought he was a bit of a sweetheart of yours? - No, Sir, he is not, nor ever was.</p>
               <p>What did they say to you, when you returned home, after you had carried the beer? - They asked me why Mr. Castello kept me there; I did not tell them any thing farther.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams. When you was examined before the Justice, what did you say? - I told the Justice the same as I told you now.</p>
               <p>Did you say to the Justice, that he forcibly, and against your will lay with you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. It will appear by the deposition what she said there.</p>

               <p>Mr. Williams. I believe you are the aunt of this unfortunate girl? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did this girl go to Mr. Connolly's service? - I cannot say, but the rash act was committed the 15th of January.</p>
               <p>She was there about ten days before that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see her after the 15th? - I saw her on the Friday about six o'clock, as that happened on the Thursday; I went to carry her some things, and when I came to the bar her mistress desired me to walk in, and her mistress s aid, ere is a terrible thing happened, says she, to Betty; says I, what; says she, it is a man has ravished her, one of our customers; I said, can I see her; and she said, if you will stop a little I will go into the kitchen along with you; I went to her, and she was crying bitterly at the sink, washing the dishes, and I desired her to tell me the truth; whether the man had laid with her, or whether he had not, and she said, yes, he had; and I made her answer, then you stay here, I will go and send your uncle, and her mistress desired me not to go home and tell my husband; for the man had money and he would maintain the child and her too, if in case she had one, and it was pity to take a man up to lose his life; I went home and my husband was not come home, I sent for him, and told him, and he went to her master's; I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life are you in? - My husband is a coachmaker.</p>

               <p>It is not many minutes walk, I believe? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the girl complain that she could not come before to you? - Yes, she said her mistress would not let her come, but said she would send for me, but she did not.</p>
               <p>She said, he was a man worth money, able to pay for this or any thing else? - Yes, and that it was a pity to hang him.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take your niece home with you? - I thought it was better to my husband for her.</p>
               <p>You thought your niece full as safe at Connolly's as with you? - I thought I could form run home for my husband.</p>
               <p>You might walk it in a couple of minutes I believe? - Yes, in three minutes.</p>

               <p>I dare say you are a very industrious woman; you do not sit with your hands before you; therefore it is possible, I should suppose, that any noise might happen below, and you being busy above, might not hear it? - I was very ill of a cold.</p>

               <p>How did you amuse yourself? - I generally have a book, I might be reading, I generally do read when I have nothing else to do.</p>
               <p>You are a very good woman, I am sure, but it is possible this might happen and you not hear it? - He could not even laugh loud but I must hear him, the stairs are so low, and it is a thin partition, and if she had made any noise I could have heard it.</p>
               <p>You live in the fore room, one pair of stairs, and this is the back parlour, how high is this room? - No higher than the common rooms, they are but new built houses.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, might not she have cried out or made a noise without your hearing? - No, Sir, I do swear, that nobody could scream out, or if they had even knocked against the wainscot, but I could have heard them, and I must have heard her, being so still as I was by myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Supposing a woman had screamed out violently once only? - If any body was to make any noise at all, or to call Mr. Castello, I must hear it.</p>

               <p>Could you have heard if there had been any noise? - Oh! Gentlemen, if any child had cried the least in the world I must have heard it, for our apartment is so low that a man can scarce stand upright in it; I heard somebody say beer, and I heard no more that night; I heard Mr. Connolly's man come and say is Betty here, and I heard Mr. Castello make answer and say what Betty; and he said did not she bring a pot of beer; and Castello said she had been gone half an hour; that was a good while afterwards.</p>

               <p>There he lays? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Sylvester.</p>
               <p>I am landlord of the Fountain in Monmouth-street; this young woman was a servant of mine; I remember her going with a pot of beer the 15th of January; when she came back I was in the cellar, and she came down stairs to me, and had a pint pot to the best of my memory in her hand, and I asked her, Betty, says I, where have you been; she said, at Mr. Castello's; says I, why do you stay so at Mr. Castello's when it is the hurry of our business; Sir, says she, you will not blame me when I tell you; says I, then tell me directly; then she told me that Mr. Castello had her by the hand and would not let her go; then I asked her, had he any thing further to do with you; and she said, no, indeed, Sir, nothing else.</p>
               <p>You supped together that night? - Yes, Sir, all four of us.</p>
               <p>How was she at supper? - She sat at supper, and was as merry that night as ever she had been since she was at my house, and my wife in a joking way said, Betty, says she, suppose we drink a good health to young Castello, if you have got one to night; no, indeed, Madam, says she, there was nothing of that kind; and the next morning she said never a word, nor until her aunt came at night; she had her breakfast along with us all the same, took no notice, nor no complaint of any kind how-somever.</p>
               <p>How did she behave herself during the few days she was in your service? - Her aunt knows very well, the Sunday before I sent her out with a pint of beer and a pipe to a neighbour, and she staid away half an hour; some of it was spilt, and she was very much in liquor when she took up the pot; and on the Monday following she could not see one thing, nor we could not get her to do any thing.</p>
               <p>Had you giving her warning? - Yes, I told the aunt she would not do for me, and her aunt said let her stay till she gets a service.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams. How came it into your head to ask her that other question,</p>
               <p>"Had he any thing further to do with you?" - Because she staid a time, and I should not have wished that any thing should have happened.</p>
               <p>Why did you think of that particularly? - It happened to come into my head.</p>
               <p>First of all hear my question, and then give me an answer; what induced you particularly to ask her that question,</p>
               <p>"Had he any thing further to do with you?" - Because she staid so long out of my sight, I did not know what might happen.</p>
               <p>You may think it a very jocose thing to hurt a young girl, did you say, let us drink to young Castello? - I did it to find whether any thing had been done.</p>
               <p>Is that the way of behaving to a young girl that you are afraid is injured? - That is the way I spoke.</p>
               <p>Court. I thought it was your wife that spoke it? - My wife spoke it too.</p>
               <p>Who is Castello? - The prisoner in the bar.</p>
               <p>How far does he live off? - Not a great way.</p>
               <p>How long has he been your customer? - As long as I have had the house, like another customer.</p>
               <p>In what capacity was this girl? - A servant.</p>
               <p>She was not hired to go out with porter? - To take out beer if required.</p>
               <p>You take your oath of that? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What was the reason that this girl went this night particularly to Castello's? - Because we were all busy; Barnet was drawing beer at the same time.</p>
               <p>Did you ever send her to Castello's house before? - I suppose she had been there, I hired her to do my business, and that is my business to serve my beer, or any thing else that is wanted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What is the character of Mr. Castello? - He is a very honest young fellow, as ever was in the world, and that there is plenty in Court will say.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Connolly, I was examined before the Grand Jury for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>You know that young woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Grant? - Very well.</p>
               <p>He is a seaman, is not he? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Is he and Betty acquainted at all? - Yes, Sir, they were acquainted.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - Why they were acquainted so far, that I used to go up stairs to fetch the candlesticks, and I went up stairs one night, and I catched him and she on the bed, and he atop of her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I believe my Lord I need not call any more witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. It seems to me that this case, if it stood on the evidence of the prosecutrix herself, is not sufficiently proved; but I am not at all averse to summing up the evidence, if the Jury desire it.</p>
               <p>Jury. We need not trouble your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Court. Indeed Gentlemen, there is not the least foundation for this prosecution, for it is not supported by the evidence even of the woman herself: I have seen her deposition, which could not be given as evidence here, because nobody was here to prove it, but she gives a very different account of the transaction now to what she did then. This is a cooked up story, calculated to extort money from the prisoner, who is represented to be a man in circumstances of ability; for it is impossible that a woman, who as she now represents it herself, had opportunities of informing numbers of people of a transaction of this kind, should make no complaint either to her master or her mistress, or Barnet, or any of the customers, any of whom would have taken the part of an innocent woman; she was entirely a free agent in crossing the streets, and all that evening, and the next morning; and she had only three minutes walk to communicate the whole to her uncle and aunt: therefore in my apprehension there is not the least foundation for the prosecution; and when you consider the evidence of the lodgers in the house, in such a situation that they must have heard that cry, which she only mentions to have made once, although she might have made cries perpetually; she might have alarmed people that passed in the street, and certainly the people over head would have heard, but yet these people underneath and above heard no cry, but one of them heard her cry beer, and heard Barnet come after her, and when she heard the voice of her fellow servant, would not it have been natural to have called to him; if she had not consented, she certainly might have made it known: I think there is not the least foundation for this prosecution, nor could it be supported in point of law, for she has not given that testimony that I should think would be sufficient to make it appear that he had carnal knowledge of her body.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of January I sat in my parlour, and I observed the prisoner at my shop window.</p>
               <p>Court. What time? - Between six and seven, near seven I saw the prisoner go from the window, and return again in the space of a minute, I had a gentleman with me in the parlour, and I told him I must go to my trap, I had contrived a trap at my window, I had been robbed so frequently, and if he had introduced a hand, or a finger, or thumb, I should have caught them, and held them fast; I went into the shop behind some shutters that I had put to secrete myself, where I could observe every transaction at the window. I saw the prisoner extend his finger against the glass of his right hand, and with his left hand he was working his hand, and I heard the glass crack; as well as seeing his hand in this manner, I saw some of my goods go out of the window, without his hand being introduced, I then considered it was by an instrument; a gentleman at this instant knocked at the door, and informed me of him, I said I was obliged to him, but I should know the man if I saw him, I would go out and look for him.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he drawn any thing out? - Three girdle buckles, a black girdle buckle, and a silver nutmeg grater.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these things were in the window before? - Yes, I advertised in two papers for this gentleman to come forward, but he never appeared, I had my window mended on the Saturday morning, and on the Saturday evening I went out, and when I returned I found two or three of my neighbours and the prisoner in my parlour, I addressed him with, O you are an old acquaintance of mine, I saw saw you here last night, for he had on a double breasted coat, it was not a lappelled coat, and the button holes were so close to the buttons, that when they were buttoned, the buttons touched within a quarter of an inch, which is remarkable, and I described him so to my wife, and he went away and came again six or eight times before he had compleated his purpose; therefore I had an opportunity of seeing him, for I had at a high window four lights, which gave me a full view of him, so that it is impossible I should be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Council for the Prosecution. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the lights were in the window between you and him? - They were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott Council for the Prisoner. What<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250063"/> time of the evening might this be? - Between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What part of the shop was you in? - At the end of the counter, facing that window he was at.</p>
               <p>I should have supposed if the lights had been behind you, you could have seen into the street? - The lights were close to the window; they gave light that I could see him.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on at that time? - He had a slouched hat.</p>
               <p>And a great coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw any thing more of that man on the Friday evening? - No, there is an instrument that he threw away.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. That knife you saw him hurl away? - I saw him hurl away something, there was no goods upon him.</p>

               <p>Who fixed on the spot? - I believe my husband or her; I received a penny post letter.</p>
               <p>Have you that letter? - I have not.</p>
               <p>That is a pity; have you looked for it? - No, I do not think I have the pockets on; the letter is of very little consequence; I have not it about me; but such a letter I really did receive; I live in St. James's Market.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Mr. Harris did not drink any tea at all? - I do not recollect; when he came in I told him we were but drinking the third dish.</p>
               <p>How many dishes do you generally drink? - That is just as it happens; some times I drink six or seven; I am fond of tea.</p>
               <p>How came you to fix just on the number of three? - I am sure we had drank no more.</p>
               <p>You had toast and bread and butter I understand? - I do not know that Harris eat any thing; Harris went away at a quar- before nine; I did not go away till after supper; I believe it might be turned of ten, but I cannot tell as to the time of my going away, what time it was.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go home? - I went as I generally do, through Chandois-street and Tavistock-street, the way to St. James's-street; my husband saw me as far as the linen draper's in St. James's Market; I lodge at the corner of St. Alban's-street: he parted from me at the linen draper's.</p>

               <p>You two went together arm in arm after making this quarrel up? - We went home together.</p>
               <p>What became of your husband after that? - He went to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>But it was made up? - No, I have seen him, but it is not made up, nor may be never may.</p>

               <p>Why do you suppose it was Friday? - Because on the Thursday I went to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Did you see your wife there? - I did; when I was at St. Margaret's Church, it was past four; I cannot say to the minute; I then went from thence to the Strand; I found I was beyond the time; I was to have been there at three; I called in the Strand; I did not stop as long as I have been here; I went immediately to Mrs. Anderson's, where I met my wife; I look upon it, it might be about a quarter after five; my wife was there first; I suppose I staid there four or five hours; I staid there till I do not know whether it was ten or eleven; there was Mrs. Anderson and a child, and there was the prisoner, he came in afterwards.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. You went with her and parted in Market-street; what became of you? - I staid there till Mrs. Anderson returned.</p>
               <p>What! in the street; where did she go; how came you to part there? - Because it was not my desire to go any farther; my wife lived about a stone's throw off.</p>
               <p>You did not chose to go that stone's throw then? - No.</p>

               <p>That was all? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then it was not to make up the quarrel at all; now, Mr. Cam, this going home, you do not know what time it was, whether ten or eleven, or half after eleven? - I have told you I did not know exactly the time I went away; I did not mention any time to my knowledge; I told you I did not know the time; I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I cannot say rightly.</p>
               <p>Then you say you went home? - Yes, Mrs. Anderson walked as far as Market-lane with me and my wife, and she and my wife went away together.</p>
               <p>Your wife said nobody went with you? - I cannot say that, I am speaking for myself.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, with respect to the crime of burglary, the Judges in construing the law respecting it, have extended the construction of it certainly very far, for they have held that it is not necessary for a person actually to go into the house, but that the putting into a house any part of their body, or even any thing which they hold in their hands by which the felony is committed, is sufficient to constitute an entering; that is certainly a very extensive construction, but it has been so decided for many years.</p>

               <p>Court. What words? - Deliver: I rather hesitated, upon which the prisoner swore he would shoot me, if I was not quick. I gave him my purse, containing forty one guineas and two half guineas; he then demanded my watch, which I gave him, it was gold, just on delivering the watch, I saw a watchman come round the corner of the street, and at the same time I heard him rattle, and in the mean time the prisoner ran off; I then jumped out of the coach, and the coachman getting off the box with the watchman, we pursued him, and he was taken by another watchman.</p>

               <p>Court. Was that your watch? - It was, on my saying it was mine, the prisoner then said, as you have got your watch you may as well have your purse, and took my purse out of his pocket himself and gave it me, it was my purse.</p>

               <p>Court. Does your slaughter-house adjoin to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it under the same roof? - Yes. On the fourteenth, in the morning about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250069"/> five, I found three flanks of beef cut away and carried off.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you another door that communicates from the slaughter-house to your house? - There is a back door opens to the kitchen door.</p>

               <p>What time did you shut up your slaughter-house? - Between eight and nine, then they were all whole; they took out three flanks, value ten shillings; the next morning I received information that the prisoners had taken the beef to one Slokum's house, who is here; his mother-in-law and he had a quarrel, and she discovered it: the bolt of the slaughter-house was wrenched and the padlock hasp, and all the doors were open; when we left them the bolt was fast on, and the hasp in good repair, but the next morning the hasp was strained all to pieces almost; we took Slokum directly, and he confessed who brought the beef to him, and we took up the prisoners, and Slokum fetched the beef. I saw the beef at Justice Blackborough's, it was delivered to me; the beef was particular, a piece of what we call the cod was cut to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know any thing of the prisoners taking the beef? - No, only by Slokum's confession.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Daniels says he bought a copper of the prisoner, and his wife sold a copper to Mr. Hill, that copper which is so found in the possession of Mr. Daniels is proved to be the copper that was lost, but non constat, if it was the copper that Daniels bought of the prisoner at the bar, that is not so traced.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, we must not go on an uncertainty, they have left the material witness at home, the man's wife, who generally manages the business, and we must go by the rules of law and evidence.</p>

               <p>When this man threatened to blow your brains out, what happened after that? - I clapped my hands together, and said, pray, Sir, I will be a good girl, and not scream any more.</p>

               <p>Were there more people with him at the justices? - A great many more, but I believe nobody belonging to him.</p>
               <p>And you picked him out from amongst them all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think you should have known any of the other three men if you had seen them? - No, I cannot justly say that I should.</p>
               <p>How came you to observe him particularly beyond the rest? - I looked at him more than I did at the rest, for the rest did not look at me.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened at the time of the robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then could you in that state of affright observe the face of the man, so as to be sure that you could know him again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had he the same clothes on that he had when he robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it by his face or his clothes that you knew him? - By his face and his clothes too, but particularly by the brown jacket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not dispute but she will say what she has, because it is an old grudge.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had Mr. Fogg here yesterday, the churchwarden, that I was to have gone to work for when the frost was over, but he is gone out of town. On the 22d of January I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250079"/> had a few words, and I drank with one Mr. Whiteway; and one Mr. Marnes who is here asked me to drink; I said, you do not owe me so much good will, ever since you belonged to the rendezvous and I was pressed; I said I cannot stop, for ever since my last misfortune I never go to any house but my own, and I am obliged to be very particular; he knows he always takes me up on suspicion of any thing that is done on the water, and when I was going away Mr. Marnes said, I have a suspicion of you Charles; says I, why should you be always troubling of me; I said you will take away my life one of these days; this was on the Thursday, I was brought before a magistrate on the Friday, and committed till Monday; on the Monday morning, this gentlewoman that was here just now came to me, in a very ragged dress, and looked very hard at me, I took her to be something of a ballad singer; says I, good woman, is it you that is to swear against me; I do not know, says she, but what it is; I was ordered to pull my coat off, and go over to the justices, which I did; the woman said she believed it was me by my jacket. I hope you will not be affronted with me for detaining you so long; in the evening the woman was brought and a girl, the girl swore punctual to me.</p>

               <p>Court to Whiteway. When was the prisoner taken up? - He came to me on the Thursday night, as he mentions, about ten o'clock, to give me information of a robbery that he was going to do that evening; that he was going to rob that house where his sister-in-law lives; his sister-in-law was to let him in, and he desired I would be somewhere near the house, that I might detect him in the matter, in order to bring him in as an evidence; upon this I took him to the public house, where our follow officers were, and I consulted on the matter, and I then thought it was better to lodge him in the house that night; I did so there was nothing done that night, but he was detained on suspicion of other robberies, and he was detained from that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I can bring proof where I lodge, that since last September I never was out after eight o'clock at night, and I was on the parish, I had two shillings every other day from Mr. Fogg; once on a time I was tried here for piracy, but not for any thing on land, and was I given to any thing that way, I could get more gains on the water than I could on land.</p>

               <p>Aye, but when the prosecutor came, who shewed the prisoner to the prosecutor? - I cannot tell, I do not remember any person shewed him.</p>
               <p>Where was he when the prosecutor first came in? - Standing at the bar.</p>
               <p>Was any body else with him? - There were two more.</p>
               <p>When he saw him at the bar, he saw him as a prisoner? - Yes, he was a prisoner then.</p>
               <p>What did you take him up for? - We took him on suspicion; after the information, we went to see if we could find him, and we did so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He first said I was the person, and shewed me to the prosecutor, and then he said he did not.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner five or six weeks in his place, he used to come to my room to have some victuals, and when he came out of his place he came to be with me quite entirely; I know nothing of his ways of going on, his Master gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Bowyer. Sir Sampson thought proper to bind this woman over to prove that he used to wear these trowsers.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You took notice of the dress the man was in? - Yes, he had a pair of striped trowsers on when he stopped me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250083"/>Jury. Did you give in that as your description of the person that robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Bowyer. The prosecutor gave information of his being in red striped trowsers.</p>

               <p>All that I have to say in my own defence is, that I do not know my prosecutor; and this runner has threatened my prosecutor with the pillory if he will not swear against me, he told that young woman so.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnson. Did the prosecutor tell you so? - No, indeed, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowyer. Where did you first find these trowsers? - In the prisoner's lodgings, where this woman was, these trowsers were hanging on the head of the bed, and when the prosecutor came to the Office the second time, and related the circumstance of his having red striped trowsers on, and it then struck me that I saw something, which I took at that time to be a striped jacket, but when I went again, I saw they were trowsers; these are the trowsers.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one Witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Court. You speak very fairly; are you sure of the person of the man? - I am certain of his person, it struck me with horror, I am sure I felt as much in seeing him as he could in seeing me; I hope, for the man's consideration to me and my family, the Court will have mercy on him; as he considered me as a poor man, and recommended me to the mercy of his companion, who had death in his hand; and I consider his as a conduct not very common; as soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250084"/> as he saw the guinea, then they went away immediately and desired me not to follow them; I have enquired of the prisoner who he was, and where he came from; I have wrote to Ireland to know his character there, I have not had an answer,* I cannot say any thing at all in that matter.</p>
               <p>* This Prosecutor, three days afterwards, informed the Court, he had received an answer from Ireland in favour of the Prisoner's character.</p>
               <p>Court. You have shewn a great deal of humanity in your conduct.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowyer. The other three witnesses can say no more than you on the former indictment? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, this prosecution rests on the evidence of the prosecutor, and his feeling disposition leaves no room to doubt that he is satisfied the prisoner is the man; it is for you to judge whether, under the circumstances, he had sufficient certainty; if you think he had, the charge is proved against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Who lives in the rest of the house? - They are two rooms over coach-houses.</p>
               <p>How do you get at them? - There is a stair-case out of three stables.</p>
               <p>Is the stair-case open to the street? - No, my Lord, it goes down a different passage out of the Mews.</p>
               <p>You have two rooms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are there other rooms on the same floor? - No.</p>
               <p>Are there any rooms over your's? - No.</p>
               <p>Are there more stair-cases? - Only this stair-case.</p>
               <p>What number of stables are there in the Mews? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>There are several stables within the Mews? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are there not other rooms over the stables? - Yes, and other dwelling houses in the Mews.</p>
               <p>What sort of a door have you at the top of the stair-case into your room? - A single door.</p>
               <p>Do you lock your room at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. It is a private room.</p>
               <p>Is the Mews inclosed? - Open at both ends.</p>
               <p>Court. How is it by night? - Open at all times.</p>
               <p>By night as well as by day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is there to protect your rooms<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250085"/> from being attacked by persons who are travelling at that end of the town? - Nothing, Sir, but my door of my apartment, which is at the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Then from the Mews to the stairs there is no door? - There is a door, but no fastening, and any body that has a mind may open it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Is there a door at the bottom of the stairs next the yard - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. There is a passage that goes into her apartments before the ascends the stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Then she goes out of the Mews into a passage, and out of that passage into her room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. You have only one door at the top of the stairs? - Two rooms, and two doors which go into different rooms.</p>
               <p>Court. The stair-case is open, and when she gets to the top of the stairs there are two doors that go to two different rooms.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, she has two outside doors to her house upon this evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. They are separate habitations for herself and husband, as I conceive; that being the case, whether there is a communication from one room to the other; whether one room lays on the left-hand or the right-hand you have two doors to communicate, the one and the other are one mansion and the dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lords, this woman has two private doors to her two private rooms, either she has two outside doors to her two dwelling houses, or she has no outside door to her dwelling house; if there is any outward door to this dwelling house, in my poor comprehension, it must be that door to the passage, after that she ascends the stair-case to two private dwelling rooms; but I fancy your Lordship will not say to any dwelling house. It is situated in a Mews, for the purpose of gentlemen's coach-houses and stables; over such a building there is generally a hay-loft, which some gentlemen have converted into lodging rooms; but surely in a very penal case indeed, which affects the life of a prisoner, the Court will not go the length in a new case of saying that this is a dwelling house, in which a burglary has been committed; I have not yet asked the witness, but it will appear, that this is not rated as a dwelling house, that it is not treated as a dwelling house, but as it always has been, and always will be, as appurtenant to the coach-house; it would be described to be the building of the owner of the coach-house and stable. It may perhaps be considerable too to this indictment, whose dwelling house it is; for if these people, the prosecutor and his wife, are the coachman and the wife of the coachman to somebody that keeps their coach and horses there, I should then submit if it can be called a dwelling house at all; it is not the dwelling house of the prosecutor: but at present I submit with the greatest deference in the world to your Lordships, that this cannot be considered as a dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Does your husband rent the rooms? - I took the rooms.</p>
               <p>Then you pay for them? - I pay for them.</p>
               <p>They do not belong to any gentleman to whom your husband is coachman? - My husband is coachman to Lady Harvey; her coach and horses stand in the Mews.</p>
               <p>Court. Who does your husband rent the rooms of? - Of Mrs. Baffetti, and she let them for an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>What acquaintance? - I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. In respect to your observation of the door, suppose a person lives in my house with the street door open, and as to these two rooms, whether their not happening to communicate one with the other, otherwise than by a platform or the landing-place, may be considered as the mansion house: it is very clear this man and his wife inhabited there, and it communicates with no other lodgings or apartments. I remember a case tried in this Court, which was reserved for the opinion of the Judges; I tried it. The owner of a house let all the house in lodgings, distinctly and separate, if the owner lodges in any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250086"/> one part of the house, it shall be called and determined his house, and though there may be ten inmates, you shall not call it the mansion house of the lodger, but the mansion house of the owner; but in that case, all the house was let out in apartments, and there was an open door; there was a shop, and a parlour within the shop, and a cellar underneath, were let out in one bargain, at a given sum of twelve pounds ten shillings; I have it in my memory; and the landlord the owner agreed with the lessee to have the cellar to place lumber in, and he abated him thirty shillings a year out of the rent for the use of the cellar: The objection was taken that the burglary was in one of the apartments so let out, laid to be the mansion-house of the lodger. I reserved the case for the opinion of the Judges, and they were of opinion, that as the owner did not at all inhabit there, though he had reserved this cellar for the sake of keeping furniture; yet he not occupying as an inhabitant any part of this house, that it was an exception out of the general rule. There are a number of instances in this town of apartments so let, and it might leave those apartments open to be robbed, without the robber being liable to be convicted of a burglary; and all the Judges were unanimously of opinion, it was a burglary. Now apply that reasoning to this case; this is the habitation and the domicile of the man and his wife, without any communication with any other inhabitants, and this door in the passage we will call the outward door to this domicile; then there are two inner doors if I may so say to this mansion house; whether it is a house, a habitation from the ground outwardly, or whether shops or warehouses are underneath, or, as in the present case, stables, does not alter the case at all in my opinion.</p>

               <p>Mr. Baron Perryn. My opinion concurs with my brother Gould's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. You do not know who your landlord is? - No. I had it of Mrs. Baffetti, but I know it was not her's.</p>
               <p>Have you ever paid any rent? - I have not been in the lodging above three weeks.</p>
               <p>What are you to pay? - I am to pay six pounds ten shillings a year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, she does not know her landlord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Was you acquainted with this place before you took these rooms? - No.</p>
               <p>The door of the passage has never been kept locked since you went there? - No.</p>
               <p>Is there any lock upon it? - I will not be sure, I never saw any lock upon it.</p>
               <p>Is there any bolt upon it? - I do not know, I never examined the door.</p>
               <p>Where does that passage go to? - It leads to my staircase.</p>
               <p>Does it go any where else? - It leads down a little further to three stables.</p>
               <p>Do the horses go through that passage to those stables? - Yes, down that passage.</p>
               <p>Court. Were your rooms broke open at any time? - I left my lodgings between one and two in the day, a month last Monday.</p>
               <p>How did you leave the door? - Locked.</p>
               <p>Which door, you have two rooms? - Both doors were locked, I am positive of that; I returned about a quarter after nine in the evening, and found my left hand door open.</p>
               <p>Was the door broke? - My key would lock and unlock it as well as it would when I went out, the-door was wide open, but the lock and staple were all right, there was no mark on this door, but on the other door there was the mark of a little chissel.</p>
               <p>How was the bolt of the lock? - It was standing out, I found my chest of drawers open, and gowns and petticoats and linen of all sorts, table linen taken away, and two pair of sheets.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the value of them? - The sheets ten shillings, I lost three table cloths, five gowns, and three petticoats.</p>
               <p>What was the value of them? - I cannot positively tell the worth of them, they were all good gowns.</p>
               <p>Speak within compass? - Ten shillings a piece, the petticoats five shillings, and there were six guineas in gold, which were pinned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250087"/> up in a pair of thread stockings, and was put in the drawers.</p>
               <p>Was the drawer locked? - Yes; I was in great distress when I saw the things were gone; and I afterwards found a pair of sheets, three shifts, a flannel coat, a pair of stockings, and six gowns.</p>
               <p>Where were they found? - At the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was not present? - No.</p>
               <p>How long has your husband been coachman to Lady Harvey? - A good many years.</p>
               <p>How long have the horses stood at this Mews? - About five years.</p>
               <p>You told my Lord you lodged at Mill-hill Mews? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of February, the prisoner was brought to Bow-street for another offence; Sir Sampson asked him where he lodged; he said he did not chuse to tell him; I saw a young woman which they said was his wife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not tell us what they said. - But I will tell you more, Sir, presently; I watched her home; I went up stairs with her immediately, the first things I saw in the room was the clothes the prisoner has on, and I found these picklock keys, and this saw, and a pistol.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they under lock and key? - No, they were not; and I found this linen.</p>
               <p>Was that locked up or open? - In a box, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Now Jealous, this man being asked at Bow-street where he lived, did not chuse to tell you? - He did not chuse to tell Sir Sampson.</p>

               <p>What at it again, Jealous; why now you know the Court will not suffer you to tell us what that woman said. You went to the room of this woman; what the woman either before or since has acknowledged is nothing to the purpose. - The prisoner acknowledged the things himself, and said he found them, it was before the prosecutrix, there she is, and I was by; that was at the Brown Bear, in Bow-street, on Monday last.</p>
               <p>It is pretty singular you did not tell my Lord that before; you found some linen in a box, and you found a suit of clothes which you believe to be his clothes? - I am positive of it, he acknowledged the woman was his wife at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What did he say about it? - He said she was his wife, and he had been married to her a week.</p>

               <p>I was at Bow-street, and was ordered by Sir Sampson Wright to go to the watch-house, to see if there was not something there, as the person who stopped him said he had a deal more money; I went up there, and there I found a dark lanthorn and an iron crow.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know he put them there? - I do not know, there was another man confined there.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any other reason to tell us they were his? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing else besides these things? - No.</p>
               <p>- ATKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Newport, I attend at the office in Bow-street, this man was brought to the Brown-bear, in the morning of the 28th by a constable, and some more people, he was very dirtily dressed, and I saw this watch hanging down, and I said to the constable, what have not you searched the man? I took him, and searched him, and found this watch, five guineas, and six shillings and sixpence; he behaved himself very indifferently before Sir Sampson, and Sir Sampson mentioned that he thought he had more money about him, and I searched him again, and found twelve guineas and an half in his stocking feet: I have delivered the prisoner four guineas of it, at least to the woman, the remainder I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And so you came here to tell us, that this man finding himself in the hands of the mirmidons that attend at the Brown-bear, put his money into his shoes? - He was not in those hands then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I do not chuse to speak without having my property returned, I have a brother, and I got eighteen guineas of him to go into business, they took the remainder of my money and my watch.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called three Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this indictment charges the prisoner with burglary, and I need not tell you that to constitute that crime, it is necessary that the place broke open be a dwelling house, and also that it be broken in the night-time: if it rested merely on the question as to time, it seems to me that it is not so made out, that the offence whatever it may amount to in point of law, can constitute the crime of burglary; because this woman left her house between one and two o'clock at noon, and there is no account of these rooms till nine at night: then the next question will be, whether any offence has been proved to be committed in a dwelling house; as to the law upon this evidence whether this is or is not a dwelling house, I would on this occasion as well as in every other, very readily refer to my learned brother, who has stated his reasons for being of opinion that it is a dwelling house: there is one fact which perhaps will be material in this case, and that fact, if found one way, would so far dispose of the case, as not to leave it open to the question of law at all, and that is, as to the situation that she has described the passage to be in: but I shall leave it as a question for further consideration, taking it at this moment to be a dwelling house, and if it was so, though it is not a burglary, and though there might be some doubt as to the breaking; yet there is another offence, of which the prisoner may be guilty, which I must state to you more particularly; and that is, that though he did not break open these rooms, yet if he stole property to the amount of forty shillings, it is a capital offence; taking it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250089"/> at this moment, as I said before, to be a dwelling house: therefore I will state the case to you now, considering it in that light only: there might be some question as to the breaking, because it appears by the prosecutrix's evidence, that when she came back the door was not at all hurt, the door was open, the lock was not hurt, the bolt of the lock was standing out, and yet the staple had not been at all forced; therefore if it was material, you might have questioned whether she had actually left both the doors safe, or whether she might not have turned the lock, and not let it go into the hasp: but here the material question is, whether you are satisfied the prisoner did take property to the amount of forty shillings out of these rooms: the prosecutrix swears very positively to the property, and that she is sure it was in her rooms, and that the six guineas were wrapped up in the stockings: now the six guineas put the value out of the question: then the next question is whether you are, or are not satisfied, that the prisoner was the person that committed it; that turns on the evidence of

               <p>I belong to Mr. Staples's Office; I know this, that the boy came in, and nominates as this, that he had been robbed of his hat; he came in to the Rotation about half after seven this day fortnight at night.</p>
               <p>Did any body come in with him? - There was a lusty gentleman came in with him, and had hold of the prisoner Burn; says he, I am not a going to let you go, do not you think it; the boy went up and had a hearing, and when he came down, I spoke to one of the runners, says I, Charles, I know Bandy, that is Johnson.</p>
               <p>How came you to know any thing of him? - Because he nominated in this, that Johnson was one of them.</p>
               <p>What account did the prosecutor give of this? - He never said a word to me.</p>
               <p>Then how did you know what the charge was? - By the hearing it read in the Rotation.</p>
               <p>Who did you hear it from? - From Butler, in the outer box; I never went night him, he never said any thing at all to me.</p>
               <p>Why are you so afraid that he should be supposed to have said any thing to you, when you was not asked it? - The meaning was as this, this Burn says, says he, I shall be admitted an evidence, says he, it is a boy in a black coat.</p>
               <p>What account did the boy Butler give of the robbery when he first came in? - Only what I heard in the box, I heard him say as this here, that it was Burne, Tozo, and Johnson; and that Burne was the person that took and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he give an account what they did to him? - I did not see the affair.</p>
               <p>I am not asking you that, you know I am not; I am asking you whether Butler gave an account of what they had done to him? - No further than nominating that it was them three that stopped him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him how he was to conduct this prosecution? - I never mentioned a word to him.</p>
               <p>Who pays the expence of this prosecution? - Not me.</p>
               <p>Do not you know who does? - We agreed to pay it between us, me, and Mathews, and Dorman.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250093"/>How much are you to receive, if, upon your evidence, these three boys are convicted? - I do not suppose I have paid above three shillings in all.</p>
               <p>Sir, do you mean that as an answer to my question; are you deaf? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how dare you answer in that manner; I ask you, what are you to receive, if, upon your evidence, these three boys are convicted? - I do not desire one farthing, I do not know how much I am entitled to.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I work at my business, I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Have you never taken up any body for a highway robbery, or a footpad robbery? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>And do not you know what you are entitled to upon the conviction of the prisoners? - Indeed, rightly, I do not.</p>
               <p>Rightly! Sir; upon your oath do not you know? - I have heard it is forty pounds, but not that I want it.</p>
               <p>Then three forties is one hundred and twenty pounds, if these three boys are convicted.</p>

               <p>You was not? - No, I was not; Burne said there were Johnson, and he, and Tozo, in company together in Lemon-street; that they stopped the boy with a candlestick, and said, you bloody dog, your life or your money.</p>
               <p>Did not Burne say he was to be admitted an evidence? - He never told me so; Mr. Platt told me that he was to be admitted an evidence.</p>

               <p>Who pays the expence of this prosecution? - When we went to prefer the bill, I said to him, have you got the money to pay for the bill; Mr. Johnson said, you must pay for the bill, you will have it paid you again; I told him says I, it is hard for me to pay it if the boy is not here, but I must prefer a bill to save my own recognizance.</p>
               <p>And how much are you to receive if these boys are convicted? - I do not do it for that, I am bound.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Johnson tell you that you was to pay for the indictment? - Yes, Sir, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>I advise you to be careful in that, I do not want to entrap you? - He told me to pay it and I should be paid it again.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to Mr. Staples's Office, when the little boy came in, I did not take much notice of him, seeing a lusty man had hold of his arm, and he desired me to take charge of the middle prisoner, because he could not stay.</p>
               <p>What did the prosecutor say in your hearing? - I cannot recollect; we go through a little place that is dark, and I thought I heard him say here is something dropped, or a candlestick dropped; I had then the boy in charge, it was this candlestick, he gave it to a man that draws beer at our house, and he gave it to me; I did not see it picked up.</p>
               <p>What did Butler accuse the boys of? - Of robbing him, he said they had stopped him, and put the candlestick up to his head, and said your life or your money; then he told me that two of them ran under a gateway, and one ran over the way, and he said he thought it was best to pursue where there where two, and then he should have the chance of catching one.</p>
               <p>Where was Platt then, was he by? - He might be in the tap-room for what I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250094"/>Did the boy tell you the names of the boys that had stopped him? - Not to my knowledge he never told me, I knew it from Burne; after Burne was committed for further examination, he begged me to go up to the justice and get him admitted an evidence; Mr. Staples said, he did not think he could do it, because the prosecutor swore so positively to him; after he had had a hearing he told me their names.</p>
               <p>Where is this lusty gentleman? - He went away directly.</p>
               <p>Where does Burne live? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where does Johnson live? - I do not know, I heard that Tozo was to be found in a public house in Salt-petre Bank, I went there at night to look for him, but I did not find him, I do not know where any of them live.</p>
               <p>Who advised the boy to prosecute them? - I do not know that any body advised him, I have not.</p>
               <p>Who paid for this prosecution? - I do not know, I have not paid any thing, nor I shall pay nothing at all to any body.</p>
               <p>Have you agreed to pay any part of the expence? - No.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true that Matthews, and Platt, and you, agreed to pay the expence between you? - I never told them I would pay any thing, when the bill was preferred I was not there.</p>

               <p>I was running along very fast, with that candlestick from my aunt's to my mother's, and some man stopped me, I do not know him from Adam, he carried me to a Justice, I know the prosecutor, I have played with him many times, and know his father and mother to be very poor, and I know he does this for the money; his father and mother were obliged to pawn their things to find the indictment, these runners told him he would have the money for us, and they would maintain him; I know nothing of these other two boys; my mother keeps a chandler's shop in Bell-yard, Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>Matthews. I paid Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>Bowen. I am very clear from my memory that this man absolutely paid me the money, and seemed very eager to have the indictment, and there was not a syllable mentioned by Mr. Johnson, I am well convinced, of its being allowed him again, not a jota at the time.</p>
               <p>Matthews. I will prove my innocence in this; the instructions were brought I believe by Mr. Platt to Mr. Staples's office, and were given to Mr. Johnson to draw up the bill of indictment, when I went in, I asked if it was ready, and he went, and struck the thing that they cut it with, says I, I will give you a bit of lead: Mr. Johnson received the money, and asked the boy for the money, and the boy said, I have none.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowen. Is that true? - I never heard any such conversation save as to the lad.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Council. You went out about four? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any lodgers? - Yes, they went with me.</p>
               <p>How many lodgers have you? - Only one family.</p>
               <p>Did all that family go with you? - Yes, all but the lodger's husband.</p>
               <p>Where was he? - He was out.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I am sure of it, he is an excise-man, and goes upon duty at certain hours.</p>
               <p>Court. What room does your lodgers lodge in? - Up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Were you up in that room shortly before you went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he there? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. You did not push against the door to know whether it was locked? - No, I heard it latch.</p>
               <p>That is you heard a noise? - I know the noise of the staple of the door.</p>
               <p>It might be the staple striking against the door? - By frequently shutting the door, I can tell partly when the lock catches.</p>

               <p>Do you often pull that door after you? - Very often.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you have been mistaken? - No, Sir, never to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Court. Did they demand the money of you before you parted with it? - Yes; as soon as I gave them the money, they let go my collar and bid me go to the bottom of the court, which they said was my way out; now that was no way out, and they told me if I came up to the top of the court, they would cut my bloody head off, and another said he would murder me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250098"/>Court. Was the prisoner one of those that made use of these expressions? - Yes; there was no way out at the bottom of the court, and I came out to the top again; I did not see them at all; I went down Holywell-lane; I live in New Nicol-street, Shadwell; going down Holywell-lane, the two fellows were under King John's Court, the other was opposite the way; they strove to catch me again, they did not catch me; after I had got past them, I knew one of them that went by the nick-name of Guinea-pig, that was the prisoner; I said Guinea-pig, you shall pay for this to-morrow; I have known the prisoner this two years, he lodged next door to me part of the time; they then threw brick-bats at me as hard as they could, and I called watch! but none came; then I went home, and I saw no more of them that night; but the next day, abut two o'clock, I apprehended the prisoner; I then sent a man to see for an officer, and he brought Mr. Wade; after he was at Mr. Wilmot's, he told me, if in case he was guilty of a fault the night before, he hoped I would forgive him; then he said, consider my wife and child.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you made use of any promises to induce the man? - I never said a word to the man.</p>
               <p>Did you threaten him? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I was locked up at Mr. Wilmot's, the prosecutor sent two men to me, and they gave me three or four pints of purl, and asked me after if I would have any gin, I said I had enough; then says one of them, are not you a foolish fellow to go to rob a man that knows you, and he said to me tell the truth, I am a particular acquaintance of the prosecutor's, and I will persuade him to make it up.</p>
               <p>Court. The prosecutor says you said at Wilmot's, that if you was guilty of a fault the night before, you hoped he would forgive you, and consider your wife and child?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has made that out of his own head.</p>

               <p>I was at the Duke of Northumberland's arms, next door to Justice Wilmot's, on Saturday the 17th of January, about two in the afternoon; I went in and asked what was the matter, some of the people in the house said, a young man is going to be examined for robbing Mr. Clarridge; I went down to see him; I said to him, if I was a dying man, says I, young man, you have been guilty of a very bad action, are you the man that robbed Mr. Clarridge? he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you given him any liquor before this? - My Lord, as I am here alive, I never gave him a drop of liquor in the days of my life.</p>
               <p>Was he sober? - Yes; I said I am acquainted with Mr. Clarridge, he is a very civil man; says he, do you know him; I said, yes; he said, then for God's sake, and cried very much, speak to him to make the matter up; I told him, I would let Mr. Clarridge know what he said; says he, my mother is over the way, who will make up the eleven shillings; he said, I had the sixpence, but I never had the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Had you made him any promise before this, to shew him any favour that he should not be prosecuted? - None in the world.</p>
               <p>Had you told him it would be better for him? - No, I never gave him any liquor, nor saw any go to him; I told Mr. Clarridge, and he told Justice Wilmot that he had spoke to somebody concerning the matter, who was at the Court, or near it, and he said it was Mr.

             the broker; I waited upon him, and I told him as I have related now; then he bound me over as an evidence; as for drinking with him, or ever seeing him drink, I never did all the days of my life.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you positively take upon you, Sir, to say that this prisoner had not any liquor in your company? - Yes, I had given him none.</p>
               <p>How came you to accost him at the outset, with saying, you have done a very bad thing? - Because I knew the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250099"/>Court. He could not be guilty before any examination.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man came out three or four times to me, and you know you said I had better tell the truth, and you would make it up for me, without going to gaol at all; says you, you know very well you had sixpence, tell the truth, and another man that was along with you at the same time, kept bringing me out a pint of purl, and had brought me purl, and wanted to force me to drink.</p>
               <p>Court. Did such a conversation pass? - Not the least in the world, if I was a dying man.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems very unnatural that the prisoner, who knew nothing at all of you, should expose himself; what reason was there for your informing the prisoner that you was an acquaintance of Mr. Clarridge's? - I never said I would make it up for him, I said I would tell Mr. Clarridge.</p>

               <p>Was there a person like him that was one of the three? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to me very extraordinary that they should make that second attack on him, after they had taken his property.</p>
               <p>Jury to Clarridge. What business are you? - I am a shoemaker, I had been into the Borough with some shoes.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night, or dark? - Rather light than dark.</p>
               <p>Was there any lamps any way near? - Not far off, I could see the men perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Jury. With which hand did he collar you? - I cannot be perfect.</p>
               <p>Why he has but one hand? - He was on the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am lame of one side.</p>
               <p>Jury. There was time enough to call the watchman.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarridge. It seems to me to be pretty extraordinary, that you should, under such circumstances, discover that you knew any one of them; why, you might have been murdered? - I was left for dead about two years ago; I did not think they meant to meddle with me.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Webley. Did Mr. Clarridge appear in liquor? - Quite sober.</p>
               <p>How near were the three men to you when they abused you? - They came quite close to us.</p>
               <p>If you had known the prisoner at the bar at any other time, you would have known him at that time? - I did not take any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250100"/> notice, I did not think they would offer to stop the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Court. If the purpose of these three men was robbery, they would have had a much better booty, by attacking them both together.</p>
               <p>Jury. The three men had an opportunity of robbing you both if they chose it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nobody there to prevent it? - No.</p>

               <p>- PEARCE sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with a search warrant to search this man's house on the 10th of February, between seven and eight that night, he lives in Long's-buildings, White-cross-street; when I came there, we got entrance into the house, and the prisoner and his wife were at supper; we told them our business, their apartment consists of one room, parted off for a bed-place; we found several things in the bed room, which were handed out to the high constable, from the officer who was in the bed room; I prevented the prisoner from going out; a child's frock was found, and the prisoner said, do not take that, that is my child's frock, but it was taken and tied up in a handkerchief, and has been in the possession of Mr. Boddington the high constable ever since; we took the prisoner and the things to Mr. Jones's house, and the first thing that caught his eye was this very frock; Mr. Jones owned it, and Mrs. Jones, and the housekeeper; we took the prisoner to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where do you live? - Windmill-hill Moorfields.</p>
               <p>That is not in the neighbourhood of Rosemary-lane? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it not that what is called Rag-fair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do people do there? - Buy and sell all kinds of wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>You saw the wife of this man? - Yes, she was very big with child, and compassion led us not to take her on that score.</p>
               <p>- BODDINGTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am high constable of Finsbury division, I went with this search warrant to the prisoner's house; this is the property I found in the house where Penny was, it has been in my possession ever since; here is a child's frock, a shirt, a petticoat, and pockets, that were all sworn to the next day, on examination at the Rotation Office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I suppose the apartments consisted of one room, with the bed parted off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing concealed in cupboards and closets? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you find any trunk there? - No large trunk.</p>
               <p>In the course of your office as high constable, perhaps you sometimes visit Rag-fair? - No, Sir, I do not belong to that division.</p>
               <p>JENKIN JONES, Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>I have a town house in Old-street, and I have a country house at Moulsey; this chest I understood contained a great quantity of wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250103"/>To what amount? - If new, I suppose seventy or eighty pounds, as it is in wear, I suppose about forty pounds; I selected this particularly from a great deal of other, it was confirmed by my wife and servant, the shirt I know by a singular circumstance, it had a particular mark, which being discoloured, I desired the high-constable to get it washed out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You could not then identify it by an initial of a name only that mark? - No.</p>
               <p>The Jury cannot judge of that mark, because it is washed out: of course gentlemen of your figure have vast quantities of linen for yourself, and the rest of your family, which, when they are worn, pass into the hands of servants? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>As to the frock you cannot identify it particularly? - Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. When had you seen that shirt before, Sir? - I must have worn it in the course of that week, either on the Thursday or the Friday, from that very circumstance of that mark.</p>
               <p>Look at that shirt and these things? -</p>
               <p>There was an J. and a figure of twelve upon it, there is the J. to be seen, the twelve is out.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the pockets to be Mrs. Jones's, there is an oilet hole to tye them by, and this petticoat has loops to tye it to the child's stays, and this frock is a very particular made one, it is gathered at the top, and the body is loose and ties on.</p>

               <p>Jury. But several jams are made in the same manner? - Yes, but they are generally open at top, I am sure they are Mrs. Jones's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Have you the least doubt? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are the oilet holes in the pocket and the loops of the petticoat so particular that you can swear to them? - To the best of my knowledge I believe them to be my work, and her property.</p>
               <p>As to the loops on the petticoat, I fancy there is nothing so common? - Most people few them to stays.</p>
               <p>Yes, but many people wear loops besides Mrs. Jones's family, as to the jam I shall trust that observation to the Jury; can you venture to say that these identical things were put up in the trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, there are in the family duplicates without number of all their things? - I make one list and send with the clothes, and keep another by me.</p>
               <p>So I thought, then you swear by your list, but whether these identical things or others of Mrs. Jones's, were in the box, you do not know; now do you affect to swear that these identical things were in the box? - I firmly believe in my own mind that these are the things.</p>
               <p>What is the ground of your belief, and by what do you distinguish them? - From the make and the marks.</p>
               <p>If Mr. Jones has ten dozen of shirts, how are you sure that that indentical shirt was put up by you in the box; that you put up a number of shirts, I can easily conceive, but can you swear that you put up that identical shirt and these other identical pieces of linen? - By the loops, and by the oilet holes, I firmly believe they are the things.</p>
               <p>Court. This linen was sent from Old-street down to Moulsey by water? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you send all your master's dirty shirts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often do you send? - Every week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Can you take upon yourself to say that that is one of the shirts that were sent that week? - I firmly believe it to be one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. She is sure that it is Mr. Jones's shirt, whether it was in that box, or at any other time it is found in the possession of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Had your master lost any linen the week before? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How do you know what went to Moulsey? - Because they were returned safe to me clean.</p>

               <p>I am nursery-maid to Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>Look at that jam? - The greatest part of it I made myself, this piece underneath that tuck I put to it, it has not been washed since, and there was new edging about it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you find any thing concealed? - No.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bodington. To whom did you deliver that shirt to be washed? - To my servant-maid in my own house, I was in the house on last Sunday when it was done, I saw it washed, because it should not go out of my custody.</p>

               <p>Can you give the Court any account of that linen or any part of it? - I bought a parcel of child-bed-linen, and along with it, I bought this muslin frock, and a man's shirt, and a pair of dirty pockets.</p>
               <p>Where did you buy them? - In Monmouth-street, Rag-fair; I carried them home all wrapped up together, I told the constable then, that I bought them that same afternoon.</p>

I speak in justice to the prisoner, he never owned the jam, but the woman downed on her knees, and begged to have the jam out of the bundle, she said, she bought it in Rag-fair that morning, and the man never acknowledged a word of it at that time upon my oath; I think it no more than justice to mention.</p>

               <p>Court to Pearce. Did you see the woman fall on her knees? - The prisoner at the bar begged once or twice not to take the frock, because it was the child's and Mr. Bodington I believe, made answer to the woman, good woman, be easy.</p>
               <p>Court to Bodington. How was this? - I do not know that the man did ask for the frock, or say it was his frock, the woman begged I would deliver the frock to her.</p>

               <p>Mr. Scott of Council for the Prosecution, thus opened the case.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, to favour me in support of this prosecution. The original prosecutor in this indictment, which was preferred ever since July sessions last, is lately dead, but whilst living, he had retired from trade, and had a house at <placeName id="t17840225-36-crimeloc200">Paddington</placeName>

                  John

            , in repairing the wall; all the scaffold and the scaffolding boards, and every thing else that belonged to this business, were the property of Mr. Beresford, the prosecutor, he provided all these things: the work however, was no sooner compleated but he missed the things mentioned in the indictment; indeed Mr. Beresford had from time to time missed many things; but Mr. J. Pond was one of the last men in the world that he had any suspicion of: after this work was finished, it seemed that there was a part of the paling of Mr. Beresford's garden, that was not repaired, and the premises of the prisoner immediately joining to those of the prosecutor, when the carpenter came to open the paling, he immediately opened into a shed of the prisoner's, and in that shed all these things were found. Mr. Beresford was informed of it, and was a good deal surprized, but being a man of a very humane disposition, I take it for granted, no prosecution would have been heard of, as the things were returned to Mr. Beresford, there being no doubt of the property: but Mr. Pond a little time after, had the assurance to bring an action against Mr. Beresford and his son, and a carpenter, for the several things stated in the first indictment; a great space of time has elapsed between that indictment and the present time, and the conduct of Mr. Pond has been putting off this matter from time to time; and with respect to this action, which was the very reason, why the Court did not try this cause before, you will find that action has never been taken the least notice of whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. The man had not money enough to go on with the action, and it was non-prossed, and he is now a prisoner for costs; it is a most wicked prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. I opened the matter some sessions ago before your Lordship, and you was then against our going into the business till the action was tried.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. They never took him before a magistrate, nor never got a warrant against him.</p>

            , of Chelsea, I believe he was a bricklayer; the prisoner took down the scaffolding that I purchased there; the burnt mark was endeavoured to be erased out, but was not done so effectually but that it is possible to be seen now; I put a private mark on them, and they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Can you identify at all the deals? - I think there is not a doubt, I can tell them by the wood, the grain of these planks was so exceedingly hard, that the saw jagged every time it cut, and would not make a clear cut; there was also found in the same shed with the putlocks, a shaft of a cart, piled up, ready for business, as if it was the prisoner's property; I knew we had the fellow to it on my father's premises, and it is here to produce.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a broken shaft? - No, it was sawed off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. What kind of a shed was this, was it an open shed? - It was very near inclosed.</p>
               <p>The man lived next door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was his shed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The shed was in the garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The garden was not fenced in, otherwise than by paling? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you there when the boards were taken away from this man's premises? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did not he claim them? - No, his wife did, she said you take them away without any authority.</p>
               <p>You carried them away? - They were taken away, I did not carry them.</p>
               <p>By your order? - By my father's order.</p>
               <p>Did you go before any magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was it afterwards before you, your father, and the carpenter, were served with copies of writs? - On the 31st of March, the prisoner at the bar brought a letter to my father, and the contents of that letter was this, to the best of my recollection -</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when he brought it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then do not be forward to relate it. - I am not forward, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Hear me, Sir; what day of the month was it when these boards were taken away from the prisoner? - I apprehend about the 22d, or 23d.</p>
               <p>Who was the letter wrote by? - Mr. Fowler.</p>
               <p>He is an attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The Letter read, dated March 31, 1783.)</p>
               <p>"Sir,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Pond, the bricklayer, has been</p>
               <p>"with me, complaining of your behaviour</p>
               <p>"in taking away his property; if therefore</p>
               <p>"you do not make him immediate</p>

               <p>"done to him, I shall be under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250108"/> " necessity of taking disagreeable measures."</p>
               <p>When was the action brought? - I think on the 3d of April.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was this cottage where the prisoner lived from the house in which you father lived? - About forty or fifty feet from my father's house.</p>
               <p>Whether between the 22d of March and this 31st of March, the date of the attorney's letter, the prisoner was at home as usual? - There is not a doubt about that.</p>
               <p>Did you or your father accuse this man of felony from the 22d of March till after the time that letter was sent? - At the time the things were taken away, it was looked upon as a base thing; his wife was told, if he did not quit the town he would certainly be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Did you hear that? - I am clear in it.</p>
               <p>What did your hear said to the wife? - I said it myself.</p>
               <p>When? - The time when the deals were taken away, I would not say an ill-natured thing on any account whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Then from the 22d to the 31st, you say he was public at his own house? - There is not a doubt of it, I should imagine so; I took the letter to Sir Sampson Wright, and he bid me go and tell Mr. Fowler, you may do what you please, for we will indict him; I told Mr. Fowler I was sorry he was concerned in such a dirty piece of business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. You only told your own story to Sir Sampson; but now, if this man had committed a felony, and you was so great with Sir Sampson, how came you not to have warrant? - My father being a man in an advanced state of life, he did not like any kind of trouble, he knew he was justified in taking his property.</p>
               <p>Was not there a bill preferred for petty larceny? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of the bill? - The parties were not examined, I was not, nor the carpenter; my father went in and nobody else, but he could not speak to the whole of the business, and the bill of indictment was thrown out.</p>
               <p>Then you never applied to the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>And the action went on? - It did.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you mended the evidence, and attempted the second time? - The next quarter sessions.</p>
               <p>During all that time the man was public? - He was, I believe.</p>
               <p>In July this bill was preferred by your father? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he never was carried before a magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>As to the putlocks, you know they were your father's property? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Might there have been no others with that mark on them, when that man's goods were sold at Chelsea? - I am very clear I bought them all.</p>
               <p>Court. How many might you buy there? - I suppose in the lot about one hundred and ten.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. As to the bolts, do you know them? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Do you swear the bolts you have in the yard, are the very bolts you took out of this man's premises? - I do most undoubtedly.</p>

               <p>You say so? - There is not a doubt of it.</p>

            , deceased, in repairing a garden fence, and the prisoner was whitewashing and stopping the house, when I went he had almost done, and these deals were in the place where I was at work, by the side of my bench, and he took them for scaffolding; when he struck the scaffold I never saw them any more; I found them in his possession.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you find them? - After I had done this house, there is a garden-fence belonging to the house that Mr. Beresford lives in, and he ordered me to put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250109"/> up a new fence; he asked me what were become of the deals, he thought they went off too fast; I told him I could not tell; one end of the sence was against the house that the prisoner lived in; old Mr. Beresford told me to knock the fence down; within about a yard, or very nigh to this fence, there was a door-way into a room, and I saw these deals in that room; they are a kind of stuff I never saw before, though I have been in that branch thirty years, and one of them has a very particular mark upon it, it is cracked almost from end to end; I went up directly and told Mr. Beresford of it, he came and went into the shed, and when he returned, he said, if every one had their right, John, there are more things of mine in that shed; we then found the putlocks, and some of the marks were fresh cut out, but not cut deep enough, and there was a shaft of a cart found, I had the fellow to it, which exactly answered, for a post.</p>
               <p>Did you measure it? - Yes, I put them both together, I paired them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. What sort of a room was this? - The room where he lodged, there was no door it.</p>
               <p>It was open and joined to his garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was the shed from the prisoner's house? - It joined.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you looked on these boards? - Yes, I swear to the narrow one in particular, I am quite clear and satisfied that that board belonged to Mr. Beresford; I cannot speak to the putlocks.</p>
               <p>What do you say to the other boards? - I cannot be so particular to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. At the time that these boards were taken away, were they marked? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were they put afterwards? - They were put in a place by themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott to Prosecutor. Have you looked on these putlocks? - I have.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt upon them? - Not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Were these boards ever carried to Bow-street? - They were not.</p>
               <p>Nor to any justice's? - No.</p>

            ? - Yes, there were two deals and three put-locks.</p>
               <p>Should you know them again if you was to see them? - Yes, one was narrower than the other, I knew it particularly, I often saw it, I brought it in the cart from Westminster-bridge, and there was never such another deal in the cart. (The deals deposed to by this witness.) I can safely swear to the narrow one.</p>
               <p>Court. What led you to take notice of these deals? - I took notice one was narrower than the other, I never minded them so particularly before, I can swear to the deals.</p>
               <p>You can be sure that these were the deals that were found on the man's premises, but do you know they were the deals that belonged to Mr. Beresford; had you taken particular notice of both, or either of those deals, before they were found on the prisoner? - I had not taken very particular notice.</p>
               <p>Then you brought such sort of deals as those for your master from Lambeth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. Was there any mark on that narrow deal? - There is a piece slit off of</p>
               <p>Court. Had you observed that piece slit off of it before you saw them at the prisoner's house? - No, Sir, I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. How many did you bring from Lambeth in the cart? - Twenty-four or twenty-five, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>Did you load them yourself? - Me and another man.</p>
               <p>Are you a carpenter by business? - No.</p>
               <p>And do you say now upon your oath, that you took so much notice of any particular deal that you could know it at this distance of time? - Yes, because he had them to build the scaffold, and they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250110"/> new, and we had no other that were, and when he struck the scaffold he took them away.</p>
               <p>At the time when you loaded the cart, did you take notice of this deal any more than the other? - No, Sir.</p>

The reason why I could not follow the cause in the King's Bench was, I was at the bar here before, and was sick a matter of ten weeks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250111"/> with the gaol distemper, and my wife and I were so ill, that nobody would come near us.</p>

               <p>Was that woman in their company? - Yes, my young man was serving them, Hyde says to the other, stay here till I come back, I am going a little way, after this I saw my young man looking over these cottons, and turning them as if he had missed one, then he went out, he had been gone out about three minutes, not more, then he returned again and called me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Do not tell us what he said, I beg that the other witnesses<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250113"/> may go out of Court. - Hyde came in again, and when she came in again, we challenged her with stealing this piece of cotton, my young man said, I will take my oath on it, that you have stole the cotton; I then said, do not make any piece of work about it, if you will give me the cotton, I shall make no more piece of work abo ut it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, he has said that he had first promised her, and afterwards threatened her, any thing she said under that impression cannot be taken.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you find any thing in her custody? - No, when my lad was gone for a constable, then she said, she believed -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship will not hear that, I object to any thing that she said being now given in evidence, because it is under that impression of the two things that the law says perfectly invalidates the evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when the things were found? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Hyde told the other to stay there till she came back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And she went out not followed by any body, and with perfect liberty to have gone anywhere she pleased? - My young man followed her.</p>
               <p>He did not at all interupt her? - No.</p>
               <p>And she came back voluntarily? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said there was another woman in the shop, and that she was in their company; how did you happen to know that, as she went out when you came in? - My servant told me so, I could not see it if I was not there.</p>
               <p>No, but you should have told the Court so then, that your opinion was formed on conjecture and hearsay.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know whether this conversation that passed between the prosecutor and her, after the constable had been sent for, was in consequence of his promise, for she had absolutely rejected the benefit that he would have given her from that proposition.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it is very far from being my wish to trouble the Court, but I submit this is a continuation of the conversation.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not my wish to press any thing against the prisoner.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to the prosecutor, I know both the prisoners, on Thursday last they both came into my master's shop to purchase some linen, it was about four o'clock, I shewed them several linens, they enquired for cottons for a gown, at last Hyde said she wanted to buy a gown for the shortest, I shewed her several pieces, there was another woman in the shop at the time they came in, which they knew, the other woman was there before they came in, they spoke to each other as acquaintance, she said, she was come to buy a gown for the short one who was going to place that night, the other woman had purchased same goods, I shewed them several; I thought I saw the tallest of them endeavouring to take a piece from the bottom, I looked over, she then desisted and pulled a piece nearer to her, that I could not see what she was doing underneath, they then both turned away from the counter, and one asked the other for a handkerchief, she had bought one piece, they both bargained for that, they did not pay for it then; I then thought they had taken the piece that I saw her endeavouring to take.</p>
               <p>How many might there be in the parcel you shewed them? - Twenty or thirty, she went out, and I followed her, I did not stop to see whether she had taken the cotton or not, she went into the silk-dyer's, I ran back immediately; it was about four doors from us, I went after her again, she was gone from the silk-dyer's, and when I came back to our shop, I found her just returned, and buying some muslin, she wanted to pay for it, and seemed rather confused, as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250114"/> thought at least; I then looked the cottons over again and examined them, and was quite positive that it was gone, she wanted to pay for that piece that she had fixed on, I told Mr. Broome what I had suspected, she paid for the muslin, and as she went out I stopped her, she said, she knew nothing of it nor of the other woman, only as a slight acquaintance, we told her then, if she would confess and tell us where it was, so that we might have our linen again, we should trouble ourselves nothing about it, we repeated it several times, she offered to be searched, she positively denied it, we then sent for a constable, it was near half an hour before we could fine one; she then said -</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am again obliged to trouble your Lordship, whether you would hear what the woman said, this evidence confirms his master, that first of all there was an attempt to get at some confession from her, by promising her, that if she would tell where the goods were, she should not be hurt, then upon her still persisting, they have recourse to the other implement by which confessions are extorted, namely threats; now I submit to your Lordship, that upon either of these grounds the evidence is not admissible: In a very late case I took this objection, and the Court held without a doubt, that the evidence under these circumstances was not admissible, the man was tried for robbing Messrs. Prescot and Grotes of a Bank post-bill, the defendant told a story, to which the witness said, that is very unsatisfactory; And unless you tell me a more satisfactory story, I shall send for a constable; under those circumstances, and under the terror of that threat, the prisoner made a very ample confession, the witness was going to disclose that confession, I took the objection, and the Court held most clearly without the smallest doubt, that it could not be received, for that, that engine had been employed, as in this case, with this addition in this case, that this woman was acting under the same impression from the beginning, and therefore I submit with the greatest deference to the Court, ( as I cannot in my mind separate the two impressions that were made on the mind of that woman,) that the Court, in a case of life, will not suffer this confession to be received.</p>
               <p>Court. I think we cannot receive this confession, but any acts that were done afterwards may be received in evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Whatever acts are done are evidence, but if those acts are not sufficient to make out the caseagainst the prisoner; you are not to hear her conversation or confession, so as to couple it with those acts. I tried a prisoner where the evidence was just as it is here, and I stopped all the witnesses when they came to the confession: the prisoner was acquitted; there were two learned Judges on the bench, who told me that though what the prisoner said was not evidence, any facts that arose afterwards must be received; and tho' that did not affect the case of the prisoner then at the bar, it was stated afterwards to all the Judges, and that was the line drawn; though you will not receive the confession or declarations of prisoners made under such impressions, yet the acts done afterwards may be received.</p>
               <p>Court to Barber. Was any thing done subsequent to this? did you go and find this printed cotton any where? - Yes, I found it at the chandler's shop in James-street, Hay-market.</p>
               <p>(The cotton produced and deposed to by the shop mark.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that linen amongst the parcel of linen you shewed the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There was a woman in the shop before these women came in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had the first woman been gone before Hyde went out of the shop? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you after that woman went away, observed that identical piece of linen there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250115"/>Why you have told my Lord that there were thirty pieces of linen? - This was at the bottom, I can swear it positively, they were dark linens I shewed her, and this was a very light one.</p>
               <p>Did you observe that identical piece of linen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were these 30 whole pieces or remnants? - Some whole pieces, and some remnants.</p>
               <p>What is the distance of this chandler's shop? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>The first woman might have carried it to the chandler's shop herself? - This piece was not taken down till after the other woman went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Why, they were laying on the compter? - No, that I remember.</p>
               <p>I wish you would remember this, that this is a case that affects the lives of two prisoners by your evidence, Mr. Barber? - There were several things laying on the counter.</p>
               <p>Aye, so many things that you could not then distinguish the one from the other, though you now affect to say that you could distinguish. - I can take my oath that I saw her hand on it, taking it from the rest; I am sure I saw her hand on it.</p>
               <p>And on that identical piece? - Yes, I can swear that the others were all dark.</p>
               <p>You did not follow this woman into the chandler's shop? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not interrupt her in her walk to the silk dyer's? - No.</p>
               <p>You took a traverse through a number of other streets, and then found the woman in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And she told the other woman to stay there? - Yes, I told her that I supposed she must have given it to the other woman.</p>

               <p>Court. He did not see her take it, but he saw her attempting to take it, and in all probability it was taken at that time; there is sufficient foundation on the evidence to think that it was.</p>

               <p>Did he converse with any body in the coffee room? - Not any gentleman, Sir, he spoke to me and my mistress; as we had had some suspicion of him I went upon the stairs, to give him an opportunity in case there was any thing in his way to take, there is a glass door to the stairs, and I could see into the coffee room, and I saw him walk up to the table called No. 5, at the far corner of the room from the bar, there were some newspapers laying on the table, that I saw him turn over, and there was a bason standing there that a gentleman had been having some soup, and a spoon in the bason.</p>
               <p>Could you see the spoon in the bason from where he was? - Yes, I saw him take the spoon from the table, and he walked away towards the street door, I went that way intending to stop him, and my mistress caught hold of his coat-sleeves, and the spoon was taken from him; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>The spoon produced and deposed to, marked T. M. P.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. He went to the table for these newspapers and turned them over? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Much company in the room? - No.</p>

               <p>Had he any soup that day? - No.</p>

               <p>I saw the two prisoners carry some lead into a shop where they buy iron, it was about eight o'clock on Sunday night last was three weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know where they got this lead? - No, I do not, there were eight different people came to see after it, and neither of them knew it.</p>
               <p>You do not know of any person that had lost any lead? - No, I do not know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an indictment for stealing lead, the property of a person unknown; now I take it clearly, that to support such an indictment as that, though you cannot identify the lead, yet you must prove that some person has lost lead; there has been a felony committed in stealing the lead, but then it cannot be proved that it is the same lead that was found on the prisoner; and I take it to be clear law, that you must lay a foundation that some one has had lead stolen from them, but as there is no evidence of that kind, there is no foundation for this indictment.</p>

               <p>Court. When the coat was fitted on, who carried it? - He carried it under his arm, he went into the public house at one door, and out at another.</p>
               <p>You did not follow him in? - No, I saw him about a week after, the great coat was found at the pawnbroker's, I was to bring back the money.</p>
               <p>Did any thing more pass about the payment? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Was you present at the time that the prisoner bargained for the coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell us the agreement as near as you can recollect? - As near as I can recollect, my master said twelve shillings was the price of the coat, and he agreed to give twelve shillings for it; and my master solded it up.</p>
               <p>Did he put his hand into his pocket? - He did, and said he had not money enough to pay for it, but if my master would let one of his men step with it, he would send the money back.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he offer to pay any part of the money? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I never saw the prisoner before he brought the coat, he was in a different plight then.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you the coat here? - It has been brought to Hicks's Hall.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You will be under the necessity, in this case, of acquitting the prisoner on a point of law, because it turns out on the evidence of the two first witnesses, that the man came in for this great coat, was fitted with it, and that the prosecutor gave the possession of this coat to the prisoner; the prisoner took it away and not the servant, the prisoner promising to pay for it; the prosecutor gave the prisoner compleatly in law a possession of the great coat, upon the usual promise of paying for it; however, being once in legal possession of it, though he did not pay for it, there is a legal remedy which must be against the prisoner by action, but certainly this indictment cannot be maintained on account of the property being vested in the prisoner by that bargain, and there being no property in the prosecutor: you will therefore be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250120"/> under the necessity of acquitting the prisoner.</p>

               <p>On Saturday night the 7th of February, I was sitting in my parlour, about seven o'clock, and I heard a smash of my windows, in the parlour adjoining to my shop, and I jumped up, and leaped over the table, I knew the door was tied, and by main strength I broke the cords which tied it, one was tied round the door, and one was tied round the iron rails; as I have been at sea myself, I knew it must be a sailor that tied it; I flew out into the street, and run up the street; there were numbers of people that cried, there he is; I heard his footsteps, but there were several people between him and me; when I came to the corner, the back of Burlington Gardens, it being then quite open and light from the snow underneath, I saw the prisoner at the bar running, at the corner of Lady Grosvenor's house, turning from Bond-street towards Saville-row.</p>
               <p>Court. How far had you gone from your own door when you saw him? - I suppose it is one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>The man you saw running you pursued? - Yes, one of the witnesses, a little boy, endeavoured to throw him down, instead of falling down, he threw the stockings down under his knees; he turned clear of him, and run into my arms; I saw him throw something down, a chairman that was coming by caught hold of him; at the same time a pair of stockings were picked up by the boy, and two pair more were picked up by other people.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He used very abusive language.</p>
               <p>Was any body running by him? - No.</p>

               <p>Court to Mitchell. What time was it you lost it? - Within ten minutes of six.</p>
               <p>Lee. I was in the parlour when he came into the shop, I asked him what he wanted, he asked me whether I wanted to buy some onion seed, I asked him how much he had, he said it was there, he bought it for six shillings, it was a sack; then I looked at it, and bought it, I did not know whether it was onion seed or leek seed; I asked him what he must have for it; he said, he gave six shillings for it; I said, will seven shillings satisfy you, I said I do not know any thing about it, you must leave it till morning; he said, he wanted a little money, I told him I could give him a little trifle of money if he wanted, but he must leave it till morning; I gave him four shillings, as my master was not at home; he called in the morning before my master was up, and I gave him three shillings more, and told him he must call again, for my master had not looked at it, and I did not know any thing about it, nor what it was worth; as soon as my master got up, I gave him some of the seed to look at, he immediately told me it was stolen; I then shewed him the sack, he said the sack was Mr. Field's sack, or had been so; the prisoner called again at night, and before that a hand bill came in; when he came again I stopped him; he said he bought it of a man, but he did not know him; my master told me it was worth ten or eleven pounds; in the morning I carried down the sack to Mr. Field's, I delivered it to one of the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Who saw you deliver it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What evidence have you to prove the identity of the seed? - We can only swear to the sack.</p>

               <p>We published some hand-bills, and dispersed them about, and in about half an hour after, Mr. White sent to inform us that his man had taken in such a quantity of onion seed, my partner brought it down to our house, there it was put by; about seven in the evening a message came from Mr. White, informing us that the man had called for the sack and they had detained him, then the sack was taken before Justice Staples and deposed to.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body here that was present when the sack was brought to your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Lee. Did you mark the sack? - I took notice of it, that I can swear to it; there is a little f on it.</p>
               <p>Should you know it from another sack of Mr. Field's? - I never saw another.</p>

               <p>I delivered 56 lb. weight of onion seed to Mr. Field's servant, on the 19th of February; it was in a hempen sack, marked with a small f about the middle of the sack; it is impossible to know the seed from other onion seed.</p>
               <p>Jury. Could you know that sack from any other? - I do not know that I could.</p>

               <p>I bought it this very day week, and gave six shillings for it in Red Lion-street, of a countryman in a brown frock, I took it to Mr. White's, and he untied the sack and chewed some of it; says he, it is not good for much, but I will give you seven shillings for it, he gave me four shillings for it in part of payment; he told me to come in the morning for three shillings more, and he told me to call on the Friday evening, between six and seven, and I should have another sack in the stead of it; I called and he stopped me.</p>

               <p>I only know that we lost this quantity of handkerchiefs, on the 27th of January, they came in the 22d, I have the bill of parcels from Mess. Ashmore, Badger, and Keelings, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Do you know, of your own knowledge, how many the parcel contained? - No, only by the bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>Had any been sold of that parcel? - None had been sold.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because in looking them over we found them all there, we keep a till book, I in general keep it, sometimes Mr. Turner keeps it.</p>
               <p>Does not he sell in your absence? - He did not sell any.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because there is none in the book, we missed them the 28th, we missed eleven, we never missed them nor examined them till these handkerchiefs were brought to us by Catchpole, the parcel had been opened, and they were all put at the end of the counter, there were none sold because none were entered in the book.</p>
               <p>What number remained? - I cannot recollect, now all the others were there.</p>
               <p>How many are there? - I cannot recollect, it is here in the bill of parcels, what are there we had, I compared them the 28th, when the others were brought.</p>
               <p>Is that the bill of parcels you examined them by? - No.</p>
               <p>Where is that bill of parcels? - That is destroyed.</p>
               <p>Who destroyed it? - Mr. Badger's people, it was returned there with fourteen handkerchiefs that we did not like, then we had a fresh bill of parcels of the remainder.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250126"/>Were these handkerchiefs stolen before you returned the fourteen or after? - Before.</p>
               <p>Therefore you parted with the original bill of parcels since these handkerchiefs came back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Badger. What did you do with the bill of parcels that you got back? - I cannot say, I did not receive the handkerchiefs back myself, some people belonging to our house did, but who I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Can you speak to the number you sold to Mr. Turner? - Yes, it was four dozen and ten of that number and mark; and two dozen of that number and mark were returned according to our book.</p>
               <p>How many are there? - There are twelve of them, but they are marked for eleven.</p>
               <p>Court. These are them that you sold to Mr. Turner? - On the 22d, I sold him four dozen and ten, they had this mark and number; as to being the identical handkerchiefs, I cannot say, two dozen of them were returned.</p>
               <p>Court to Richardson. Have you brought your books here? - I have brought the till-book of what we sell in the course of the day.</p>

               <p>But you cannot tell the number that remained? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you examine the goods when they came in? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. If the evidence amounted to this, that a certain number had been sold by Mr. Badger to Mr. Turner, and that all that number remained except these, and that no such parcel appeared to have been sold, that would be evidence to be left to your consideration, but there is no evidence that all the rest remained.</p>
               <p>Jury. You are not sure you ever had such a quantity, you never examined them when they came into your house? - No, not till the 28th.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot supply the defects of evidence, it is the prosecutor's business to lay evidence before the Court.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. I think it is very doubtful whether the box coat, or any part of the clothes of the coachman, can be considered as any part of the proper furniture of the stable; which the Judges have generally held to be necessary, so as to have the protection of the strict law: now the bridles, saddles, horsecloths, boxcloths, &amp;c. are the proper furniture; therefore I think you will be very well justified in acquitting the prisoner of that particular penal clause, which makes it a capital offence, that is, its being stolen privately in the stable.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys. Give the Court a full account of what passed between the prisoner and you when she gave you the fifteen guineas? - The constable came and demanded it of me, the prisoner had given it me before.</p>

               <p>Court to Snow. How much in fact do you know, of your own knowledge, the prisoner was ever possessed of? - She had forty pounds and upwards when she came away from Chatham, I know that myself, I sold all the things off myself, and I know she received the money; besides she received interest money at the Bank, and there is a house let for four guineas a year, and here is her wages still increasing, which she must in the whole have upwards of sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How long did this young woman live with you? - Four months?</p>

               <p>Perhaps you know the spending of that money as well as the taking of it? - I cannot tell what became of it.</p>
               <p>Where has she lived from that time to this? - She was a twelve month with Mrs. Tuthill, in town all the time.</p>
               <p>How long was it after she received the forty pounds, that she came to London? - In the course of three or four days, she had then her own private property of twenty pounds, or upwards; she remained at this Mrs. Tuthill's house, where I was a lodger, I believe she lodged there near a twelvemonth; I do not suppose it cost her one shilling a week, I found her every thing myself, except bread and lodging, then you may judge; two shillings a week at most.</p>

               <p>And had you heard her talk of this? - Yes, they make a common talk of their business, they never make any secret.</p>
               <p>And do you harbour such people? - She told me she had come out of gaol, and never intended to do any thing of the kind again; she had been a fine in Tothillfields, I followed and missed of her; I went into Short's Gardens, and she was not there, and she turned down an alley, and I stood in the street till I saw her; I saw her at the further end of the street, and when she saw me, she ran away, and we took her to the publican's house, and we went to that cellar, and there we found this pewter, and this skellet, but no pots.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - Close by St. Giles's workhouse.</p>
               <p>You keep a common lodging house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the criminality and danger of the conduct you have described in yourself, in receiving and harbouring in your house, people that make a habit of stealing? - She never had laid in my house before, I have had several of them taken up in the neighbourhood, since I have lived there; I never would encourage such a thing.</p>
               <p>Do you know that you are liable to be indicted as an accessary, for harbouring and receiving a selon? - We cannot be answerable for strangers that we do not know.</p>
               <p>No, but you can for people that you do know; now, by your own account, you knew this woman to be a thief before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Only let me warn you, that the very account you have given yourself now, if it had been given by another witness, would have made you liable to have been convicted as an accessary, therefore, take warning. - My Lord, I detest them, I will take warning.</p>

               <p>Are not these very fine clothes for a carpenter, very fine things with silk linings? - I do not know, they were given to me to put by.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure as to them? - Quite sure.</p>
               <p>How lately had you seen them before the prisoner was taken up? - I had not seen them a great while before, I put them in the chest, not locked, but my door was always locked, and I always found it locked.</p>
               <p>You lodge in the house of the prisoner's mother? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you occupy six rooms; - Yes, I could not get a licence, because it was reported it was such a bad house; it is not a public house now.</p>
               <p>Was it licensed before? - Yes, for many years.</p>
               <p>But when you and your husband, people of the first morality and virtue, went there, you could not get a licence? - Upon the account of the people that lives in it, the justices would not licence it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where did you apprehend the prisoner? - At his mother's, at his lodgings, where these things were taken out.</p>

               <p>I asked you a plain question, I only wanted an answer to it; you went to the pawnbroker's? - I found the duplicate in the prisoner's purse.</p>
               <p>Yes, and you took the purse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you took the purse out, the man wanted his duplicate back again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He liked it a good deal better in his own hands than in your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is it to the justice's? - A mile.</p>
               <p>How did you go there? - Upon my legs.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Mr. Birne's a pawnbroker, that duplicate is my hand writing, on the 27th of January, the prisoner brought the clothes to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the man before that brought them? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You have a great many people I dare say come to you in the course of business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I wish you would look at the prisoner, and tell the Jury whether you are satisfied that he is the man? - I am quite clear, I have no doubt about it, I saw him since at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>(The coat and waistcoat produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many more gentlemen of your description does Mr. Birne retain? - His son and a boy.</p>
               <p>After you had this coat and waistcoat in, what did you do with it? - It was put in the warehouse, I billed it and booked it.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you put it into the warehouse? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Then I am right in supposing that for ought you know you left it on the counter? - Perhaps I might.</p>
               <p>Perhaps then it might have been removed by somebody in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The duplicate itself contains no description of the coat or waistcoat? - It does not.</p>
               <p>By what do you affect to identify the prisoner? - When he came I objected to taking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250135"/> them, I thought the coat too fine with a silk ining, I asked him whose coat and waistcoat it was, he said it was his own, he said, he was a bricklayer by trade, and had been out of work some time, and if I doubted it, he would try them on, but they appeared to be his size; and I knew him again at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>My question is, by what do you pretend to swear that that is the man that gave you the coat and waistcoat? -By his being some time in the shop, and my saying these things to him; we have a vast number of people.</p>
               <p>What size is your shop? - Rather a large shop and a pretty large window.</p>
               <p>And something hung up in it that obscures it a little? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is your shop cupboarded off n the old style? - You mean those places that people come in that do not chuse to be exposed.</p>
               <p>Yes, how many of those places have you? - Three.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come into one of those places? - Yes, but there was light enough, I suppose he was in the shop ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Do not suppose, but swear something about it, will you swear he was there five minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear to ten? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw the man before in the whole course of your life? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>And you first saw him afterwards at the Justice's in the character of a felon, charged with this offence, and were told a duplicate had been found upon him? - I immediately recollected the prisoner.</p>
               <p>If you had met that man in Fleet-market on the day you saw him at the Justice's, should you have known him? - I should have recollected he was one of my customers.</p>
               <p>Court. The moment they applied for these things did you immediately fetch this coat and waistcoat? - I sent the boy for them.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time recollect that these were the things that were pawned by the prisoner? - I did not then immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You do not universally give duplicates? - No.</p>
               <p>They pay you for them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do people that pledge things that are stolen take duplicates? - Sometimes.</p>

               <p>What quantity? - I have the quantity with me, I have not weighed it, it may be seven or eight ounces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for the Prisoner. It was a part of the business of the man at the bar to put on the bridges of the buckles? - Certainly, among the rest.</p>
               <p>There were several other men who worked in the same place with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now is it by any means unusual to put them in their pockets? - They have no business to put them in their pockets.</p>
               <p>This man was going to get his breakfast? - Yes, he said he was, it was not nine o'clock, he had his coat on, and his hat on, his great coat was in the shop.</p>
               <p>You cannot swear to the small pieces of silver? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you find any plate at his apartments? - No.</p>
               <p>Describe the situation in which this peep-hole was, that you watched the prisoner through? - At the top of the stairs, there had been a door, there was only a wainscot that parted the shop from the stairs, I took down a board.</p>
               <p>I should suppose that the window of the work-shop faced the peep-hole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The man was between you and the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose the men worked with their faces to the light? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Consequently the men were between you and the window, now I want to know whether you can see through a man, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250138"/> is my short question, because this man was standing with his back to you? - He did, but not when he put the bridges in his pocket.</p>
               <p>When he was forging them down he stood with his back to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He told you after, that for the purpose of multiplying bridges he had forged them down? - He did.</p>
               <p>Then he would be to account for so many as he had multiplyed them into? - Certainly, but no man does account.</p>
               <p>You had no reason before to doubt of his being an honest man? - No, only my general suspicion of all my shop.</p>
               <p>You said your defect consisted chiefly of filings? - Of filings and bridges.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I searched the left-hand breeches pocket of the prisoner, and found nothing but money, I felt his waistcoat pockets, and found they were worn out, and could hold nothing, I came to his right-hand breeches pocket, and was going to put my hand in, he pushed my hand away, stop says he, and he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out the silver, and gave it into my hands.</p>
               <p>How many bridges are there? - There is two bridges no way deficient, there is another bridge that is hammered and doubled to.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing? - I searched him in every other pocket, and Mr. Lycett then said, give them into my charge, and the man said, he did not intend to take them away.</p>
               <p>Did you search his lodgings? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Of what use are the other pieces of silver? - Of no use but to work.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner asked to speak with me in the parlour and he told me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say any thing to him before he spoke to you? - No. I had given charge of him, and was going up stairs.</p>
               <p>When you went into the parlour, did you speak to him first? - No, he spoke to me, he said it was the first time, and he hoped I would have mercy on him, I turned away from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe you attended afterwards at the Rotation Office in Clerkenwell Green? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the justice there what had passed in the parlour? - I believe I did; this bridge is one of them that Mr. Terry marked; this is one that I marked. (The bridge deposed to).</p>
               <p>Recollect a little, because it is of some consequence to the defendant, whether you told the justice what had passed in the parlour? - I cannot be sure whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Aye, but you must endeavour to recollect yourself, because you know it is a subsequent fact to that? - I cannot charge my memory whether I did or did not; I mentioned it before Sir Sampson Wright at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it at Clerkenwell-green? - If I did not, my partner did.</p>

               <p>What he was spokesman? - Any body was spokesman, we were insulted in the face of the Court.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell me, yea or no, that you did say so? - I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not? - No, by no means, nor I cannot swear that I did.</p>
               <p>In consequence of the examination that took place at the Rotation Office, this man was discharged? - He was.</p>
               <p>And afterwards he was taken up by a new warrant and carried to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There you told the story of the parlour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Be so good to recollect exactly, and state it in words, what passed between him and you in the parlour? - He said, I wish to speak to my master; I came down stairs, and went with him to the parlour, and he said it is the first time, I hope you will have compassion or mercy; I turned round from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250139"/>Had not you at that time said, compassion! why you have stole my plate? - I need not tell him that.</p>
               <p>Had you told him that he had stole it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then this expression might mean this, have compassion on my character, perhaps he meant that? - I told the men that we had been robbed to a very considerable amount, and that it must be some men in the shop; he did not tell me then that he had any silver in his pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

            ? - Very well.</p>
               <p>When did she die? - On Saturday the 24th of January.</p>
               <p>When did you know of her death? - I knew that morning, I was the person that first saw her.</p>
               <p>Where did you see her? - I saw her in the cellar, she had tambled out of the bed in a fit I imagine.</p>
               <p>Do not tell us what you imagine, but describe the situation in which you first saw her? - When I first saw her she was on her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250140"/> knees, seemingly as if she had tumbled out of bed, with her under petticoat on.</p>
               <p>What time of the morning was it? - About ten.</p>
               <p>Was she leaning against any thing? - Her head might be against the wall, for ought I know; she was almost upon her face, her head either rested against the wall, or against something that was near the wall.</p>
               <p>How came you to go into the cellar? - Her mistress desired me to go down, she had called her, and she did not answer, only said, Hah!</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mrs. Wade had been down or not? - I do not know, I rather believe not.</p>
               <p>You do not know with certainty? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner at home? - No.</p>
               <p>When you saw her in that posture, did you speak to her, or go up to her? - I called to her, but she did not answer, and I lifted her upon the bed, and put a blanket over her.</p>
               <p>In what situation did she appear to you to be in when you lifted her upon the bed? - When I lifted her upon the bed, I thought she had been quite dead, but as soon as I lifted her up, she fetched a sigh; I put a blanket over her.</p>
               <p>Go on, and relate what you saw and what passed? - Then I was sent immediately for a doctor.</p>
               <p>Who sent you? - Mr. Gaunt, the parish officer.</p>
               <p>How came he there? - He came in just at the time, I had not been in I suppose a minute before he came.</p>
               <p>Did you bring a doctor? - I went to the doctor's house, and he said he would come immediately, and he did come in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - I think his name was Davis; I do not recollect his name.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - In Parliament-street, I think it is; he came, as I was informed, I do not recollect seeing him.</p>
               <p>What sort of a cellar was this? - A brick cellar, the bottom was done with bricks, it is a brick floor.</p>
               <p>What doors or windows has it? - One window and a door.</p>
               <p>What sort of a window? - A window fronting the street.</p>
               <p>But what sort of a window is it? - I believe it is a kind of flap to put down.</p>
               <p>Not a glazed window? - No, not a glazed window, it shuts down close with a flap.</p>
               <p>Have you observed it? - Yes, I have observed it.</p>
               <p>Was the floor of the cellar wet or dry? - It was wet, there was water in the cellar, which came in, I believe, at the spring tide.</p>
               <p>Where is Mr. Wade's house? - In <placeName id="t17840225-63-crimeloc343">Tufton-street, Westminster</placeName>

               <p>Was there a bed in the cellar? - There was a bed in the cellar that she laid on.</p>
               <p>How long had you lodged in this house? - About four or five days, I believe.</p>
               <p>Had the deceased laid in the cellar during that time? - I believe she did, I do not know perfectly.</p>
               <p>Was that bed laid on the floor, or on any bedstead? - It was laid on two rabbit hutches.</p>
               <p>What sort of things are those, describe them? - They are square things, like packing cases or boxes.</p>

               <p>What bedding was there on the bed? - There were two blankets, and I believe a sheet or coverlid, it was something white, I believe it was a quilt.</p>
               <p>You say you put a blanket over her when you laid her on the bed? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether that blanket was wet or dry? - No, I did not at all observe that in my fright, I cannot pretend to say whether it was wet or dry.</p>

               <p>Did you observe in what manner the prisoner behaved to this girl, or how she was treated in the family? - I never saw him treat her ill, the prisoner lodged at my house three months before he came to that house, and he had the apprentice then; he had left his shop that he lived in, and came to my house till he got another house.</p>
               <p>In what manner was the deceased treated in the family? - I never observed but what she was treated very well, during the time she was at my house.</p>
               <p>But during the time preceeding her death, that you lived in the prisoner's house, in what manner was she treated in the family? - I did not see any alteration, she seemed as usual.</p>
               <p>Speak at once, Sir, - I do not know that she was treated ill at all, she was treated very well for ought I know.</p>
               <p>You never observed any ill treatment? - I never observed any ill treatment; I met her the evening before in the passage, in the dusk of the evening, carrying a pail of water, but I do not know that I saw her after that evening.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular then? - No, nothing particular, she seemed to me as usual.</p>
               <p>In what manner was she fed in the family? - That I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Did you board in the house? - No, I did not, I had a wife and family who lodged there too.</p>
               <p>Were you usually at home at meal times? Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether this girl lived with the family, with Wade and his wife, or how she was victualled? - Why with Wade and his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250143"/>Have you ever seen her victualled with them? - Yes, at the other house I have.</p>

             this last four or five days, I confine myself to? - I do not recollect whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Where you at home at meal times? - Yes, at home I was, but I had no business in their apartments.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to observe them during these few days or not? - I do not recollect I did.</p>
               <p>What appearance had this girl for three or four days preceding the time of her death? - I did not see any thing particular the matter with her, she looked fresh and well in the face as she always did.</p>
               <p>Did she look reduced in flesh? - I did not observe she did.</p>
               <p>Did she then look fresh and well in the face? - She did.</p>
               <p>Now you saw the cellar, and the bed and bedding, as you have described it to us, from the appearance of it to you, taking all together, the cellar, the bed and bedding, did it seem to you as a fit place for any body to sleep in? - The bed was fit enough, but I do not say the cellar was a fit place for any body to sleep in, because of the water coming in.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the deceased complain of any ill treatment, or of any want of necessaries? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Council. This bed where she lay was three feet from the floor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If I understand right, this is a brick floor, and uneven? - I do not think it is even.</p>
               <p>Were these hutches where the floor was dry? - I do not know, but there was not much water there.</p>
               <p>Was that the driest part of the cellar? - Of the cellar it was.</p>
               <p>And this girl had never complained? - No.</p>
               <p>After the officers had been there, you, I believe, told the prisoner that you had heard them say, that he would be taken up for it, what did he say? - I told him of it.</p>
               <p>Did he go off? - He went off about his business, but he said he should not run away, for he had done nothing.</p>
               <p>Did you see the body afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any marks of violence?</p>
               <p>Court. There are no marks of violence charged in this indictment at all, the marks of violence are wholly out of the question; it is charged in the indictment, that intending to starve and kill the deceased, the prisoner did feloniously, and so on, neglect and refuse to allow and give, or permit and suffer to be allowed and given, to the said Constance, sufficient food, drink, and necessaries, to support her life; and did also neglect to provide and furnish, or permit and suffer to be provided and furnished, proper and wholesome lodging for the said Constance, but did force and compel her to be and remain in a damp and wet cellar, belonging to his said dwelling house, without proper and necessary bed and bedding, by means of which she languished and died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Had she at all the appearance of a person being starved? - Not in the least in her face.</p>
               <p>Now, as to the bed, there was sufficient bed and bedding? - There was for any person to lay in.</p>
               <p>The evening before, you saw her with a pail of water? - Yes, in the dusk of the evening, I met her in the passage.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any weakness then, particularly? - No, I did not observe any thing, she was about her work as usual.</p>
               <p>Jury. As you had a family in the house, what part of the house had you? - The one pair of stairs only.</p>
               <p>No part of the kitchen? - No, I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Court. What family had Wade? - A wife and two children.</p>
               <p>Had he any lodgers but you? - Yes, a man and his wife lodged in the garret.</p>
               <p>What rooms did the house consist of? - Only one room on each floor, two stories high; the ground floor consisted of the kitchen, then the parlour, then the one pair of stairs, then the two pair of stairs; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250144"/> one pair of stairs consisted of one room and a closet.</p>
               <p>Where did Wade and his family sleep? - In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Who slept in the two pair of stairs? - The other lodgers, a man and his wife, that was the garret.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You mean by the ground floor, the bottom floor where the girl lay? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The next floor is where Wade and his wife lay? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Is not the kitchen and the parlour level with the street? - The kitchen is not level with the street, the parlour is level with the street, it is under that.</p>
               <p>Where is the cellar? - It is the same.</p>

               <p>Do they cook their victuals in the cellar? - They do not cook their victuals there, it is a cellar or kitchen.</p>
               <p>What was there on the ground floor? - That cellar was on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Is not it under ground? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then why do you say it is upon the ground? - There must be ground below it.</p>
               <p>Do you think that a proper answer to give in a Court of Justice; do not you understand that that floor which is level with the ground, is called the ground floor, and that which is under ground is called the under ground floor. - The parlour is what I call the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Did Wade and his wife lay, and cook their victuals in the parlour? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you know any fact that has any connection with the subject of this charge, previous to the Saturday morning when you went to the house of Mr. Wade? - On the Thursday before, which is the 22d of January I was at the workhouse board, which we have in the parish every Thursday, and

             had spoiled two beds, and requested we would take the girl back, and exchange her for another; the board thought it rather an extraordinary request as well as myself, and they desired me to call and see the girl, in consequence of which, I called on the Saturday morning following.</p>
               <p>Was Wade himself at home? - No.</p>
               <p>Who did you see when you came there? - Mrs. Wade; I went, as it is a custom with me, generally of a Saturday, to go amongst the poor of the parish; accordingly, I appointed that morning to call, as the board desired me to call any morning between that and the Thursday following to report it; I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Wade came to the door; I asked if Mr. Wade was at home; she replied, no; says I, have not you a girl of the name of

            , your apprentice; yes, she said; says I, can I see her, where is she; in the cellar says she; says I, will you be so good to call her up and let me see her; yes, says she, but I believe she is not well.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner not being at home, we cannot take what his wife said as evidence; but in consequence of this conversation, did you go down into the cellar? - I did.</p>
               <p>Who did you find there? - Before I got down to the bottom of the cellar, I saw a person, which was Vaughan, with a candle in his hand, looking at the girl.</p>
               <p>In what situation was the girl at that time? - She was upon these rabbet hutches, I believe, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>What sort of things are the rabbet hutches? - I do not exactly know, they have been two old package boxes, or something of that kind; when I got down to the bottom of the stairs, Mr. Vaughan said, I believe the girl is dead; then I went to the bottom of the stairs, and I looked at her, says I, Good God! surely not; I suppose he and I stood about a minute, he with the candle in his hand, and the girl fetched a sigh; I said to Mr. Vaughan, go up stairs, and go for a doctor immediately; I wrote a note to Mr. Churchill, who is our apothecary,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Churchill, please to send Mr.</p>
               <p>"Jones, to No. 20, Tuston-street, immediately,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250145"/> "for there is a child dying." I went out of the house to see for Wade, I sent Vaughan off as I could, and asked Mrs. Wade where Wade was, if I could see him; she told me he was then in Tothill-street, baking his gingerbread; I called and asked if there was no woman to be got to take this girl up stairs; I desired her to take a dry blanket off the bed that was in the parlour, and carry it down stairs.</p>
               <p>What convenience was there for the girl to lay on? - I believe there was a bed and two blankets; these blankets were very damp and wet, I apprehend either from the girl herself, or from laying some part of them on the ground.</p>
               <p>Were they all damp and wet? - I felt the part that was just by the bedside, and that I suppose had got wet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether there was any sheet or coverlid, or any thing of that sort? - Upon my word, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did any physical man come? - this was all in I suppose two minutes; I asked, have you got no lodger to assist to get the girl up stairs to bed, that was in the floor they slept in, I called out, and at last a woman came down, and I told her to get some assistance and get the girl up stairs, which she did, in the mean time I went to see for Wade where I heard he was baking, I came there, he was not in the place, I ran immediately to the churchwarden, and desired him to come and look at the girl, before I returned they had got the girl up.</p>
               <p>The girl did not recover? - No; before I returned Mr. Jones had been there, and she was dead.</p>
               <p>When did you first see Wade? - He came home in the mean time, when I came back with the churchwarden, there was an inquisition called, and he remained at home, he was taken up in the evening.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the cellar in which this girl lay? - I did.</p>
               <p>From the observation that you made of it, and your own view of it, and the situation in which you found it, did it appear a proper place for any body to lay in? - I did not think so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate, another of Prisoner's Council. You found no obstruction in going down? - No.</p>
               <p>Not in the least? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you take any observation of the bed? - The bed seemed very wet.</p>
               <p>Was it a tolerable one of the kind? - Had it been in a proper place I presume the bed was pretty well for an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Wade remained at home all day? - I do not know, he was found at home.</p>
               <p>Had you received any complaint from the child in any part of the time of her having been with the prisoner? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Not at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had she been disposed of by the parish to the prisoner? - From the 20th of June.</p>
               <p>Are her parents alive? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You never received any complaint from her, or from any person on her behalf? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you know the deceased? - By frequent coming in and out of errands to my shop, she has more than once or twice asked me for bread.</p>
               <p>How long before she died? - Within the space of two or three days, as near as I can remember.</p>
               <p>What reason did she give you for asking for bread? - She said, she was hungry.</p>
               <p>How did she look? - She looked rather bloated in the face, fresh, but so very dirty that it was almost impossible to guess how she looked.</p>
               <p>Did you see her the day before she died? - I did, she was in my shop two or three times, before, and I observed of her that she shook very much, particularly her head, as if she had a palsy, which I thought proceeded from the violence of the cold weather.</p>
               <p>Did she make any complaint on that day of hunger or of cold? - Not to my knowledge, she did not complain to me, Mr. Wade had alledged so many complaints against the girl to me, that I spoke rather harsh to the girl, when she complained to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I believe you once advised him to beat her.</p>
               <p>Court. Surely that is not evidence, I have not questioned her as to the particular of what the girl said, for if she had given any account, or any relation to her of any thing done by her master, being at a time when she was in no apparent apprehension of death or danger of life, I should not think it admissible evidence, but I take the general fact that she complained of hunger, without relating from whence that proceeded, and the general fact of her master complaining against her to be evidence, but not the particular conversation from which that proceeded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What was his conduct towards the girl? - As to that I do not know, I never trouble my head with the neighbours, he had not been there above three weeks or a month, I do not know of my own knowledge, he told me he never struck her.</p>

               <p>Court. Then I do not think any evidence she can give can be admissible; do you happen to know of your own knowledge in what manner this girl was treated by her master? - All that I know about it, my Lord, is this, she came to me one day for two pounds of potatoes, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, after I had served her, I was dressing victuals, and she asked me for a bit of bread, and she said -</p>

               <p>Was Wade himself at home? - No, he was not, she appeared not well, she shook as though she had the ague, I says to Mrs. Wade, says I, Madam, you ought to get her something hot, she said, she would, but whether she did or not, I do not know, I saw no more that night, on the Saturday morning, there was a little girl came up to me, I was tired, and was in bed rather late, it was Mr. Vaughan's little girl, but I did know her, and she said there was a gentleman wanted me, I went down, and it was Mr. Gaunt, he asked me whether I lived in the house, and I told him, yes, and he desired me to do what I could for the child, for the child was very ill in the cellar; I went down, and he left two shillings, to get something hot to comfort her, the girl was not dead, she fetched breath, but her jaw fell as I stroked her, and her eyes flew open, I was so shocked I went to the chandler's shop, and got Mrs. Matthews to come and help me out of the cellar with the girl; she died immediately as I stroked her face with my hand, she just gave a gasp.</p>
               <p>Did you observe what sort of a place this was that she lay in? - I thought it was not a place fit for a Christian to lay in, it was a very cold damp place with water in it.</p>

               <p>Did you know her in the month of January? - No, Sir, I saw her the Sunday before she lost her life in Vine-street, all the particulars I know of her was in the month of December, she used to come three or four times a day to fetch water.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular about her, when she did come? - I thought every time she came she looked more miserable, and more like an object of pity.</p>
               <p>On what account did she appear so? - She was without shoes and stockings to her feet as you may call them, for there was neither sole to her shoes or foot to her stocking, I took notice of her one day particularly, I says to her, little girl, what makes you go in that way? one day she came in for a kettle of water, about three in the afternoon, the later end of December, I thought she had put the kettle into the hot liquor, and I told her not to do that, she said to me as this -</p>

               <p>ARCHDALE HARRIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you called on in February to view the body of the child, and when? - On the Saturday in the afternoon, the officers of the parish with some other gentlemen called upon me to desire me to go and view the body of the deceased, I did so.</p>
               <p>Did you take sufficient notice to form a competent judgment of the probable cause of her death? - My Lord, the body looked so well that I could see no reason to suspect any thing.</p>
               <p>That is to suspect any violence you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the general state of the body? - It seemed to be in a very good state: what you may say died in a healthy state.</p>
               <p>Was it much emaciated? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>As much in flesh as might reasonably be expected? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you open the body at all? - No, there was not the least reason for it, neither do I apprehend I should have got any additional information from opening it, it did not appear so to me.</p>
               <p>What appeared to you then from the inspection of the body, to have been the probable cause of her death? - I cannot say; if I had not heard of the circumstances, I should have thought she died a natural death, from the inspection of the body alone.</p>
               <p>Did it ever happen to you to examine the body of any person who died from the severity of the weather at any time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that kind of death attended with any particular appearances? - Very often upon the extremities.</p>
               <p>What are those appearances? - Very often a tendency of mortification in the extremities, frequently of the feet and the legs.</p>
               <p>Do you apprehend that tendency of morttification to be always visible, where the death has arisen from that cause? - I think so where it has seized on the extremities.</p>
               <p>Now was any such appearance visible of the body of this girl? - No such appearance.</p>
               <p>You have been in Court all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have heard the evidence of all the other witnesses, with respect to the place where this girl lay? - I saw the place.</p>
               <p>I wish you to describe the place? - It was a very bad place certainly, a damp cellar.</p>
               <p>From the appearance of that place, joined with the account you have heard of it from the other witnesses, do you think it likely that the laying in that place for four or five nights during the late severe weather, and preceeding the 23d of January, consistent with the appearance of the body, could be the cause of the death of the deceased? - There was no sign of it, therefore I cannot upon my oath say that it was the cause.</p>
               <p>Therefore I find you rather conceive that if the death of the deceased had proceeded from the damp and cold of that cellar, that it would have been likely to have produced some appearances that would have led to that suspicion? - I should think so my Lord, I should have expected some appearances.</p>
               <p>As a professional man, I would ask you, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250149"/> you think that the death arise from the immediate effect of the cold and damp? - I should have expected to have seen some marks of it upon her extremities.</p>
               <p>Now if a death is occasioned, and arises from any disease brought on by a damp and unwholesome place, will not that disease generally manifest itself for some time before the death? - I should think she would have had some apparent complaints before the death; I will explain myself a little more fully; it seems to me that where the cause of the death is the immediate effect of damp and cold, and it is a violent death by the severity of the weather, it is usually attended with such appearances as I have spoken of; but when the disease arises from the cold and damp, I should have expected it for some days preceding the death.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. If the death of the party is occasioned by any sudden fit, is it ever unattended with distortion of features? - Sudden death is frequently without distortion, in regard to convulsions it very often leaves a settlement in some parts of it.</p>
               <p>You did not open any part? - I did not perceive any purpose it would have answered, I do not apprehend it would have answered any; I did not think there was any cause at all that required it by the appearance of the body.</p>
               <p>Court to Vaughan. I think you said that the deceased had on an under petticoat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe where the rest of the clothes were? - I saw her gown hanging up just by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Mr. Harris, Did not you observe the bed was wet within side? - Yes, in several places, it looked as if it had been wetted by a person's laying on it, it was in a circular manner in several places.</p>
               <p>Court to Vaughan. How far was she from the bed when you found her that morning? - Tumbled down close to the feet of the bed, her head was the other way.</p>
               <p>Court. It does not appear to me in this case, that there is sufficient evidence that this was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, unless there is, it is no matter for the jury to judge upon.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, I do not wish to take up your time more than is necessary for the due and proper administration of justice on the one hand and on the other; I will therefore state to you now, how far this strikes me upon the evidence, and if you after that entertain any doubt in your minds, I will hear the prisoner's defence, and his witnesses, if he has any: the charge against the prisoner, is that of occasioning the death of the deceased by two means specified in the indictment, the first by refusing her the necessary assistance for the support of her life, and the second by neglecting to provide her with other proper accommodations, and forcing her to lay in a damp, wet, and unwholesome cellar, without proper and necessary bed, bedding, clothing and covering, which together are stated to be the cause of her death: Now, in point of law, I think the charge against the prisoner, though it contains no charge of actual personal violence, might clearly be supported by evidence that came up to the charge; and I think it right for the sake of the public, and the numerous persons that are attending here, to declare very fully and clearly that opinion; for it a person intrusted with the care of a young person, or any other, does by the refusal either of necessary assistance, or by any other severity, though not of a nature to produce immediate death, or by the putting them in such a situation as may be dangerous to their life and health, actually and clearly occasion the death of that party, I think in point of law it is murder; and I think further, that it is a murder of a worse kind, than many of those that are attended with greater personal violence, for this reason, that there is greater time in such a case, for deliberation and reflection, and it is never in a situation to be reduced to manslaughter, because it never can arise from any misconduct that can mitigate it: that being the nature of the charge and the law, it is for you to consider how far that is supported<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250150"/> in point of evidence, for in proportion to the malignity of the charge, ought to be the clearness of the evidence by which it is supported: now though I think it right to say for the same reason that I have declared my former opinion, that the conduct of the prisoner at the bar has been extremely reprehensible, and in my opinion highly criminal, in placing this unfortunate girl in such a situation, which certainly might have been the cause of her death; yet it is necessary in an indictment of this kind, in which the consequences are so extremely penal, not to throw it upon Courts and Juries, to presume away the life of the prisoner, but that the fact should be proved: and the first fact indispensably necessary to be proved is, that the fact imputed to the prisoner was the cause of the death of the party; that is the very foundation, for unless it is clearly proved that the fact, either of omission or commission was the actual, efficient and immediate cause of the death, it is to no purpose to enquire into the circumstances of it; and I shall, in the present state of the evidence, observe only, that though this conduct has been highly reprehensible, yet you ought, and certainly will divest your minds wholly of all prejudice, arising from your disapprobation of the prisoner's conduct, because you are to try coolly the evidence of the fact, and not to be satisfied with slighter evidence of that which is indispensably in point of law necessary to be proved; although the prisoner has conducted himself criminally, in a less degree, or although fortunately perhaps for him, that criminal conduct is not clearly proved to be the cause of the death: and you have the opinion of Mr. Harris, who is sent for, a man of character in his profession, selected by the parish officers, who in this case seem to have acted with great attention and propriety, for the purpose of making such an inspection as should enable him to form an opinion of the cause of the death of the deceased. Now the two circumstances imputed to the prisoner, are starving her, and compelling her to be in a wet and damp place, coupled with the severity of the weather; and as to the first of these, the evidence of Mr. Harris seems to put it out of all doubt; for whatever complaints the girl may from time to time have made of hunger (and it is not unlikely that she may have been hungry), she was not starved to death, and I think the state of her body, which he has told you, seems to exclude all possibility of that: therefore there is a clearing away of one of the causes assigned in this indictment for the death: the next is, that her death was occasioned by the place where she lay; and upon that also you have the opinion of Mr. Harris; now there are but two ways in which the damp and cold of a place of this kind, can occasion the death of a person; the one is by the unwholsomeness of that damp and cold producing some disease in the party, which in its event may be mortal, in which case the damp and unwholsomeness is the primary cause, and the disease produced by it, is the immediate and efficient cause of the death; the other way is, where the damp and cold operates so much on the party, and produces a chillness and a numbness, attended with a subsequent mortification; and Mr. Harris says it would have produced those appearances which usually attend a violent death of that kind, namely the appearances of a tendency to a mortification visible at the extremities: now although the prisoner's conduct not being the cause of the death, may rather be considered as good fortune, than innocence, yet there were no such appearances on the body; therefore it is Mr. Harris's opinion, that there was nothing on the body that would warrant him to pronounce, that the damp and cold were the immediate cause of the death; if indeed, the damp and cold were the primary cause, and brought on diseases, such as a fever, an ague, or other diseases, there would then be a visible disease for some time preceding the death of the party; now there is no such evidence of any visible disease, except the circumstance of the girl shivering with cold, which is a very likely fact, if there had not been those extraordinary circumstances</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250151"/>of misconduct; but there is no evidence before us of the actual existence of any such preceding disease: thus it stands on the evidence of Mr. Harris; but there is a circumstance which struck me at the time of the first examination of Vaughan, and which induced me to call him again, which was the circumstance of the situation in which the deceased was found; she was found upon her knees, and almost on her face leaning against the wall, as if she had fallen forward with her under petticoat on; I therefore called Mr. Vaughan, to ask him where the rest of her clothes were, and he stated that he did not recollect all, but he recollected that her gown was hanging up: now that seems to me to be a strong circumstance, for if she had perished either through the cold, or disease attended by the damp, she would most probably have perished in her bed; the effects of cold are to benumb, and if she had strength and exertion to get out of her bed and put on her clothes, that exertion would have been sufficient to have prevented her death from cold; but it seems she had got out of her bed and was proceeding to dress herself, and in that state she had fallen forwards: from the circumstance too of her being not quite dead, coupled with the time of the morning, it appears very probable that she could not have been very long in the situation in which she was found; it was then ten in the morning, therefore to be sure, the probability appears that this girl had been getting up in the morning, and beginning to dress herself; so that upon the whole, there does not appear to me to be any evidence before you, to warrant you upon your oaths to pronounce that which you must pronounce before you can go to the other facts; which is, that the facts imputed to the prisoner in this indictment were the cause of the death; if you have any doubt, and do not think the evidence you have heard sufficient to remove it, I will call on the prisoner for his defence.</p>

            : You have in this case had the good fortune, that your ill conduct, as I must call it, with respect to this unfortunate girl, has either not in fact been the cause of her death, or that there has not been sufficient evidence to prove it to be so; the effect is the same as to your acquittal here, for of that, of which there is no evidence, and of that which does not exist, the Court must form the same judgment; but it is my duty to repeat to you, what I have before stated to the Gentlemen of the Jury: that placing this young woman to sleep in that cellar, with but scanty provision in such a place where it was not fit for any person to sleep, and in such severe weather, was a conduct of great cruelty and criminality, and extremely likely to produce the death of this young woman, whether it actually did so or not: and therefore the feelings of your own mind on this occasion should not be those of a man acquitted from a full persuasion of the innocence and rectitude of his conduct, but of a man acquitted for want of sufficient evidence against him: I thought it proper to say thus much to you, and I hope it will make a proper impression on the future conduct of your life.</p>

               <p>Court. Was you sober? - I was not so sober as I am now indeed: I came home, I had not a farthing in the world.</p>
               <p>Court. You see the consequence of drinking so much? - There was nobody in company but her and I; I have had nothing to day but my tea and a pint of beer to my dinner; I lost nineteen shillings in all, but it was put down sixpence lower at the Justice's; I do not know the meaning of a warrant, God knows I do not, I have lost all my good time, I do not mean to hurt a hair of the prisoner's head.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is not necessary to take up your time by going on with this business, for if the prisoner has taken this money, still I think the indictment cannot be maintained, because there was no felonious taking whatever; for he tells you that he gave him the money, and gave him a compleat possession of it for weighing; but likewise he cannot identify the guinea other than by a bit of dirt, which is not sufficient, and it is very probable the prisoner might have another guinea in his pocket; but however that may be, I am clearly of opinion that there is no felonious taking whatever, and therefore you must acquit the defendant.</p>

               <p>Who went with you? - Roberts, a constable.</p>
               <p>Did your brother go with you? - No, he was left with the bag at the White Lyon; I think the prisoner's house is in Church-street St. Giles's, there I found fifteen sacks, and three bags, which are chiefly used for flour; we brought them all to the White Lyon, the prisoner was in the round house; Mr. Morgan came and saw the sacks and bags, and said they were his own property, I was present, they have been in possession of Mr. Morgan, with the constable's seal on them, one of them was half full of pollard, I did not observe the mark on them then, but some of them have Mr. Morgan's name at full length on them.</p>

               <p>Except as to this business, what was his character, if he had left you and had applied to you for a character, what character would you have given him? - I only can say in a few words, that he was the best servant I ever had in my life, I placed a great deal of confidence in him, he never lost me an hour when in health.</p>
               <p>Might it not happen, that this man, being in the employment of collecting of sacks, might have carried them to his own house, with a view afterwards to have brought them to yours? - Those fourteen sacks had not been in my possession for more than a twelve-month, nor of any of my servants to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Your business is very extensive? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you see the prisoner there? - I just came out of my master's gate, and he was coming out of my master's door, and he called to me; my master is a coach-wheeler.</p>

               <p>What was he to give you for this? - One time two-pence, and another time threepence halfpenny for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Did you carry a bag that night? - I had it on my back when I was taken.</p>
               <p>Where did you get that bag? - The prisoner gave it me on the outside of the door, the bag was full, but I do not know what it contained.</p>
               <p>How many times did you carry bags for the prisoner? - Three times, I think, I carried them to his house and set them down.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, till this unfortunate affair, I held the prisoner in the highest esteem, and he has a wife that now lays in, that was brought to bed a day or two ago, and has a family besides, I beg leave to recommend him to your lordship's mercy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I have no disposition whatever to be severe upon people, but you must consider we are bound to do our duty for the good of the public; and of all the offences that I have heard tried this sessions, I think this stands in the most flagitious light; a man whom you have shewn such indulgence to, one on whom you reposed such confidence, and whom you would have trusted to any extent, that he should be guilty of such an act of treachery as this, and it would be a very bad example indeed, to let him go unpunished; therefore, though for my own part, I feel as much as any man can do for the miserable condition that prisoners bring themselves into, yet it is necessary that such offenders should not go unpunished.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord it is merely out of humanity to the poor woman, and the situation she is in; I shall leave it to your Lordship.</p>

               <p>I am a hackney coachman, I drove Mrs. Osmond from the Old White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, and she had three trunks with her, two in my hackney coach, and one in the boot, I carried her to the end of Air-street, Piccadilly, to the boot-maker's.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that the trunk you put into your coach? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The trunk deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Court to Cumming. Did you take notice of the trunk? - Not then I did not.</p>
               <p>What passed after that? - She ordered me to let her out, and I took the little trunk and carried it into the shop, and she then ordered me to take a large trunk out of my boot and carry it in; this I left in the coach, when I was taking that other trunk out of the boot, I saw this prisoner, that very man, walk backwards and forwards by the side of my coach, and he went and stood about three or four yards behind the coach against the post, and when I was dragging this heavy trunk up the steps, I missed this man from the post, I had some suspicion, I took hold of the lady, says I, Madam, I should be much obliged to you to go and look at the coach; and as I came out, I heard a piece of work in the street, and the trunk was missing, I ran across Piccadilly down Eagle-street, and caught hold of the trunk, I am sure that is the trunk, I did not see it thrown down; I am sure the prisoner is the same man that was walking by my coach.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Reeve, Council for the Prosecution.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, Mr. Redgrave and I had information, that a cart was going the other side of the way in the Old Bailey to receive some copper; we came about two in the afternoon, and saw the cart set out from under the gateway and go across Smithfield; we then took a coach.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was with the cart? - Rothwell, the person who was tried.</p>
               <p>Nobody else? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he riding in the cart? - Yes, it was a little open cart; we took coach on the stand in Smithfield, and followed the cart to Muswell-hill; the cart stopped and went in at a pair of gates, which where opened on the ringing of a bell; we ordered the coachman then to go on that we might not be observed, and we came back to Islington, and there we waited to see if the cart came back the same way that evening; it returned a little after six, with Rothwell and the prisoner in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you seen the prisoner before that day? - No, I never saw him before, to my knowledge. Redgrave and me stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250168"/> the cart, and they both came out; we took them into the parlour at the Woolpack, a public house in Islington-road; Redgrave went out to take care of the cart; the prisoner finding I was left alone, attempted to get out of one door and Rothwell at the other, I held Rothwell fast, and the prisoner got out at the back door which goes into Gwynne's Buildings; we found in the cart a deal of cut copper, called cecil, and 20 l. in halfpence; the halfpence were carried to the Tower long since, some of them are here, which I have had ever since.</p>
               <p>(Four halfpence produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. Did you yourself take those four halfpence out of that cart? - Yes, I am confident they were in the cart.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you first get those halfpence? - Out of a butter basket that was in the cart, I took them out myself: Redgrave and me, and some others, went back to Muswell hill the same night, to this house, and there we found a cutting-out press, a stamping press, and several dies, and some blanks, and some halfpence, fresh made but not coloured; the press was standing as if for work, the dies in the press, and a halfpenny between the dies, we brought them away, and they were produced here; they are at the Tower now.</p>
               <p>Court. This charge must be maintained against the prisoner at the bar, and you must have the evidence here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Council for the Prosecution. My Lord, I should think it was sufficient for us, in the first instance, to produce the conviction of the principal, and it is incumbent on the prisoner to impeach it; the Jury must suppose that conviction is right; the record is sufficient for me, if the prisoner can prove that these halfpence were good halfpence, then he is not active in the committing the felony; the law requires that these things should be carried to the Tower, and immediately destroyed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Council for the Prisoner. My Lord, I submit if the record related to any thing relative to this man, he must contradict that in the best manner he can; but you must prove that there was a felony committed; the record proves it against the man himself that was a party, but not against this man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Till it is impeached the record is right.</p>
               <p>Court. I ground myself upon this; Mr. Justice Forster is of opinion, and very rightly, That if a man is indicted as accessary to a felony, the imputation of the felony to the principal is not sufficient to affect him, he has a right to controvert that felony; it may be an exceeding nice question to discuss this thoroughly, but here is sufficient evidence of the fact, independent of these dies, and these machines that this man found; if the prisoner is found coming from a house, with a cart, in which was contained a great quantity of counterfeit halfpence, that is a degree of evidence, in my apprehension, to lay before the Jury, accompanied with the conviction of Rothwell, whom he is indicted as counselling, aiding, and abetting; I should think that will be a degree of evidence for the Jury's consideration, without the production of the machines, and without deciding the other point; therefore I shall take no notice to the Jury of this evidence of finding the dies and these things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Where did you see the prisoner first? - Just by the Angel and the Bluecoat-boy, at Islington.</p>
               <p>Coming to town, or going from town? - Coming to town.</p>
               <p>In a cart with Rothwell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know where he was taken up then? - I do not.</p>
               <p>This was an open cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The halfpence, that you say were in it, were they in baskets or in bags? - They were in different things, they were not all in one thing.</p>
               <p>Where did they come to? - To the Woolpack, some yards lower.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know Rothwell? - I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250169"/>Then all that you can say is, that he was in the cart with Rothwell, and that you found these bad halfpence there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have never heard any thing of him since? - No.</p>

               <p>I was the other officer attending with Dinmore; I watched the cart to Muswell-hill, I saw it go in, then we went up to Highgate, and returned to Islington, and waited till the cart returned; I saw the prisoner with the other person in the cart together, we were at the One Ton, I was up stairs, they drove very fast, and I was obliged to run, and I overtook them at the Woolpack, then I told them to stop; Dinmore then came up to me, and they asked me what I wanted; I told them I had information they had some smuggled tea in the chaise; there was a hamper that one of them set his feet on, and there was some cecil in it.</p>
               <p>Court to the Monier of the Mint. Is that destroyed or not? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Redgrave. There was a seat in the chaise, and in it were two baskets of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any halfpence which were found in the cart with you here? - Yes, here is one.</p>
               <p>Were the rest of them like that? - All alike.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself see that halfpenny taken out of the parcel that were in the cart? - Yes, my Lord, we broke open one paper, and took them out for a sample, we opened them all, and they were all of that kind, they were in twenty shilling papers.</p>
               <p>How many were there? - I cannot recollect, we reckoned 20 l. in all; I run to the cart, and in the mean while the prisoner made his escape from Dinmore.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing when the prisoner was taken again? - Mr. Clarke received a letter from Scotland, that he had made his escape there, I was not at the taking of him.</p>
               <p>How long has he been in custody? - Above a month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What did you find at the house? - Every thing compleat, and some new halfpence that were not coloured; it is always usual to colour them after they are made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. What became of these dies and implements? - They were carried to the Tower.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I certainly may give evidence to what is found in a man's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. That is only introductory evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. If you give them in evidence, the Jury ought to see these instruments, unless they are gone, and that is not the case at all, because the gentleman who sits here tells me they are in a confused heap now existing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. The presses are never produced here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Always.</p>
               <p>Court. The law requires that there should be sufficient evidence, the Court and Jury are to judge whether the evidence is sufficient, you are to distinguish according to the crime, if it was for having a die or a stamping press in his custody, then you must produce them, because that is a specific charge, but they are to be produced here as so many circumstances of coining; but if you give evidence of these things, you must produce them; I do not think it is necessary to go that length.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My Lord, I should apprehend that they must produce that evidence that is sufficient to convict the prisoner, and it is fully in their power, and they have not accounted for it.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether they have produced evidence enough?</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My objection is that it was in their power to have produced evidence to shew that Rothwell was guilty of felony, and that the mere record is not sufficient.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You mistake the law, that record is sufficient at present to prove the conviction of the principal; you may impeach it if you can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. It is the conviction of another man, that this man is a stranger to.</p>

               <p>Who lived in that house? who inhabitted it? - One Prosser lived in it, and he let it to one Marston for half-a-guinea a week, but there were no writings drawn up.</p>
               <p>Where did the prisoner live himself? - I understood he lived there, he came to tell me he wanted to have a job of painting, I went to look at it, he let the house to Mr. Marston for half-a-guinea a week, that was a verbal agreement at a public house at Islington; I do not know where he lived afterwards, he took me to see the job, and Marston's wife was ill and wanted to go and live in the country, I never went after it afterwards, because I waited for an answer.</p>

               <p>Mr. Burdett, of Council for the Prosecution, thus opened the case.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury; although many prisoners have appeared before you in the course of this long sessions, indicted for offences, similar to that with which this prisoner stands now charged; yet I will venture to affirm, that not one of their cases has been accompanied with similar circumstances of ingratitude. The prisoner was left by her husband, who had gone to sea, with a young child at her breast, in very great distress; in the month of September last she contracted an acquaintance with the prosecutrix, and informed her of her unfortunate situation; and that she had no other way of subsistance, but by working at her needle, and having no acquaintance in town, she insinuated, that it would be a very great act of charity, if through the recommendation of the prosecutrix or her friends, she should get employed: upon this, the prosecutrix, who is a very poor <rs id="t17840225-90-viclabel465" type="occupation">widow</rs>

                  <interp inst="t17840225-90-crimeloc466" type="placeName" value="Prescot-street"/>

                        targets="t17840225-90-off463 t17840225-90-crimeloc466"/>, for forty years past, told the prisoner, that she should esteem herself very happy, if she could procure her any employment, which the prosecutrix promissed. In consequence of this encouragement, the prisoner called daily on the prosecutrix, and obtained from her, and through her means, both assistance and work; and soon after proposed to come and lodge with her: the prosecutrix being old and infirm, and not able to keep a servant, was willing to accept this offer, she having at that time a very sore leg, which confined her: accordingly the prisoner came to reside with the prosecutrix; but the prisoner had not been long there, before the prosecutrix missed several of her things; however, she had no suspicion of the prisoner at the bar, until she discovered the loss of a cloak, which she was very confident could be taken by no other person but the prisoner, nobody else having access to the place wherein that cloak was kept; upon this, she charged the prisoner with robbing her, and the prisoner being so charged, confessed she had taken it, and said she had only pawned it; this satisfied the prosecutrix, who imagined, that by shewing her some lenity on this occasion, it might cause her to confess, and return the rest of the things; but instead of that, in a very few days afterwards, one morning before the prosecutrix got up, the prisoner was rummaging for something under the bolster, and being asked by the prosecutrix what she was searching there for, she said, she was looking for her stockings about the bolster and bed; but after the prosecutrix got up, and came to put her hand in her pocket, she missed a guinea; and the same day, or the day after, she missed the remainder of those things, as stated in the indictment. The prosecutrix then told the prisoner, if she did not return her things, she would bring her before a magistrate: the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250172"/> prisoner promised to get them, but instead of doing so, she absconded for several days, and when found, it appeared she had hired herself as a servant to an attorney of Clement's-inn; she was upon this taken to Bow-street, when one of the prosecutrix's cloaks being found upon her, she was committed. Gentlemen, this is a short state of the facts, which will be proved on the part of the prosecutrix, against the prisoner at the bar, if I am rightly instructed; and if they are proved to your satisfaction, it is your duty to find the prisoner guilty; if these facts are not proved by the evidence we will produce, you must acquit her.</p>

               <p>I took in the prisoner out of charity to lodge with me the 12th of September, I have had no servant since my husband died, I took care of her child while she assisted me as a servant. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; when I was able to get out of my bed, and to go from one room to another, I went up stairs for some things; she did not want me to get up, she said it would hurt my leg to go up stairs, and advised me not, but I did go; I went to the chest to get a piece of callimanco out, and when I opened the chest, I missed a pair of new stays that were in the chest; when I came down she was sitting in the room, and had some small needle work by her; says I, where did you leave my stays; says she, in the chest; says I, they are not there; says I, is there two table cloths there? yes, says she; then, on St. Stephen's day, when the prisoner's child was buried, I went to put on my black silk cloak, and I asked her where it was; says she, it is in the drawer; says I, I cannot find it; says she, it was there not a quarter of an hour ago, let me look for it; says I, I can see as well as you; she laid her hand upon mine, says she, make yourself easy, Mrs. Richardson, do not put yourself into a passion, I know where it is, and that night she told me she had pawned it for three shillings, and a week after she said she had put it out for three shillings and sixpence, in the name of Brown; then I lost the sheets.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you, after missing all these things one after another, and she telling you that she had pawned some of them, to leave her in your house? - She only owned to the cloak; after she went away I missed the sheets, two shifts, and a shirt; I lost also a silver table spoon and a tea spoon, and a stewpan; she had my black silk cloak upon her when she was taken.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Would you ask this witness any questions? - I would rather ask the gentleman when he is examined, if your Lordship pleases.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>As the prisoner and two more were going out of our shop, I just stepped in, and my wife informed me a tea pot was stolen; I followed, and when we came to the end of White Hart-yard, they all stopped; the woman on my left hand, who was one of the three, took out two dishes from under her clothes, they were yellow dishes with blue edges; the prisoner at the bar was taking out a black tea pot from under her arm, and she dropped the cover of it; on hearing the cover fall, I offered my service to take it up, I told her I knew the pot was mine; she said, she only took it in a joke, and hoped I would not detain her, or words to that effect; I said, I certainly shall, it was a joke I could not dispense with, and I brought her to my house, and got a constable.</p>
               <p>Did you bring the tea pot with you? - I brought it in my hand, there is a selling mark upon it, of my own making, in red ink; the other two women made their escape; the value of the tea pot is one shilling, I did not get the dishes.</p>
               <p>Jury, looking at the tea pot. My Lord, the mark is of so simple a nature, it is a figure of one, any one can make such a mark as that.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they smartly dressed? - Very genteel, I could not have conceived it.</p>
               <p>Why did not you stop the others? - I confess I was flurried a good deal, I might not act with propriety.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you recollect whether I was rightly in my senses when you brought me back to the shop? - I should think you was not, or you would not have been guilty of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I mean to say, whether or no he could not perceive I had drank more that afternoon than had done me good?</p>
               <p>Court. That is no excuse at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took it back in my hand to the shop, but I would sooner have broke it.</p>
               <p>Court. I am sorry to hear a young woman of your age tell us, that you was so intoxicated you did not know what you did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This prosecution is for a thing of small value, but a person being in liquor is no excuse, for some of the lawyers tell you, that drunkenness being a voluntary crime, increases the guilt; but if a person had in a frolic taken such a thing, I think it would be too severe to construe it into a felony, and if you should take it in that light, it is possible you may acquit her.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. It has not been very usual to object to questions before they are heard; all I desired was, that the witness for the Crown, who is now sworn, might tell her own story, without being interrupted by me or that gentleman.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, the want of gravity comes from the witness, and not from me, I cannot help the Court laughing at the nonsense of the witness; I am instructed, that her husband is now in the gaol of Newgate, and is to receive mercy in consequence of this woman's evidence here. - Then you are instructed very wrong, I assure you.</p>

            . I do not see myself the impropriety of that question, because what that gentleman alledged last night in the case of Mrs. Rudd, with respect to the evidence of Mrs. Perreau, the Court refused to receive her evidence, because she thought the consequence would be, that her husband would receive mercy; and if this woman had now said, that the consequence of this man's conviction would be that her husband would receive mercy, it would have been material.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I believe the law is, that it cannot go to the competency of a witness; nor do I believe in that case that the Court refused Mrs. Perreau on that; I believe it was put to Mr. Bearcroft, whether he chose to examine her upon it or not.</p>
               <p>Court. If it went to her credit, the question was proper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you never in the custody of an officer before this time? - No.</p>
               <p>Never for receiving stolen goods? - I never did receive any stolen goods; there is several of the name.</p>
               <p>And you neither had paid for these things, nor had the three guineas to pay for them? - No, not quite.</p>
               <p>Pray Mrs. Levy, I am desired to ask you another question, give a serious answer upon your oath; has not your husband very recently been in custody for putting off bad guineas? - No, not bad guineas.</p>
               <p>For some offence about coining? - No, Sir, I will tell you; this was the second time that this man came; the first of this man's coming to me, he came with half a guinea, my husband was not at home, nor knew nothing at all about it; I told him when he came home, and I looked at it; says I, it is bad, and I would not have any thing at all to do with any bad money; he went away and came on the Monday; he asked me if my husband was at home, and I told him he was not; he bade me keep it, and he begged me to tell my husband to see if he could get any customers; on the Thursday, my husband took the half guinea, and went into that gentleman's shop to buy some tea and sugar, and that gentleman said it was bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your husband then was in custody, on a charge of having put off a bad half guinea? - He was in custody for having this half guinea.</p>
               <p>Your husband being in custody on this subject, you then laid this scheme to bring the prisoner to your house? - I could not, I did not know where he lived, he frequently came and brought me silver after he knew this.</p>
               <p>When was your husband discharged? - He was not discharged, he was bailed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. And he is now to be tried? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my Lord, I ask her the question in Mrs. Rudd's case; I ask you, upon your oath, whether you have not laid this scheme to bring that man here, for the purpose of bringing off your husband? - Upon my oath I have not.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect that the conviction of that man at the bar will prevent the prosecution of your husband? - I do not expect it.</p>
               <p>Do not you hope it? - I do not hope to convict any body.</p>
               <p>Do not you hope your husband will be discharged? - I do not suppose he will be discharged.</p>
               <p>Did you never say so to that gentleman? - I never said any thing to that gentleman.</p>

               <p>Did you never promise that gentleman to take the prisoner? - I never promised any body, I did not promise any such a thing, you want to persuade me that I told him things; there is as much honesty in me as there is in you.</p>
               <p>Have not you been told that your husband will be discharged? - I have told you several times that nobody has told me so.</p>
               <p>Have you, then I did not understand you. - Then I tell you so now.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect it will be better for your husband, if that man is convicted? - I do not expect any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it? - I believe very little about it, indeed.</p>
               <p>You are an unbeliever, is that the case? - Like yourself.</p>
               <p>I do not believe what you say, if you you mean that; where is your husband? - I must be a witch or a wizard to know where he is now, I have been here since nine this morning, he was in bed when I came out this morning; if you was on the bench, I am sure you would cast him right or wrong.</p>
               <p>Did not you lay this scheme to bring the prisoner to your house, that your husband might be discharged? - You could not blame me if I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. This man came to you with half a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he offer half a guinea for? - Eight shillings and sixpence, I paid him for that.</p>

            . If you cannot carry this matter any further than the evidence that is now adduced, I am of opinion it is not sufficient evidence, therefore it is the business of the Court to decide on that question, and if my brother Gould is of the same opinion with me, I shall not reserve this case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. It is your Lordship's wish as well as mine, that the determinations of the Court should be consistent, and that one day we should not reject evidence, which another we received; I do not believe there is an objection that can be stated by the ingenuity of man, but what has been taken, and has been considered; I defy the ingenuity of this gentleman to find a new objection; I remember this objection being taken, and taken by myself, and over-ruled; the answer to me has been this, the offence is compleat on the prisoner if he puts it off to you, and gives you the possession of it, he has done as much as in him lays; to do the subsequent part lays in the witness, to give the money; no one of the Gentlemen of the Jury would have have paid the money, but the moment he had possession of these counterfeit shillings, he would immediately have taken the prisoner up: I only wish we may know how far it is or is not evidence.</p>

            . If my brother Gould concurs with me, the man must be acquitted; but if he thinks it such a case as is proper for the consideration of all the Judges, it shall be reserved for their opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I concur that nothing can be more clear, than that the act must be done according to the terms of the act of Parliament, and whatever progress it may have made towards it, if it is not finally compleated and finished, it does not reach that crime: however it may be right to take every possible method to repress such pernicious practices as these, the Judges are bound not to stretch laws that are to affect the lives of their fellow subjects: I remember a case I tried at York, and I reserved it; it was an indictment for coining a guinea and a half-guinea; the guinea was struck between two dies, with the head and with the reverse compleat; it was then delivered by the coiner, (for there was actual proof of the fact itself, of its being delivered) to a person standing by, and the purpose of it was manifestly and unquestionably to go and get it changed; but in the state that it was delivered out, the edges were rough, and it would not pass; nobody would take it; nothing could be proved of what became of this piece of counterfeit money: the objection as it has struck my brother now occurred to me, that it was treason brought very near to completion, but not quite completed: I let the trial go on, I acquainted the late Mr. Wallace, a man very eminent and particularly so in the laws of this country; I said, I did not chuse to let this pass publicly in the hearing of this whole county, for Yorkshire was then very famed for this, and I reserved the case: the opinion of the Judges was, that I was right in my conception, that the piece not being compleatly finished, it did not amount to high treason. The act of Parliament in this case says, shall take, receive, pay, or put off: now take the common idea of that; a man comes to a tradesman to pay for a piece of goods, that he is buying in his shop, before the tradesman has delivered his goods he discovers this counterfeit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250179"/> money, the man intended and meant, if you please, to put off that money, but it had not its effect, it was stopped before it reached the goal; the legislature in my opinion upon the act of Parliament that occurred to me, have themselves decided this matter, in the act of the fifteenth and sixteenth of his late Majesty, there the offence, which I apprehend this amounts to is provided for; if any person after such a day shall offer or tender in payment any false or counterferfeit money, he shall be liable to be imprisoned for six months: this was offering and tendering this false money, and it would clearly come within that act of Parliament, but within the term pay or put off as it strikes my idea, it falls short of the import conveyed by those words, therefore I do concur in opinion with my brother Perryn; altho' it is said here at the bar, that this matter has passed several times here, and then we are told that all the ingenuity of council cannot invent a new objection, that there is no objection that could occur to the ingenuity of man, but has been started here and thoroughly discussed; I confess, I never heard a question of this kind before, therefore it comes to me purely and simply upon the terms of this act of Parliament, and if we are to understand these words not with a legal acceptation, but a vulgar acceptation, what does a man mean when he says I put off such a half-guinea? why, I have got rid of it; therefore we ought to refer to the natural acceptation of the term, and this evidence does not reach it: therefore I am of opinion that in point of law the offence is not proved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, that act of Parliament your Lordship mentions is for offering, or tendering in payment, as and for a good piece of legal coin, false money as good money; the objection would be, it cannot come within that act of Parliament, he does not utter it, or pay it as good money, he pays it as bad money.</p>

               <p>A Second Count, for putting off one piece of counterfeit milled money called a half-guinea, &amp;c. for eight shillings and sixpence, against the statute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester of Council for the Prosecution thus opened the case.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen; I did not think it right to mention this indictment, in the beginning of the former trial, because though I wish justice always to take place between the crown and the prisoner, I for one will never endeavour to prejudice the minds of the Jury; for which reason cautiously did I avoid it, nor did I suggest the least hint whatever of this offence, I wished that trial to turn on that simple fact of the shillings; the question now is, Whether the offence mentioned in this indictment, which has now been read to you, is, or is not compleat? because -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg Mrs. Levy may go out of Court while Mr. Sylvester is stating this.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250180"/>Mr. Sylvester. The character that has been given of the witness, Mrs. Levy, I believe she does not deserve; the way to affect witnesses, is to call people to impeach their testimony; you will judge what credit is due to her testimony, and whether it remains unimpeached. The story of this indictment she has pretty nearly told you on her cross-examination; as well as the former; that on the 29th of January the prisoner came to her, and wanted her husband to get some customer to buy counterfeit money; that one particular half guinea was left for some days, and that at last it was bought, and eight shillings and sixpence was paid for this half guinea; the husband going with this half guinea, and tendering it in payment as a good half guinea, because otherwise, in my opinion, it is no offence, the tradesman said, how did you come by this; then it was discovered that it came by this man, the prisoner; he had been traced by the officers of justice backwards and forwards to Levy's house; they watched him and took him into custody, and found a large quantity of counterfeit money upon him; in this case, the money was actually paid for the half guinea, therefore the offence was perfectly compleat, and if so, you must find the prisoner guilty. If on the other hand, the evidence should not be sufficient to reach him, or he has a clear defence to this accusation, I, for one, shall rejoice in his acquittal; and as to the Mint, although they think it their duty to stand forth to prosecute every offender, and to protect the public, they have no wish or inclination on either side of the question.</p>

               <p>The 29th of January was the first time the prisoner came to my house; he asked me if my husband was at home, that was this day five weeks, I cannot rightly tell the day of the month, I told him my husband was not at home, and I asked him his business, than he shewed me half a guinea to buy it.</p>
               <p>Court. He asked you to buy it, did he? - Yes, Sir, I told him it was a bad half guinea, and he said it was; I asked him then what he asked for it; he said, eight shillings and sixpence; I told him, I thought eight shillings and sixpence for a bad half guinea was a great deal of money, and I told him I could not say any thing to it, I would shew it to my husband, and he would call again, for being Saturday, I could not pay him</p>
               <p>Court. What it was your sabbath, was it? Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>So your conscience would not let you pay for it that day? - No, Sir; he called again on the Monday following, and I told him I did not much like to have any thing to do with it; then he over persuaded me, and said there was two shillings that I might get by half a guinea, and I bought it of him, and gave him eight shillings and sixpence for it.</p>
               <p>Court. And you actually bought it? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>And did you pay for it? - Yes, Sir, I paid him eight shillings and sixpence for it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner you dealt with? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you known any thing of him before? - I had seen him several times before.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any dealings with him before? - Once, a good while back.</p>
               <p>And only in that instance? - Only in that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. When did you see him after that? - I saw him on the Thursday following, he called and had nothing with him, and he called on Friday, as I have said; I am sure of the man, I do not come here for gain or interest; I gave the half guinea to my husband in his pocket on the Thursday, as he called on the Friday.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is your husband here? - No, he had no call to be here.</p>
               <p>Now, the first time that he came to you, you say, that he left the half guinea with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not then bargain for it? - I was only to keep it and shew it, I was afraid to look at it almost, for I did not like the thoughts of bad money, and I know the consequence of people being brought into trouble.</p>
               <p>I think you said you had once before dealt in bad money? - Yes, once with him, but never with any body else, I had bought half a guinea worth of silver of him, and if he had not come to me, I should not have gone to him.</p>
               <p>And so this half guinea shocked you, and frightened you so, that you was afraid to look at it? - I never mentioned any thing of shocked.</p>
               <p>Well, frightened? - No.</p>
               <p>Afraid then? - It was very pretty.</p>
               <p>At last you gave it to your husband? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of it after you gave it to your husband, you do not know of your knowledge? - He laid it out.</p>
               <p>Why will not you tell me that you know nothing at all about it? - I do, Sir.</p>
               <p>Your conscience would not let you pay for it on the Saturday? - No.</p>
               <p>Then your conscience is of this sort, it will let you make an iniquitous bargain of a Saturday? - I did not make any bargain of a Saturday, I bargained and paid for it on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the pawnbroker's? - No, I had as much about me.</p>
               <p>Your husband gave you information that he was in trouble about this half guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was taken up for uttering that half guinea, and gave bail? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was he in custody? - A week.</p>
               <p>Did the Solicitor of the Mint consent to his being discharged? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where was he bailed? - Before them that committed him, somebody up in Bow-street.</p>

               <p>What charge was made against him at Sir Sampson Wright's? - For uttering a bad half guinea he was committed; I know nothing about his being admitted to bail, only as I have heard; I do not know how long he was in custody.</p>

               <p>You went to Levy's house? - I did on Friday the 6th, the very day that I was taken ill; I went into the one pair of stairs, there I saw the prisoner at the bar, and Mrs. Levy, sitting at a table by the fire, and upon the table there lay three nine and twenty shillings worth of silver, in three parcels of silver, I counted them, and in each parcel there were twenty-nine shillings; I desired Jealous to search the prisoner in my presence; he did so, and in his pocket he found a canvass bag, and I think there was twelve or thirteen pounds, besides the three parcels that were found on the table; (the three parcels shewn him) I think there were four counterfeit half guineas, and six shillings which are in the hands of Mr. Jealous.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Have you compared the shillings in the parcels and in the bag with those in his pocket?</p>

               <p>She was a good deal frightened and alarmed at your coming into the room? - I do not suppose she was so much frightened as what you may imagine; the fact is this, after her husband was taken into custody, it was thought necessary to get at the branch and at the root of it, and the woman herself said, she would give up the person whom she had the half guinea of.</p>
               <p>In order to save her husband? - No, Sir, no such thing; he is under process at this time, to appear at Westminster sessions.</p>
               <p>I would ask you, if I may be permitted, whether you do not, upon your oath, believe that that woman expects her husband will be discharged in consequence of the prisoner's conviction?</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Though that affects her credit, it does not affect her competency.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am as well contented that it should go to her credit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Clarke. You have seen all the half guineas? - All but that of Mr. Lestley's, which I never had in my hands.</p>
               <p>Be so good to compare them.</p>
               <p>(Clarke looks at the half guinea and the others.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If the half guinea which is now produced to you by that gentleman, had been produced to you by any body else, could you have distinguished it from a good half guinea? - Not a doubt of it, if it had been out of my possession for seven years.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish that one from the others that are produced to you? - No, I do not say that.</p>
               <p>They are so much alike, that though you could distinguish them from good half guineas, you could not distinguish them from these? - It is too much for me to swear it, I would not swear it.</p>
               <p>I dare say you would not.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know that they are bad? - By the milling.</p>
               <p>Is there any gold in it? - It is impossible to distinguish that, without an assay.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke. Whoever made one made the other; I should not like to give above sixpence; in short, they are worth nothing; I should not suppose there is any gold in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Franklin. You have said it is impossible to ascertain, without an assay, how much gold there is in this half guinea? - Yes; one of the reasons that I think it is bad is, that the milling is very badly executed.</p>
               <p>Might not a good half guinea be so clipped, and afterwards milled by an inexpert hand, as to produce that sort of milling that is now on this half guinea? - It might be so done.</p>
               <p>Court. Does it appear that this half guinea has been clipped? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you tell that by your eye? - Yes, I speak from the whole, but the milling is what I know by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke. You will find that the very outlines of the die is upon the money, therefore when it comes to be milled, or taken off, it must reduce it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, admitting the whole of Mrs. Levy's evidence to be true, for the sake of argument, I humbly submit that there is no evidence, that this half guinea was the half guinea that Levy uttered, because Levy is not produced.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to Mr. Levy's to see him; I knew him some time; he said he would help me to some employ; he was out of town, and I called again the next day, and she bid me stop a bit, and she began telling this money over; I had no time to say any thing to her, she had them in the room when I went in; she said here is somebody coming up; says she, put that bag in your pocket, and she had some shillings that she was looking at, and there was somebody coming up stairs, it was these gentlemen; says she, here is somebody coming up stairs, and, says she, put them in your pocket; I put the silver in my coat pocket, and the half guineas and shillings I put in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you say as to offering the half guinea to her? - I never saw that, I know nothing of it; there were four on the table, that was all that I saw.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This is a case that comes directly within the act of parliament; this depends intirely on the credit you give to Mrs. Levy's testimony: as to the want of the evidence of Levy being produced, that does not, in my apprehension, make any great difference in this case; because, if the prisoner offered to sell any counterfeit money, he has been guilty of the offence which is within the act of parliament; it seems to me, that if any half guinea is now produced to you in evidence, which was uttered by the prisoner at the bar at a less price, it is sufficient.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of February the prisoner was brought to Sir Sampson's, and he asked him where he lived, and he said he did not chuse to tell him; I was then told immediately of a woman at a certain place, who was called his wife; curiosity led me to watch her home, and I watched her to No. 14, <placeName id="t17840225-97-crimeloc499">New-street-hill</placeName>

               <p>But you must not tell us that; did you ever see the prisoner there? - No, when the prisoner was brought to the Office, before Sir Sampson, and when I produced the property in that box, Sir Sampson asked him how he came by it; he said, he had bought them, and would tell who he bought them from, if Sir Sampson would admit him an evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you happen to know how long it was after the things were lost before you found them in this box? - Several days.</p>
               <p>From the 14th to the 18th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, as to the conversation that passed at the office, are you quite sure at this distance of time; you hear many conversations? - If it was for seven years, and I saw your face, or any man's face, I could remember him.</p>
               <p>I have seen so many instances of your recollecting faces, that I can believe that; but I say as to the conversation? - Yes, I can.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Newport, at New Prison, and I attend at the Office in Bow-street, to bring prisoners backwards and forwards; the prisoner was brought by a constable, and some other people, to the watch-house, on the 18th of February.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing that the prisoner said before the magistrate? - Yes, when Jealous came back, he said he bought those things, and if Sir Sampson would admit him an evidence, he would tell who he bought them off; I took him into another room, and I searched him, and in his pocket I found a watch, and in his breeches pocket I found five guineas, and six shillings and sixpence: I took him over the way, and searched him further, and on his taking his stockings off, I found twelve guineas and a half in his stocking foot; I brought him over again there, and Jealous was in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250187"/> parlour with the box, and he owned some part of the property, and said he found it then; I do not know what part of the property it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was this confession in writing? - No.</p>
               <p>Is not it the constant custom of your office to take it in writing? - No, Sir, I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Do you know it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not take it to be a direct confession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now this man had been in custody of your mirmidons, and he had hid his money, for fear you should steal it from him, that is the case; is not it? - You may think as you please.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the last witness; on the 24th of February last, in the evening, about half past seven o'clock, I was up in my two pair of stairs room, it was quite dark, and having a lodger in the first floor, she heard a noise, and we both went into the kitchen, and found the sash up, and the shutter open; the kitchen is even with the ground; I fastened the window about half an hour before, the shutter I fastened with a couple of bolts.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it dark at seven? - Quite dark; when we came down stairs, seeing the sash up, we went up again, and called out from the one pair of stairs for assistance, and one

               <p>Court. What are you? - I am a taylor, I live in Addle-street, and have lived there years, I am a house keeper; on Tuesday night last, the 24th of February I went to my door, which is directly opposite this court; opposite my door I found three men, I watched about five minutes, there was a lamp directly over the court, at the entrance.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the prisoners, can you tell by that lamp light that the prisoners were the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You speak to them all three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Be very sure, it is a matter that affects their lives. - Yes, I am very sure, I suppose I saw them half an hour in the court; they were walking backwards and forwards, and I saw Wheeler John cross the way, from the other two, and go into a green shop, he crossed again and came past me, and went round the corner into Wood-street, and he came back to the other two, who stood at the bottom of the court, and then he and Robins went up the court; Goodall waited at the bottom, and presently the other two came running down the court and joined him; and they all went to Addle-street together.</p>
               <p>Is this court a confined court, or is it open at both ends? - It is a confined court; as soon as they got out of sight, I heard the cry of murder, and thieves! I went up the court, and saw the woman out of the window, who begged me to get in, for there were thieves in the house, I saw the windows were o pen, and the window sashes thrown back, the bolts wrenched off, only hung by a nail that one might turn it round with one's finger; the woman came down and let me in, I searched the house, and below there stood the china, and tea pot, and some things ready in the window, they stood one in the other.</p>
               <p>Jury. What distance might you be when you was making these observations? - I do not know, two coaches can hardly pass the street one by the other; I went out afterwards, and at the bottom of Bartholomew Lane, the corner of Whalebone Court I saw the same three men again; there is a great light there, I heard no conversation, I watched them till a coach turned up the lane, then I lost sight of them, I then went up Throgmorton-street, and found them at the bottom of another court, I passed them, and had them apprehended, I heard them say nothing at any time; in the court where Goodall was taken, we found an iron crow, about two or three yards from him, I did not see it found; the first that was taken was Robins, he had a scuffle with the man that took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Goodall. The crow was brought in a quarter of an hour after I was taken.</p>

               <p>Court. Who did you order to bring them? - I think it was one of my servants or else my wife, it was not the prisoner; I ordered my servants up stairs.</p>

             a constable searched him, and took this ten pounds Bank bill out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>(The bill produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. Can you recollect whether you had that identical Bank bill? - I cannot, I know that this was the bill that was taken out of his pocket, but I cannot tell that this was the bill that I lost.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that all the other notes you received were ten pound notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that you had all the remaining notes at that time? - No, I had used two, but I took them from this parcel, they were not mixed with any other I am confident.</p>
               <p>Can you ascertain at all what notes you had paid away? - No, I cannot; when the constable took the bill out of his pocket, and said, Oh! here is the Bank bill, says the prisoner (looking very impudently at me) why then Sir, you put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have given your evidenceas you are naturally expected to do, very candidly, Sir; you are in some uncertainty how many Bank notes you had used, perhaps two, perhaps three? - I rather think two.</p>
               <p>Consequently this may be one of those that you had paid away? - I do not conceive it is one of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you that morning that you went out this Bank note in your breeches pocket? - I perfectly well remember having it in my hand, in my breeches pocket when I came in to dress; that note which I lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had taken two ten pound Bank notes from a parcel of notes, and you lost one, but whether this note now produced in evidence, is the one you lost out of your pocket, or one of those you paid away you cannot tell? - I cannot distinguish it from one of those I had paid away.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner attend you to the family where you dined? - No.</p>
               <p>Where do you dress, in your study? - I dressed that day in my parlour, for I was in a great hurry.</p>
               <p>To which parlour the other servants have access as well as the prisoner? - Yes, they might have been in, and were in, no doubt, while the clothes lay about.</p>
               <p>You have likewise several clerks that may go in if they chuse it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came to you and brought your money, you apprized him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250191"/> there was a Bank note in your breeches pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He returned and searched your pockets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore he could have returned it into the pocket if he had chose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he refuse that night to have his pocket searched? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>I believe in consequence of your suspicions you dismissed him your service that very night? - Yes, I ordered him not to sleep in the house, but to come to me in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did he come in the morning? - He did, I was busy, and could not talk with him then.</p>
               <p>Then he had the whole afternoon of Thursday, the whole day of Friday, and of Saturday to dispose of the Bank note to his wife or any body he pleased? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday however this Bank note which is now produced in evidence, God knows where it came from, was found in his pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it found in that state of care that you and I would take of a Bank note? - It was so (in a careless manner.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner can neither read nor write? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Now I will ask you a question, Sir, that is sometimes attended with risk; what was your opinion of the prisoner before this? - My opinion of him before was, I thought him a very honest man; I had the best character with him when I hired him that I ever had with a servant in my life.</p>
               <p>I think it was not probable that Mrs. Walford should bring your clothes? - It was most probably a servant.</p>
               <p>Do you know that when the man went home he carried the papers to a Mr. Brooks? - The prisoner told me he did go immediately from me at dinner, and took the papers out of my waistcoat pocket to Mr. Brooks, and said, Sir, are either of these a Bank bill?</p>
               <p>Did he communicate to those clerks that he consulted on the subject, his reasons for asking the question? - I understood he did not.</p>
               <p>Was not it known, from the prisoner's communication, before you came home, that there was a Bank note lost? - I understood not, that it was not known even to Brooks; I conceive that the Bank bill was put in his pocket that day, from what happened; I told him on the Saturday, when he was at my house, that I should search his lodgings, and I bid him wait in my kitchen till I had dined.</p>
               <p>Did he wait? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you discharged this man, or at any time, did you pay this man his wages in any sum of money? - He has had his wages in little sums, one guinea, and two guineas for the funeral of a child.</p>
               <p>Within what time may you have paid him this money? - I paid him ten guineas in three or four months; he has been with me eleven months.</p>

I remember an indictment for the delivery of a challenge, and that challenge was stated to be in the hand writing of the party who delivered it; the delivery was certainly the offence, but we failed in proving the hand writing; and I remember it was fully the opinion of the Recorder, that if you state a fact, you must prove it: I therefore think, in this case, as they have not laid it in the indictment, purporting to be signed by

               <p>- ARNOLD sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Crooked-lane now, No. 15; I was Mr. Stoney's errand boy when he was robbed; there was nobody in the room while my master was out, that I know of, but the prisoner, and when my master came home, the things were gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Who first found out that they were lost? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you find it out before your master came in? - No, I let my master in, and he took a book as he generally used of a night, and sat down by the fire; he told me to make the bed, and I asked him if he had been pulling the bed about, and he said no; then I pulled the clothes off, and there was a pair of sheets missing from the bed; and he looked in his box, and the other things were gone out of it; the box was unlocked, but the lid was down; I know the prisoner, he lived facing my master a good while; he came up stairs to me that evening while my master was out, I was in the next garret, and he came and looked into that room, where I was, and I got up; he asked for master; I told him I expected my master in about seven, and that I was going down stairs to light a fire, and he might stop; he came down along with me, and I unlocked the door, and as I was lighting the fire, he stood by me; he asked me if I had any aqua fortis, and I told him no.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether the sheets were on the box then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes; I told him he might get a pennyworth at any of the druggists, and if he had a mind, when I went down, I would get him some; when I had lighted the fire, I stood by the fire, and he said, Jack, you had better go up to work; so I thought I might as well, for fear my master should be angry; so I said, you can fit in the dark, cannot you? and I went up to work and left him in the room; and in about a quarter of an hour, I came down, and I heard him going half way down the one pair of stairs, and I asked him if he had locked the door, and he said, no; I knew his voice.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the room then? - No, I only looked to see if the fire was safe.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether the sheets were in the bed, and upon the box then? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you think you should know the sheets at all? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you know the prisoner's person? - No, I followed him down stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you see his face? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Is that staircase a light staircas e, or a dark one? - It is a very dark one.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was the man you saw go down stairs? - No, Sir, I am not sure, I cannot swear to the man.</p>
               <p>What sort of a bundle was it? - A bundle almost as big as himself, I could not see the colour of it.</p>
