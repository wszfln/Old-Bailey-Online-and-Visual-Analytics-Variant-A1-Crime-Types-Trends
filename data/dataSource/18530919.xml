                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. On 2nd April, I received a warrant for the apprehension of the prisoner, and went with Mr. Zuccani to Southampton—I found the prisoner there on the following day at 4, Yorkterrace—I was answered by a man who called himself Marshall—I said, "Mr. Marshall," he said, "Yes;" I said, "I am a police officer, and hold a warrant from the Bankruptcy Court for the apprehension of Joseph and John Legge"—I did not see the prisoner then—in consequence of what Mr. Marshall said, I found it necessary to search the premises; there was a great deal of resistance to my doing so, on the part of Marshall and the prisoner's wife—after I had searched the greater portion of the house, the prisoner came from the upper part of the house; I lodged him at the police station at Southampton that night, and brought him to town on the following day, Monday, and handed him over to the officer of the Bankruptcy Court—on 20th April, I was at Guildhall police-court—I saw Marshall in the prisoner's presence, in a room adjoining the police court—after the examination of Marshall, I said to him in the prisoner's presence, "What money has your son given to you?" the prisoner replied, "I have not given him any, it was given by Mr. Wontner"—Mr. Wontner appeared for him on that occasion—I did not see any money pass—I do not remember that Marshall himself said anything—I have seen Marshall and the prisoner in conversation together, but I have not heard the particulars of the conversation—I have not heard them address each other as "father," or "son"—from the character of their language I always considered that they addressed each other as such; I cannot tell the words, it was from the general conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You suspected that they were father and son before, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not remember any particular expression in their conversation that led me to believe it; I did not hear them address each other as "father" or "son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> However, I understand you to say, they admitted to you that that was the relationship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not together; they have done so at different times—the father did not admit in the prisoner's presence that he was his son—the prisoner has not admitted to me in direct terms that Marshall was his father—I do not recollect anything particular that he said about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What took you to Guildhall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was instructed by the solicitor for the prosecution; Samuel Marshall Legge was charged with conspiracy, I believe by Mr. Nicholson, one of the creditors—the charge of conspiracy was against the prisoner, his wife, and his father; those three were charged with couspiring to defraud the creditors of their goods—I think I attended four or five examinations before the Magistrate—the first examination was not a long one, but the subsequent examinations were very lengthy; the result of it was that all the prisoners were discharged; the charge was dismissed—I have not seen Mr. Zuccani here to-day, he has been here on every other occasion; his name is on the back of the bill—I did not go direct to No. 4, York-terrace, I traced them there—I left London, and chose to go to Southampton; I was not desired to go there, I chose my own course—I did not know that Marshall was living at Southampton; it was stated before Mr. Fane that Marshall was at Southampton, but I went there before that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you no instructions to go to Southampton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I used my own discretion about that; I heard certain accounts in connection with this business, and I thought it most prudent to go to Southampton—the furniture that I found in the house there was cabinet and upholstery furniture; some was finished, and some not; there were tables, and chests of drawers, and sofa frames, and chair frames—it seemed the stock of an upholsterer's and cabinet maker's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the parties remanded four' times on the charge of conspiracy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they were, I did not attend the whole of the examinations; I believe the case was beard before four different Aldermen—I went to Southampton because I heard that certain goods had gone there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity of property was there at Southampton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. 4 was a six-roomed house, and two kitchens besides; it was full of furniture, and there was some more at No. 5, the house adjoining, No. 4 not being sufficiently large to hold it—I do not mean that the house was furnished for habitation, but the rooms were crowded with furniture, piled one on the other—I believe there was four or five tons of it—I believe it to be worth some hundreds of pounds—what I said to Marshall at the police court was, "What money has your son given you?"—I am sure I used that expression, and then it was that the defendant answered—I remember nothing more being said—beseemed to recognise the expression as alluding to him, I did not address him—I have heard them conversing on other occasions, but I cannot mention anything that they said.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner; I believe he is my brother. I have known him many years, and he has been brought up as such; I could not prove he was or was not—he has always lived in the family as my brother—my father's name is Legge, his Christian name is Samuel Marshall—I believe his name is Samuel Marshall Legge—I and the prisoner have lived together with him as his sons—my father has never to my knowledge gone by any other name besides Legge—my brother, father, and myself were not living together previous to the bankruptcy—my father did not live with me at Brompton, he did in Chelsea; he then went by the name of Legge—I will not swear that my father never went by the name of Marshall, to my knowledge; he might have done so at York-terrace, Southampton, but I was not present when he took the premises—I went down there on the Thursday night, and left on the Sunday morning following—I think he did go by the name of Marshall there—I have been in business with my brother—I have aided him in selling furniture by auction, P arranged the sales—the first sale was at Tunbridge; I arranged that with a gentleman, to whom P was well known for twelve months before, and he sold the goods by auction for me without my brother knowing anything about it—there was afterwards a sale at Canterbury; my father arranged for that sale by my instructions—my brother had an interest in that, but he was not present—it was a sale by public auction; I was there and received the money—the goods were sold in the name of Legge—I went by the name of Anson there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in partnership with your brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten weeks altogether; my name was used jointly with my brother's for about ten weeks—I entered into partnership with him about 1st Jan., the business was then carried on jointly in Churton-street—sales were effected at Canterbury and Ramsgate; the goods were sold by public auction—the name of the firm was Joseph and John Legge; the goods were sent down to Canterbury, and sold there by public auction—I was known to the parties, although I went in an assumed name, as is commonly done—P was known as the proprietor of the goods; after the sales at Canterbury and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190004"/>
               <p>Ramsgate, certain sums were paid to the creditors—I do not know how much exactly—some money was paid to the creditors immediately after the sale at Canterbury—the whole of the money taken at the sale at Canterbury was expended in the firm, and principally paid to the creditors; my brother disposed of the money that was realised from the sale at Ramsgate; I believe it was paid to two different creditors—I assisted in taking the goods down to Southampton—we intended to sell them there, and offer them as a composition—we thought of selling them at a great advantage, as I am well known there, better than in my native town—they were to be sold in the same way as had been done at Canterbury and Ramsgate—my father bad formerly occupied a house at Southampton in his own name—that was in 1847, I have no doubt that there were cards found on the premises that would prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he live there in the name of Legge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the new town there; I do not know how it was that he came to take the name of Marshall—the sales I speak of were what are called speculative sales—they were forced sales, we were obliged to make up money for our bills, but I have speculated in sales for years, and have realised more than I could otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by a forced sale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it would be to go and sell a certain amount of goods for about half their value.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a loss to you in every case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a very heavy loss at Tunbridge and Ramsgate, but the loss by the Canterbury sale was very trifling; I believe, there was a loss—they sold for much less than we had to give for the heavier goods, but then we were charged an exorbitant price for them—you will find on looking over the sale account, that the goods I had from my creditors fetched the full value—my father had ceased to live at Southampton for two or three years before this affair—he had then been known there under the name of Legge, and myself too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor in this case; I keep the One Tun, in Chandos-street, Covent-garden. On Saturday night, 4th June, a person named Edwards purchased a quartern of gin at my house—his landlord, I believe, was with him, Wheeler, the defendant—Edwards tendered me a sovereign in payment for the gin—I gave him change, and among it was two crown pieces—it was 19<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in amount—there was two crown pieces, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—they left together—this was towards 9 o'clock in the evening—on the Monday morning Edwards came to me again, and laid what appeared to be a crown piece on the counter—it was a bad one—after some conversation, he said it was a bard thing for him to lose it, he being a working man—I told him I was likewise a working man as well as himself—my wife suggested, that being a neighbour I should give him half a crown, which I did, and he went away—after he bad left I obtained some information with reference to a crown piece from a man named Taylor—that was about 1 o'clock—about 3 o'clock Edwards came again, with his master, as he called him; not the prisoner—on that occasion I got the crown piece, and next day I got back my half crown—on 7th June I received a summons, and attended the County Court on 22nd—Edwards did not appear then, and the cause was struck out—I afterwards received another summons, and the case came on for hearing on 7th July, before Mr. Bailey, the Judge at the County Court heard Wheeler sworn and examined as a witness—he said the counterfeit coin produced was the one paid to him by Edwards, and that he bad no other by any other means whatever during the week—he was questioned by Mr. Norton as to whether he had purchased it from Taylor, and he swore that he had not, and threatened an action against anybody that said so—he said on his sacred oath that he did not buy it of Taylor, and that if Taylor dared to come and say so, he would indict him for perjury—I did not give Edwards a bad crown piece on the Saturday, I gave him two good ones—the crown piece produced at the hearing was not the one I had given Edwards on the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potboy to Mr. Looby, who keeps the Nag's Head, is Houndsditch. On Wednesday night, 7th Sept., I left my place, at a quarter past 12 o'clock, and was going home—when I got outside my master's house I saw the prisoner and a gentleman together in the street, about two doors from my master's house—I saw her strike the gentleman in the pit of the stomach, and knock him backwards—he fell on the ground—I ran to his assistance, and picked up his hat—I then saw the prisoner with her band in his side pocket; she drew a pocket book from it—she put it under her arm, under her shawl—I was trying to assist the gentleman up; the prisoner was still standing there, but I thought I bad better not make any alarm for the police, or she might run away—as I was trying to help him up, I saw the policeman a little distance from me—as he came towards me, the prisoner turned round, and saw him coming, and threw the pocket book into the middle of the road—I saw that—the policeman picked it up, and took her into custody directly—she was quite close to the gentleman at the time she threw the pocket book away, and then the policeman took hold of her—the gentleman appeared to be very much in liquor—while the constable was holding the prisoner, she said to the gentleman, "Have I robbed you?"—he replied, "I do not know"—at the same time she dropped some silver from her right hand—I believe a gentleman who assisted me to pick up the prosecutor picked up a shilling, and the policeman picked some up—just as the police, man had the prisoner in custody, a young woman passed by, and the prisoner said that that young woman had given her the pocket book to throw away—that was not so; I saw the prisoner take it out, put it under her arm, and afterwards throw it away—the young woman did not have anything to do with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, and live in Bevis Marks, St. Mary Axe. I was passing through Houndsditch, about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock, on the night in question—I was walking on the side of Duke-street, which is on the opposite side to the Nag's Head, and I saw a man fall down, with his back towards the pavement—I crossed over to pick him up, and when I got there I saw the prisoner leaning over him, and rifling his pockets of the contents—from her manner, I was induced to believe that she was his wife—she said, "Do get up, George, because if the policeman comes and finds you here, you will be taken to the station, and fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and she asked some of the people who were passing to get him up—I was about going away, when the policeman came up and took bold of her—she then threw the pocket book which she had taken from the man's pocket into the road, and the money she let fail by her side—the policeman said to her, "Halloo! I have got you now," or something to that effect—the boy had picked the gentleman up the moment before the policeman came up—two or three of the leaves of the pocket book were scattered about—I helped the policeman to pick up the money; I believe I picked up a shilling and a sixpence, and two leaves of the pocket book—I did not assist at all in picking up the gentleman—while the policeman had hold of the prisoner, she pointed to a woman who was standing in the road, and said, "I hare not done the robbery; that is the woman standing there"—that woman had not taken any part in it, or gone near the gentleman—she was about two yards away from him all the time—she had not taken anything from his pocket; she was in the road, and the prisoner was on the pavement—I saw the book taken from the pocket distinctly—the other woman had no more part in it than I had.</p>

On 29th Aug., about 8 o'clock in the afternoon I was on duty at London Bridge wharf, and saw Mrs. Kircher come from a steam boat on to a lighter, carrying a bam) box in her hand—I saw the prisoner Bushie put his hand into her pocket—I saw the other prisoners—I saw them all three standing talking together for two or three minutes before, and when Bushie left to go to the lady, one on each side closed on to Bushie so as to take off the attention of any one behind—I was in front—I saw Bushie put his left hand into the prosecutrix's dress, and take it out again—I laid hold of his hand, and asked him what be had there—he made no reply—I opened his hand, and took this purse out of it—I then told the prosecutrix—I had first seen the prisoners about five minutes before, when I was on the Hull boat—Mrs. Kircher came from a Gravesend boat, the passengers from that boat had to pass over the Hull boat—the lighter was outside the Hull boat, and the Gravesend passengers had to cross over the lighter—when I first saw Bushie and Nicholls, they went across the Hull boat on to the lighter—I saw Nicholls go and feel a lady's dress in front, the lady was with a gentleman—Nicholls left, and then Bushie went and felt her—I saw them leave in a hurried manner, and go to Pickett—that was the first time I saw Pickett—he was about two paces from them, on the same lighter—I then saw them all return, Bushie and Nicholls went and stood in front of the lady and gentleman with their hands behind them, Pickett went before the lady and gentleman pressing before some more passengers that were waiting to go on board the boat—there were about fifteen or sixteen persons on the lighter at that time, or there might have been twenty—the lady and gentleman moved away in consequence of being pressed, and then the prisoners went to the prosecutrix in the way I have described—when I took Bushie into custody, Pickett went on one side of the lighter and Nicholls the other, but I pushed them into the gangway, they could not get off—I knew them all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, as a ship broker, in the Circus, Tower-hill; we carry on business under the firm of Hall and Son. On 25th Aug. I had occasion to go to the Bank for a Bank post bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is the custom at the Bank to make that application by filling up a blank form given for the purpose; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it the form that I filled up, it is for a Bank post bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to the order of oar firm (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Bank post bill, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Hall and Son, Circus, Tower-hill; value received of the same. 25th Aug., 1858")—I think I made the application about half past 9 o'clock in the morning, or before 10 o'clock, at all events it was the first thing in the morning, perhaps it might have been a little after 10 o'clock—at the time I was writing out the order, there was some person near me, I cannot say who the person was, I took no particular notice of him—having filled up the form, I handed it in to the Bank post nil office, with the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked what time it would take to make out the bill—they said about a quarter of an hour; I said I could not be back so soon as that—I went away and returned in about an hour and a quarter—I was then told that the bill had been already given out; I eventually got another—I never gave any one authority to apply for this bill (<hi rend="italic">bill produced</hi>)—the endorsement here of "Hall and Son," is not the writing of our firm, nor has it been written by our authority—it was not endorsed by my father or myself; we are the only two persons in the firm, no clerk has authority to sign for the firm—this is not the bill that I got.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the cashiers of the Bank of England. I was on duty in the Bank post bill office on 25th Aug.—Mr. Hall would not apply to me for the bill, he would apply at the counter to one of the clerks, and fill up the form; the bill would be made out from that, and then it would come to me to sign—I remember a Bank post bill being brought to me to sign, I have no doubt the one produced is it; here is my signature—our usual practice is after signing it, to call out the name of the person to whom it is payable, if we see any person present—any person who answers and correctly describes the bill, receives it—I distinctly remember giving that bill to some person—I am not able to say to whom—I cannot be certain whether I called out the name of Hall and Son; when there are very few persons in the office we do not always call out the name, we lay the bill down and put a lead upon it; it is most likely that I did call out the name; some person applied for it correctly, and it was given to that person—I remember Mr. Hall afterwards coming and applying for it, I could not positively state how long that was after it was given up, probably about an hour.</p>

               <p>at the paper, certainly; I did not read it—I looked on both tides of it, I merely glanced at it—I do not know what time it was when he brought the bill back, I only know the time we went into the Royal Exchange was half past 12 o'clock—I should think it was near 1 o'clock when he came back—he was not gone half an hour—I do not recollect telling the officer that this occurred at 10 o'clock in the morning—I do not think I did, because I recollect the time so well; I must have been very agitated if I did—we sat down in the Royal Exchange at half past 12 o'clock—we were thinking; I named several persons, to see whether my father could borrow some money of them, and he said no, no; they would not do—when my father left me, he went out at the left hand side, as you stand looking towards the front of the Queen's statue—that would lead to the Bank—when he came back he said, "Look here, what I have found!"—I said, "Where did you find it?" and he said, "If you come with me, I will show you"—I went out with him, and we went to Capel-court; I do not know whether that is the entrance to the Stock Exchange—he pointed down to the side of a scaffold-pole there, that was lying oil the ground where there was some building going on, and said, "That was where I found it; it was just underneath that scaffold-pole"—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) this is my father's handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner many years, and have received many communications from him in writing—I should positively know his handwriting, as far as my judgment would go—I have done business with him; (<hi rend="italic">looking at the bill</hi>), I should positively swear that the name of "Hall and Son," on the back of this bill, was not his writing, according to the best of my belief, and I will give my reasons; on looking at the "George Thompson, Guildford, Surrey," I find an "S" which is exactly like his; it is the S" in "Surrey;" I believe that to be his—I do not think the "S" in "Son" is like his; I see not the slightest likeness whatever to his handwriting there—I saw him sign his name only a short time ago—I saw him write lately at my house—I have known him eight years; for the greatest portion of that time he filled a very important situation in a most respectable firm at Bermondsey, but from some differences which arose between his wife and himself, there was an alienation—I have had the highest opinion of his honesty and have now; his character for honesty was exceedingly good—latterly he has been in very extreme poverty—from the high opinion I had formed of him, I have advanced him sums of money from time to time—some short time ago I knew him to be in the lowest state of poverty, so much so as to be glad of a few pence.</p>

               <p>auctioneer—he is in my debt now, not many pounds, it is for money that I have advanced to him—I formed a very high opinion of him—I do not know how be came to leave Mr. Ross, of Bermondsey—that was the employment that I referred to—I do not know that he left that service, having embezzled 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have heard it within this day or two, from his own family—I have been in communication with his wife—the next employment I found him in, after leaving Mr. Ross, was making razor strops, he came to me to borrow money to carry out the project—I never was at the house in Arbour-square—I was never at any house where he lived, except the one at Bermondsey, when he was at Ross's—I did not know anything of his acquaintances; I formed my opinion of his honesty from his filling an important situation; until Mr. Ross died, I had no other means—Mr. Ross died about two years ago—I cannot say that I see any similarity in the writing of this "Hall and Son," and "Geo. Thompson"—they appear to me to be entirely different; the "H" of the "Hall" appears to have been written over two or three times, it appears to have been written with very bad ink—the "Geo. Thompson" is written in blue ink, and thick—I consider the two names differ as much as two hands from different persons will differ—I should not like to form any opinion upon the flourish, it is altogether different from his—I never taw the bill before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at No. 21, Edward-street, Dorset-square. Early on Wednesday morning, 24th Aug. I was in Long Acre—I had no watch with me—I thought it was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I went up Angel-court to make water—it is a very dark court; while I was there a man came behind me, put his knee in my back, caught me by the neck, pulled me back, and kept me tight by the throat, while another man put both hands into my waistcoat pockets, and then into my trowsers pockets—I had an opportunity of seeing the man who held me, it was the prisoner—I was not able to speak a word while his arm was round my neck—I had 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a half sovereign in my pockets—as soon as the prisoner's hands were removed from my neck, the man who robbed me ran about half the distance to the corner of the court, and as soon as he had got that half distance the prisoner took leave of me, and ran after the other man—as soon as I got up I ran after them, crying, "Stop thief!" and "Police!"—I saw the prisoner before he got to the corner, I saw him turning round the corner (I had been thrown</p>

               <p>down on the ground on my back)—I ran after him, and when I ran out of the court I found that the police bad him—I felt the effects of the violence for a fortnight after—I had been drinking that night, I had taken a good drop, but I was not drunk—I recollect all that occurred—I did not see anything more of the man that had his bands in my pockets—the policeman took the prisoner to the station—I do not think I went with him, I do not know that I did.</p>

"Stop thief!"—I immediately ran after the prisoner, and when I was almost close to him he turned round to meet me—I told him be must come back with me to see what he had been doing to the gentleman—he said he had not done anything to him—the prosecutor was then standing in Long-acre, at the end of the court—I brought the prisoner back to him, and he said, "That is the man that robbed me of a half sovereign and some silver"—he did not say anything else—I then told the prisoner that I was a police constable, and he must go to the station with me—when</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publisher, carrying on business at Nos. 97 and 100, St. John-street, Smith field. Parker was in my service about two years—Sadlier was a canvasser—Parker was clerk to superintend the canvassers—he had been a canvasser himself, but was promoted—his duty was to give the canvassers certain districts to go over, to obtain orders for various publications, and when obtained to enter them in the order book, and re-enter them in the delivery book, so that the deliverers might go to the parties, ascertain that they had given such orders, make checks on Saturday night, and hand to the canvassers, which they presented to the cashier in the counting-house—they then received the money, and we supposed they were receiving the money for <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> orders—they received a commission, which varied according to the extent of the work—the canvassers reported the orders to</p>

               <p>Parker—he entered them in the order book, transferred them into the delivery book, and sent the deliverers to the persons who were supposed to have given orders, to ascertain whether they had been given; and on their reporting that they were genuine orders, it was Parker's duty to make out checks for the commission, when a portion of the goods had been delivered, or the parties had said that they were genuine orders—the goods are delivered periodically as published—the checks were presented to the cashier—it was Parker's duty to enter the orders in the order book, then in the rough delivery book, and then in the permanent delivery book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were not entered there till it was ascertained that the orders were genuine—it would not have been in the course of business that any check for the commission should be given till the names had been entered by Parker in the permanent delivery book—from something I had heard, I gave Parker into custody; I believe it was on 18th June—I saw him searched, and this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found upon him—it is Parker's writing—this other paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has initials in Parker's writing signed at the bottom of it—it is a copy of the other paper, in a different writing, but the initials to it are Parker's—the body of this other paper is in Parker's writing; it is a check, dated 17th June, for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is the commission for these other two papers—it is payable to Sadlier, and signed by R. Sadlier, as having received it—this other check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Parker's writing; it is on 28th May, and the initials to the list are his—here is another, the same; the body of the check is Parker's writing, and the initials to the list—here is another, the 6th May; another, the 23rd April; another, the 30th; another, the 23rd; another, the 15th; and another the 9th April—they are all the same.</p>

WOOLLETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Parker been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years; I placed him over the canvassers; he was superintendent of the whole—I should think they were not bound to do whatever he told them—he engaged the canvassers—their number varied from twelve to twenty or thirty—when we produce a new work we put on extra hands; sometimes we have thirty or forty—Sadlier had been employed as a canvasser for a considerable time; I cannot say how long—I had no time to attend to the canvassers; they were entirely under the control of Parker—I did not know anything against Sadlier's character till this fraud was discovered—he did not call once or twice after I discovered this matter, and offer me every information in his power—he kept out of the way—he did not call, to my knowledge—I sent to him to say that I wished to see him, but he sent frivolous excuses for not-coming—he kept out of the way—I cannot say whether he came to the office; I do not know—supposing these orders had been given, Sadlier would have been entitled to his commission—I have seen the canvassers writing, but I believe nothing more than their duty to write their circulars—they might be employed by Parker in packing—Parker had plenty of writing in his office, but not more than he was quite capable of doing himself—I have heard of the canvassers doing things on their own account, and when I have heard it I have discharged them—I know Sadlier returned a check by post—I gave the men notice that if they were about to receive money that was not due to them, to return the checks, or I should prosecute them; and Sadlier sent back a check for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that had been given him by Parker to receive that night—that was the first check that was put in to-day—that was after I had taken Parker into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Tallis. The first of these lists of names produced is in Parker's writing; all the others are in Sadlier's—these are the names of persons who are supposed to have given him orders, and on which he was entitled to receive commission—the lists were handed to Parker, and it was his duty to give a check for the commission—here are about fifty-three names in these lists—I have searched through the rough delivery book, and the permanent delivery book—there are three names out of the fifty-three entered in the delivery books—they are entered in the order book as if they were real orders—they all appear there, and are marked; up in that book as genuine orders, the persons having received a certain part of them—all orders are entered first, as the canvassers give them in, but afterwards they appear in the order book; and supposing them to be delivered, they should be entered in the delivery book—I find these are ticked off by Parker, as if they were entered in the delivery book—I am correct in saying that there are only three of them entered in the delivery book—they all appear in the order book, and are all ticked, as if they were entered in the delivery book—I have referred to the rough delivery book as well as the permanent delivery book, and there are only three of them in either of those books.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and I also keep the White Horse public house at North Ockendon, Essex; I have a little land.

Wolton and Eve, salesmen, to whom I had employed him to take cattle on former occasions—I did not see the prisoner again till next evening Friday the 8th about 5 o'clock, when he came to my house at North Ockendon—I asked him whether the heifers were sold—he said, No George, there is wonderful bad trade as you will see by the paper; I had them turned out on Plaistow Marshes, I was only offered 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them"—I said, "It is very foolish of you, Thomas; they will waste like dew, being stall fed"—he said, "They will not hurt, they will be all right; they will go to Smithfield again on Monday"—I saw no more of him till the following Wednesday at Romford market; I then said, "Are the heifers sold, Thomas?"—he said, "They were sold on Monday, and your money lies at Mr. Pocklington's"—that is a Smithfield banker, I do not keep an account there—I asked him who 1 was to apply to for it, he said, "Playford"—I said, "I thought I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He knew you did not bank at Pocklington's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That made no difference; I went there on the Thursday after the Wednesday that I saw him—I did not find my money there, or else I should not have troubled you here—I did not give him into custody between the 7th or 8th July and 15th Aug., when I saw him, because I always give a man lenity; that was my reason; I always consider a man's wife and family—he had not told me he had sold the heifers and paid the money to Cumbers; he told me he did not know what had become of him—Cumbers did not come to me and tell me that the prisoner had paid him the money; I deny it—Cumbers did not come to me at Romford, and tell me that the prisoner had paid him the money, he used very bad language to me on the Wednesday; both of them did—that was because I asked them for the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you ask them for the money when he had told you it was at Pocklington's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was well aware that he was telling me an untruth; they used language unfit to mention in Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask Cumbers where the money was, and did not he tell you he had got it, and he should keep it till there was a settlement of accounts between you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I swear he said no such thing—the sheep on the marsh was not a joint transaction between me and Cumbers; he said there were five turned out, he had taken some to London, and brought me 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, that was all, and there were five sheep left, which cost me 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had not bought some lambs and sheep between us—they were not the same sheep—I never in ray life agreed to go into partnership with Cumbers for the pur<lb/>chase</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say, when he asked you for a settlement, that you knew two or three lawyers, and would give them a job? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never asked me—I swear the prisoner did not tell me, on the Wednesday, in Romford, market, that Cumbers had got the money—Cumbers has not come to my house several times for the purpose of getting a settlement—I keep a public house—I mean to say I have got a license from the Magistrates—I have got a license so far as I sell spirits—I hold a license now—it has not been taken away by the Magistrates exactly—it has been suspended for a month—I am not obliged to answer such questions as when it was suspended—I am not ashamed of the matter, there is nothing to be ashamed of—it is only suspended, that is all—no Magistrates have taken it away for bad conduct—I was before the Magistrates on the licensing day—I have never in my life been summoned for anything improper; I mean to represent that—I have never been summoned for having disorderly and improper people in my house—I never served liquors on a Sunday—I was summoned for beer; one Sunday I gave a barber a pint of beer who shaved me.</p>

I saw him at the bottom of Holborn-hill, by the Anchor public-house, Farringdon-street; I was going there, and so was he—we had some conversation in the house, and then went outside—he said he could get a horse if he knew where to dispose of it—I said he could dispose of it in Whitecross-street—he asked me if I would go with him, and I said I would—he did not say where—we went into another public-house, and he asked me if I had a knife—I said, No"—he said he must have a knife or a chisel, as anything of that kind would</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside in Basinghall-street. The deceased child was brought to me by Mrs. Wheaton, on Saturday, 13th Aug., it was in a state of extreme exhaustion, proceeding partly from the diseased condition of the child, and partly from want of nourishment; it was affected with scrofula—that is frequently a result of want of nourishment—I saw it again the next day, the 14th, it was still in the charge of Mrs. Wheaton, it appeared very much better next day—I saw it again on Monday, and the improvement continued—I did not see it afterwards till it was dead, on Wednesday, 24th Aug., and on the following day I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the child generally was very much emaciated, and the mesenteric glands were enlarged, showing the evidence of scrofula, but not in an advanced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190060"/>
               <p>stage—the stomach contained a small quantity of fluid, apparently wine mixed with milk—the structure of the stomach was healthy, and the organs generally, but small—the mesenteric are the glands by which the food carried into the system passes—a child affected by scrofula requires a more frequent supply of nourishment—I attribute the immediate cause of death to a want of a proper supply of nourishment—I think it would ultimately have died of the disease, but it was not so far advanced as to be the immediate cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose in consequence of the scrofula attacking the mesenteric glands, sufficient nutriment was not taken up into the system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The child required a more frequent supply in consequence of that disease—all women's milk is not equally nourishing—a good deal will depend not only upon the state of mind of the woman at the time, but also upon the food she takes, a deficiency in the quantity or quality of the milk might cause the want of nutriment—the scrofula in this case was no doubt inherited, the stomach was not much swollen—I had no opportunity of examining the mother—scrofula would influence the milk—the disease in the child was quite in an incipient state—as the disease advances it generally produces a great deal of irritability, but it goes on to a considerable extent before it produces death—that would depend upon the strength or weakness of the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Harding, I have lived at No. 5, Princes-street, Sparrow-corner, nearly fifteen years—I have known the prisoner all that time—I never knew him to be in for any <hi rend="italic">indecent</hi> action in his life; I always found him to be honest—on Friday evening, 26th Aug., I was at the Blue Boar, I was standing at the door under the shed, from the rain—I went there at half past 7 o'clock, and stood there till the London Dock bell rang for 9 o'clock, or it might be five minutes past; about 8 or 10 minutes past 9 o'clock I moved just inside the door, I held the door in my hand, and called the prisoner from the bar where he was speaking to the barman; I told him if my husband came while I ran up as far as my door, to run as far as my place and let me know; he did not come—I blew out the candle and put on some coals, and ran back again—I had been at the public house door from half past 7 o'clock, and looked in to see what time it was, and saw the prisoner reading the newspaper, that was at half past 7 o'clock—I often looked in after that, but the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> was either reading or talking to some one in front of the place, while I stood there—there are two front doors, one leads out to the corner of Princes-street, and the other to Rosemary-lane—I stood at the one at the top of Princes-street, facing Queen-street—I could see both doors from where I stood—I did not see the prisoner come out into the street while I was standing there; if be had come out, I should have seen him—when I looked in he was reading the newspaper, with his elbow on the bar, or speaking to some more <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> inside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Kidd and Podger, and live at Shad well; we carry on business as millers. Legerton was in our employ as foreman, and he had the whole charge of the flour and the mill—it was his duty to see everything brought into the mill correctly, and delivered out, and to make entries of flour and offal sold—we had a servant at the mill named Day—at the latter end of July, Day made a communication to me—on 12th or 13th Aug. he made another communication to me—in consequence of that, I went to the house of Digby, about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening—I went into the shop; he was behind the counter; he is a pork butcher—I asked him if he had not been to Shad well mill on the preceding day—he said he was there—I asked him to show me his ticket for what be brought away—he looked about in a few places, and on the shelves in the shop, and said, "I cannot find it; it is gone to the wash in my coat pocket"—I asked him what he did bring away—he said so many bushels of sweepings—I asked him what he brought away the second load—he told me so many bushels of sweepings again—I asked him if he had brought away any flour—he said, "No"—I said, "Are you certain you brought away no flour"—he said, "Yes, I am certain: so help me God, I did not"—I then said, "It is no use for you to deny having brought away the flour; you can very well remember if you did bring it away"—he replied, "I did not bring away any yesterday; I brought away one sack about a fortnight ago"—I went into the back premises, and saw some flour on a form in a sack—I looked at it—of course I could not swear to flour, it was not in our sack—I asked him who he got that from—he said, "From Mr. Cooper"—I asked him if he would allow me to search the premises to see if I could find the sack—he consented, and I found an empty sack of ours in an outhouse, where he keeps his pig—I told him that that was the sack he brought away yesterday, for it was a new one—he still denied it, but after some considerable time he acknowledged it—before he did that, I told him it was no use to deny it, because Day saw the flour put into his cart—he then said, "Well, it is no use for me to deny it; I did bring away a sack of flour, for which I paid 41<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the price of a sack of flour was 41<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have the book here in which it was the duty of Legerton</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Kidd and Podger. It is my duty to be at the mill at Shadwell—I was there in July and August—I recollect, in July, Digby came to the mill with a horse and cart—he had three quarters of middlings, and a sack of flour—I was standing at the mill door, Legerton put part of the middlings into the cart, and he put in a sack of flour and Digby covered it over with another empty sack—I then saw him go away—I made a communication to my master—in consequence of that I afterwards watched, and Digby came again on 12th Aug., and I saw him take away thirty-four bushels of sweepings and a sack of flour in a new sack—I have seen the sack that was found in Digby's house—I could not swear it was the same sack that was taken from the mill, but I believe it was—Legerton put part of the sweepings in the cart on 12th Aug., I do not know who put in the rest—I saw the sack of flour put in—it was covered over; the sweepings were not—I saw Digby go away—he came again the same day, and bought some more sweepings.</p>

               <p>had been sitting—Simpson said he was going on shore again with some dirty clothes—he went and got his carpet bag—I gave him the key, and be went to Crawcour's chest and unlocked it—he took the big box out, and said it was too heavy, it would burst the carpet bag—he then took the small one, and I was to open the large one while he was gone—he and Crawcour went on shore, and I was going on shore, but the mate told me I had better stop, I had got into trouble—the next day Crawcour came on board, he brought me sixty sovereigns—he said he had sold seventy ounces—he had sold as much as he could; be could not give me more, he had not got more—the next day I and Branchett broke open the other box, and there were three bags of gold—I gave one to Branchett; he said it would be too much to take on shore all at once—he took one bag out himself, and said he would have nothing to do with the rest—he took the bag in a large cotton handkerchief, and went on shore, and came back and told me he had sold it, and got 150 sovereigns and upwards for it—the remainder of the gold was put in Crawcour's chest—one bag was put into Branchett's bed, or under it—he put it away; I did not see it after it was put away—after I came to England, Branchett told me he hove it away among the cotton bales—he was afraid of being searched for it—there was cotton or wool on board the ship—Crawcour came on board the ship on Saturday, I think about 11 o'clock—the gold was missed, I think, on Friday night—when Crawcour came on board on Saturday, I told him before several of them that gold had been missed—he took the remaining bag, <hi rend="italic">lapped</hi> it up in a handkerchief, and took it over the side, but I believe before he did take it he went in the cabin and had some words with the captain, and told him he would not go home in the ship—Branchett said he was afraid of its being discovered, and he threw it amongst the bales of wool—I would not believe he had done such a thing—he told me that I should have 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I came to England—I arrived in England about 2nd March—I arrived in a man-of-war, a prisoner, but when I got my freedom it was 2nd March—I was bound to appear in 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after I arrived I went to Bough ton, in Kent, to see Branchett—I went there three times, I think, and once he came up to London to me, the last time—I saw him at Boughton the first time—I went to his house, and his wife took us through the fields, and we found him standing talking to a man that was working in the fields—I did not say anything to him about money; he asked me to come and have a glass of grog—we went to an hotel or beer shop—I asked him for money—he offered me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first—I told him I would not take it; I said I wanted 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he hove away the half bag of gold, and he had been living very extravagantly; he had been drinking very hard, and he bad very little money left—he wanted me to take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I said I would not take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I wanted 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him then, and the next day I got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more from him; that was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said that was the half of what he bad—when he offered me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I would not take it, we left the beer shop and went to his house, and he told me that I knew very well that Simpson had the greatest portion of it, and he would give me Simpson's direction—I went down again, and he would not give me any more money—after stopping a few hours, I came up to London again—he afterwards came to London, and brought his wife—he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told me where Simpson was, and offered his services to go and find him—I went from London to Ipswich—then to Colchester, and then to Liverpool—Branchett did not go with me—he went down home, I believe—I did not find Simpson—I am now under conviction for using Simpson's name, a charge of false pretences.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a wine and brandy merchant, in John-street, Crutched-friars, and have for nearly twenty years—the prisoner has been in my employ upwards of 16 years—he was my principal clerk and cashier—on Friday, 19th Aug., I was up stairs in my private counting house—in consequence of some investigation, I went down to the clerks' counting-house, where the prisoner sat—I asked him what might be my balance at my banker's at that time—he mentioned an amount that I do not remember—I fancied he was mistaken in the figures, and thinking he was incorrect, I took the rough pay-in book, the banker's book, the check book and the cash book up stairs with me, and on tracing the amounts that had been received by him, and paid in, to see whether they had been passed into the banker's—I found several of them missing—I copied the list off—I have not that list, it is destroyed—this sum of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was one of the sums that was deficient—I went down to the prisoner again, and said, "You appear to have some amounts that you have not paid hi, why don't you pay them in?"—he made me no answer—I waited some time—I then spoke very loudly to him; "Do you hear me, Sir"—he passed out from the enclosure where his desk was, and came round to me, and seized me by the coat with both hands, and said, "For God's sake forgive me, Mr. Storr!"—I said, "You don't mean to say you have been robbing me?"—his reply was, "For God's sake forgive me"—I thrust him from me and went out, saying, "I have nothing to say to you"—I immediately gave the other clerk orders to lock up all the books, and the cash box—he did so, and gave me the key—I think the cash box was in the safe at the time, I will not be positive—I then left the house—on the following morning I went to the counting house about 11 o'clock; I found the prisoner there, he came up to me repeating the words he had said before, "For God's sake forgive me, if not for my sake, for that of my family?"—I replied, "I have nothing to say to you"—I left the counting house, and returned in half an hour—I found the prisoner had gone—I believe he was apprehended on Monday—I consulted my solicitor, Mr. Pinkerton, and what steps I took were under his advice—if the prisoner received moneys on my account, it was his duty to pay them into the bank most unquestionably, all of them—if he received instruction from me to pay money into the bank, it was his duty so to do most unquestionably—this 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was one of the deficiencies that I first discovered—this check (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), has my signature—the body of it is in the prisoner's writing—it is for 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated the 23rd Oct, on Glynn, Mills, and Co.—it was drawn for rum and wine duties—the Custom House do not take checks—it was the prisoner's habit to get them cashed, and another clerk paid the duty—I directed the prisoner to get this check cashed—I saw him afterwards, and he stated he had got the check cashed—the amount of the rum duty was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the wine duty was 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making together 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not pay those moneys for them—I counteracted the order—looking at the payments I had to make, I said, "Don't pay that duty"—I told him to pay the money in again to the bankers—this is the rough pay-in bank book—all the sums that the-prisoner paid in it was his duty to enter in this book, the whole of them should appear here as they were paid in—on 25th Oct. here is paid in, rum duty, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the 4th Nov. here is an item, wine duty, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that ought to have been 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has never in any way accounted to me for that 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have looked through this book carefully, to see whether any such payment has been made, and there has not—until 19th Aug., when I looked</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He was to wind up the partnership affairs; there was some confusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that was the mistake of the Lord Mayor—I kept the prisoner to post the books—he was to have his salary continued—his duties were even lighter, in consequence of the termination of the partnership bringing the accounts in a very small compass—he was in my employ first—he was paid by Mr. Storey and me jointly, to act in winding up the affairs—besides that, he attended to my business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any wine duties due from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; those duties have not been paid at all—the check was differently prepared—I found my payments were more heavy than I anticipated, and I desired that the duties should not be paid—I did not desire that the notes he received should not be paid in at the banker's—I did not desire him to get other notes from the bank—I desired him to pay the money in again—I might have desired him to pay the money in at twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it you really directed him to do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "We will pay the money in; I see we can't easily spare it"—I said the second time, "I think you had better pay the wine duty in, and leave the rum duty"—that was all that I am aware of—I might have told him to pay it in at two payments—I did not authorize him to retain a small part of it—I gave him no authority, nor did I wish for or desire it—one portion was to be paid in by itself, the other to be paid in afterwards—he had got the cash from my bankers at that time—the cash was kept in his own tin, which he kept in hit desk—whatever money he received from me he had to put in the book, and it is acknowledged in the proper manner in this book, and the disbursement is not accounted for; he should have accounted for it in this red book, supposing it were not paid in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer. I am lodging at the Spread Eagle Tavern, Greenwich. I rent some ground at Westbourne-park, Blackheath—the prisoner occupied a lodge there, belonging to the estate—I had a room there for my use, where I was in the habit of leaving some clothes—I left there two carpet bags and a packing case, containing wearing apparel and a hamper containing wine and liquor—on Sunday, 11th Sept., I went there about 7 o'clock in the morning—I found that my packing case had been opened, and re-sewn with a thread—I missed from it a travelling cloak, a great coat, two waistcoats, and a pair of trowsers, which had been lying outside the packing case—there was a snuffbox in the pocket of the great coat—I had left the things all safe on Saturday evening, at 7 o'clock—the prisoner was there that Saturday evening—he came from his employ at the time I left—he was intoxicated—after missing the things on Sunday morning, I re-packed the package, and left the lodge—I returned at 3 o'clock, and then found the prisoner standing in the middle of my room, over the hamper, with a quart bottle of Hollands in his hand—he was intoxicated—the hamper had contained one quart bottle of Hollands and live pint bottles of port—I examined the hamper, and missed the five bottles of port and the Hollands, which he had in his hand—I then asked him what he was about; he said he did not know what he was about—he fetched me two pint bottles to put into the hamper, and asked if I wanted any more—I said, "Yes," be knew there was more—he was so very bad I could not be angry with him—I have never seen the other three bottles—about half of the bottle of Hollands was left; I have never seen the other half—I told the prisoner I had lost some things, but he seemed in a sort of stupor, as if he did not know what he was about—the hamper was secured with a proper hamper cord—I gave information to the police on the Monday evening, and the prisoner was apprehended on the Tuesday—he went away—his wife endeavoured to find the things.</p>

I have got hold of your legs"—I could not have held on any longer if Allen had not come—the water is about twenty feet deep there—it was nearly high water—Allen palled me on board, and the prisoner was given in charge—he had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—I went to the station with him—before he was taken, he caught hold of Allen by the hair of his bead, and said, "You b——r, I should like to drown you for saving the other"—the stern of the vessel from which I was thrown was from ten to fifteen feet from the pier.</p>

On 26th Aug., between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I was in a coffee-shop, in Wellington-street, Woolwich, in company with some sergeants of Artillery, taking coffee—the prisoner was not in our company at all; he was not in the same room as we were—I and one of the sergeants of Artillery had a discussion about English and Scotch; I said that there were as good Englishmen as Scotchmen; upon which the sergeant struck his hand on the table—my wife was there, and, in consequence of what passed between the sergeant and me, I and my wife went down stairs, and went out at the door—I had not got a yard from the door when I was struck right above the eye with a stick or umbrella, and knocked down—I called out, "They have knocked my eye out"—I became insensible for some time—I beard my wife moaning and crying—I went to Guy's Hospital, and am still an out patient—I had not spoken to the person who struck me—I do not know who struck me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, R</hi> 38). On 16th Aug., I received information. I went to Mr. Collins's house, in Greenwich—I ascertained that the prisoner lived there—I had seen him go to that house; I live just opposite the street—I found some books, with his name in them—I found a "Bradshaw's Railway Guide," with the leaf turned down right upon the express train which leaves London for Dover and the Continent—in consequence of that, I went to Calais and Lille—I saw the prisoner there—I followed him to the Hotel de I'Europe—I went into the room, and said to him, "Good morning, Mr. Henin!"—I looked at him, and said, "I suppose you know me?"—he said, "No, I don't"—I said, "My name is Carpenter, a sergeant of police, of Greenwich; I suppose you know the object of my mission?"—he said, I suppose you are coming after me for Mr. Wheatley's money?"—I said, "I have; and I hope you have not spent much of it;" he said, "I have not more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Where is the remainder?"—ha said, "I have it"—he unbuttoned his waistcoat and trowsers, and took from round his waist this belt, which contained a great deal of money, it was very heavy, and from his pocket he took this bag, which was also very heavy; it was full of French silver money—he gave me the key of his carpet bag, and told me the remainder was in there—he told me he had changed the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Belgian notes, and there were 460 francs in Belgian notes in the bag—he said they bad charged him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the exchange—just at that period the French police appeared, and asked for his passport—I saw the passport, and there was the name of John Thompson, London, 11th Aug.; I saw it, and heard it read—I said to the police, "That is not his name, it is John Henin;" they said if that was the case, they must take him before the com<lb/>missary</p>

               <p>—I said there was no need of that, he had given me the money, and was willing to go to England; but they insisted on it, and before the Magistrate they made me give up the money, and would not allow me to count it—I was going to open the carpet bag to look at the notes, and the Magistrate got up and took it from me, and locked it up in his cupboard, and he told me I must go to Paris and see the English ambassador, and get a letter of identity that I was an English officer, and then he would give me the prisoner and the money—I went to the English ambassador, got it, and the Magistrate said it was right, but he sent me to the Prefect, and he said he would not give me the prisoner nor the money—I came back, and found the prisoner on 13th Sept. in Westminster; I saw him coming, and stood on one side—when he came, I said, "What are you doing here? I thought you was in France;" he said, "No; I had my liberty on Friday or Saturday; they gave me my discharge, and gave me twenty francs"—I said, "Was that to pay your passage over?"—he said, "No, it was to pay some money that I had to pay; and I went to the minister of the English Church at Lille, and he gave me twelve francs"—when he was before the authorities in Lille, I charged him with having stolen 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a check for 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an acting surveyor of the Customs, and live at No. 83, Prince's-road, Bermondsey—I knew the deceased very well. On 11th April last, I saw him about 8 o'clock in the morning; we were on duty together during the whole of the day—he was my waterman—he appeared perfectly well that day—I had known him for sixteen years; he appeared a very healthy man—I was not then aware of his having received a gun-shot wound—I left him at the water-side between 4 and 5 o'clock that afternoon, and went home—I saw him again about 5 o'clock; he came to my house in company with the prisoner, who charged the deceased with having stolen a cloak, and also with having contraband goods in a bag which he was carrying—the deceased had a cloak with him; he was in uniform—I asked the prisoner who and what he was—he said that he was one of the detectives, and he wished to examine the bag, stating that the deceased had taken Jesse Wilson, and that he should be revenged—there is a person called Jesse Wilson, who has been several times convicted of smuggling—I told the prisoner to be quiet, and that if he was one of the detectives, we would go to the police station with him, and there he could examine the bag—we left for the purpose <hi rend="italic">of</hi> going to the station; when we had got about one hundred yards up the street, the prisoner asked if we intended to go to the police station; I told him that I was Gampton's superior officer, it was a very serious charge, and I should go there—upon that he came to a stand still all at once, and while the deceased was in the act of turning his face round, the prisoner struck him right and left on the head, and knocked him down; he hit him on both sides of the head—I cannot positively say whether he struck him on the face—after knocking</p>

               <p>him down he fell upon him—I laid hold of him to pull him off, and while I was pulling him away he kicked him, I think, in the chest, but I would not be certain where—when Gampton fell, he fell backwards—I think his head struck the ground—the blows were severe ones—while I had hold of the prisoner he attempted to strike me—I let him go, and he ran away—Gampton got up himself—he staggered as if he was in liquor—we both followed the prisoner, and saw him taken into custody by inspector Bolas—I did not know the prisoner before—I saw Gampton next morning, at the Southwark police court—he appeared very much agitated and in very great pain—he complained to me of pain in the head and face—I heard the prisoner say before the Magistrate that he was sorry for what had occurred, and he was tipsy—I saw Gampton twice afterwards before he left duty; he still complained of pain in the head and general weakness.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am medical inspector of the Customs. I knew the deceased very well for nearly seven years—I had ample opportunity of forming an opinion as to the state of his health—his general health was good; he came to me in the morning of 29th May last—I examined his head—above and behind the left ear there were faint marks of ecchymosis, in the last stage; I mean discoloration by the effusion of blood; I observed nothing else—he complained of intense pain on that side of the head—he had a faltering gait, and his vision was slightly impaired—I concluded that he was labouring under pressure on the brain, and I inferred that it was from violence from the discoloration: there had been a blow or violence of some kind—I ordered him home immediately, to be kept quiet in a dark room, and I saw him again in the evening—he was then in bed—I continued to attend him until 1st July—on commencing my attendance upon him I immediately put him under a course of treatment, under which he seemed, for some time, to recover—the treatment was directed to the pressure on the brain—he seemed to improve considerably for about a week—he was kept perfectly quiet in a dark room—about 11th or 12th June the symptoms turned, the legs became again very tremulous, his speech faltered, and his reason began to be affected—he gradually grew worse after that; his reason became gradually more impaired, the symptoms of paralysis or palsy increased, the urine and other dejections were occasionally passed in bed, and he became</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he in a very excitable condition on 29th May, When you saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rather so, not particularly; he had the excitement of irritative fever from the compression, none beyond that—I attributed it to pressure on the brain at that time—I applied no surgical means to relieve that—an injury to the spinal marrow would not produce the same effects; it would produce a different class of symptoms; it would not affect the nerves of the brain, it would produce paralysis of the limbs—it might secondarily affect the brain sympathetically—the discoloration was the only outward symptom; that might have resulted from any force applied to the surface—I did not think it desirable to bleed him—he was not very bright when be first came to me; that is to say, he answered hesitatingly, and his memory seemed to be deficient—it was about 11th or 12th June that he began to get incoherent—he was not of a delicate habit of body, he was a man of good frame; his general health was good up to 11th April—he had occasionally a cold or diarrhoea, and things incident to most men—I was not then aware that he had received a gun-shot wound some years before—I am now aware of it; I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident medical officer of St. Luke's Hospital. I saw the deceased there on 1st July—he had delusions both of sight and hearing, and he had a reeling, faltering gait, like a drunken man—his speech was hesitating, a good deal affected, and his manner was nervous and agitated—he was evidently suffering from pressure on the brain, or it might hare been <hi rend="italic">disintegration</hi> of the brain, some morbid alteration of structure—I examined him every day—I examined his head, I think, the morning after he came in—I observed a little thickening under the scalp, which was the remaining evidence of a bruise—I put him under a course of treatment generally; to relieve the symptoms of the head—he gradually improved after the first few days up to the commencement of Aug., when we considered him well—he was to have been discharged about the 19th of that month—after the 8th a change took place, he gradually became more dull—he did not seem to be very joyful at the idea of going out, and then symptoms of pressure on the brain again gradually appeared; he got worse—he was treated for it unsuccessfully, and he died on 17th Aug.—I afterwards made an examination of his head and body—there was nothing material the matter with the body—on removing the scalp I found a shot flattened on the frontal bone, just over the right eye; it was about one-eighth of an inch in diameter, or rather more, as it was flattened—it did not penetrate the skull—I removed the skull cap, and on opening the dura mater I discovered a large clot of blood in the arachnoid membrane, the next membrane to the dura mater—the arachnoid is a double membrane, and the clot was between the two layers of the arachnoid; it occupied almost the whole of the surface of the left hemisphere of the brain—the pressure on the brain from that would be very great indeed—I think that pressure was quite sufficient to account for the symptoms I observed—that clot of blood had arisen from the rupture of a vessel of the brain—I have no doubt at all about it—it must have been caused by a blow of some kind; a blow on any part of the head sufficiently violent would do it—I could not form an opinion as to the exact time at which that clot had been formed, but it must have been some time, because it was partially invested in a false membrane; it occupied the whole of the left side of the head, some part of it was under the mark—in the <hi rend="italic">pons varolii</hi> I found another</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190101"/>
               <p>clot of blood; that is at the base of the brain—that was also an old one in the process of absorption—it was about the centre of the middle of the base of the brain—my opinion is that was caused by the same violence that caused the other—they were simultaneous—that would no doubt affect the gait; the latter perhaps more particularly, as that part is supposed to preside over the motion of the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the shot anything to do with the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing on earth; or with the appearances I observed in the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If I understand you rightly, when first you saw him all you could say was that some morbid action had set in in the brain; you could not tell whether it was a morbid disease, or the result of violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it was not easy to say at that time whether it was the result of disintegration or not—I did not find any vessel of the brain ruptured, but that might have escaped me—vessels of the brain may be ruptured by great excitement without any actual violence, if the vessels are diseased—emotion would hardly rupture a healthy vessel; strong emotion, or excitement, might do so. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the large clot of blood covered the surface of the membrane; supposing that clot of blood had been the result of a blow, do you think a man could attend to his business, labouring under that for five or six weeks afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes, probably be might; perhaps not with so much effusion as he had when he died, but with a great amount of effusion—the amount I found killed him—I am hardly able to say whether, he could have continued attending to his business with that amount of effusion, he might; the brain bears a great deal of equal pressure; no morbid action bad been set up in the brain, nothing organic—I have no doubt the effusion was in some measure absorbed or relieved in the first instance, and there was subsequently an increased effusion, probably from the same cause; it might have been from some other cause—he had no other blow while with me—he was not subject to violent fits—I attended him continually up to the time of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What length of time would account for the false membrane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say such a membrane might have been formed in a couple of months perhaps, or three months, they vary very much—from finding no rupture, I concluded that the effusion was from a very small vessel; it very often happens that you cannot find the aperture—if a large vessel had been ruptured the pressure on the brain would have been more sudden, and would have destroyed life sooner—finding no rupture, I should conclude that it was slowly progressing; under those circumstances a man would be more likely to be able to go about his business, and we should have the better chance of relieving it; it might afterwards go on increasing.</p>

On Thursday, 15th Sept., about a quarter to 3 o'clock in the morning, I was in the York-road, Lambeth, going home—I saw Clark come up to me; he approached me from behind; he put his right hand on my shoulder, and his left hand on my mouth—then Howe comes up—he came from behind also; I had not seen either of them at that time—Howe <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and hit me in my right eye—he came round in front of me to do that; he hit mc very severely—I did not fall—I just had power to</p>

I was on duty about a quarter to 3 o'clock last Thursday morning in Manor-street, York-road, Lambeth—I heard a cry of "Police!" proceeding from the corner of Sutton-street—I saw the prisoner Clark running from the cries, with another man dressed as a coalheaver—I am not able to say whether Howe was the other man—I could not swear to him, the street was dark—I caught hold of Clark, and held him—he said, "Let me go, I am after him"—I had been in the street for some time, I suppose ten minutes, and no one had passed between the time of the cry of "Stop thief!" till Clark came up—he ran up to me—I met both of them in the street, running—the other man continued running, and escaped—I held Clark, and he said again, "Let me go, I am after him"—I held him till the prosecutor came up—he said, "That is one of the men that robbed me"—Clark replied, "You are a false man to accuse me"—I then sprang my rattle, and my brother constable Fermeger came up—I told him what I had seen, and he went after the other man, and while the charge was being taken against Clark, Howe was brought in—the prosecutor directly pointed to him, and said, "You are the other man"—Howe said he was not the man, it was a falsehood—I searched Clark, and found on him one shilling, two sixpences, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—after locking Clark up I went back to the spot where I had taken Clark into custody, searched, and found this pocket, and part of a waistband of trowsers, containing a half crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—it was within a yard of where I took Clark, and about twenty yards from where I heard the cry of "Stop thief!"—both the men ran in the same direction out of Vine-street into Manor-street—they ran down Sutton-street, and turned the first turning into Manor-street—I met them at the corner of Manor-street—Manor-street leads into Vinestreet—it is near the Belvedere-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer's assistant, at Walworth. On Sunday evening 14th Aug., I was opposite the King's Head in Walworth-road, about five minutes before 11 o'clock—I had a watch in my left hand waistcoat pocket, and a purse, and some money in it in my other pocket—I was standing still against a post—the prisoner Jones passed behind me, and she said, "Well, my dear, where are you going?"—I said I was going in—she said, "Will you take a walk a little distance?"—I walked with her a little distance down the Walworth-road, and into York-street—when we got there she said, "Just come up here a little way"—there is a turning there, called James-street—I went in that turning with her, about six or seven yards from the corner, she then placed one of her hands under my waistcoat—I placed my hand on my pocket, where my purse was—my watch was secured by a guard round my neck—a shortish young man passed just at the same time that the female was talking to me, and I had my hand on my purse—that was a short young man, not the male prisoner—as soon as the young man had passed, the female placed her hand on my watch guard—she took the watch out of my pocket—I saw her break it from the swivel of my guard—I got hold of her wrist directly, and said, "You have taken my watch"—she said, "I have not got your watch"—I said, "You have"—and I was trying to get it from her, and the male prisoner came from the corner and knocked me down while I was trying to get the watch from the female prisoner—I had not seen anybody at the corner before he appeared and knocked me down—I pulled the woman down with me when I fell, and the man placed his hand</p>

               <p>across my throat, and he said, "You ought to be ashamed to strike your wife in this manner"—I had not struck her at all, but I kept hold of her wrist and tried to get the watch from her—the man placed his hand on my mouth—I turned my head, and called "Murder!"—some people came up, and as I got up I let go the woman—the man made his escape, and the woman followed him—she left her shawl and handkerchief behind her, but not the watch—I took the shawl and handkerchief, and went after her—I overtook her, and said, "You have taken my watch out of my pocket"—she said, "I have not"—I caught hold of her, and a man said, "Hold her tight, I will go for a constable"—I held her till the constable came up.</p>

The prisoner came in about five minutes past 2 o'clock; he asked the barman if he would give him a half crown for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bit, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the barman said, "You want to <hi rend="italic">best</hi> me"—the barman gave him the half crown, and he went away, and about ten minutes afterwards I saw him, facing Mr. Nicholls's house, in custody—I saw him knock something out of Mr. Nicholls's hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rotherhithe. On 30th Aug., about 6 o'clock in the afternoon, I was at Trinity-wharf, and saw Murphy cutting the lead off a cistern, which was sunk in the ground—he tied the lead up in a blue handkerchief, and went away with it till he came to Cow-lane—he went down there—there is a marine store shop there—Alexander Smith was with me, but he only saw him tie the lead up—he went and brought a policeman, and we went with him to Hulkin's shop in Cow-lane, and saw Murphy there in the shop, between the front door and the passage, which leads into the back room—he had a match in his band, and his pipe—I am sure he is the man—he worked on the next wharf, about three days before—I saw Hulkins in the shop close to Murphy, and then they shut the door.</p>

I was with Calnon, and saw Murphy, who I knew by sight, cutting the lead; he tied it in a blue handkerchief, and went down the wharf to Cow-lane—I got a constable, and we all went to Cow-lane, and saw Murphy in Hulkin's passage; the constable went up to him, but I did not hear what he said.</p>

On Monday, 15th Aug., a little after 12 o'clock, I came out of the Sportsman beer<lb/>shop, with Charles Hook, Edward Goldspink, and the prisoner—I and Hook left and went home, leaving Goldspink and the prisoner standing there by Mr. Fenton's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ingledon-street, Brixton, and am a labourer. I came out of the Sportsman with Hook and the prisoner, we stood by Mr. Fenton's shop—Hook and Rhodes left, and I remained with the prisoner—I was looking at the Vauxhall fireworks, and in a few minutes I heard a window smash, and saw the prisoner at Mr. Fenton's window alone—he came towards me, and told me that he had put his handkerchief round his fist, took his cap in his hand, and thrust it into the window—I pasted on, he walked by my side, and when I got into Ingleton-street, where I lift, he said, "If I take the things I wish you to shift them, to take them of me"—I said, "No, John, I will not have anything to do with it"—I then went borne—I saw the prisoner again next day, and told him that an officer was after him to take him into custody—he said the things were at his own home, and directly after that he left the beer shop and went away—I had not seen Rhodes, or a policeman, or made any communication; as the next day I had to go to Blackwall, I did not come back till evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me break the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but there was nobody there but you—I would not swear you broke it—I did not tee you take anything from it—I did not stay till the prosecutor came home and give information, because I did not want to have anything to do with it whatever—I was not taken into custody on 16th Aug.—I went to the station with you, and denied knowing anything about it, that was because I did not wish to harm you—I did not appear at the first examination, at Kennington-lane, because I had got too much drink overnight—I was compelled to state what I knew in order <hi rend="italic">to</hi> clear myself.</p>

On 15th Aug., about twenty minutes past 12 o'clock, I passed the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner and Goldspink a short distance from each other—the prisoner was nearest to the prosecutor's house—he was close by the front of the window, and Goldspink was about five yards from him—the Vauxhall fireworks were going off, and Goldspink was looking at them—the prosecntor's window was then quite safe—I went round again, about twenty minutes to 1 o'clock to see, and found it broken, so as to give access to the things in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, of No. 29, Robert-street, Brixton. I went out on this night, leaving my window safe—I returned a little before 1 o'clock, and found a pane of glass broken—there was no shutter up—I missed several brooches, a pair of hair bracelets, and other common jewellery, which had been in a glass case in the window; a person putting their hand in could lift up the lid and take them—I have not found any of them—it is my dwelling house, and is in the parish of Lambeth—I lost some shirt studs and waistcoat buttons, and some of the same description have been shown to me by the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you examine the shop that night, to see whatyouhad lost? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because I considered some person had fallen against it—I put the shutters up—I remember your coming to the shop next day, to ask me something about a pipe—I did not say anything to you about the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> If Goldspink was standing at the short distance of three or four yards he must have seen me break the window; but when he was taken to the station he strongly denied all knowledge of it, and of me as well; he never appeared at Kennington-lane, and I got a remand for the opportunity of getting him to state what he stated at the station, and when he came he stated a different thing altogether; he is rather a light character, and has been sent to Wandsworth, and there is a man in Court who can prove that he was found early one morning at the back of a gentleman's house for an unlawful purpose.</p>
