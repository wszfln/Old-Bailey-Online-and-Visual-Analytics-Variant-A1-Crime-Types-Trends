            , who was committed as a principal in the forgery, has since been carried before the Grand Jury for the county of Middlesex, by an order that is supposed to be obtained from this Court, and hath before that Grand Jury been examined as a witness against Dr. Dodd; how that order was obtained it is immaterial for me to state to your lordships; it is sufficient for me to find that a gentleman in the commission, who was upon the bench, actuated by a very laudable spirit of preserving the dignity of the Court, and to prevent the Court's being imposed upon, mentioned it to your lordships, and, in consequence of its being so mentioned, that order has since been formally vacated by the Court; it therefore stands now as a certain fact, that a witness committed as a principal in the crime has been carried, without any legal authority, before the Grand Jury of the county of Middlesex, and hath there been permitted to give evidence against the prisoner now standing at the bar: it is obvious to every man who hears the fact stated, that it is incumbent upon the witness so admitted to exculpate himself, and to throw the whole weight and load of the guilt upon the gentleman now at the bar. Such evidence it is the genius of our law, and has been the humanity of all courts of criminal judicature, never to receive, because they have always acted upon this principle, that supposing the guilt of the party accused to be undeniable, yet the proof of that guilt shall not be received through polluted channels; as I take that to be the uniform practice of all courts of criminal judicature, I trust the same construction will hold with your lordships. It is impossible to know what passes before a Grand Jury, every thing that is transacted there is transacted under a solemn oath of secrecy, and therefore never can come forth to the world: it cannot be alledged by the gentlemen who are of counsel for the prosecution that it was unnecessary to have Robertson as a witness, because the materiality or immateriality of the evidence given by him to the Grand Jury must be perfectly a secret; but however it is fair inference and fair argument to say, that the gentlemen who conducted this prosecution conceived it to be material to have Robertson's evidence, otherwise there was no necessity for that extraordinary exertion to get him there, unless in their judgment and in their apprehension he might be a material evidence to support the charge against Dr. Dodd. My Lords, I say, upon such grounds, I trust it is fair argument in me to suppose that he was a witness materially necessary for the carrying on of this prosecution, and fixing upon the prisoner the guilt the indictment imputes to him, and that without his evidence the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190005"/> guilt could not be brought home to him; I trust it is extremely clear, that Robertson ought not to have been admitted as a witness before the Grand Jury. Suppose a bill of indictment was brought before your lordships, and a prisoner was called upon to plead to it, and it appeared to your lordships that there was but one witness on the back of the bill, which witness also appeared to be an accomplice, and had been committed as a principal in the guilt, that would appear, upon the face of it, to be a bill found by a Grand Jury who are not supposed to be competent judges of law, they are only judges of fact, and the probable guilt of a prisoner is a sufficient ground for them to find a bill; but, I say, supposing it appeared, that that bill was found upon the oath of a person, who by the laws of this country ought not to be received as a witness, or at least, supposing him to be received as a witness, whose evidence never can, never has, and, I trust, never will convict any person, your lordships would not, in such a case, I conceive, put the prisoner to plead to or answer that indictment; it may be answered to me here, that there are a great many other witnesses on the back of this bill; that it does not appear here what the evidence given by Robertson was, whether there was enough to find a bill against Dr. Dodd or not; I trust that will be no objection; what passed before the Grand Jury must necessarily be a profound secret; it is enough for me to say that there appears on the back of this bill, as a witness a person, who was committed as a principal, and who ought to have answered as a principal at the bar of this Court. He has been carried up to the Grand Jury by an order surreptitiously obtained, which order the Court have shewn a just disapprobation of, and have in truth vacated; therefore I trust, in such a case, the law of this country will not permit any prisoner at the bar to be put upon this country; and if the rigid law of this country will not permit it, I am too much acquainted with your lordships humanity to suppose your lordships will permit it.</p>
               <p>Mr. COWPER. - Will your lordships please to favour me a few words in support of the motion that has been made by Mr. Howarth, that Dr. Dodd may not be called upon to plead to the bill of indictment that is now found against him, and that that bill may be quashed; and my Lords, it is upon that general ground that the bill of indictment has received the sanction of the Grand Jury of Middlesex, in consequence of evidence having been adduced before them that ought not there to have been produced or heard. The principles upon which we who are of counsel for the prisoner mean to support this idea do not at all combat the general rules of law, with respect to admitting of accomplices evidence, the attaining justice in a degree through the assistant evidence of those who are partners in the crime, under particular circumstances and in particular cases, is very often found to be necessary; but those circumstances and the situation of the party, who is so admitted an evidence, must appear either to the committing magistrate who selects one, perhaps less attainted with the guilt than another, for the purpose of assisting the prosecution, or to the Court who are to try the prisoner; where there have been instances of the Court directing one of the persons committed for the offence to be admitted as an evidence: but, my Lords, except in one or the other of these situations, where a person is brought before a magistrate and charged as a principal, where, upon the face of the instrument, there is every evidence to shew that he is a principal, where the magistrate upon the hearing of the evidence before him commits him as a principal, and where this Court have refused to admit him to the advantage that the situation of an evidence against the prisoner would give him; I submit to your lordships that Robertson's evidence under these circumstances was improperly carried before the Grand Jury, I will not say more than improperly, that is sufficient, it is not necessary to cast any reflection upon the prosecution, it is not necessary to cast any reflection upon the officer of the Court; it suffices us to say, that Mr. Robertson's evidence has been improperly, and in an unbecoming manner conveyed to Hicks's-hall, and there submitted to the Grand Jury, and upon that evidence, together with the testimony of other persons, this bill of indictment is found against Dr. Dodd. My Lords, the gentlemen on the other side of the question will not surely attempt gravely to tell your lordships that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190006"/> this might have been obtained without the interposition of a magistrate, or without obtaining an order from the Court, because if they do, they will be reduced to the necessity of arguing against their own conduct. Why were the prosecutors to come to the court? your lordships are not to give them advice; your lordships are not counsel in any prosecution; they applied to receive that sanction which they conceived, and I apprehend they conceived very rightly, was necessary for them to obtain, namely, an order for the conveyance of Mr. Robertson before the Grand Jury; however they misunderstood, or however they misrepresented, the answer that your lordships so justly gave to that application I do not know; but still, not departing from the idea that the interposition of this Court was necessary to the conveyance of Robertson before the Grand Jury, an order was obtained for this person, whom the prosecutors were bound over to prosecute capitally, to be carried before the Grand Jury. My Lords, it will be unnecessary to comment upon that order, it has been already stigma tized by the Court itself; it has been discharged, and it has been discharged as surreptitiously obtained; why then, my Lords, have I any proposition that needs an argument to maintain it, when I state this bare fact, that in consequence of an order now discharged by the Court, now declared by the Court to have been surreptitiously obtained by this means alone did Robertson's evidence come before the Grand Jury; what Robertson swears, whether he swears any thing material, or swore nothing that was material, whether the Grand Jury credited or disbelieved his evidence, whether they found the bill upon any part of his testimony, or found it solely upon the testimony of others, is totally out of the present case, because that fact remains and must remain in perfect secrecy; for the Grand Jury have not only an oath of secrecy imposed upon them, but if it were the Jury that sit there trying the prisoners your lordships would not permit any incompetent or illegal evidence to go before that Jury, however immaterial, because it is impossible for your lordships ever to say what degree of influence a piece of immaterial evidence might have upon the mind of any person whatsoever; it would be your lordships duty, and I am sure would be the conduct of the Court upon such an occasion, to take care that the Jury should hear no such evidence. Thus it stands with regard to the present bill of indictment, such was the situation of Mr. Robertson committed as a principal, and the parties bound over to prosecute him with effect; what have they done? In a case of forgery that came before this Court not a great while ago, that occasioned a very considerable consideration of the subject of admitting persons as evidence, and what safety the person should derive from being so admitted an evidence, great doubts, I believe arose. At one time I can venture to say that there were differences of opinion amongst your lordships, with regard to the propriety of admitting a person as evidence, and with regard to the advantages that were to be derived to the person so admitted as an evidence; then, upon that subject so difficult to define, so important in its consequences, and so delicate in its nature, the mistake of the prosecutor, together with the mistake of the officer of the Court (for I will call it no more) is at once to remove every difficulty, every obstruction whatever, and to take

             out of the situation of being committed as a principal in, and liable to be tried for that fact, to be admitted an evidence against a person by which he is to exculpate, and totally to indemnify himself from the consequence of that charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. BULLER. - My Lords, I am of counsel on the same side with Mr. Howarth and Mr. Cowper. It is the established law of this land, that no man shall be put upon his trial for any offence, unless there be a bill first properly found by a Grand Jury; I say properly found, for if there be any objection whatsoever to the finding of the indictment, and the most familiar that is to be found in our books are those that go to the objection of the Grand Jury; for instance, where only one person of the Grand Jury has been incompetent, where only eleven of the Jury have found the bill, that therefore it shall not be tried; I take it the objections go universally; I am aware that the objections I have been alluding to, and which are particularly stated in Lord Hale, go to the Grand Jury only; but I will beg leave to consider whether the reason that governs the one does not govern the other. Another case put by Lord Hale is this; if one of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190007"/> Grand Jury is outlawed, these objections go to the persons of the Grand Jury: I am aware that that is not the present objection; but I will beg leave, with your lordships permission, to consider whether this does not fall within the same reason; for I cannot conceive that the law, which is so peculiarly watchful over the personal qualifications of the Grand Jury, should not be equally attentive to the evidence which is laid before them, and upon which they are to decide the fate of the bill which is offered to their consideration: I take it to be as essential to the finding of, the bill that the evidence offered to the Grand Jury should be such as the law allows, as it is when the indictment afterwards comes to be tried before your lordships; and if that rule holds, I trust I shall have very little difficulty in convincing your lordships that this bill has been improperly found. My Lords, the prosecutor has thought it so material to admit Mr.

             a witness in this cause, that though, in my humble apprehension, he stands in a much more criminal light than the prisoner at the bar, yet they have thought fit to bargain with him, to let him off from a capital felony of the most dangerous sort to society, the most peculiarly so from his situation in life of any man that can be charged with such an offence. Mr. Robertson stands in this business as a sworn broker of the city of London, as such it was his peculiar duty to preserve good faith between man and man; he is bargained with by the prosecutor to be let off in a case where he stands upon the appearance against him now as the most criminal, for the purpose of procuring evidence against the prisoner at the bar. My Lords, if that evidence be improper, there remains but one thing more to be enquired into, that is, whether your lordships can say that that evidence has not had an improper effect when it was admitted before the Grand Jury: it is not improbable that the bill might be found wholly upon his evidence; if I have a right to assume that as a fact, because the prosecutor has thought it material and absolutely necessary to produce him before the Grand Jury, why then your lordships sitting here cannot say but this indictment may have been found upon his evidence only; if it be so, is

               <p>"for a burglary, and (by the advice</p>

               <p>"which he confessed, but was not indicted</p>
               <p>"for the other felony." Here he was admitted, because he confessed himself guilty. The passage before that in Lord Hale seems to me still stronger:</p>
               <p>"If two defendants be</p>
               <p>"charged with a crime, one shall not be</p>
               <p>"examined against the other to convict him</p>
               <p>"of an offence, unless the party examined</p>
               <p>"confess himself guilty." Now, has Robertson confessed himself guilty? No, he has not; then there is an express authority by Lord Hale, that not having done it he is no witness, he does not stand in that predicament which Lord Hale states the man to be there. He says, that they were both charged with the crime; that is the case here; the prisoner and Robertson were both committed for the same crime; he stands now charged with that crime, and he has not pleaded guilty; therefore upon this authority I take it to be clear, that he cannot be admitted a witness upon the trial, and if not, I must leave it to the ingenuity of the learned counsel to shew why a man, who the law says shall not be a witness upon the trial, shall be admitted a witness to find the bill upon, against a man whom there is no other evidence to affect.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - I am to trouble your lordships in answer to this objection, which to me is perfectly new, which to me is totally unlike any that I have ever read or heard of; and I find that the gentlemen who here support this objection, very properly don't produce before your lordships any one instance in which such an attempt was ever made, much less an instance in which such an attempt succeeded; for myself, and for those for whom I stand here, as they have no wishes upon this subject but that justice should have its course, they certainly will not desire me, nor should I find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190008"/> myself at all inclined to give any resistance to the motion that is made, if I did not think that the very proceeding required it, and that the objection is without the least appearance of any legal foundation. I perceive, my Lords, the objection, as it is made, to Dr. Dodd being put upon his trial on this indictment is, that there is a witness supposed to be improperly carried before the Grand Jury, and that witness, when carried before the Grand Jury, is supposed to be so situated and circumstanced that he ought not to be heard, and your lordships are desired, for the first time, almost, I believe, in the history of English judicature, to enquire and consider to what evidence the Grand Jury gave attention, and whether, upon the whole, it appeared to them that there was fit ground to find the bill. My Lords, I have always understood that for the sake, not of bringing men to punishment, but for the sake of defending them, and for the protection of Englishmen, that it was the sole and exclusive privilege of a Grand Jury to judge, not whether a man was guilty, but whether such circumstances appeared against a man accused of a crime that he ought to be put upon trial; and this is so peculiarly and exclusively the province of a Grand Jury, that your lordships are not only forbid, by law, yourselves, to know or presume, what evidence influences the Grand Jury, but they themselves are restrained by an oath from disclosing that evidence; they are to enquire and to judge whether a man ought to be tried, whether such grounds of suspicion (for suspicion is enough to find a bill) appear against a man accused, that he ought to be brought before another Jury to receive a conviction or acquittal; and as that is the province of the Grand Jury, it is no wonder that this is the first attempt, I believe, to desire of a court of judicature, who is to try the indictment found, to declare whether the Grand Jury have or have not had sufficient evidence before them to justify them in saying,</p>
               <p>'We think this gentleman ought to be put upon his trial;' for that is all that they have said. My lords, I should have thought this a very full and sufficient answer to the objection, if something had not been said which makes it, for the sake, not of the motion itself, but of the parties concerned, and of those who have acted different parts in it, to say something more to your lordships, as well too as to take notice of some which appear to be indeed very dangerous doctrines that I have heard delivered upon this occasion. One grand and indeed principal objection, as I before observed, to this witness is, that he was improperly carried before the Grand Jury;</p>
               <p>"improperly carried," I think are the words used; and the impropriety consists in this, that an order was obtained for carrying the body of this

             before the Grand Jury, there to be a witness, and then to be brought back again to the gaol of this Court: that that order was improperly obtained, there is no doubt; I am not at liberty now to dispute it; at the same time, though it certainly was improperly obtained, and was obtained from a mere mistake upon an idea that the proceeding was regular, though it certainly was not, but at the same time it is well known to some that hear me, who are acquainted with the business, that it was a matter of course, if the prisoner had been in another gaol; for if he had been in another gaol, and not in that of this Court, your lordships know an Habeas Corpus might have been applied for, and must have been obtained, to carry him before the Grand Jury; as he happens to be in this Court in which the indictment is to be tried, instead of having an Habeas Corpus the Court is to be applied to for a simple order to carry him before the Grand Jury, and your lordships order is regularly granted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice GOULD. - You do not put that as a motion of mere course?</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - Whether there may possibly exist cases in which the Court will not permit, I will not go so far as to say, there may be, I don't know that there are; because this I am sure of, that if the prisoner was in another gaol, and his evidence was wanted before a Grand Jury, that the prosecutor upon applying for an Habeas Corpus might have it most certainly; if there may be cases in which it would not be admitted, they must in truth be of a very extraordinary nature: this order of your lordships has been talked of as if, when it was obtained, it gave some weight and effect to this man's testimony; but your lordships know that you neither do nor can make a man a witness, a man is or not a witness<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190009"/> by the law of England; that your lordships cannot make or alter; but you administer, and administer it wisely; but it is the law of England says, whether a man can or not be admitted a witness; if that law says, he cannot, it is not in the power of all the courts of judicature in this kingdom to make him; on the contrary, if he is a legal witness, no Court can say he shall not be; and the only purport of this order is to remove the body of the prisoner Robertson, and the only effect of it as it seems to me is this, that the gaoler, who would otherwise be exceedingly blameable in admitting the prisoner out of his gaol, is excused from all fault in so doing; let me suppose this man had escaped from the gaol, and had then gone before the Grand Jury, is it to be doubted that if he was by law a competent witness, that his evidence might be received wherever he offers himself as a witness, though he had escaped from gaol? and your lordships order goes simply to the fact of the gaoler carrying the body of this prisoner before the Grand Jury; and the only difference seems to me, that the gaoler carrying the prisoner out of the gaol without permission from the Court, he might have behaved improperly, but however the witness himself as to his competency could not possibly be affected by the manner in which he went before the Grand Jury: I have heard it said indeed to-day that it may depend upon the Court, that it may depend upon the committing magistrate, whether an accomplice shall be a witness or not; I know of no such law; I know it may depend upon the Court whether a man who has been used as a witness and is afterward attempted to be tried; whether in the judgment of the Court he is to be put upon his trial; or whether the manner in which he has been used as a witness does entitle him to be excused from prosecution; so a magistrate sometimes advises a person to be admitted as a witness who is an accomplice, and who is perhaps at the same time in gaol; he takes a recognizance from him to appear as an evidence; the Court will afterwards consider whether that person has acted so properly as to be excused from a trial; but this is the first time that I have heard it said that the competency of a witness depended upon any magistrate of this kind, and as high and great a regard as I have for your lordships sitting here, I should be very sorry, for one, to have the law of England so changed, that it might depend upon the discretion of judges, and not upon the fixed rules of law, whether a man shall be a witness or not. Thus much upon the first objection, that this man was improperly carried before the Grand Jury; whether he was properly, or whether he was improperly carried is to this point we are now considering totally immaterial; the persons who were guilty of improperly carrying him, those who without legal authority procured the gaoler to let him go, may be worthy of censure; but as to the competency of the witness himself it seems to me to make no sort of difference. I am sorry, my learned friend who last spoke, introduced into this cause something of which you cannot take notice, but which seems to me to cast reflections upon those for whom I am concerned, whom I know are not worthy of such reflections, and the account given by Robertson is, that what he did was totally founded in mistake; in answer to which it is necessary for me to say something, and I will say as little as I can, though I should be justified in saying a great deal more: the argument supposes, at least, that Robertson was as great a criminal as any other person accused, nay, that he was the principal offender; I, who know as much, I believe, as any body can know of this cause, am very far from entertaining that opinion of Robertson; for though I think he acted blameably; yet as there are degrees of guilt, as far as the matter is understood by me, Robertson is considered as almost innocent, for I am perfectly satisfied that Robertson was really persuaded that the bond was genuine; this however does not appear before your lordships, and therefore should not be mentioned; I speak it only because I would not have those for whom I stand suffer from a reflection which is perfectly unmerited, and those persons too are incapable of making any bargain with Robertson or any other man, in order to bring about any thing improper in this or any cause, but especially in one like this, where the life of a person is concerned; it was thought proper, it was by my advice, and that is enough to excuse all others concerned in the business, that Robertson should be received as a witness; now as to Robertson being guilty or having acted a criminal part, the whole of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190010"/> argument your lordships see assumed is, how does your lordships know, or how can you know what part Robertson acted?</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice WILLES. - All that we know is, he is committed for the same crime, we do not assume it, but we judge from his commitment that he is equally guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - He is committed for the same crime; is it for a court of justice without evidence, or hearing a circumstance of the matter, to know that the magistrate is justified in committing him for that crime, that there was evidence to find him guilty, or that he may not be perfectly innocent? I have never yet heard that the commitment by a magistrate is in any place a presumption of guilt against a man who is committed; it cannot be; it never is heard of in any instance at all that appears; and all that is stated with regard to Robertson, is, that he is committed for the same crime, and so might the most innocent man alive be; nay, innocent men are committed, and consequently upon the commitment of a man for a capital crime, it is the magistrate's duty to bind by recognizance the person that appears to prosecute him who is so committed; the recognizance, as it seems to me, makes no difference in the case at all, because it is the necessary consequence of the commitment; as no magistrate can be justified in committing a man for a capital crime, who does not also bind the person who appears as prosecutor by recognizance, to prosecute the person committed: all that appears before your lordships, is, that this man is committed for the same crime that Dr. Dodd is; there is, as I say, no evidence at all before your lordships of the guilt of this man, that can be taken as any thing like evidence; for this is the first time I ever heard it suggested in a court, that a man who was committed for a crime, was by that commitment disenabled from being a witness; I never heard of such a doctrine being insinuated; suppose it now appears, which it does not, nor can it, that Robertson was equally guilty with Dr. Dodd; I will suppose it, that it appeared that it was possible for any man to know without forming presumption (which he is not authorized to form) that Robertson is equally guilty with Dr. Dodd. I will suppose it appeared so: why is it not the practice in this Court every sessions? where accomplices in the greatest crimes are admitted as witnesses, they are admitted with a degree of reserve, who by their single testimony cannot convict a person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice GOULD - I wish to see the opinion upon the subject which is in print *; I recollect where the dividing line was there; I held, that the justice of peace, by a constant and established practice, and I have seen things since to confirm that, particularly a very learned treatise by the late Mr. Fielding, concerning the growth and encrease of robberies; he lays it down as a known practice, that they do judge upon all the circumstances appearing before them, which of the criminals to admit as the witness, that matter was dissented from by ten of the twelve judges; but as I understood their opinion to be, it was then to be in the direction, not of the justice of peace, but in the direction of the court of gaol delivery, where it was found necessary, which of the persons committed for a capital crime should be admitted as a witness; I believe Mr. Reynolds was present when that opinion was delivered; he told me, according to his remembrance, that was said by the learned judge here. * Vide The first number of the first sessions in the last mayoralty, and an account of the arguments of counsel, with the opinion of the Judges on Mrs. Rudd's case, by J. GURNEY.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - The question then was solely upon the privilege of Mrs. Rudd, not upon the competency as a witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice GOULD. - The true reason of that decision was, that that was a matter for the discretion of the justice o f peace, to hold forth an absolute indemnity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice WILLES. - I am of opinion the judges went upon the general principle, that in that case, the inferior magistrate was to exercise a discretion. - Mr. Mansfield before you go on, I would mention, that the argument on the part of the prisoner points itself very strong this way, that no person committed for the same offence shall be allowed to be an evidence against a co-criminal without the interference of some legal authority, and in this case, there is no legal authority authorizing him to be a witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190011"/>Mr. MANSFIELD. - With regard to the case of Mrs. Rudd, it never was made a doubt, whether Mrs. Rudd could be a witness; but the question was, Mrs. Rudd's having been in fact taken and tried as a witness by the magistrate, whether she should be considered as entitled to an indemnity which should screen her from prosecution; and that I apprehended was the only question so in the general opinion expressed by the judges; I never conceived or apprehended, that it was meant to be considered by the judges, whether they could or could not say a criminal, an accomplice, should or should not be a witness; they can say, when the person is brought before them to be tried, whether they shall hold him entitled to favour or prevent his being convicted; they can say too, where the prosecutors, who are bound by recognizance to prosecute a person committed, shall be relieved from that recognizance, because they have thought proper not to prosecute the man, but use him as a witness; but it is now to me, if it is to depend upon the discretion of the judges, whether an accomplice is a competent witness, for that is the argument made use of here. It is to depend upon the discretion of the judges, whether an accomplice is a competent witness; now that position is utterly new to me; all the favours that a man derives from being a witness, all the consequential steps which are to affect the prosecutor, one way or the other for not prosecuting all those, must depend upon the discretion and judgment of the Court, at the time when that matter comes before them; but as to the admission of a witness as to the question of his competency, I do apprehend it must depend, not upon the discretion of the Court, but upon the rules of law, with regard to the present question. What is it Mr. Robertson has proved before the Grand Jury? as to parts of the case, it cannot be doubted, that Mr. Robertson might be permitted to give evidence, if he chose it; that he did not receive the bond from Lord Chesterfield; for instance, that he did receive it from Dr. Dodd; that he knows no more of it; can any mortal say, that as to these questions, Mr. Robertson, let him stand in what predicament he will, is not a competent witness? I have no doubt, nor have I heard an argument suggested, that he cannot be a witness throughout but what law or dictum is found, which warrants the doctrine contended for; that this man is not to be received as a witness, a case is produced from Lord Hale, in which two men being actually charged or indicted, one is admitted an evidence against the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice GOULD. - In that case, it is expressly said, that by the advice of Mr. Justice Brown, a very learned and eminent man, and Mr. Wylde the recorder, who was afterwards a very learned judge at Westminster-hall, Perrin was admitted a witness against Trew; Perrin confessing himself guilty of that burglary, he was admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - Advice there, I should suppose, must mean a legal opinion of the court; for a judge, fitting in his judicial character, does not advise prosecutors; it is the province of those in a different place to give advice; judges only give legal opinions, and when it is said by advice, it seems to me it can mean nothing else but a legal judgment.</p>

            . - If any advice was asked of a judge, except sitting in judgment, I should think it exceedingly improper.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - Then, all that I can collect from thence, is, that in the opinion of the judges, he was a legal witness; in another way, if it was to depend upon that question, whether he being admitted a witness, is to be prosecuted for other crimes; here it must be determined by the judgment and discretion of the Court, whether the man is so used as a witness, that he is entitled to any protection; that judgment must be exercised according to legal discretion; but where the word advice is used as applied to a man's competency, it must mean that the judgment of the court was, that he was competent; another case mentioned by Mr. Buller is. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice WILLES. - The other case is, if two defendants be charged for a crime, one shall not be examined against the other to convict him of an offence unless the party examined confess himself guilty, and then he shall be admitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - But the charge must mean legal charge, must mean charge upon an indictment, for there is no other way of charging.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice WILLES. - Charge and indictment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190012"/> are synonimous words in the law of England.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - In - reports it is said that a particeps criminis may be admitted as a witness where a person was indicted for treason, and others were concerned in that treason, the party that confessed it might be a witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron PERRYN. - There is no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - Then there is an end of all questions as to competency of this man's evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice WILLES. - No doubt as to his competency.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - The arguments against this man were, that he was an accomplice, to which I before gave your lordships what appeared to me to be a satisfactory answer. Although twenty witnesses appear upon the back of an indictment, if one witness satisfies the Grand Jury that the man ought to be tried, they often proceed no further in examining witnesses; whether either of them proved enough to warrant the bill, it is impossible for the Court to say; if your lordships were to stop the proceeding for any thing that now appears, you must presume that the Grand Jury found the bill upon the testimony of a man whom, if there be an objection to, they ought not to have heard; now that presumption in law does not authorize your lordships at all, because if the Grand Jury were to examine 20 witnesses, 19 of whom should prove nothing, yet their names must appear upon the back of the indictment; and your lordships have no ground now upon which you can presume that the Grand Jury did find the bill upon a circumstance that they ought not to have heard; and unless therefore your lordships can do that which the Grand Jury are not authorized to enable you to do, unless you can yourselves say, that the Grand Jury have founded this bill upon an exceptionable man's evidence, supposing there was any exception to him, unless you can say that there is no foundation for the application now made, which it is clear you cannot say, because the Grand Jury may have paid no attention to more than one of the witnesses; and if upon the evidence of any one, however they might disregard the rest, there was such a ground appeared to them, as made it fit for them to find the indictment, they would be bound to find it. I have heard it said by one of my friends in argument, that it is totally immaterial, as Robertson's name appears here, whether the Grand Jury believed him or not; whether what he said was material or not, is nothing to the purpose; I beg leave to say the contrary, the form of business is, the witnesses are sworn, and their names are put upon the indictment before they go in to the Grand Jury, the Grand Jury then call the names appearing upon the indictment; they don't often examine them all; they examine as many as they think proper, and it is impossible for your lordships to say, that the Grand Jury founded the indictment upon this, or that man's evidence, or to know whether they had a legal authority for finding the bill; therefore I trust your lordships will be of opinion that this trial is to go on, recollecting that this is admitted to be the first attempt of the sort that ever was made for rejecting a bill upon a supposed knowledge of what passed before the Grand Jury, and I submit to your lordships that it is entirely without authority.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice WILLES. - Mr. Davenport, before you go on, tell us if you know of any case where a prisoner committed as a principal has been admitted an evidence against a person concerned with him in the same offence, without the interference of a magistrate or the direction of the Court before whom the matter is to be tried?</p>
               <p>Mr. DAVENPORT. - I hope to satisfy your lordships, that the constant practice has always been so; it depends upon the practice, and not upon any written authority.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice WILLES. - The clerk of assize has come to me on the circuit, and said such a justice of peace has examined this matter, and wishes, if you have no objection to it, that one prisoner may be admitted an evidence against the other; then I always pay that deference to the discretion of the justice, unless the circumstances make it improper to do as he has desired: sometimes the clerk of assize has brought me the informations taken by the justice of peace; I look over them carefully and exercise my discretion, whether such a person ought or not to be admitted an evidence against a co-defendant, and if I see there is no probability of convicting him by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190013"/> assistance of that evidence, then I never admit him: I wish Mr. Reynolds would say what has been the practice at this Court, of which he is a very old officer.</p>
               <p>Mr. REYNOLDS. - The judges were of opinion that every accomplice, or every man charged with a felony, that was intended by the justice to give evidence, should notwithstanding that be committed as a principal, and they mentioned as a circumstance, suppose such a man broke gaol, can he be indicted for a felony? now with regard to the orders for removing persons where it appears by the calendar, that they were committed expressly to give evidence; orders have always been granted for their being removed to the proper Jury, without asking any thing of the Court; but I never knew an instance in my life where two persons were committed as principals, that ever an order was made of course, or was ever done without the particular directions of the judges to the officer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice GOULD. - I have had abundance of application from the Grand Jury upon the circuit; they came to me, I remember, at Lancaster particularly three or four instances; they said, here are such persons committed, and without the evidence of one or other it will be impossible to find the bill; then upon reading the depositions and informations, I have ordered that man to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. DAVENPORT. - My lord, with respect to the carrying of Robertson before the Grand Jury; the mode of bringing him thither has created this confusion; an application in consequence of our advice was made to this Court, not as it is misunderstood, to admit him, for that was not our advice, but merely to acquaint the Court that that was the intention of the prosecutor; we conceiving, and if we are wrong, the criminal law in this respect, I hope, will be set upon a more certain footing, that the prosecutor had a right to adduce what witness he pleased; and that the law only could reject him upon the foot of an accomplice; that I conceive to be the law, and stand here to learn if it be not; taking that to be so, and that it is our error, if there be one, for I would wish in the hearing of such an audience as this, that the innocent officer should not be reflected upon, nor the parties who are concerned in this prosecution, for they are at least as innocent and irreproachable, I will venture to say, as any man that would venture to traduce them, what have they done to produce not only such appellations, but it is publickly given out in the papers, that they had surreptitiously obtained the order of this Court: my lords, out of decency and out of respect, and as a lawyer, I conceive that nothing but decency and respect could have made it necessary for them to apply to the Court, I take it to be the common practice, and I shall be corrected if I am wrong, that for all prisoners in this gaol, necessary to be carried to Hicks's-hall before the justices, there is an order of course at the sessions upon a 2 s. fee; to send down their officer, their deputy, the lowest, the meanest man they have amongst them, to fetch that prisoner from the keeper of Newgate, to give his testimony, and to bring him back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice GOULD. - Is that so? for I asked that question of Mr. Akerman, who has been gaoler here, as he informed me, twenty-two or twenty-three years, and he says positively, that there never was such a thing done when a man was in Newgate without an order of this Court, that it was so in all his experience.</p>
               <p>Mr. DAVENPORT. - Did he inform your lordships that there ever had been such an order from this Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice GOULD. - I take that for granted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice WILLES. - The Justices at Hicks's-hall could have no power to send such an order for Mr. Robertson, because he is a London commitment.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANLEY. - I speak with respect to the practice; when we came to the Quarter Sessions we waited about an hour and half for bringing up this prisoner; we were told that we might wait till eternity, that he never could be brought before the Grand Jury upon the order of this Court, that it belonged to that Court, and without we paid for that order we might wait for ever; I paid for that order, and he was brought up.</p>
               <p>Mr. COLEPEPER. - I do not remember that any justice at Hicks's-hall ever gave an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190014"/> order to bring an evidence, before the Grand Jury: I am sure they never made an order to bring a prisoner from hence to be carried before the Grand Jury. We never make an order to bring any body before the Grand Jury; we make an order to bring them before us in a matter before us for trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice WILLES. - Certainly this order was of no validity, in fact it was not obtained, nor drawn up by the direction of the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. DAVENPORT. - I mentioned what I know to be the practice, whether properly or improperly done is totally beside this argument; I mentioned it as I professed it, merely for the sake of the exculpation of those who took it to be right; and I go farther, that all the counsel at the table, on one side and the other, thought it right. As to the importance of the order, the validity of it, or the authority of those who issued it, I take to be beside this question, because where a bill, which, upon its face on the parchment before your lordships, appears to be a legal one, and above exception, there is no power in any court to inquire how that bill was obtained; it is, in my judgment, totally immaterial. The fact is, the witness

             was at Hicks's-hall; he was before the Grand Jury; had he been brought there by Mr. Akerman without authority, is it an objection to the witness, or his examination? had he escaped from Mr. Akerman for that purpose, and came back again, is it an objection to his competency, or to their examination of him? or can the Grand Jury reject him, and say, how are you brought here? be it therefore by a wrong in law, or be it by a right in law, the fact is, he was there; and, as I have stated before, if, Mr. Akerman the keeper of Newgate, against the duty of his office, if the Quarter Sessions, against the authority they bear, had taken him there, if the prisoner had broke the gaol, and had gone there, still my argument is this, that being there there is no other question, but is he competent or incompetent? My Lords, that is the question here, and will your lordships now say, that the Grand Jury were themselves not indictable, if they had rejected the witness upon that ground? my Lords, I could not have defended a Grand Jury who had rejected witness offering his testimony, upon any ground of legal incompetency, I should have stood in an aukward situation as counsel for such a Grand Jury; if I am wrong I shall be corrected in that, if I am right, then the Grand Jury did their duty in the examination, your lordships will do yours in trying the facts upon the parchment, to which there is no objection, at least at present, made; if there be any, I am sure for one, whatever may be in favour of the prisoner, from whatever quarter it comes, I shall be perfectly satisfied; the only fear I ever possessed is, not that a prisoner should escape, but lest it should be my fault to convict him. The witness, having been examined, is now objected to, not as incompetent here, for then the gentlemen are before their time in the objection; when he is brought here it is time enough to argue, that, without your lordships order, he stands at your bar as a witness; I say, that is the time when the objection is to be made: I hope when that time comes, the objection will be answered; I feel myself, in my own judgment at least, very capable of answering it upon principles of law, upon the received and universal practice in the little experience I have had; then, my lords, if the gentlemen are before their time in the objection, we are so far right, that we are in possession of a bill found by a Grand Jury competent to examine witnesses, competetent to find, and competent to return it: from such a Grand Jury this bill comes. My lords, it has been said, and I subscribe to the doctrine, that if there is an outlaw upon the Grand Jury, if there is one that by law is no grand juryman, that it vitiates the indictment, what is the solid and substantial sense of the objection? for cases may be quoted for ever, lines may be produced out of books, but they will want foundation and sense when they come to be examined; and what is the sense of the objectors? that the grand juryman being no grand juryman at all, why there was no Grand Jury. What is the law then? I say, that as to objections arising from the incompetency of the Grand Jury, it goes to this solid plain position, and indeed all law is resolvable, when understood, into the plainest positions; it is not the law for this or any other country, if it is not intelligible to every man's capacity; it requires some pains to trace and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190015"/> find it out, but when explained it must be intelligible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice GOULD. - Mr. Howarth, you see the counsel for the crown insist upon going on with this indictment, found as it is; suppose conviction should follow upon this trial, to be sure the Court will save the question, whether Robertson was improperly and illegally produced before the Grand Jury, for the opinion of all the judges; but it is not for the Court to give advice one way or the other; - the Court give no advice, but the counsel for the prisoner proceed upon this indictment at their peril.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron PERRYN. - Mr. Mansfield, you will take into your consideration, that if you proceed upon this indictment, and the judges afterwards should be of opinion that it ought not to have been proceeded upon, because it was improperly obtained, the consequence will be, that the prisoner can never be tried upon any other indictment for this crime, and therefore this prosecution must be final; whereas if you have any objection in your mind respecting the propriety of proceeding upon this indictment, another indictment may now be preferred before the Grand Jury, and you may now make your application to this Court for the purpose of producing

             as a witness before that Grand Jury; and I will freely own my sentiments that a judge has no right to give his advice, whether a person's testimony is sufficient to convict another; but when the trial comes on, he is then to form his idea of the competency of that evidence; and I will never, while I am a judge, give my opinion what evidence ought to be produced: and the construction put upon what was quoted from Lord Hale is, that what is said by the Court before trial could not be given by way of advice, but only when he is brought to trial: it is contrary to the constitution that the opinion of the judge should be taken before the trial; and I should have no difficulty, I own, whatsoever, to pronounce an order for taking Robertson out of the custody of Mr. Akerman to be produced before the Grand Jury; and my idea of it is, that it would be an order of course, provided he had been in our calendar; and all the litigation of this day has proceeded from too great and an improper lenity to the prisoner at the bar in not putting him upon the footing of other prisoners, by bringing him here six days before the sessions; and whoever was the author of that lenity has produced all this confusion. You will consider whether you will proceed upon this or prefer another bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. HOWARTH. - I have advised with the gentlemen with whom I have the honor to be of counsel for Dr. Dodd. We made this objection to your lordships under the hope that it had some weight and substance in it; I believe all of us are rather the more confirmed in that objection by the arguments of the gentlemen on the other side; and we are willing and desirous, on the part of Dr. Dodd, that the trial should proceed, if your lordships will reserve the question for the opinion of the Twelve Judges.</p>

               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - May it please your Lordship and Gentlemen of the Jury, this as you have heard already is an indictment against the prisoner at the bar, Dr. Dodd, for the crime of forgery, which in the words of the indictment is forging, and causing or procuring to be forged, and aiding and assisting in forging a false instrument called a bond; there is another charge for forging a receipt, the bond and receipt relating to one another, being two different instruments: the indictment charges him as being a forger of those two instruments, as assisting in forging them, and as publishing them knowing them to be forged; to this indictment Doctor Dodd has pleaded that he is Not guilty; and you are now upon the evidence which shall be brought before you, to decide whether Dr. Dodd is, or is not guilty of either of these crimes so imputed to him. As this prosecution and the transaction which gave occasion to it has been made the subject of very general discourse, and has been so circulated in the papers, that there is scarce any man at all that is acquainted with what passes in this city, but supposes himself to know very much about the crime imputed to Dr. Dodd, and from the stories that have been circulated, from the representations that have been made of it, judgments are very apt to be formed prejudicial to the person upon whose life you are now to determine, it is very much to be lamented that it is impossible to keep transactions of this fort from being thus made the subject of public talk, because from thence prejudices are very apt to arise in the minds of those who perhaps afterwards may fit as you do in judgment upon the matter, and I mention this to you merely for this reason, because I myself, as well as the prosecutor of Dr. Dodd, would be very sorry that he or any man standing in his situation should suffer the least prejudice from any thing that hath been said or heard before the actual trial; and I wish you therefore upon the present occasion so to judge and so to act, as if that which you will now hear from the witnesses was the first relation that had ever reached your ears concerning this matter; suppose it now to be intirely fresh, and that this is the first moment of your lives in which you knew that Dr. Dodd was to be brought to a trial under an accusation of forgery; it would be a great pleasure to me, I am sure it would to those, who for the sake of justice alone carry on this prosecution, to find that the evidence should be such as would in your judgment warrant you to pronounce that Dr. Dodd is not guilty of the crime that is imputed to him. On the other hand, if the evidence should be such as fully and beyond all doubt evinces the guilt imputed to him, then, however you and every man may lament that a gentleman of his function and character should descend to the commission of such a crime, yet uneasy and disgustful as the office is, and sorry as you may be to perform it, you will do your duty and say, that Dr. Dodd is guilty as he is proved to be: I am indeed, gentlemen, very much afraid; that though I sincerely wish it may be in your power to acquit the prisoner, that consistently with a very few plain facts that I have to state to you, it will be utterly impossible for any man who hears the story proved to think him so; it will be enough either to prove him to be the person who forged, or who published the instrument or the receipt, knowing them to be forged; the crime is the same in the judgment of the law, the guilt in point of conscience is the same, the punishment to be inflicted is the same, but I am afraid there will be no doubt but this unfortunate gentleman will be proved to be certainly the author, the forger, and likewise the publisher. The facts by which this will be made out to you are but few; the bond is for a large sum of money, the sum of 4200 l. purporting to be a bond from Lord Chesterfield to Mr. Fletcher. The receipt is for 4200 l. paid by Mr. Fletcher as to my Lord Chesterfield, a receipt purporting to be a receipt of my Lord Chesterfield; it is a bond for an annuity of 700 l. a year, and 4200 l. was the sum to be raised upon it; the bond apparently is signed by Lord Chesterfield; it is signed by the name of Chesterfield; it is attested by Dr. Dodd; it is attested also by a Mr.

            , the name of the prisoner now standing before you, was written by himself, as his hand-writing is extremely well known, and that hand-writing will be very clearly proved; now, gentlemen, if the case rested there, unless it was in the power (which for one I wish it might be) of the prisoner at the bar to shew to you that this was not his hand-writing, or that my Lord Chesterfield's signing was really my Lord Chesterfield's, why there would be clear and decisive evidence against him as the forger of this bond; in general so strong evidence as that cannot possibly be obtained to prove a forgery; because, in general hands are disguised, feigned names are used, and it is difficult to make out the signature; but here it will be proved, that the name

             is really and truly the hand-writing of the prisoner. Then if a bond is proved to be forged, if the hand-writing of a man charged as the forger, is proved to be to it as the witness, and he cannot explain it, why, then there is clear and full proof that it is forged by him; and if the case stopt at that point, I am afraid it would be utterly impossible for the prisoner to make out his innocence; but as there are various other circumstances in this case, it is necessary for me to relate them to you.</p>
               <p>When this bond first appeared to Mr. Fletcher, or Mr. Peach, who assisted Mr. Fletcher in advancing the money, being signed by the name Chesterfield, with these witness names, Dodd and Robertson, affixed to it, it had the effect, that money to the amount of 4200 l. was advanced. Robertson, I believe, was a broker employed to negociate this matter. After the money had been obtained, and the bond deposited with Mr. Manly, who acted as attorney for Mr. Fletcher, he observed upon the bond a very remarkable blot; there was no particular effect, I think, in this blot, but it was in the letter e in the word seven, which you will observe in the bond: this was upon the 5th of February, the bond bore date upon the 4th; and upon the 5th of February Mr. Manly seeing this, it struck him as something singular; he spoke to Mr. Fletcher about it, and told him that this bond had a very odd blot in it; there were some strokes both above and below the line of the bond, which had a very singular appearance; though they could not tell for what purpose any thing had been done with a pen, yet there appeared scratches with a pen as if something had been done: Mr. Manly talking to Mr. Fletcher about it, Mr. Fletcher wished that another bond might be prepared, fairly and without any blot, and might be carried to Lord Chesterfield to execute: this produced a meeting between Mr. Manly and my Lord Chesterfield upon the 7th of February: upon the 7th of February, Lord Chesterfield seeing this bond, said it was a forgery, and not his bond. The next step which was taken was that which was fit; an information was made before the Lord Mayor; and this bond having first appeared to Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Peach in the city of London, Dr. Dodd and Mr. Robertson were both carried before that magistrate; but before they were carried before the Lord Mayor, Mr. Manly went with an officer, together with Robertson, to Dr. Dodd's, and Mr. Manly then acquainted Dr. Dodd with the business on which he came: Mr. Manly told Dr. Dodd that he was very sorry to attend him upon such an occasion; that it was upon a charge of forgery against him, the forging a bond of Lord Cherfield's. Dr. Dodd appeared, as any one naturally would with such a charge brought against him, very much shocked. He was asked, what it was that could induce him to do this deed? and Dr. Dodd, struck and overwhelmed with a charge so brought upon him, and Robertson being present, whose name appears upon the bond, Dr. Dodd said, that it was urgent necessity had pressed him to it. He then gave some reasons, some tradesmens bills. I think, that he had to pay; that he meant no injury to Lord Chesterfield or any one, that he meant to pay the money back, and had resources by which he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190019"/> should be able to do it; but he did not deny it, he did not pretend to deny it; he did not insinuate that he was innocent of the charge, but only, as I tell you, gave some reasons, by way of palliating the crime, for his having committed it: when carried before the magistrate, and again charged with this crime, Dr. Dodd did not then deny it; but he applied for mercy, said that he was very willing to make every restitution in his power; that he had a regard for Lord Chesterfield, and applying to Lord Chesterfield's compassion and tenderness, hoped there might be no prosecution; but neither then, nor when Mr. Manly first charged him, did he at all deny the crime, but, you see, held language and conversation which did in the most express terms admit his guilt. This is in general the amount of the proofs against Dr. Dodd, depending, you see, merely upon Lord Chesterfield, upon those acquainted with his hand and those acquainted with Dr. Dodd's, and upon those who were present at those confessions: besides this, we shall be able to explain to you how this matter began and was transacted: Mr. Robertson was, as I have told you, a broker, and appears to have been the agent of Dr. Dodd in this business: but I must, in justice to Mr. Robertson, say, that being himself perfectly satisfied by the representations of Dr. Dodd, that it was the bond of Lord Chesterfield; and I have the more reason to say this, because at the first interview, in the presence of Mr. Manly, when he charged Dr. Dodd, Mr. Robertson called out upon Dr. Dodd to say whether he was not perfectly innocent; and it is justice to Dr. Dodd, as well as Mr. Robertson, to say, that upon that occasion he did, and in the most emphatic expressive terms, acquit Mr. Robertson of his being in any wise criminal, of his being at all acquainted with the forgery or having any thing to do with it: this he did more than once in terms very explicit, which did convince every one that had any thing to do with this affair, and were concerned in this prosecution, that though Robertson was certainly blameable in suffering his name to appear as a witness to an instrument which he did not see executed by Lord Chesterfield, which it purports that he did, yet that he was himself imposed upon, that he bore no part at all in the forgery: Mr. Robertson will tell you, that from Dr. Dodd he received the bond, that at his instance he negociated it; and that Dr. Dodd had the money produced from this bond we know, because by Dr. Dodd that money that he had received upon the bond was refunded, except a small sum he had made use of; 3000 l. was advanced in notes upon the house of Raymond and Co. of which Mr. Fletcher was a partner, the other in Banknotes; there was something Robertson had as the brokerage, the rest went to Dr. Dodd; and Robertson will give you an account of this, and will explain to you how the transaction began. This is in general the nature of the evidence we have to lay before you; and after what I have stated to you with regard to Robertson, I am sure every body will go before me in considering that it was not false clemency in the prosecutor, or any improper motive whatever that made him, or those that advised him, think that it was fit and proper to use the testimony of Robertson upon this occasion, though without that it is so extremely strong, you will see, upon Dr. Dodd, that it will be almost impossible, I think, for him to answer it: there are matters of smaller consequence and less moment that will appear in the cause, which it is not necessary for me to trouble you with. Dr. Dodd, you see, is charged as the forger, as the publisher, that is, the person who uses, who delivers this instrument, knowing it to be forged; and if he be proved to be guilty of either, the crime is equally enormous, in the judgment of the law the punishment is the same. Mr. Robertson is guilty of a behaviour which no one can but blame, in having suffered his name to stand upon this bond which he had never seen executed, and in saying, as I believe he did, that he had seen it executed at the time when it went out of his hand; but all this was under a perfect persuasion, in consequence of the representations of Dr. Dodd, that the bond was really genuine. When these facts are laid before you, you know very well your duty; it will be for you to draw the conclusion. If the evidence be such as does irresistibly prove that Dr. Dodd forged or published either of the instruments, knowing them to be forged, then you will pronounce him guilty; if you see any room upon the evidence to doubt of his being guilty, if you are not perfectly convinced that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190020"/> he is, to be sure you and every one present at this trial will be glad that there should be a reason for you to give a contrary verdict, and for saying that he is innocent.</p>

               <p>Council for the Crown. Mr. Manly, you will now be pleased to inform the Court what you know of this transaction? - On Tuesday the 4th of this instant February, the bond that has been produced, with a warrant of attorney and a letter which is in my possession, were left at my chambers when I was not at home, as I was told, by Mr. Peach, who is a Silk-merchant in Bread-street; he came with the Broker,

            , as I was informed, and left them there for me to look at; I found them on my desk when I came home: I was informed that the sum of money had been paid: this was all the information I then had; they were left for me to look at to see if all was right.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were they left on behalf of any particular client? - Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Peach are both my clients; I perused the bond, I believe, first: I observed in the condition of the bond a very remarkable blot in the letter e in the word seven, before seven hundred pounds; it was a blot of a remarkable nature; it did not appear to me to be the effect of chance, but the act of a pen, dotted in hair-strokes in a particular manner, as if done by design.</p>
               <p>Does that appear in that bond now? - It does.</p>
               <p>(The bond is shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. MANLY. The letter (e) is totally obliterated: I thought it a remarkable circumstance, and yet I could see no end it could answer to give me any reason or cause to suspect it was a forgery; however I thought it so remarkable as to be necessary to let Mr. Fletcher know it; accordingly I sent to Mr. Fletcher, and he came to me on the Wednesday evening.</p>
               <p>That was next day? - I shewed Mr. Fletcher the bond, and the blot; I asked him what he thought of it? he said it was something very remarkable; I said it was; he said, I think it is best to write over a clean bond, and I will get you to wait upon Lord Chesterfield with it.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecutor. Tell the Court and the gentlemen of the jury, when it was you first saw Dr. Dodd? - Shall I mention what passed with Lord Chesterfield first?</p>
               <p>COURT. I think it will save time to let Mr. Manly tell his story.</p>
               <p>You went to Lord Chesterfield? - I did.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Mr. Manly knows very well what is evidence, and therefore I desire he will not enter into any other particulars.</p>
               <p>COURT. He is going to give evidence of what he has referred to already, and therefore he may go on without interruption.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANLY. On Thursday the 6th of February, I went to Lord Chesterfield's; not meeting with his lordship at home, I took the liberty of writing a note to his lordship, acquainting his lordship with my visit, and the business, and that I should call the next morning at ten; accordingly soon after ten on the Friday morning, I went to Lord Chesterfields,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190022"/> and saw his lordship; his lordship was above stairs, when I came to the room door, his lordship met me, saying, you have called about the bond; I said I had; his lordship answered, he had burnt the bond, which surprized me a little; afterwards his lordship explained to me that he had given a bond for 500 l. which he burnt when he came of age; before that explanation it was a mystery; I told his lordship, I did not understand that; I immediately introduced the bond in question to his lordship; Mr. Innis, the gentleman who has been examined, was present with his lordship; my Lord Chesterfield immediately disowned the bond.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. This is, my Lord, what passed in conversation with Mr. Manly and other persons in the absence of Dr. Dodd, your lordship knows it is not admissible evidence against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Lord Chesterfield has been already examined as an evidence. They may ask the question of Lord Chesterfield, whether, when the bond was offered by Mr. Manly, he disowned it: this is in the course of the narrative; I shall not sum this up to the jury; but when they bring Dr. Dodd present it will be evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANLY. After I left his lordship, I went into the city to Mr. Fletcher, and told him his lordship said it was not his bond, and consulted him what steps he would take about it; Mr. Fletcher, myself, and Mr. Innis went to Guildhall to see if the Lord Mayor was there; Lord Chesterfield said, he supposed Dr. Dodd was gone off, that is the reason I did not apply to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is not evidence most certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANLY. We preferred an information respecting our suspicions and belief of this forgery, in order to get a warrant against the broker Robertson, and Dr. Dodd; upon the information being taken, my Lord Mayor granted a warrant or warrants against them both; before the warrant, I believe, was signed by his lordship, Robertson the broker came into Sir

               <p>COURT. What passed between you and Mr. Robertson does not go to affect the prisoner at the bar. - Robertson was taken into custody; when he was taken into custody, he, Mr. Innis, myself, and my Lord Mayor's two officers went to Dr. Dodd's house in Argyll-street; Mr. Robertson and I and one of the Lord Mayor's men in one coach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is Argyll-street in the city of London or the county of Middlesex? - In the county of Middlesex; we were admitted into the house, and Dr. Dodd soon after came down stairs to us; when we were in the parlour together, Mr. Innis, myself, Dr. Dodd, and the officers, and Robertson, I then opened the occasion of our attending him; I told him I was very sorry to attend him upon such an unhappy occasion, it was upon a charge of forgery against him, and Robertson was then in custody for forging Lord Chesterfield's bond; the Doctor seemed very much struck, and was silent some time; I told him the broker laid the whole charge to him; and asked the Doctor what could induce him to do such an act; the Doctor said, urgent necessity.</p>
               <p>COURT. Previous to the time when the Doctor said that urgent necessity induced him to act thus, had any promises been made to him of any favour respecting a prosecution? - None at that time; he said urgent necessity; he was pressed to pay some tradesmens bills; that he meant no injury to Lord Chesterfield, or any one, as he meant to pay the money back in three months.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are referring to a memorandum, when did you take it? - They are short minutes I made immediately afterwards; he said he meant to return the money in three months time, and had certain resources to enable him to do it.</p>
               <p>COURT. At the time you had this conversation with the prisoner, did you shew him the bond that you apprehended to be a forged instrument? - I think I did not; the broker here interrupted him, and said, Doctor Dodd, I desire you will declare my innocence before all present, Doctor Dodd replied, I do, I do; I think those were his very words; he very readily did it, without the least hesitation; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190023"/> then said it was a very unhappy affair, and asked the Doctor, if he had the money to return.</p>
               <p>Had the money been actually advanced by Fletcher upon that security? - The money had been paid upon the Tuesday, and I understood it had been paid, upon my brother or clerks saying it was well executed; when I asked him if he had the money to return as that would be the only means of saving him he answered he had; I then desired him immediately to give it to me; he desired to go up stairs to fetch it, but my Lord Mayor's officer refused to let him go; upon which I desired leave of the officer to entrust him with me up stairs, accordingly we went up stairs; Dr. Dodd immediately returned me six notes of 500 l. each of Sir

             and Co. these notes made 3000 l. Dr. Dodd took these notes out of a pigeon-hole in the bureau, or some desk of that sort; I asked him where the remainder was? he then produced his banker's book, and to the best of my remembrance there appeared the sum of 900 l. on the debtor's side of the banker's book; I asked him what he could draw for, whether he had that money at the banker's? he said he could not draw for all that, for he had had occasion to make use of part of the money, but he could draw for five or six hundred pounds; accordingly he drew a draught addressed to the acting partners of the Banking Company in St. James's Street, in favour of Mr. Fletcher or bearer for 500 l. (that 500 l. I received) immediately after Dr. Dodd had given me that draught, we came down stairs, Mr.

             the broker then gave me a draught for 100 l. which he said he had received for half the commission.</p>
               <p>Was that in the presence of Dr. Dodd? - Yes; that draught was given to Mr. Fletcher, and I understand it was paid; after I had received the 500 l. draught of the Doctor, I went to the Crown and Rolls in Chancery-lane and sent for Mr. Fletcher to come to me.</p>
               <p>Where did you leave Dr. Dodd? - I left Dr. Dodd coming out of his own house with Mr. Robertson in custody with the officers; they were to go to some tavern or coffee-house in the neighbourhood till I returned; Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Corry my Lord Chesterfield's solicitor soon after called upon me there; we then went back to my Lord Chesterfield's, and there we learnt that Dr. Dodd was at the York Coffee-house in St. James's-street; we went there, and there we found Dr. Dodd and the officers and Robertson: we ordered a room up stairs, and when we were all up stairs together in presence of all the gentlemen, I asked Dr. Dodd if he could give any security for the remainder of the money; he immediately said he would give any security in his power, he was ready to make any restitution he could; I asked him if he would give a judgment upon his goods, he said he would, or any thing else; he was, in fact, desirous of doing it; he then executed a warrant of attorney to confess judgment as a security for the remaining 600 l. and I believe that was attested by Mr. Corry and myself; after he had given this judgment he said, I think I can draw for 200 l. more upon my banker; I said, if you can it will be much better; the Doctor instantly drew a draught for 200 l. which reduced it to 400 l. that draught of 200 l. was paid the next morning, as I am informed, and have no doubt, there then remained 400 l. and the judgment was the next day entered for the 400 l. and execution taken out.</p>
               <p>COURT. I suppose there were goods enough to answer that? - There is a distress for rent and another execution, but I am told there is enough.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards, or when, go before the Lord Mayor? - The next day, Saturday; Lord Chesterfield called upon Mr. Fletcher at Sir Charles Raymond's house; I had a message to come there, and a message was sent to the Lord Mayor to know his lordship's pleasure when he would be attended upon that business; an answer came back that the prisoners were then before my Lord Mayor, which we did not know of; we then went before my Lord Mayor, and were sworn to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Was Lord Chesterfield there? - Yes; my Lord Chesterfield, Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Innis, and myself; the Lord Mayor bound over Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Peach to prosecute, and the rest, as I understood it, only to give evidence, the recognizance was taken different.</p>
               <p>Was the bond produced before my Lord Mayor? - It was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190024"/>Was there many witnesses examined before my Lord Mayor? - Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Peach, Mr. Innis, myself, and I believe my Lord Chesterfield.</p>
               <p>W as the bond read? - I don't know; it was laid on the table: the information that was given was read to the prisoner. The Lord Mayor laid the bond before them and asked them many questions.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the examination before my Lord Mayor was reduced into writing? - I did not see that it was; Dr. Dodd when called upon his defence, I did not take it down, but the substance of it was, that he was pressed to pay some tradesmen's bills; he meant no injury to any one, and meant to restore the money.</p>
               <p>When the bond was produced and Dr. Dodd charged with forging of it, he admitted the fact, did he? - He did.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it when you first went to Dr. Dodd's house? - I believe between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I think near four.</p>
               <p>When the Doctor was first charged with the crime, before any offer or act towards restitution was done upon the part of Dr. Dodd, it was I think that you said, that was the way to save him? - Returning the money would be the means I told him I thought of saving him.</p>
               <p>I need not ask your import of these words, saving him from the consequences of any prosecution? - Yes; I so made use of these words.</p>

               <p>Was any thing said before my Lord Mayor by Dr. Dodd about Robertson? - Dr. Dodd very readily admitted before my Lord Mayor that Robertson was innocent.</p>

               <p>What did Dr. Dodd say then? - He said to this purport;</p>
               <p>'I cannot tell what to say in</p>
               <p>'such a situation; I had no intention to</p>
               <p>'defraud Lord Chesterfield.'</p>
               <p>Are those the words the Doctor said? - As near as I can recollect they are; his words were</p>
               <p>'I cannot tell what to say in such a situation: I</p>
               <p>'had no intention to defraud Lord Chester-field;</p>
               <p>'I hope his lordship will consider my</p>

               <p>'four hundred pounds to pay some tradesmen's</p>
               <p>'bills; I meant it as a temporay resource;</p>
               <p>'I should have repaid the money in</p>
               <p>'half a year; I have made satisfaction, and I</p>
               <p>'hope that will be considered; my Lord</p>
               <p>'Chesterfield must have some tenderness towards</p>
               <p>'me; -</p>
               <p>Was Lord Chesterfield then present? - His lordship was.</p>
               <p>-</p>
               <p>'he knows I love him; he knows I regard</p>
               <p>'his honor as dearly as my own; I hope he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190025"/> ' will, according to the mercy that is in his</p>
               <p>'heart, shew clemency to me; there is nobody</p>
               <p>'wishes to prosecute; pray, my Lord</p>
               <p>'Mayor, consider that, and dismiss me; Mr.</p>
               <p>'Robertson is certainly innocent.'</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure that the paper you have in your hand is not the Morning Post, for I recollect they are the very words inserted in the Morning Post? - No.</p>
               <p>I ask you, for form's sake, when Dr. Dodd said what you have given an account of, whether he was not then charged before the Lord Mayor with forging the bond? - He was.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Innis, if I understood you rightly, you did not go into Dr. Dodd's house, nor see Dr. Dodd till after there had been an interview between Dr. Dodd and Mr. Manly? - I was not there at first; I came in, I suppose, three or four minutes after Mr. Manly; we set out together in two hackney-coaches.</p>
               <p>[The six draughts, of 500 l. each, were produced in court by Mr. Fletcher.]</p>
               <p>Mr. FLETCHER.</p>
               <p>Are those the bills Mr. Manly returned to you? - Yes; They are all signed by me.</p>
               <p>Are these the bills that were given for the money raised by this bond? - They are, in part, what I gave to Mr. Peach on that account.</p>
               <p>COURT. As the annuity of 700 l. a year was to take place immediately, how came you to make those bills payable at 14 days sight? - It was the agreement with the Broker.</p>
               <p>By that means you got the interest of 3000 l. for 17 days; hereafter a question might arise against you upon that for usury. Those six notes that have been produced were the notes that you paid for the original purchase of the annuities? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. PEACH sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. You left that bond, I believe, at Mr. Manly's chambers? - Yes.</p>

               <p>COURT. Mr. Fletcher, is it not usual in these kind of transaction to have an attorney of your own to see the instruments executed? - Most certainly.</p>
               <p>You did this without an attorney? - I mentioned Mr. Manly's going to see the deed executed: Mr. Robertson said he could not; I agreed to that, upon condition that he brought a letter from my Lord Chesterfield that his lordship had executed the bond, and desired the money to be paid to Mr. Robertson: he did bring me such a letter; that letter was left at Mr. Manly's chambers with the others; Mr. Peach carried them (the letter was produced in Court, and identified).</p>

               <p>When did you first see that bond? - I left this bond with Dr. Dodd upon Monday the 3d of this month in the evening to be executed; I carried it to Mr. Franco's in Fenchurch-street; Dr. Dodd dined there on the Monday; at the same time I carried a letter which Mr. Fletcher directed me to write; I wrote it in my own hand; it contained an order for me to receive the money.</p>
               <p>Did that bond appear to be executed by my Lord Chesterfield at the time you carried it to Mr. Franco's? - No; it was a bond filled up, but not executed.</p>
               <p>Look at the letter; is that the letter? - It is.</p>
               <p>Did you receive again the same bond and letter from Dr. Dodd? - Yes, at his own house in Argyll-buildings, on Tuesday the 4th.</p>

               <p>At whose desire did you put your name to it? - I asked Dr. Dodd if the bond had been regularly executed, when he presented it to me, I desired him to put his name as a witness to it.</p>
               <p>When the bond was produced to you on Tuesday, was the name of Chesterfield subscribed to it? - It was, and also to the receipt for the money.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you receive the bond of Dr. Dodd? - To receive the sum of 4200 l.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not subscribe your name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190026"/> to any other bond? - Only to that bond and that receipt.</p>
               <p>And it was given to you to subscribe by the Doctor? - The Doctor did not ask me to subscribe it; he put his own name to it; then I said, Doctor, as you have seen this regularly executed I may put my name to it? he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect whether there was that blot upon the word seven at the time you subscribed your name? - I don't remember the blot.</p>
               <p>Did you receive the money in consequence of it? - I did, and carried it to Dr. Dodd.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you had other transactions of this nature, in negociating the sale or loan of annuities besides this? - Yes; I have done business of this kind.</p>
               <p>Is it your practice, in transacting that business, to subscribe your name as a witness to the execution of an instrument which you have not seen executed? - No; it is not always the case, but I have done it.</p>
               <p>Then you deceive the persons who place confidence in you; did you ever do it in any other instance? - Yes; I have.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have experienced that it is a very dangerous thing. Look at those six notes; are they part of the 4200 l. you received of Mr. Fletcher? - These are the notes; they are at 14 days sight.</p>
               <p>Are they accepted? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Two of them I see are indorsed, Chesterfield; my Lord Chesterfield will inspect them, and say whether they are indorsed by his lordship.</p>
               <p>Lord CHESTERFIELD. They are not.</p>

               <p>COURT. Dr. Dodd, this is the time for you to make your defence to what the witnesses have said in support of the charge against you; it is not the province of the counsel to open the case of a criminal in your situation, but you may contradict any thing that has been given in evidence against you; and afterwards by counsel may examine any witness in support of the case you have to state to the Court; I shall with great patience hear your witnesses; and also hear any thing you have to urge in your defence.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lords and gentlemen of the jury. Upon the evidence which has been this day produced against me, I find it very difficult for me to address your lordships; there is no man in the world, who has a deeper sense of the heinous nature of the crime for which I stand indicted than myself; I view it, my lords, in all its extent of malignancy towards a commercial state like ours; but, my lords, I humbly apprehend, though no lawyer, that the moral turpitude and malignity of the crime always, both in the eye of law, of reason, and of religion, consists in the intention. I am informed, my lords, that the act of parliament on this head runs perpetually in this stile, with an intention to defraud. Such an intention, my lords, and gentlemen of the jury, I believe has not been attempted to be proved upon me, and the consequences that have happened, which have appeared before you, sufficiently prove that a perfect and ample restitution has been made. I leave it, my lords, to you, and the gentlemen of the jury, to consider, that if an unhappy man ever deviates from the law of right, yet, if in the single first moment of recollection, he does all he can to make a full and perfect amends, what, my lords, and gentlemen of the jury, can God and man desire further? My lords, there are a variety of little circumstances, too tedious to trouble you with, with respect to this matter. Were I to give a loose to my feelings. I have many things to say, which I am sure, you would feel with respect to me: but, my lords, as it appears on all hands, as it appears, gentlemen of the jury, in every view, that no injury intentional nor real has been done to any man upon the face of the earth, I hope that therefore you will consider the case in its true state of clemency: I must observe to your lordships, that though I have met with all candour in this Court, yet I have been pursued with oppressive cruelty: I have been prosecuted after the most express engagements, after the most solemn assurances, after the most delusive, soothing arguments of Mr. Manly; I have been prosecuted with a cruelty scarcely to be paralleled: a person avowedly criminal, in the same indictment with myself, has been brought forth as a capital witness against me; a fact I believe totally unexampled. My lords, oppressed as I am with infamy, loaded as I am with distress, sunk under this cruel prosecution, your lordships and gentlemen of the jury, cannot think life<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190027"/> a matter of any value to me; no, my lords, I solemnly protest that death of all blessings would be the most pleasant to me after this pain. I have yet, my lords, ties which call upon me; ties which render me desirous even to continue this miserable existence: I have a wife, my lords, who for 27 years has lived an unparalleled example of conjugal attachment and fidelity, and whose behaviour during this crying scene would draw tears of approbation, I am sure, even from the most inhuman. My lords, I have creditors, honest men, who will lose much by my death; I hope for the sake of justice towards them some mercy will be shewn to me. If upon the whole, these considerations at all avail with you, my lords, and you gentlemen of the jury, if upon the most partial survey of matters not the slightest intention of injury can appear to any one, and I solemnly declare, it was in my power to replace it in three months; of this I assured Mr. Robertson frequently, and had his solemn assurances, that no man should be privy to it but Mr. Fletcher and himself; and if no injury was done to any man upon the earth, I then hope, I trust, I fully confide myself in the tenderness, humanity, and protection of my country.</p>
               <p>Mr. HOWARTH. - My lord, upon the inspection of the bond, they don't appear to me to be intirely the same words that they are supposed to be in the record; there is a blot in the word seven, which covers part of the s and the whole e.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is matter for the consideration of the jury; they must be satisfied they are clearly the same, or else the charge in the indictment is not supported.</p>
               <p>Mr. MANSFIELD. - The contents of the bond follow as near as may be the bond, by having a blot in the very same word, whatever it is, as nearly imitating the blot on the bond as possible; the counts upon the receipt are separate counts, and they are totally distinct from the bond.</p>
               <p>The Jury, after having withdrawn about ten minutes, pronounced the prisoner <rs id="t17770219-1-verdict6" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Had you ever seen her before that time? - No, I had not; I felt my watch go out of my pocket and caught her by the right hand directly; I told her that she had my watch; before I had uttered the words I saw her left hand held out at full length, and she was endeavouring to deliver the watch to a man with a black patch over one of his eyes, and the man was endeavouring to receive it, but I never saw the watch in his hand; I saw the chain hang out of her hand as she was endeavouring to deliver it; upon this I quitted her and seized the man by the collar; a constable was ready that instant, who was very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190037"/> attentive indeed, we secured them both and carried them into an alehouse, close by the playhouse door, where they were searched, but nothing found upon them; I went the next morning before the justice.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose you had the woman by the arm before you quitted her and seized the man? - Not a minute; I immediately quitted her, and seized him; she was then endeavouring to make her escape; I committed the man to the care of my brother who was close to me; and I myself retook the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How long was it from the time of your taking the man by the collar to your retaking the prisoner? - I don't know; I believe it was about 4 minutes.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear the woman you retook was the same woman? - Yes; the whole was within the space of three yards; I could swear to her dress; she had a little black bonnet and black gown on; I swear she is the same woman; the moment the constable came up, he said, O Sir! don't you know her? it is the famous Miss West: there was not another woman there that I saw at all; I have not got my watch again; it was a watchmaker's watch; it was good for nothing; there was a gold chain and five seals to it.</p>

               <p>I am a peace-officer: upon the 18th of January last I had a warrant against the deceased at the suit of the prisoner, on suspicion of her having robbed him; Mr. Gosler and I took her about six o'clock in the evening, at her lodgings in Berwick-street, Soho; we took her in a coach to justice Blackborrow, in <placeName id="t17770219-27-crimeloc127">Clerkenwell Close</placeName>

               <p>When you saw the deceased after she was dead, did you observe where the wound was? - Just upon her right shoulder; the knife went in at the neck and slanted downwards; the prisoner stood behind her when he gave the stroke; the wound was about an inch wide.</p>
               <p>Did they speak before the justice as if they were angry with one another? - He seemed to speak as if he was angry; she as if she was laughing; she was quite a young woman.</p>
               <p>Was there any man with her at her lodgings? - No; she came in, she had been out to market; an interpreter that could speak English came with her in the coach; he was in the kitchen of the house she lodged at, with the woman of the house; he did not belong to the deceased; the woman of the house desired him to go with her because she could not speak a word of English; this is the knife, (producing a sharp pointed knife, the blade about six inches long) I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>How long might it be after you came out of the justice's before the wound was given? - It could not be a minute; after I put the prisoner into the coach I searched him; the sheath of the knife was found the next morning by a gentleman who is present.</p>
               <p>Have you rubbed the blood off? - When I shewed it before the coroner's jury the coroner touched the knife and rubbed some of the blood off; I desired he would not; it was bloodier when I took it up than it is now.</p>

               <p>I went with the deceased, the last witness, and the interpreter to the justice; the prisoner was at the justice's when the deceased was brought there; the prisoner charged the deceased with being accessary to his being robbed and having in her possession in a purse some medals which he would swear to; she was searched before the justice in the prisoner's presence; but the prisoner did not claim any thing that was found upon her; and the justice discharged her; the deceased and Davey went out of the office; I followed them; when I got to the steps the deceased took hold of my arm; the prisoner and deceased had each an interpreter; her interpreter came out behind me; when we had gone about 20 yards, I from behind heard the word sacre; I turned my head and saw the prisoner's hand come upon the deceased's shoulder, and she dropped on her knees giving a shriek; Davey and I endeavoured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190039"/> to help her up, but she dropped again; I quitted her and seizing the prisoner by the collar, called to Davey to assist; and we carried the prisoner to the justice's; there I saw the prisoner was bleeding; I went back and took the deceased to the Oxford Arms; we laid her on a table; she was to all appearance dead; she died almost immediately; the wound was over the right shoulder; it slanted into the collar bone: Davey came to the Oxford Arms and shewed the knife which was bloody.</p>
               <p>You said the prisoner charged her with being accessary to the robbing him; did he charge any body as principal? - No; he said he had been robbed, and he had seen the things he had been robbed of in her possession.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of the word sacre? - A foreigner on the Jury. It is the same as a curse or damn.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon: upon Tuesday the 21st of January I was called upon to view the deceased; I did so; in the upper part of the collar bone I found a large wound, and by the direction of my probe I apprehend it penetrated into the cavity of the thorax or breast; I imagine the circulation of the blood was thereby soon stopped, and a suffocation ensued; it certainly had that effect; I compared the instrument with the wound, and it appears to me that is the instrument that caused her death.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether the wound was mortal and occasioned her death? - I imagine it was.</p>
               <p>To GOSLER. You say the woman smiled at him before the justice; did it appear that she made use of abusive and scurrilous expressions to him? - No; they both spoke together at one time, but that was soon over; when silence was called.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing just before she went out? - No.</p>
               <p>What countrywoman was she?</p>

               <p>To GOSLER. Whether from the manner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190040"/> of the woman's behaviour it appeared to you that she did use the prisoner with all that scurrility he suggests? - There was some quick discourse between them at the first, afterwards that subsided, and when the woman was discharged she was going off perfectly quiet.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner Noah: on the 31st of December my son came to me at Tom's coffee-house, Cornhill, and said Noah wanted to speak with me at 'Change; I did not go directly, as it was post-day; in about half an hour after Noah came to me at 'Change and said, I was looking for you, that I might give you a commission; here is a foreigner who has got a prize in the lottery of 2000 l. you may sell it as well as another, and get the commission; I asked him if he knew the man; he said it was a man who lodged with his brother, and had come from the Hague; that he was a reputable man, of reputable parents; and he had received money lately from Messrs. Norden; I said, it is post-day, I will apply to Mr. Keyser, and divide the commission with him; Noah said, he had no objection; I went to Mr. Keyser and told him the story; Mr. Keyser desired I would bring the man to the office, that he might have the ticket checked; I then went back to the 'Change to Noah, and told him to call at my house to go with me to Keyser at 4 o'clock; Noah came alone; I asked Noah where the foreigner was; he told me he was gone to the play; for a man who had got a prize of 2000 l. might enjoy himself for once, and go to the play: the business was agreed to be deferred till the next morning; the same evening between 6 and 7 o'clock I was called by my son, who said that Noah was at my house with another gentleman, and had left word he was gone to the Nag's-head; I found both the prisoners there; Noah said, there is the man who has the ticket; Arones took the ticket out of his pocket and shewed it to me: I thought it a good ticket; I desired them to go with me to Mr. Keyser's office to sell it; I gave him the ticket back again, as Arones would not trust me with it; then all three went to Keyser's office, and from thence we all four went to the York coffee-house; Keyser in a little room asked after the ticket; Arones shewed it to him; Keyser took down the number, and he and I went to his office and examined it, and found that it was drawn a prize of 2000 l. on the third day of the drawing of the lottery; Mr. Keyser likewise examined it at other offices; I went back to the New York coffee-house and told the prisoner it was a good ticket, but it must first be checked at the exchequer; Mr. Keyser looked at his watch and said, it was too late to have it checked that evening; Mr. Keyser desired, that for safety he would lodge it in a banker's hand for fear of fire or thieves, which Arones refused, saying, he would not trust it with his own father without the money; upon which Mr. Keyser told him he would give him 400 l. that evening, that then he might lodge it in a banker's hand, and they might put their seals upon it till it was examined or sold, and he should have the remainder of the money; to which he gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190043"/> no direct answer; I told Keyser he had better let it alone till it was examined; they then went home, and I appointed them to come to my house the next day, in order to go to Whitehall and have it checked, and so we parted; he did not come at the time the next morning; I left word where I should be; I went to Mr. Keyser's office; but he had not been there, then I went to Tom's coffee-house and met at the corner of Sweeting's alley the prisoners coming to the office; I asked Arones why he did not come at the appointed time; Arones said he had some business to do; Noah took me aside, and said, Arones had been at Whitehall and had had the ticket checked; I told Mr. Keyser that the man had already had the ticket checked, and that it would save time; I asked Arones for the ticket to sell it; I observed on the ticket no mark of its having been checked; Arones said he had only had it examined, as he had not two guineas in his pocket to pay for checking it; I told Arones he had no occasion to have paid 6 d. as it might have been examined for a penny in the city; Mr. Keyser said, he was informed he could sell it as it was, and desired the man to give him the ticket, and he would get the money for it at the stock exchange; Arones refused to give the ticket without having the money for it; upon which Mr. Keyser ran out of the coffee-house, and in the mean time I asked Arones for the ticket, but he refused to give it me; then Noah took Arones aside, and, I surmise, told him I was to be trusted; upon which Arones called me and gave me the ticket; I threw it down and would not accept of it, being angry that he distrusted me; I said, let Noah go with me and see that I don't run away; I gave the ticket to Mr. Keyser, and he went with it to the stock exchange; Mr. Keyser came out of the stock exchange whilst I was standing with Noah and said, he thought there was a forgery in the ticket, and so he should go to Guildhall and have it examined; then Mr. Keyser and I went to Guildhall, and there it was found out to be a forgery; I then returned with a constable to have the two people apprehended; I found Noah where I left him; I asked where Arones was, to give him the money for the ticket? Noah said, he could not tell where he was, but he would go and look for him; but he did not find him; and so I delivered Noah up to the constable; Noah never had the possession of the ticket; Noah always said it belonged to Arones; Mr. Keyser said in the presence of Noah that he thought it was a forgery; he spoke in Dutch.</p>

             called at my office and asked me whether I could dispose of a 2000 l. prize; I told him I made a distinction between a 2000 l. prize, and one of less value; that I must know who the proprietor of the ticket was; in consequence of that I afterwards saw the two prisoners in the evening at my office; the office being small and very full at that time, I desired them to walk with me into the New York coffee-house; we went into a little room, there Mr. Levy told the prisoner Arones to deliver the ticket into my hands, that I was the person who was to dispose of it; Arones delivered the ticket into my hands; I took down the number and examined it at my own, and other offices, and found that number had been drawn a prize of 2000 l. the third day of drawing; I told him as he was a stranger he should have the ticket checked before I sold it, and advised him to lock up the ticket for fear of fire or any other accident; he said he would not trust the ticket out of his hands; I told him if he was afraid of that I would let him have 3 or 400 l. if he would lock it up at my banker's till the next morning, and I would then go with him to have it checked, and would dispose of it; Arones made no answer; but Levy gave me a hint not to give the money; the next morning Levy came alone and told me, he had waited some time and the persons were not come; I went into the stock exchange as usual, and told one of the dealers in prizes that I expected a 2000 l. prize to sell, and offered to sell it to him; he told me he had purchased as many as he chose; I told him I would have it checked; he said there is no occasion to check it, if you indorse your name to it, and we see it in the commissioner's list, that is sufficient: Mr. Levy had me called out of the coffee-house and told me they were come with the ticket; I went into the New York coffee-house; I understood Arones had been at the exchequer to examine the ticket, but not to have it checked, for he had not two guineas in his pocket to pay for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190044"/> the expence of checking it; that I learned from Arones; when a ticket is checked the commissioners write upon the back,</p>
               <p>"this ticket</p>
               <p>"has been checked with the counter-part, and</p>
               <p>"is a 2000 l. prize;" the price paid for checking is generally a guinea a thousand; I then told them that I could sell the ticket without being checked, but he would not deliver the ticket into my hands; upon which I left them all at the coffee-house and went about my business to the stock exchange; I was soon after called out of the stock exchange by Levy, who delivered me the ticket; I told them it was very odd that they would not trust me with the ticket; I told Levy to tell the persons to stand at the stock exchange door till I came out with the money for it; this is the ticket (inspecting it) there was my indorsement upon it, which I erased; I went with the ticket to the stock exchange and offered it to sale; a person to whom I had promised the preference of it, came into the coffee-house, several persons bid for it; at last I sold it to the person who first offered for it at 79 5/8 per cent. I then mentioned that I would have had it checked; but they told me there was no occasion for it; the person said, No, only put your name to it, and call for the prize list; we found it a prize of 2000 l. in the seventh column of the list of the third day's drawing; I indorsed the ticket as is usual when we sell a ticket, if it is even a 20 l. prize, that the person that purchases it may know from whom it came; I make myself liable by that indorsement, as I imagine that is the purpose f or which it is required; it is always understood so between us the same as if I sell a ticket during the drawing as un-drawn, I endorse it, and am answerable in case it should have been drawn; and so in this case I apprehend I should have been called upon to pay the money when I had signed my name; Mr. Shewell came into the box and said, Mr. Keyser, what have you sold this ticket for and to whom? I told him I had sold it to Mr. Bower at 79 5/8; he desired me to shew him the ticket, for he recollected something of the number; I shewed him the ticket; he said 25590, I believe I have purchased a prize of the same number which was indorsed, and says he, I think I know the person who has got it now, for I sold it again; he desired me to go to my office and examine whether 25590 was not the first 2000 l. prize drawn in that lottery; I held the ticket in my hand at the stock exchange door; one of the brokers overlooked me and said, don't be frightened, Keyser, your ticket is a very good one; they advised me to go to Guildhall to have it checked; I came to the door and saw Mr. Levy, and laid hold of his arm; Sir, said I, I am afraid there is something wrong in this ticket, and desired him to go with me to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Was Noah by at that time? - I cannot recollect; I went to Guildhall, but stopt at the musick shop under the Piazzas at the Royal Exchange, and erased my indorsement; I indorsed it, 'sold for a 2000 l. prize, E. J. Keyser.' I went with Mr. Levy into the Irish Chamber at Guildhall, where I knew some of the commissioners, or somebody belonging to the lottery, where I desired Mr. Johnson to check the ticket; Mr. Johnson accordingly fetched up the file with the counter-parts of the tickets, but found it would not check; while we were there, Mr. Bower, who was to have purchased it, came into the Irish Chamber and said, that there certainly were two tickets of one number, for he had seen another ticket of that number in the hands of Mr. Shewell; upon which Mr. Johnson and one of the commissioners, Mr. Levy, and myself, with one of the marshal's men, went in search of the prisoners; we went to Sweeting's-alley, I left the prisoners there, and bid them wait till I brought the money; I desired Mr. Johnson and the commissioners to stand at a distance, and I would see whether I could find the prisoners; I saw Noah, I asked him where the foreigner was, for I had got the money for him; he said he was somewhere about, he could not tell where, but he would look into the New York Coffee-house for him; upon that I beckoned Mr. Johnson and the commissioner, with the marshal's man, to follow me into the coffee-house, and there we apprehended Noah.</p>

               <p>Mr. JOHNSON. This ticket matches the check exactly, the other does not; I went to the New York coffee-house; we apprehended Noah and brought him back; at first Noah seemed surprized; he told me that Arones told him he had found it; this was prior to his examination before the Lord Mayor: Noah gave some information by which Arones was apprehended.</p>

               <p>Did you put down the day of the month when you found it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you put down any thing else at the time? - Nothing at all but the number with a pencil.</p>
               <p>Did you look into the papers to see if it was advertised? - Not for that purpose, I never troubled my head about it.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where he lodged? - Yes; he said he lodged in Wellclose-square, but did not tell me the house.</p>
               <p>This foreigner is a poor ignorant man, did you not tell him it might be of value, and bid him take care of it? - No, I told him it was a ticket, and that was all.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of December, as I was going through Bishopsgate-street, on the left side of the way, I perceived Mr. Muller; I crossed over the way, and asked him how he did; he was in company with Arones; after we had walked a little way, I perceived Arones stoop; I turned my eye and saw him take a piece of paper off the ground; it was a smallish piece of paper, folded; he opened the paper in my presence; Mr. Muller spoke to him in a language that I did not understand; I asked Muller what the gentleman had found; he opened it, and said, it is a lottery ticket; he gave it in my hand; I looked at the number; I saw wrote Lottery, Anno 1776: Muller took out a memorandum book, and upon a slip of paper he made a memorandum of the number; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190047"/> he had so done, when we got nearly opposite to Bishopsgate Church, I parted from them both; I was going to take a walk; I never saw any more of either parties, or heard of them, till the 11th of January; when I got home, I was informed that a gentleman, Mr. Muller, wanted to see me upon particular business: he left word it was concerning a foreign gentleman that was in company with him the day I met him, and that it was concerning a ticket that he found upon the pavement; I did not see Muller, not being on the twelfth of January at home: upon the Sunday following Mr. Muller called upon me, and told me the nature of the affair, and asked me if I would go along with him to see the prisoner; Mr. Muller dined with me that day, we both went to Newgate to see the prisoner; I saw him in the wine room.</p>
               <p>Was it the same man you saw pick up the ticket? - The very identical man.</p>
               <p>On his Cross Examination, he said, 'that</p>
               <p>'he had seen Noah, but never had any dealing</p>
               <p>'with him of any kind; that he (the witness)</p>

               <p>'Steward, who keeps the new concert rooms</p>
               <p>'Tottenham-court Road, and that he collects</p>
               <p>'in debts and does business of that kind; that</p>
               <p>'Muller was a gentleman for any thing he</p>
               <p>'knew; that he had seen him at coffee-houses</p>
               <p>'where he had been; that he always understood</p>
               <p>'him to be a foreigner; that he never</p>
               <p>'visited at his lodgings; but that he lodged</p>
               <p>'in Little George-street; that he had visited</p>
               <p>'the witness in Vine-passage, Drury-lane,</p>
               <p>'where he had lived three years; that he</p>
               <p>'remembered the number, when Muller</p>
               <p>'came to tell him about the affair, before</p>
               <p>'Muller shewed it him; that he shewed</p>
               <p>'him the memorandum on a slip of paper;</p>
               <p>'that he did not know whether or no it was</p>
               <p>'the leaf of a book; that he saw nothing on</p>
               <p>'the paper besides that memorandum; that</p>
               <p>'Muller dined with him on the 12th of January,</p>
               <p>'and asked him to go with him to</p>
               <p>'Newgate in the afternoon; he afterwards</p>
               <p>'said, that he saw upon the leaf where the</p>
               <p>'number was, the name Count Burgois, and</p>
               <p>'something about dining with him; that he</p>
               <p>'believed the paper he put down the number</p>
               <p>'on at the time was a less piece of paper than</p>
               <p>'that leaf of the book; that it was a loose paper;</p>
               <p>'that the number was 25590.'</p>

            , my husband is in the Marshalsea prison for debt; on the 25th December last the prisoner went with me to see my husband; I gave my child the key of my room to play with, and she took it away unknown to me and went and took the things mentioned in the indictment out of my room in Duke's-street, Bloomsbury; she left the door unlocked and the key lying on the floor; I went to the Marshalsea prison on the Sunday and came home on Monday morning about eleven o'clock and found the door open; I saw no more of her till she was taken, and then she had my petticoat and shift on and a pea-green riband of mine on her head; I have got nothing again but my hat, which she took off my head in the prison; it was found in her pocket.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was set to the bar, and his counsel Mr. HOWARTH and Mr. ALLEYNE contended, that the words of the Habeas Corpus Act, all the forms of which act the prisoner had observed, were sufficiently large to warrant the idea entertained by the prisoner, to enable himself to be discharged upon bail; that there did not seem to be in the act any restriction at all upon the judges sitting upon a Commission of Oyer and Terminer; that in every possible construction that can be made of a law, that which is most favourable to the liberty of the subject, is always adopted by the magistrate; and that any person who is committed for high treason or felony, is entitled to his discharge, upon application being made in pursuance of that act; that there had been sufficient time to have brought the prisoner to trial; the prisoner gave public notice that he was ready to take his trial; that a commission might be added to that under which the court were then sitting; that as the prosecutors had not thought fit to procure a special commission for the trial, that the court finding him in the gaol of Newgate, would certainly comply with the prayer of his petition, for the court were bound to deliver the gaol of every person that should be found in it, let the offence he is charged with be of what nature it may, unless some particular application should be made to the court to detain him upon legal or reasonable cause; that if it were otherwise, a person might be imprisoned for life without a possibility of redress: the counsel said, it might be urged in answer on the other side, that the prisoner might petition for a commission to issue against him for his trial, but it might be then doubtful whether his petition would be heard, or how surely he would obtain the prayer of it; for if those who have the power to grant the commission have not the will, the prisoner has no mode of compelling them; that it is the duty of the officers who prosecute for the crown, to see that the commission issues in due time, and with proper expedition; the counsel observed, that it had been suggested, that the court having no power to try Mr. Platt, they had therefore no power to interfere; that though that looked specious when stated, yet they did not conceive it to be true in point of fact; as for instance, suppose a man was confined in Newgate for a felony committed in Yorkshire, the court at the Old Bailey has certainly no power to try him; but suppose such a person was upon the first day of the opening of the commission to present his petition, grounded upon the Habeas Corpus Act, requesting to be discharged or tried during the session; that the court would certainly order him to be immediately removed by Habeas Corpus to the county of York, there to take his trial; and that if the court did not do it in the first instance, that man would certainly be entitled at the call-over to be discharged; that if the court could make no order (which the counsel contended they could not) to send the prisoner to any other place, or to refer him to any particular commission or jurisdiction, they submitted to the court, that the party would be entitled at the last day of the session, either to be discharged, or admitted to bail; that it had been said, a special commission was to be issued upon the statute of the 35th of Henry VIII. to try the prisoner; that if such a commission was to issue, it should appear upon the face of the warrant that the prisoner is a person liable to be tried under that commission, for unless that appear with precision upon the face of the warrant, the court certainly would not intend or presume any thing in order to bring him within that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190065"/> commission; that on the contrary, so far as intendment and presumption would go, the court would intend and presume every thing in favour of a man, who is in a strange country, and who has applied to be tried: that the statute of the 35th Henry VIII. passed for the purpose of removing some doubts that had been entertained upon the construction of the statute of the 33d Henry VIII. but the court would recollect, that the law says, that a commission shall issue to try persons accused of treason in parts without the realm of England; that supposing the party to be indicted for the offence under a special commission, the words of the commission would express the offence to be committed without the realm of England, and the indictment must necessarily follow that description; that if there was a description generally that he was indicted for high treason committed at Savannah, in the Colony of Georgia in North America, that upon that description only, such an indictment would clearly be different and be quashed; that the necessary allegation and averment must be, that it was at a place without the realm of England: the counsel contended, that the warrant ought to contain the same certainty of description; that that averment was no where to be found in the warrant, for he is committed as charged upon oath with high treason at Savannah, in the Colony of Georgia in North America; that the warrant does not go on to state that it is without the Realm of England; they observed, that in such case, the court would not intend that North America is not in England; that no judge will intend or presume that the East Indies or any other part is without the realm of England unless it is so averred to be; that by fiction it is often averred to be within for the purpose of having actions tried here that could not otherwise be tried; nobody controverts the fact, and therefore it is taken as an admitted fact upon the pleading, that it was necessary that it should appear to the court upon the warrant, that the prisoner was committed for an offence that is indictable and triable, under the statute of the 35th of Henry VIII. which could not appear unless the commitment had gone on to allege, that this was committed at Savannah, being a place without the realm of England; that upon that single principle, whatever the court might conceive of their general power, under the habeas corpus act, yet upon that single principle the prisoner was intitled to his discharge. The counsel further observed, that they did not find themselves at liberty to argue now a question, which they should have been glad to have done; whether a general commitment for high treason is sufficient; they acknowledged that it had been settled in Sir

            's case, though the counsel said the reasons did not convince them, but taking it upon the general proposition that the court could not presume or intend that the offence was committed without the realm of England, as it was not so specified in the warrant; the counsel therefore concluded, that the court would under the general prayer of the petition that the prisoner had presented to them under the habeas corpus act admit him to bail.</p>
               <p>Mr. ATTORNEY GENERAL and Mr. WALLACE, of counsel for the crown, argued, that in cases of high treason, particularly in Broom's case in second Roll's Reports 107, and in abundance of other cases in the time of Queen Elizabeth and James the first, it had been held that the commission of gaol delivery did not extend to high treason; when that was held, Stamford says, that commissioners of the gaol delivery shall not deliver prisoners committed for high treason, because they have no jurisdiction to try it, and when that came to be corrected, as it did afterwards in Crompton's book of the jurisdiction of courts, a surmise is made that by the first of Edward VI. the law appeared to be otherwise; likewise Coke, Hale, and Hawkins say, the law appeared to be otherwise; but then the reason upon the law being otherwise, what do they conclude? why that the court may deliver them, because they have jurisdiction to try them; that a perusal of the act will plainly prove the whole scope and purpose of it, which is merely to bring into the gaol delivery prisoners in franchise, that they may not lie without the benefit of gaol delivery; and that act has put a penalty upon all sheriffs, lords of franchize and gaol keepers within the county for not bringing in criminals, that it was not in the contemplation of that act, that any other but those who could be tried before the gaol delivery ought to be brought in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190066"/>The counsel observed, that they had been drawn a little forwarder in what they purposed to offer to the court in these observations, but they intended at the outset to consider, in the fairest order that presented itself to them, the several arguments that had been used on the other side; they declared they had not in this particular case either personally or politically a single wish about the event of the application to the court, beyond that of keeping the law steady and clear in its due course; let the law be preserved; they had no kind of objection to what became of this individual case; liberty regulated by law and protected by law, they said, they venerated and admired; but liberty qualified in any other manner, they had no sort of esteem or regard for, for it was nothing better than licentiousness; that therefore the single question before the court was, as upon a point of liberty regulated and protected by law; and the counsel said, they would confine themselves in arguing it merely to the point of law upon the question; that the first thing that occurred was the observation that had been made upon the warrant, in order that it might be seen whether the prisoner was in gaol under such circumstances, as that he might be detained in prison: that the whole observation that had been made upon the warrant amounted to this; that although the crime is described in the warrant to have been committed at Savannah, in the province of Georgia in North America, that it does not sufficiently appear to have been committed without this realm. They observed that the counsel for the prisoner, instead of applying themselves to any kind of learning upon the form of warrants, or to any one case that had been decided upon the subject of warrants, thought proper to inform the court that in an indictment it would have been necessary to have stated, that the crime was committed out of the realm, for what purpose was it to be stated, the prisoner was to be indicted under the statute of Henry VIII. which makes the question of the venue immaterial, otherwise than as a formal venue to be laid within the indictment; if he was to be brought within that statute, that then the counsel for the prisoner said, the crime should be described as committed out of the realm; that if that argument was well founded it would not avail the prisoner; it was enough for them to say, that no position concerning the forms of warrants, that no case respecting disputes upon those forms had been quoted; that all the cases that had ever arisen upon the forms of warrants had not gone upon technical expressions, but upon the fair direct substantial intendment of the warrant: suppose the counsel for the prisoner could prevail upon the court to believe, that for want of the averment in the warrant of its not being out of the realm the prisoner could not be tried here under that statute, then the consequence would be, that he must be sent over to the place in which, the crime was committed in order to be tried, which thing had been done over and over again; they quoted the case of Comberley in Strange 848, where the court went far enough to affirm the whole law they were now aiming at; namely, that a prisoner might be apprehended here, this being the place of his abode; and that he might be committed here, being the place of his abode, for a crime committed in Ireland, or a crime committed in any part of the king's dominions, and that being so apprehended the imprisonment is legal; and that he might be sent over by a warrant of the secretary of state, which is the only universal warrant known of, unless the court of King's Bench would exert that warrant, which the counsel said, they would not controvert if they did; in order to the person's being sent over to the place of his trial; then, if the counsel for the prisoner were right in supposing that it would be impossible to try him without averring in the indictment, that the offence was committed without the realm, the consequence would be that the statute of Henry VIII. as to him, was gone, but that he remained here in order to be sent over to that place, which he must be sent over to. The counsel said, that if they were to argue it upon that ground, they should take themselves to be rather stronger in insisting that he was not to be discharged in this manner, than in the taking it upon the other ground; that thus much was submitted to the court to shew, as far as that part of the argument went, that he remains a prisoner unless there were some other grounds upon which he was to be discharged; that with regard to these grounds, they had been taken so variously and argued consequently so differently, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190067"/> in order to make their argument intelligible upon that subject, they would resort to a little division.</p>
               <p>That they would first of all put the question as if the ground was perfectly free of all embarrassments upon the subject of the power supposed to be conferred by the habeas corpus act, and to make that hypothesis a little clear, they would suppose this motion now made in the court of King's Bench, whose authority is boundless as far as goes to their discretion in point of bail; that supposing the application made there, what case would be represented to that court, in order to entitle the prisoner to bail? why, the evidence before them would be this, that a man who had committed the crime of high treason, which is the highest crime in the estimation of the law of this land that a man can commit, that the warrant returned upon that habeas would inform the court that he was charged with committing that crime at the distance of 2 or 3000 miles off, at Savannah in Georgia, the warrant would inform the court that such a culprit had been committed for the space of six weeks before the return of the habeas; it would likewise inform the court that he had lain in gaol one term with these two circumstances telling each way about it: in the first place, that he had made no application to the court to be bailed; in the next place, that the prosecutor had preferred no indictment in the court of King's Bench against him; that the court of King's Bench had undoubtedly the jurisdiction to try this offence, and the indictment might be preferred there; that the prisoner was in the gaol of the court, speaking of its universal jurisdiction, and therefore in that sense the application would stand thus; that having been six weeks in the gaol of that court (without any indictment preferred against him during that term, and without any application on his part under the habeas corpus act) for a crime committed in the province of Georgia, and during the subsistence of the rebellion, in the course of which he committed that crime, he applies to the discretion of that court to be discharged; that it could not be assuming too much to say, that in such a case the wisdom of the court would not think itself called upon to effect such a discharge; that it was for that reason that they quoted the case of Sir

             had been apprehended at the time of the rebellion, which then existed, would neither bail or otherwise demean him at the first argument, but remanded him and ordered him to be brought up again upon the last day of the term; and after the rebellion was over, after he had lain four terms in prison, after one assize in Somersetshire; for it had been observed, in order to meet a suggestion made by the attorney general at that time, that the evidence would arise of an overt act in Somersetshire, which would require him to be indicted there, after four terms with the general supposition that he was to be indicted in Middlesex, and where in point of fact he must have been indicted, if indicted at all; the court did, after remanding him and bringing him up again, think proper to discharge him; the counsel observed that Lord Chief Justice Parker and the court at that time, who were very great men, were as zealous friends to the liberty of this country as ever sat in justice, and that they had no doubt that, if such an application as the present had been made to them, it would have been impossible for them to have conceived that the discretion of the court of King's Bench was called upon under the present circumstances, as they appear upon the warrant to operate their discharge; thus much was said upon the case, upon the supposition that it was clear of all embarrassments upon the fact of jurisdiction; and that the observation came to be material in another view, because it had not yet been contended, that the court of gaol delivery was bound to use no discretion upon the last day of sitting, supposing them to have that authority, but that the person who appears to be in gaol must be delivered ex necessitate and without reference to any kind of discretion, without reference to bail, which is a modified way; that of the counsel for the prisoner meant that then to be sure the argument they (the counsel for the crown) had been urging did not apply to that, but though there are in the State Trials abundance of cases which have been argued,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190068"/> yet there never was an argument by the most sanguine counsel in Selden's case, or any of them, in which it had been hoped by them, that upon so narrow a case as that now presented to this court, the court of King's Bench would think themselves called upon in their discretion to discharge the prisoner; that a case had been mentioned in which the circumstances belli flagrantis operated at the time as an excuse for three of the terms out of four, for not bringing on the trial; that then, with regard to the grounds upon which the counsel for the prisoner applied to the court, the counsel for the prisoner had said, that every man in prison must be discharged at the last day of the sitting of the commission of gaol delivery. In answer to that the counsel said, that in every book upon the subject of gaol delivery the justices of that commission had been treated as a court of criminal jurisdiction, and of criminal jurisdiction only; that the court would not find in any book which treats of their authority to deliver prisoners, a hint that it refers to any other sort of prisoners than those which are confined for crimes; that if it had stood upon this ground only it would have gone a great way towards proving, that a court of gaol delivery was merely a court of criminal jurisdiction; but it is one of the most ancient commissions next to Eyre, known of in this country; it was very often sent out in the intervals of the commissions of Eyre, and that the terms in the commission were very general, and implied a very large and very extensive authority, and yet if the court would trace the history of that commission, and the history of the several cases decided upon it from year to year, in the year books they would find that there are bounds to their jurisdiction, why should there be other bounds to their jurisdiction than the walls of the prison itself? why should not the case of every prisoner for debt committed under special authorities, where the commitments are bad, be discharged? but till heard, the court could not say whether they were bad or no; why were not all those cases within the jurisdiction of gaol delivery? and yet it was agreed by every one, that they were not, and therefore the court of gaol delivery has bounds; why has it bounds? because the authority to act at all upon the cases of the several prisoners that are found in the gaol was incidental to the power of delivering the gaol on the one hand; on the other hand, it was confined to such sort of prisoners in gaol as were not attached by any other competent authority of a judicial sort, but as lie there purely for their deliverance; that before the 4th of Edward III. Chap. 2. it was not possible for the justices of gaol delivery to have proceeded upon an indictment taken before the justices of the peace: in the year book of the 15th of Henry VII. folio 5, B. it is laid down that the justices of gaol delivery may proceed to give judgment upon an indictment taken before the justices of the peace; it was there argued collaterally, for the point of that case was nothing to the purpose of gaol delivery, that was a case of an assize by writ of the King's court removed out of the Common Pleas, and the party insisting that he ought to be discharged of the damages, &amp;c. to the King, that was the question that arose there; but in arguing the question they referred to that case; that the reason of that case was plainly referrable to the 4th of Edward III. because they had authority by that statute to proceed upon the case, even though another judicial authority had taken it up; but they go a great deal further, for by the first of Edward VI. Chap. 7. which was intended by the legislature merely to be a continuance of processes, began in the reign of Henry VIII. but which had by interpretation been properly and justly extended to authorize the gaol delivery to proceed upon all manner of indictments that were depending upon prisoners in that gaol, either before justices of the peace or justices of oyer and terminer to proceed on them, or to proceed to give judgment upon them; that the authority of a court of gaol delivery to pronounce judgment upon those indictments depended upon the operation and effect of that statute; that it was stated to be so by all the books; the counsel put this case; suppose a man had been indicted before a court of oyer and terminer, the statute of Edward VI. clearly confines the authority to the court of gaol delivery, as pronouncing judgment and awarding execution upon indictments then taken; suppose judgment had been pronounced either by a former court of gaol delivery or of oyer and terminer, which for want of continuance by adjournment was gone;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190069"/> suppose a commission of gaol delivery came after and found that man convicted by judgment, and that the man supposing a pardon had come to him in the mean time offered to plead his pardon, that court, it had been determined expressly, could not allow the pardon; they quoted a case in Daliston, folio 20. of the resolutions of two judges, Portman and Bromley, that they were neither authorized by the 4th of Edward III. which gave them jurisdiction to hear the indictments which came in by the justices, nor by the first of Edward VI. which gave them jurisdiction to pronounce judgment and award execution; that they were not authorized by one or the other, but they directed him to take his certiorari to carry his record into the King's Bench to plead his pardon and have it allowed there; the counsel said, they mentioned these cases only for the sake of shewing the nature of the jurisdiction of gaol delivery wherever a prisoner is laid in gaol for deliverance; they might from all antiquity proceed upon an indictment; if a man laid in gaol under no attachment at all, or under an attachment for deliverance only, and no prosecution was instituted against him before the court of gaol delivery, they might discharge him; but the language of the books upon that subject is, they may discharge him after inquest upon proclamation; Lord Coke and all the writers subsequent to him take after inquest, to mean where no sufficient evidence is given before the inquest; if a bill is returned ignoramus, or no bill is preferred against him, yet the court discharges suspects; for suspect is used in the original case in Edward III. which case has guided the language in the books upon this subject, what is the purport of the proclamation? It is calling upon the prosecutor to charge the party with a crime, and if he is not charged with a crime, then he is discharged; that is the whole extent and compass of the authority of gaol delivery; if a man is imprisoned there only for deliverance they may proceed to try him, they may discharge him without trial, if nobody will come to prosecute him; that in a case in the year book it was said, that it was for the profit of the King, that they should give judgment upon him, and that was the reason why the gaol delivery gave judgment upon him; that was not said by the court, but by the counsel argumentum it was said rashly, that it was not competent for the court to pronounce judgment upon him, the statute having made it law, consequently that is the extent of it. That the authority of a court of gaol delivery would not extend for delivering a prisoner beyond where they can go in point of authority to try him. That the counsel for the prisoner had put a case, that suppose a man was imprisoned in Newgate for a crime committed in Yorkshire, there would of course be an habeas corpus to remove him.</p>
               <p>They said in answer to that, that there was in reality no writ of habeas corpus issued, but merely a warrant commanding the gaoler of the place where he is to deliver him, and the gaoler of the place where the offence is committed to receive him.</p>
               <p>The court of gaol delivery cannot, nor ever did discharge such a man; but their manner is to make out a warrant in order to subject him to the proper tribunal for trial. That in a case where justice had no interposition in the matter at all, where the party seemed to lay upon small felonies, without any body appearing to prosecute, though that is not directly within the case of delivering suspects, the court would in such a case as that let him be delivered rather without arguing the point or deciding judicially upon it; that the court, they apprehended, would not think themselves much influenced by an accident of that kind having passed sub silentio, when it appears clear that the true grounds and principles of the jurisdiction of courts of gaol delivery could not possibly go beyond that case. That there had been instances where men had been committed for felonies in Ireland, and they were not discharged at the gaol delivery; the counsel likewise quoted a case of a murder at Barbadoes, and a felonious marriage in Ireland, where the parties were committed to Newgate, and nobody imagined they were to be discharged by proclamation the last day of the session; that it would be idle to call upon the King's serjeant and attorney on the last day of the session to prosecute a man for a felonious marriage in Ireland, or a murder at Barbadoes; it never was imagined that that man was to be discharged under that species of proclamation, that the court finding him attached under the charge of a crime which they have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190070"/> no jurisdiction to try, he must remain there in order for trial; must he so? say the counsel for the prisoner, why then imprisonment must be for life; what is this the country in which people talk that there must be an imprisonment for life, because all jurisdictions are not confounded, because every justice of the peace is not at liberty to admit a man to bail for high treason? that a person who thought himself entitled to be bailed must apply to the court of King's Bench, which alone could bail him. That according to the idea of the prisoner's counsel a court of Quarter Sessions might bail high treason; that a competency to try the crime does not operate to bail it at all; and it had been expressly laid down, that no other court can bail but the court of King's Bench; that the argument on the part of the prisoner in the present case was a very extraordinary one, for the prisoner was here directly under the hand and jurisdiction of the court of King's Bench, which might have tried him or might have bailed him; that he having not applied to the court of King's Bench to be bailed, they come now to a court in which they had not made out that there was the least degree of authority to interpose in any manner whatever. That the counsel for the prisoner had said, that the prayer the prisoner is to make is, that he may be brought to his trial; now supposing the prisoner had made that prayer; the answer to it is, it is impossible he should be brought to his trial; well, but if he has gone through the form, as the gentlemen of counsel for the prisoner said, of moving to be brought to a trial, which upon the state of his petition it appeared impossible for him to be brought to, he has then satisfied the letter of the habeas corpus act, and in favour of liberty it shall be made nonsense of; and a man that never for an impracticable trial shall be set at liberty under the habeas corpus act, because it tends to liberty; it tends also to injustice; do the laws that protect the personal liberty of one individual mean to obtain the personal liberty of all the rest of mankind, and to leave the public open to all crimes being committed upon them? certainly not. That the question before the court was, whether the present case be that in which the court is directed to take this and that particular course; that the act of parliament does not enlarge or change their jurisdiction in any respect whatever, but only prescribes to them a mode of exercising it in favour of liberty; then as the court cannot possibly do justice to the public upon the offence, could the court bail him? if so, the court is to bail a person committed for a crime which it avows in the very moment of admitting him to bail that it has no cognizance of whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. HOWARTH in reply referred to the special commission under which Capt. Roche was tried for a murder at the Cape of Good Hope, which commission was issued under the 33d of Henry VIII. and that commission recited all the facts necessary to bring the party within the act; it recited that he had been vehemently suspected by the council (the word made use of in the act) it recited that the crime had been perpetrated in parts beyond the seas at the Cape of Good Hope, not stopping there, but without the kingdom; the commission there following the words of the act; it directs them to try a murder committed at the Cape of Good Hope without the king's dominions; so did the indictment follow the commission, and if the indictment had not followed the commission it would not have been good. The counsel likewise quoted the case of Mr. Sayre; he was committed for treasonable practices, and any thing that had the epithet of treasonable bestowed to it is, as the counsel for the crown had said, a crime of the first import for the magistrate to take care of; yet the learned judge whose abilities were never doubted (Lord Mansfield) said, that warrant did not contain any charge with convenient certainty, it was too vague, too general, that he could not tell what were the import of treasonable practices, and upon that ground and that ground only Mr. Sayre was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>The counsel put another case; suppose a man committed under a warrant for stealing a variety of things, though every body knows the import of stealing, yet such warrant would be bad unless it were said that he feloniously stole; is there any body that does not know that stealing is a felony? is there any doubt about the word or any ambiguity in it? it conveys full as strong an idea to the mind of a man as saying feloniously stealing; but yet such a warrant would be bad, and a person would be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190071"/> bailed that stood under such a charge. The counsel contended that the offence must be described in a legal technical manner, as much as it ought to be upon an indictment. That the counsel for the crown had said, it had been admitted that a commitment for high treason is sufficient, and he was bound to yield to the presser of a case that had been determined, but the reasons upon that case and the conclusions did not bring conviction to his mind of their property; then if the court cannot bail this man, suppose the other mode was adopted as the counsel for the crown had pointed out, of the case of persons charged with felony in Ireland, that they are sent to the place where the crime is committed; that the present defendant had no objection to travel back to Georgia at the expence of government; and though it might have been practised in extraordinary cases where the parties never complained, or never sought redress, yet a secretary of state had not so broad a power as to send a person apprehended here over to Ireland to be tried; that it is a necessary and preparatory step to that power, that an indictment should be actually preferred at the place where the offence was committed; that a certificate of that indictment should be sent. over here; that upon that certificate the party should be sent over there to submit himself to a trial upon that indictment.</p>
               <p>The COURT observed, that with respect to the warrant the counsel on each side allowed, that convenient certainty was sufficient in a warrant of commitment; that it was not necessary in a warrant of commitment to state that it was upon oath; that it might possibly be in many instances without oath; but when the charge comes to be made formally by an indictment, greater precision is required; that in the case of Sir

             it was said, there must be a credit given to the justice of peace that he keeps himself within due bounds. As to the rule of convenient certainty: This prisoner is committed being charged, as the warrant expresses it, upon oath; so far the charge was more explicit and full than it need have been by law; for the court said, they could not think themselves at liberty to quarrel with cases that had been most solemnly determined; first in the case of Kendall and Ross, and afterwards adopted by the court in the case of Sir

            , and again in a case in the Common Pleas, where the same objection had been made to the warrant; that it was fully established by these authorities, that a court had no right to throw things into confusion and subvert the solemn judgment of their predecessors. The warrant in question alledges, that the prisoner was charged upon oath by two persons named in the warrant with high treason at Savannah in Georgia, in North America, does not that convey to the court and to every bystander, that this North America is one of the four divisions of the world that is without the four seas of Great Britain? should the court here strain and say, why there may be a Savannah in Georgia, in North America, in England, the court is not bound to go against common sense, common language, and grammar; if this were an indictment it would be a very different consideration. As to that species of high treason the adhering to the king's enemies, the antient opinion was, and Lord Coke confirms it, that they might have been tried by the Common Law in this kingdom; but as to other species of high treason, though the offence was of equal magnitude if it was committed out of the realm, according to the established constitution of this country, they could not be tried here without the interposition of an act of parliament, the more especially when the crime was committed in foreign parts, not part of the dominions of this crown; with regard to such an high treason as that, the court said, that without giving any positive opinion respecting it they would readily yield to the course of the argument of the counsel for the prisoner, that it would be necessary in order to pursue the form of the special commission, and the language of the act, to state that it was in parts beyond the seas, without the realm; but with regard to the warrant the court were of opinion that it was a very proper formal warrant. Then as to the question whether there was any power in the court independent of the habeas corpus act to bail in cases of high treason; for with regard to the discharge of the prisoner, in the first place by proclamation, however that might have been, if it had passed sub silentio from a presumed assent of the crown was another consideration, but that was not the present case, for here the king's attorney general opposed the discharge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190072"/> of this prisoner, or his being admitted to bail; that by the Common Law the court of King's Bench was the only court that had power to bail in cases of high treason; Lord Chief Justice Hale in his 2d vol. 129. says expressly, that the court of King's Bench might and still may bail in any case whatsoever, even in high treason or murder; but, says he, this is in the discretion of the court, and none can challenge it de jure; there is also a case in a book called, 8th Modern, which is called, the Case of the Prisoners in the Tower; it was in the 9th year of King George I. they were persons concerned in the plot Layer was concerned in, and there was a suspension of the habeas corpus act, but these prisoners brought writs of habeas corpus to be bailed in the court of King's Bench, and they contended that the court of King's Bench was not controuled by the act of suspension, because the act said, that no judge or justice should proceed to bail or try any of the prisoners described in the act without the allowance of his majesty, signed by six privy counsellors; now said they, this term judge or justice does not restrain the court of King's Bench, it not being an adequate and sufficient description of them; but the answer to that was, that there was no authority vested in any judge or justice to bail in such a case, except in the court of King's Bench; and from thence they argued in that case, that as the court of King's Bench was the only tribunal in which that might be done, and as that court consisted as well as other courts do of judges, it was there held, that upon that principle and upon that ground, that the act must necessarily hold to that court, because no other court had authority to bail in the case of high treason. - The court said, they were clearly of opinion that no court whatsoever could bail in cases of high treason but the court of King's Bench; and that it appeared from these authorities, that independent of the habeas corpus act, there could be no possible ground for the court of gaol delivery to admit a prisoner to bail. That with respect to the habeas corpus act, which should certainly be carried to the largest extent that a liberal construction could put upon it; yet as the judges did not set as legislators to make laws, but to execute the law, they must govern themselves by it; that by that act of parliament under certain terms and conditions, and in certain situations therein described, courts of oyer and terminer and goal delivery might bail prisoners; that as to the present offence it was certainly in the option of the crown either to proceed against the prisoner in this kingdom the same as if the offence had been committed here, either in the court of King's Bench, or else before commissioners in such shire of the realm as should be assigned by the king for that purpose; that in the catalogue of special commissions in the 2d vol. of Lord Hale from fol. 10 to 20, a special commission upon the statute of Henry VIII. is enumerated as one; then it is clear that no other judicature than the court of King's Bench or a special commission has any thing to do with those offences committed out of the realm; the provisions of the act as t o the method of proceeding is, first a prayer or petition is to be made by the party to the court of King's Bench in open court the first week of the term, or the first day of the session of oyer and terminer or general gaol delivery, to be brought to his trial; that the commission under which the present court of gaol delivery acts is a general commission of gaol delivery, for all offences in a common and ordinary way committed in the county of Middlesex, therefore it is clear that this is not such a case as is meant by this act, because to petition the court of gaol delivery, who have no power at all to try the prisoner, is nugatory and is nothing.

             applied on his behalf, but the court of gaol delivery were of opinion they had no authority to interpose. Now suppose a man had been committed for felony in Yorkshire, and preferring a petition of the same sort to be tried here; or suppose a man committed for felony in Cumberland at this time of the year when there was no assize at Cumberland till next Summer; or suppose the case of the King and Yates of a felony committed at Hull where a special commission is not sent sometimes for 4 or 5 years together, this court could not under the habeas corpus act give any relief. - Supposing there had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190073"/> no power under the 35th of Henry VIII. to have tried this man in the court of King's Bench or by a special commission, and it appeared that he was in custody for a treason committed at Savannah in Georgia; all that the court could have done in that case would have been to have enquired into what method he could have been sent over to Georgia in order to receive a legal trial, but he could not entitle himself under the habeas corpus act to be discharged, With respect to Captain Roche's case, he was committed on the 10th of July, two days before the session at the Old Bailey began; Roche petitioned on the first day of the session to be admitted to bail, but the court did not allow his prayer, he continued in gaol till the next session, which was in September; towards the latter end of that session, Roche having been very active to obtain a special commission, the special commission came down, but on account of a dispute between Roche and the prosecutor, who should pay for the special commission, it went off, and he was not brought to trial till December session following; so it was decided by the court that not withstanding it was moved the first day of the session in July, he was not brought to his trial till the December session. The court mentioned the case of pirates who were committed to Newgate to be tried by a court of Admiralty, and no notice at all is taken of such persons at the gaol delivery, no enquiry is made when a commission of admiralty is to issue; that in the present case it does not depend entirely upon the will of the crown to grant a special commission or not, because the prisoner may apply to the court of King's Bench to be tried or else bailed; that the longest time he could remain in Newgate would be till he could make his prayer under the habeas corpus act to the court of King's Bench; that being the case, where was the great hardship upon the subject in this case?</p>
               <p>Mr. SERJEANT GLYNN said, he did not accede to the position that the power and the notice of the justices of gaol delivery is confined only to cases that they are competent to the trial of, for he thought that contradicted common, and what was stronger, that it contradicted necessary experience: that he had always understood the power of gaol delivery to extend over every person committed for crimes, though they had not the jurisdiction to exercise a power as a court of error over summary convictions; their jurisdiction extended to enquire whether a person is confined by legal authority; that if persons are committed for the purpose of trial in other counties and by other jurisdictions, the court of gaol delivery takes proper notice of that, if they are committed for trial before the same jurisdiction, in that case the neglect of proceeding before themselves is the ground upon which the prisoner is to be delivered; but where they are committed for trial by other jurisdictions, what the court does upon that occasion is to take notice that it is a legal detention for a legal purpose, that of bringing the person to trial in another jurisdiction; but supposing the case that a prisoner is committed under a commitment so absurd and informal and substantially defective that it does not amount to a charge that imports that he should be carried to any jurisdiction to be tried; that in that case the prisoner is to be discharged by the gaol delivery. Mr. Serjeant Glynn mentioned his own determination of a case that occurred at the Old Bailey, where a man was charged with divers offences in different counties, that he could not let him remain in prison, because he could not understand where he was to be carried to be tried; that where a prisoner was in custody charged with an offence triable under a special commission, he was to remain a convenient time for the purpose of such trial; that the court takes notice where a person is committed for the purpose of being tried in another place, and therefore does not discharge him, for he is legally detained for that purpose; yet if he is detained beyond a legal time necessary for that purpose, that the court ought then to interpose; and the Serjeant said, he thought the power of deliverance was upon the ground frequently of their having no jurisdiction to try, and no care being taken or expedition used to bring the person to trial in a convenient time, as the liberty of the subject requires he should be before any other proper competent jurisdiction; that there he apprehended he was a proper object of deliverance by the court of gaol delivery, but concurred in opinion with the learned judges on the Bench, that the court could not at present interpose.</p>
