On 20th July I received information and a description and subsequently saw Ward alone on Ludgate Hill, and followed him into the Old Crown public-house—I then went to the back of the house and sent in a message—in the meantime I saw Llewellyn, and, being a respectable fellow, I asked him if he would go in and tell the land<lb/>lord there was a man there going to pass counterfeit coin and that he had a white <hi rend="italic">slop</hi> on and a pea jacket—he said "I will do so," and went into the house—he and the other two prisoners came out and I went round to the front of the house and saw the three prisoners in the road together-Llewellyn turned back and said "Am I going to the Palace?"—I said "No, you must go up here and turn down the lane"—I then went home, changed my uniform, came out, spoke to the barmaid, and found the other two pri<lb/>soners at the Red Lion 500 or 600 yards from where I had seen them before; that is the reverse direction to the Palace—they came out and I followed them to the Holloway Road, where I spoke to another officer—they separated opposite the Red Cap, and Ward went on 50 yards, and they all three joined again at St. John's Church, Holloway—Llewellyn then went into the Marl-borough Hotel and I went in and spoke to the barmaid, who showed me this coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then went round and took Llewellyn, handed him over to the publican, and went and arrested the other two prisoners—Mason gave his address, 5, James Street, Holloway Road—I went there with Ser<lb/>geant Burnham and found this battery, mould, ladle, and metal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

(<hi rend="italic">These advertisements were addressed to cutters and travellers offering good terms for new patterns and designs, and purporting to emanate from a foreign house doing no trade in Great Britain.</hi>) After the second advertisement I gave Laughlin, who is in my employ, some instructions respecting it, he subse<lb/>quently showed me a letter and I gave him other directions in consequence of which he told me he was going out, and told me where he was going—he afterwards told me the result of an interview he had had—according to my directions he wrote again and I gave him a great number of patterns—I could identify them, but I have not seen them since the examination—the patterns that were produced were the ones that Laughlin obtained, and were found on the prisoner—I heard that according to my directions the prisoner was given into custody—we send goods to nearly all countries in the world.</p>

In consequence of directions I received I went with Loughlin to the Yorkshire Grey and remained outside—I met the prisoner as he was coming out and told him I should take him in custody—I did so and took him to the station, placed him in the dock, and on searching him found these letters and the answer of Langhlin's, together with the two packages of patterns—when I took the letters from him he said "I hope you won't take those, as they might implicate others" I also found a receipt for the advertisement and a copy of the advertisement in his purse.</p>

               <p>I cannot remember the dates when I took indigo to 91, Minories, but I went there about eight times altogether during a period extending eight months back—our first conversation took place at 91, Minories—Cowart paid me from 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. for it when I delivered it—after I had been twice Cowart said "It is a great bother your coming two or three times for the money, what will you give me out of it if I pay you the whole amount?" and then he deducted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—then he asked me to bring some more indigo and he would pay me each time—in the letter I asked for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we made an arrangement that whenever I referred to the matter in writing I should allude to some one else; that is why I say in the letter "My friend will clear out," and "My friend wants the money on Thursday"—he did not send me the money from Liverpool—I do not know how long he was absent—I saw him on his return—I remember Mr. Broomhall calling my attention to a deficiency of indigo afterwards—as I felt unhappy, my health was in a bad state, and I had been out late at night spending money with bad companions; I was passing this man's place on my way to St. Katherine dock and called and told him not to expect me to keep the appointment I had made with him—he said "That is all nonsense," and that I should have to keep the appointment—I said I had made up my mind, I should leave it all alone—he said it was all <hi rend="italic">bosh</hi>, or something of that sort, and threatened me that if I did not go on bring<lb/>ing indigo he would take all I had brought to my employers and then tell my father—I afterwards took him more indigo, for which he paid me at the same rate, and on one occasion he advanced me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I again asked him to give me time to refund the money and I would give him interest for it—he would not hear of that and I felt obliged to take him indigo for the 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 11th July I took a parcel of indigo from my masters premises to 91, Minories, by appointment—I suspected that I was watched, and went into the shop as quick as I could, and said "I believe I am followed," and put the parcel in Cowart's hands, who hid it and substituted another parcel for it, and instantly the policeman came in and examined the parcel—I did not see the parcel of indigo afterwards—the next morning I asked the officer to withdraw while I spoke to my master.</p>

I am a musician, of 31, York Road, Walworth—on 9th July I was on board the Fairy steamboat, and had some beer with the prisoner, who I had seen on board beats before—he went upstairs and I sat there some time—when we left Cherry Gardens Pier I saw the prisoner drinking a cup of tea, and he said to the girl "Will you get me another cup of tea?"—she went to get it and he sat on the bar down behind the partition, and I saw him put his hand out and bring it back to his coat tail pocket, it seemed to me he did that twice—I went up and told the captain what I had seen and afterwards told the mate and spoke to the barmaid who was counting her money—the mate went upstairs after the prisoner and brought him down, and said "Where is the money you have taken from that girl?"—he said "I have not"—I said "You have"—the mate said "If you don't give it up I will shake it out of you"—he said that he not, they had a scuffle, and the mate took 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him while he was on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student, of 88, Newman Street, Oxford Street—on 12th July, about 12.40 a.m., I called at a stationer's shop facing Middlesex Hospital—I had left a bottle there for some oil to replenish my lamp—the three prisoners came in with another man and the prisoners called for some lemonade and wanted me to toss them for some cigars—Thomas, the cabman, made offensive remarks about my trowsers and said that I was like a shoeblack—I took no notice and he pushed his black felt hat in my face—I told him if he did that again I should hit him—he pushed his hat again in my face and I pushed him back—he then hit me with the glass out of which he was drinking lemonade—we got out into the street—Williams held me on one side and Thompson on the other—the one who escaped held me round the waist while Thomas was attacking me—Thomas struck me, and directly they let go of me I put my hand to my pocket and my watch was gone, which was safe five minutes before; I pulled it out in the shop when Thomas asked me the time——I called "Stop thief!" and the</p>

               <p>prisoners went away as quick as they could—Williams was at the corner of a street and said "The man who has got the watch has gone down that way"—Thomson jumped on the cab to drive it away—Thomas drove by the side of it, and the witness Bower turned it back—I went to the station and gave the prisoners in charge.</p>

I had been to see some friends—I did not hear Thomas ask a man to hold his horse, I was inside the shop—when Thomas put his hat in <hi rend="italic">ray</hi> face I said I would throw him over the railings if he did it again—he said that he was <hi rend="italic">Young Hundreds</hi>—he hit me across my face with the glass and cut my lip—after that we went into the street—I <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> up at him and he struck at me many times; that did not last half a minute, because I was seized by the other people—I did not hear the cabman say he had lost his hat and must look for it, as a policeman was coming and he should be summonsed for loitering.</p>

Thomas cut my lip and I got the lemonade over me—I did not strike him outside till he struck me—I was in the shop nearly ten minutes before the prisoners came in and ten minutes afterwards—I did not hear the expression "There goes your cab," or "They are driving your cab off"—one policeman came first and another afterwards—one took Thompson and the other Williams—one policeman told me to get into the cab and Thomas drove me half way to the station and then said he would not go further unless I paid him his fare—he was on the box when he said that; I do not know whether he said that through the square hole—I then got out and walked to the station—I do not know how Thomas got into, the station, but he was watched—the acting inspector heard my charge and said "Do you charge the cabman as well?"—the cabman was the acting one of the lot—I made the charge against him first—I did not feel any one touch my watch.</p>

               <p>struck him with the lemonade glass across the lips-—they tusled and got outside—I went outside but not near them—I saw the other three holding Dixon while Thomas was punching him—when they let go of him the man not in custody ran away, and directly afterwards I heard Dixon say "My watch is gone"—I ran as far as Union Street but could see nothing of him, but Williams ran out—I saw a constable run from Tottenham Street, and then Williams said that the man who had run away had gone up Union Street—I omitted to mention that when Thompson saw the other man run, away he got up and drove the cab off—another witness ran after him, followed him as far as How Street, and caught him—they at last all came back except the third man—some constables came up; one took Williams and another took the other two—I went to the station and heard the charge made.</p>

Twining, giving the donor a provisional receipt, leaving a counterfoil in his receipt book, and to make out a receipt in the secretary's book for the secretary's sig<lb/>nature, also to be sent to the donor—I produce the secretary's receipt book for 1875, and on the 15th June I find on counterfoil 59 an entry in the prisoner's writing of "Strand Charity Organisation Committee No. 59, St. George's Place.

I got of you this morning"—Johnson said "You got no 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I don't know what you mean "—the prisoner said You know—Johnson said "I don't know anything at all about it"—I then said to the prisoner "I shall have to charge you with having stolen these silk handkerchiefs from the premises of Messrs. Spall of 120 Cheap<lb/>side; you will also be charged with receiving them, well knowing them to be stolen—he said "I did not steal them, I will tell you the man they belong to—I said "You keep on saying you ill tell me, but you do not do so"—after some hesitation he said "I got them of a man named Lee, at 4, Jupp's Road"—I asked the prisoner if he had any books—he reached down some invoices and gave them to me—I said "Do these refer to these goods" he</p>

I am a solicitor, of 40, Churton Street, and have the conduct of the prisoner's defence from beginning to end—I remember the hall porter being put into the box on the second remand—he forgot the date—I asked him what day it was and he said "Last Friday—I said "Think again," and he said "Well, it was either last Friday or Friday week"—Mr. Newton, the Magistrate, said that he had determined to tend the case for trial, and I immediately sat down—I asked Mr. Newton to allow the evidence to be expunged—I thought it advisable that no witness should be called.</p>

I took out a summons at Bow Street and the defendant appeared, and at the suggestion of Mr. Vaughan I withdrew the summons on the defendant pro<lb/>missing not to annoy me again—he admitted the signature to the letters and that he had sent them—ten days afterwards I received these two books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in this cover; on one of them is written" Bribed, of course, by old mutton chops," in the prisoner's writing; that referred, I suppose, to the reporters—there are some marks in the books, but nothing to show who made them—I afterwards received this document. "Extract from a novel publication shortly to be issued, and will appear if the wretch does not do his victim justice immediately. It is said that since Abraham's daughter ran off with a scavenger, and a synagogue's funds under Abraham's manipulation became small by degrees' and beautifully less, he has been seen walking of mornings alongside the bank of the Serpentine, but has never had the courage to consummate the most desired object of all who know him, &amp;c.

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Webster and Graham, 17, Ely Place, solicitors for the prosecution—the defendant applied to us by his solicitor, Mr. Rawlings, as to the course to be taken with regard to the prosecution; I saw the defendant yesterday—he said nothing about having seen Mr. Rawlings, to me, nor did he allude to the interview I had had with Mr. Rawlings; I told him that Mr. Braham suggested that he should plead guilty to the indictment, and we would ask his Lordship to allow him to go out on his own recognizance, which he indignantly declined to do—nothing was said about the costs of the prosecution.</p>

               <p>money, to which you sent this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed B. Jones.—To Mean. Webster and Graham, and stated referring to Mr. Abraham:"</hi> He lies in the teeth saying I am endeavouring to extort money, it is an odious lie jastaj every act through his life has been It is a further lie to say that I knew he lost money by my property.") This is our reply: <hi rend="italic">From Webster and Graham to B. Jones, dated February, 1st, 1877, stating that they hove nothing of the facts between himself and Mr. Braham, and that if he had and complaint he should enforce it by legal means and not by abusive letters, and enquiry wither he was prepared to pay Mr. Braham, his principal, interest, and costs, as he would be glad to get rid of the property.</hi>) We had no answer to that—Mr. Braham did not swear that it was your writing, upon which he obtained the first summons in March, it was merely my application to the Magistrate, and I stated that it was your signature—he granted the sum<lb/>mons without oath, but when Mr. Braham was examined he swore to your signature—you admitted before the Magistrate that you sent that insulting document in reply and you justified it—I don't remember if Mr. Braham swore over and over again that it was all your writing, but he swore to your signature—I do not think you wrote me a letter when you received the second summons, but Mr. Rawlings called on me—you called on me after the second summons with a view to my withdrawing it, and I wrote you a letter; I believe you called on me again on 27th—this is my letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated January</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">stating thai the summons against the defendant had been adjourned to that day week.</hi>) It was not on the receipt and that letter that Mr. Rawlings and you came to me—when you did come no stipulation was made that you must pay a certain sum for costs if the pro<lb/>ceedings were withdrawn—after that letter I do not remember seeing you or Rawlings, but you sent me a sort of undertaking which I refused to accept—you said that you would undertake not to write any more yourself, and that you would undertake that Mr. Braham should not receive any further annoyance—I wished to be certain that another person was under your control—I didn't think of coercing you—you led me to believe that if you had not written the letters they were written by your instructions—you led me to believe they were written with your instructions and said that it should not occur again—you said that you would use your influence to prevent it—I led you to believe till the last moment that the thing would be settled there, and if you had given that undertaking it would had been withdrawn—on the day before the case came before the Magistrate you gave me an undertaking which I could not accept—I did not give you the form—you passed this piece of paper to mo (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in Court, and this is the answer I wrote upon it "Don't intend"—when the sum<lb/>mons was adjourned for a week you showed no disposition to arrange it, you never came near the place, nor did Mr. Rawlings, but the day before it came on I receive the undertaking from you—since the hearing of the summons you have offered to produce the writer of the document—I stipulated with Mr. Rawlings for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. costs; you had written to say that you would pay no costs—this is the document upon which I applied for the second summons.</p>

One witness says I ran first and another that I ran after, and there is no evidence to identify me as the man who ran out of the house at all, and no property was found upon me except a ledger and other articles, which I had when discharged from a ship, and which could serve no purpose in a burglary—I never saw the man I am charged with before, and I was simply walking along the street when the policeman asked me to walk with him, and I said I had no objection. I answered every question and told where I lodged.</p>

On 14th July I received a warrant from Sir Thomas Dakin to take the prisoners in custody and to search the place at 153, Fleet Street, which I did in company with Taylor, of the City police and Inspector Latter—Baker was on the second floor when I went up, and I called him out and followed Estrabrook up, who was going up in front of me—when we got to the studio I told Estrabrook we were police officers—I said "I have a warrant to arrest you both, also another which authorises me to search these rooms"—I produced the warrants and read them both to them—they made no reply—Baker was then in his shirt<lb/>sleeves—I directed Latter and Taylor to go downstairs with him to get his coat, which they did; whilst they were gone Estrabrook seemed very over<lb/>come, and he said "I am guilty of this 1"—I said "Now, I suppose you have got some of these negatives—you will save time if you get them"—He got up and was about to go his bedroom; I followed and said "I mean The Champagne Supper,' and 'The Four Ages'"—I went into the front room and be went to a cupboard, and amongst others he produced this negative of "The Champagne Supper"(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said "I want 'The Four Ages'"—he said he would give it me, and he went again to the same cupboard, and from another shelf produced a lot of negatives, amongst them this "The Four Ages "(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—by that time Baker had returned, and they were afterwards conveyed to the station by Latter and Taylor, and we then returned in company with Inspector Peel and searched the premises—I counted the negatives and Peel ticked them off—there were 150, all more or less obscene, some very bad—there were 375 actual printed photo<lb/>graphs—the negative produced is a very fair specimen, as also the corres<lb/>ponding print—there is a negative also of this print but I have not got it—these twenty or thirty prints are specimens.</p>

I live at 53, Greenfield Street, Mile End, and am the wife of Henry Spurden—on the 9th July at about 6.15 in the evening the prisoner, who is my sister-in-law, came to my house with an infant in her arms, which she gave to my landlady—she said her husband went home and told her that I had said I would pull her wind-pipe out, and she pulled me down by the hair from off the stairs and dragged me along the passage, and I feel with my back against the room door in the passage and she threw the baby's sucking bottle in my eye-—it broke, and the sight of that eye is gone—she pulled me backwards and forwards and said come back you b-w-; I got up as well as I could and went to the hospital—what was left of my eye had to be removed—I did not provoke her in any way before she struck me, and I never threatened her.</p>

I was going towards Mare Street, at about 4.15 on Sunday morning, with the last witness, when I saw the two prisoners coming from the front garden gate of the prosecutor—a short boy of about twenty was with them; he beckoned to the prisoners and walked away—I called out to a sergeant who was coming up the road to stop Goffee, as he looked rather bulky—when they saw two constables in front of them they turned round and faced me, and I let Goffeerun by, but caught O'Neil and we had a little struggle in the road—he said "God blind me, you havn't got me to the station yet"—with the assistance of the sergeant I got him to the station—on the way he said to the last witness he would have his b-y liver out, or words to that effect—when he got to the station he made a rush at the last witness, which was prevented by the sergeant and myself—Goffee was apprehended four days afterwards—at the station be said "You have got the cheese, but you have not bit it yet."</p>

               <p>I went to the place to have half a pint of beer, when the prosecutor began to make fun of me on my conversing with a man that the prosecutor says I was reciting to. The prosecutor put his hand in my pocket and took my handkerchief—I said "You were not sharp enough that time," and insisted on his giving it me back. He struck me on the nose and cut it; they tried to put me out; I struggled, and we fell. I lost 155. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was all I had. I received a violent blow on the head, and I remember no more. When I recovered my senses I was lying on the floor, and all were standing round me. I got up and walked out. One man said "It was only a lark you old fool." I went away, but was watched and given in charge. It is a public-house row. I have been twenty-eight years at sea and never had a row before in my life or a bad discharge. Whoever bit the prosecutor was of unsound mind.</p>

I had seen Mr. Thompson at my house three or four times before, but not with the prisoners—when I last saw him he was so intoxicated that I thought it necessary to tell my barman not to give him any more drink—he was kissing Ketcher and putting his arm round their Decks, and calling them his dearly beloved boys, and was patting Ketcher on the face; that was a common occurrence; I have seen him acting in an in sane way before; he was not intoxicated when he did that, he perfectly knew what he was about—he did not say anything when he tore the note up; he tore it in three—he had the others in his hand at the same time, loose.</p>

On 26th July, I was on duty at the Bank of England, and was sent for to the secretary's office—the two prisoners were there—the clerk said that Mr. Thomson had stopped the note that morning, giving his address 171, Holland Road, Kensington—our clerk said that Ketcher gave the name of Phillips—Ketcher heard that and said "The note was given to me as he can prove," pointing to Eldon, at Mr. Baker's, Dick's Tavern; Thomson was drunk and he was tearing up bank-notes, and the note was given to me there by Mr. Thomson"—I asked how he accounted for the signature on it—"John Thomson, 21, Fentiman Road, Clapham"—he said "I did that"—he also said "I pointed Mr. Thomson out to a policeman in Fleet Street, knowing he was drunk, and he had about l,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his possession"—I took both prisoners to the station and found Mr. Thomson there, they were confronted with him about 2 o'clock, and I said to him "These two persons say you gave them the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note"—he said "I did not"—I said "Did you authorise them to put your name on the front of the note"—he said "I did not," they made no reply—they both referred me to Mr. Baker and said that what they had told me was the truth—I went direct to Mr. Baker—the prisoners were searched, but only three farthings was found between the two—I went to Ketcher's address in Hoxton Street, but found no money—Eldon gave his address, 90, High Street, Islington, and then 290—I went to two 90's and two 290's, but could not hear of him, and he said before the Magistrate that he had given me the wrong address—I found this piece of paper on Eldon, and said "Who is this for?"—he said "It is for Ketcher"—after the charge was read over at Bow Street they both repeated that the note was given at Baker's, and Ketcher pointed to Eldon and said "He was present at the time it was given."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. When Ketcher referred to Eldon, Eldon said "Yes, I was there when the note was given."(<hi rend="italic">Note, read</hi>: "If the gentleman is really locked up get him out by all means and without a moment's delay. The fine for being tight will only be a few shillings, and 1 can do that, and if the old gentleman has gone astray before, then we must call in the assistance of a solicitor to advocate his cause; you will be repaid all the money you expend. Don't let the little man go wrong because I like him, and meet him almost daily at Chambers, or more correctly speaking I used to do so. He is a perfect gentleman, but unfortunately puts his hand up to his mouth too often. Mind, don't let him go to do seven days; I will, if necessary, pay expenses for the little fellow.") Eldon said that he had written that to be given to Ketcher.</p>

I am a labourer, of 10, Star Lane, Canning Town—on Wednesday, 4th July, I was drinking with the prisoner and he went home with me to my lodgings—I was tired, suffering with a bag leg, and laid on the bed to rest it—he shoved me over on the bed and said he was tired too, and laid down by the side of me—I was not sober—my purse was in my outside coat pocket, I saw it there a few minutes before I laid down—about two or three minutes afterwards I felt his hands in my pockets—he left me and I slept—the next morning I missed ray purse and three sovereign—in the afternoon I missed a serge jacket and shirt—after giving him in charge I found he had got two knives and a pipe of mine in his possession—the pri<lb/>soner was potman at the beer-house where we had been drinking—the day after I missed the things I went with two police officers and found the pri<lb/>soner</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—on 19th May last I was living at the Criterion public-house, in Shakespeare Road, Brixton—I was the nominal landlady of the house—the prisoner and his wife lived and slept there—I have known him for years—I had lived under the same roof with him and his wife at the Victoria public-house, Hyde Park Gardens, and also at a private house at Peckham Rye—I went to the Criterion on 17th March last—up to Saturday, 19th May, there had not been any quarrel or ill feeling between us—he came down from his bedroom that day about 12.30, his wife</p>

               <p>bad come down earlier—we dined about 1 o'clock—Mrs. Henson left before dinner and went to another house that the prisoner had in the City, where she attended two or three time a week—on this Saturday morning she went out about 10 o'clock—Miss Rose, the barmaid, was present at the dinner, and the prisoner and his two children—after dinner I and Miss Rose went upstairs to attend to some household arrangements, leaving the prisoner standing in the bar—I believe there were two or three customers in the bar, but 1 did not notice—we had been upstairs about half an hour when heard the prisoner call from downstairs, I think it was for Miss Rose, I won't be sure whether it was to her or myself, I sent her down—she occupied the same bedroom with me, but we were both in the prisoner's room when he called—the prisoner then came up to his room—he said "Emma, what a time you have been"—he always called me Emma—I said something about not being long if Miss Rose had been allowed to stop—he complained of not being well, I suggested that he should lie down as I knew he was not well—he said that he had his work to do in the cellar—I advised him to put it off until after tea—I then went to my room to dress, and I believe he went downstairs—I was in my room about three-quarters of an hour, I was leaving to go downstairs and was on the landing, I had an empty jug and a candlestick in my hand—I saw the prisoner coming from his bedroom door—I said "Have you done your cellar work?"—he said "Yes," and I said "I will go down and see about the tea"—he then said he wanted to speak to me, walked into my room, and I followed him—my keys were on the dressing table, he asked me whether they were mine, I said yes—he asked if they were the keys of my cash-box—I laughed and said "I have not any money to put in a cash-box"—I took up the keys and put them in my pocket and was about to go downstairs when he took hold of me and said "I am going to kill you"—I said "Oh, no"—I did not believe that he meant what he said, I could not think it—Miss Rose came up, the door must have been dosed, because I tried to open it and could not—I found that I had received some injury, my finger was cut; I don't know that I had felt any wound, but at the same moment that I found my finger was cut, I felt something trickling from my neck—Miss Rose opened the door; I believe I was then in a stooping position, but I was able to run downstairs—I don't think he was holding me—I don't know what became of the jug and candlestick—when I got downstairs I heard the prisoner call me once or twice—I was then sitting in the bar, he was at the door at the foot of the stairs—I did not see him again until he was in custody, that was about two hours after—when he came up into his room I asked him for a holiday, as I felt tired and wearied—he said no, he could not spare me—I saw that he did not wish me to have one, and I did not press him—this was before I went into my room—I do not think I used any other words that were likely to offend him—no razor was kept in my room—this paper is the prisoner's writing—I have read it, it is true. (<hi rend="italic">The paper was as follow</hi>: "Emma Pearson and myself have been like man and wife for years; she never knew another man. I love her dearly.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Laugh borough Road, Brixton—I was called to the Criterion on Saturday, 19th May—I got there between 5 o'clock and 5.30—I noticed blood on the stairs and on the floor in the parlour—before I saw Miss Pearson I saw the prisoner lying on the stairs with a man support<lb/>ing him; he seemed excited and bewildered—I said "What is the matter?"—he said "Who are you, what do you want?"—I thought at the time that it was he who was wounded; I had not been told who it was—I could see by the way in which he spoke that he did not know what he was up to, or what he was doing at all—I judged that he was either drunk or stupid from some reason or other—I was then called down into the parlour, where I found Miss Pearson with her neck bleeding, and a handkerchief tied round her neck; Miss Rose was supporting her—there was a great deal of blood on her clothes and hands—I bad her taken upstairs and laid on the bed and I then examined her—I found a out on the left side of the neck, be<lb/>ginning near the middle line of the neck, extending forwards to about 1 1/2 inches below the ear, forward along the edge of the lower jaw near to the centre of the chin—the depth of it at the back was from) inch to 1 inch; towards the front it became gradually more superficial and was skin deep—there was another cut on the cheek extending from about the middle of the long cut—that was not, perhaps, 1/4 inch deep at the beginning, and that also became superficial just at the end—there was a very small out just over the right eyebrow; that was quite superficial; it was a clean out through the skin—the deep wound in the neck must have been inflicted with a very sharp instrument, such as a razor—it would not necessarily have been a violent cut—I don't think the two wounds could have been done by the same action of the razor—the fore and middle fingers of the right hand were cut; that might have happened in the struggle, from grasping the razor; she has the marks of the wounds now—I did not pay any atten<lb/>tion to the prisoner, he was in charge of the police—I saw the razor at the police-court; such wounds might be produced by it.</p>

I live at 3, Wallis Court, Mint Street—I have lived with the prisoner eight years—on 9th July we went out between 7 and 8 a. m., and we drank at several public-houses and became intoxicated—we came home, and about 2 o'clock in the day I went into the room where the prisoner was lying down—I tried to take some money out of his pocket—he woke up and said "You have taken some money out of my pocket"—I said "No, I had it in my hand, but I left it there; you had better lie down and you will find it"—he laid hold of me, and we fell down on the bed and then on the floor—I left the money in his pocket—I thought he had bitten my nose, but when the bandage was taken off I found it was only a cut—I went to the hospital, where the wound was dressed—I lost much blood, but suffered no pain—I appeared against him at the police-court the next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old and live at 3, Mitre Street, Blackfriars, with my father and mother—on Saturday, 7th July, I was in the garden which joins the prisoner's yard at the back—she has lived there a great many years and mother knows her—her yard has a chicken house against our wall—it has a sloping roof nearly to the top of our wall, which is 7 or 8 feet high—I saw the prisoner on the roof of the chicken house about 12 o'clock, with a beer can in one hand and a dead cat in the other, she said "You have killed my cat"—I said "I have not killed it, not hit it once"—she said "I will have your b-life"—my mother then came up and the prisoner threw some stuff at me over the fence, from the can—there was no cover to the can—some parsly was growing there, and I was about 6 feet from her—just a little spot went on my neck—I did not notice my mother at that time—I was stooping down sweeping the yard—I was not looking up towards her—the prisoner was not directly behind me, she was on one side—I did not see her throw anything, but I felt something on my neck, and when I looked up I saw the mouth of the tin, which was in her right hand—I did not hear her say anything more—I went in to my mother who was in the kitchen washing the breakfast things—I was pricked on my neck, but the mark has gone away—my clothes were burnt—these are them (<hi rend="italic">producing a felt hat and a pair of trowsers and a waistcoat, all covered with red stains, and a shirt with a great number of holes burnt through it</hi>)—my mother was in the house when I felt the stuff on my neck, and I went into the kitchen to tell her—the shirt and waistcoat have not been washed since—I had no flannel or linen of any kind under my shirt—I had no marks on my body, only one on my neck—my mother has kept the clothes since—I took them off an hour and a half afterwards, and I have not had them since—I cannot swear to this can.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness, and live at 3, Mitre Street, Lambeth—the prisoner's house faces mine, and the chicken-house is against the end of the wall of my garden, which is about 12 feet long and 8 or 9 feet wide—the fowl-house comes nearly up to the wall, and the bottom of the fence stands on the wall—the top of the fence is about 7 feet from the ground—the wall is 5 feet high and the fence 2 feet—the roof of the fowl-house comes to about 1/2 foot from the top of the wall and the width of the sloping roof is 2 feet or 2 1/2 feet; it is made of wood and there is plenty of room for any one to stand there—on Saturday afternoon, 7th July, about 12.15, I heard a disturbance in my garden; it was after dinner, because I have my dinner early on Saturday, and it was an hour or an hour and a half after dinner—I heard the prisoner hallooing at my boy, but did not hear the words—I went out and saw the prisoner on top of the chicken-house—I said "Whatever is this disturbance about?"—she said "He has killed my cat with poison, I will have his b——life"—a woman in the pri<lb/>soner's yard spoke to me at the same time, but I did not hear what she said—I do not know whether my boy heard the prisoner say that, he was stand<lb/>ing near the dust hole, he was very near—I made no answer, but told him to finish what he was doing and make haste and come indoors, and I went into the kitchen, but before that the prisoner said "I will burn him and his b——garden too"—I said that if she did such a thing she would suffer for it—she made no answer—I left the boy sweeping the path and went in, and about three minutes after that he came in to me and said</p>

               <p>"Mother, Mrs. Barry has thrown something over me, and it is burning ray neck"—his hat looked red, but not so bright a red as it is now, because it was not dry—I did not stop to notice his other clothes—I ran down the garden with the hat, and jumped on a box and saw Mrs. Barry standing on the chicken-house, and said "Whatever have you thrown on my child, you wicked woman <hi rend="italic">?"</hi>—she said "I did not do it"—I said it is all over the place, everything in the garden where it was, is burnt up"—she said no more I went into the Kitchen and locked at the boy to see whether he was burnt and he had a little mark just by his collar—his clothes were all coming to pieces, as he moved his arm they tore into holes; his waistcoat turned white and his hat turned red; his skin was not burnt, but his shoulder looked red.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not tell the boy at the time that it was vitriol, but I did after I took him to the Court on the Monday—his clothes have not been washed since, they had been washed before—I wash every other week—the holes were in the clothes when I took them off the boy, as they are now—there was just a little mark on his neck like a graze—I told him afterwards on the same day that she said she would have his b-life; he was mad to drive the cats about, and 1 thought it better to tell him to prevent his driving other cats—I told him that before I took his clothes Off just before I came back with his hat—a man and woman were in the pri<lb/>soner's yard at first, but not when she used that language—when she first spoke to me those people spoke to me and I told them it had nothing to do with them and to mind their own business; I could just see their faces over the wall; they were afterwards witnesses at the police-court; I do not know their names; I did not see them when this conversation took place—I said at the police-court "There were two other people in the yard, but they could not have heard what she said"—I took some of the stuff off his hat with my fingers, it looked a pale red, it did not burn, I wiped it off directly—some weeks before this the prisoner said "How tiresome he is to the cat," or something like that—she complained that he would run out and halloo at her—I said "He don't harm the cat, it is great folly of you to take notice of him, it is the only way he has got, because the cat rakes up his flowers"—the cat never annoyed me—I do not think I said at the police-court "The cat annoyed me by pulling up my flowers;" I think my boy said that—the Magistrate asked me what the cat did in the garden and Isaid that she pulled up the flowers—the prisoner and I have always passed the time of day from the windows and have been friendly up to a week or two ago, when this happened to the cat—I think the cat looked starved.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Stones End, close to the police court—I examined these clothes before the Magistrate on 17th July—the hat is stained by some strong acid, sulphuric, probably; and what would produce that appearance on a felt hat, would most assuredly hurt the human skin—there is no brown or red on the shirt, but the holes are such as acid would produce—I say the same as to the waistcoat and trowsers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It must have been a strong acid to produce that effect on a black felt hat—I know something about acids, but am not an analyti<lb/>cal chemist—I cannot give you an idea how long acid would be acting on this hat, it would depend upon temperature and other causes; probably in a quarter of an hour, in the ordinary condition of the atmosphere—I cannot tell how soon it would turn red, whether immediately or not; sulphuric acid would not discolour the shirt but it would gradually rot—a strong acid would destroy the fabric in half an hour—the trowsers are burnt through but not the lining—acid which burnt through trowsers of this kind, would, if it fell on the skin, produce inflammation of the cuticle, and great pain, undoubtedly—if inflammation set in it might last days or weeks and lead to serious consequences of health and life—if inflammation was set up I should expect it to last much longer than twenty-four hours—I do not think the mark would disappear in forty-eight hours, but it would depend upon the amount of inflammation—I saw the boy on the 17th, there was then a small mark on his neck to which I attached no importance; it might have been a little <hi rend="italic">exema</hi> of the skin, or a little graze; it was a little <hi rend="italic">papillice</hi>, not like a burn; I do not think it was produced by acid—it was not like a burn from acid, and if such as injured this hat, had fallen on human skin it most have injured the skin also.</p>

It is not usual to keep acid of this strength in tin, it should be kept in a glass—I wish to observe that the acid, though trong, relatively, must have been diluted, and I understand that the prisoner was cleaning tins—the acid might be strong enough to burn this shirt while on the boy's shoulders and yet be absorbed by the shirt and not be strong enough to burn his skin.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SAFFORD</hi>. The acid might not burn his skin because it might be intercepted by the fabric—the cloth might be destroyed and yet the skin escape injury—the cloth would absorb the acid; it would depend upon the quantity; if there was not enough to penetrate, then the skin would escape, but it would effect the skin if the quantity of acid was large—it is possible to throw acid on the clothes and destroy them without injuring the skin—acid of this strength placed in a beer can soldered together, would destroy the metal, but I cannot say in what time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Pure sulphuric acid would burn a hole immediately almost like flame, and it would be more likely to injure the skin—if material saturated with acid of this strength touched the skin it would at once cause inflamma<lb/>tion, but if it was diluted it would gradually destroy the material without injuring the skin under it—the speed with which the material is destroyed entirely depends upon the strength of the acid—weak acid would not be so likely to destroy the skin as strong acid—sulphuric acid is made enormously strong, but a very weak solution would not burn a shirt into holes—twenty drops in a quart of water would not affect the skin—the area of the spot injured would make no difference in the inflammation, it depends upon the intensity of the acid—the shoulder of the shirt is lined, and the lining is</p>

               <p>damaged, but. not to the same extent as the outside—I do not believe sufficient acid came into contact with the skin to do injury, it was absorbed and neutralised by the structure above it.</p>

               <p>—I asked what he had done with the tools—he said he had taken them to Mr. Fry's house, where he had taken the prisoner first, and that Mr. Fry had come back to the church—I examined the church to see if any one else was there, and to see if the doors and windows were fastened—they were all fastened except one—no one else was in the church—I sent East for the tools—I examined the confessional—it was all broken up except one side, which was standing—I compared the marks on the confessional with the tools, and they corresponded—I showed it to Mr. Fry—the injuries appeared to me to have been recently done—Mr. Webb then came to the church—I asked him in the prisoner's presence if the confessional was in the same state as when he last saw it; he said no, but that it had been com<lb/>pletely destroyed since then—I then sent for the verger, who came, and said he had locked up the church securely—I asked the prisoner what he was doing there—he said he was passing and tried the door, and found it opened and went in to see what was the matter, when the constable came and tried the fastenings—I asked him what he got the tools for—he said he had been to do a job for Mr. Smith—I asked where Mr. Smith lived, and took out my book to put the address down—he said in St. Donat's Road, but he did not know the number—I asked if he bad done the work—he said Mr. Smith was out—this was about 10.30 p.m.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attendant at the church—I was present on the evening of 13th July—there was choir practice, which concluded about 9.30—I went round and fastened all the doors securely before leaving—I went out by the north door and locked it—I delivered the key of this door to Mr. Fry, at his house—the prisoner had come to the vestry that evening during the practice, and given a Mr. McClure ft note—Mr. McClure had come to see Mr. Fry—I was not there two minutes; he did not enter the church at all—that was about 8.15—I was called up about 11.30—I was in bed—I went to the church—I entered what is called the confessional door with the policeman—that is not the north door, but just adjoining it—I had tried that door before I left—it had not been unfastened—I found Mr. Fry, Mr. Webb, the prisoner, and a constable there—I saw part of the confessional lying about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been the verger about six months—the sides-men are named Soliaque and Saunders—I remember an entry being made by Mr. Tooth on a Sunday morning, I cannot give the date—I did not witness the service which was then said to be held—the bolt of the lock of the door 1 went in at does not shoot home—it has been found open about four times, and appeared to have been opened from the inside—my opinion is some one had been concealed in the church—the door has been found open once since the prisoner has been committed—I attend the services as the attendant of the church—Mr. Davison and the Revs. Tait and Gardner hold the services there—the confessional was put up before I went there—many of the congregation go and have a shove at it after the morning and evening services—I mean they shake it, either from curiosity or novelty or hatred, or something—the confessional has been broken before the 13th July, and pieces were lying about—there is a seat in the confessional—I cannot say who it is for, I never tried it—about three weeks before the prisoner was taken into custody the organist got into it, and it all fell about him—it had been previously loosened and the two</p>
