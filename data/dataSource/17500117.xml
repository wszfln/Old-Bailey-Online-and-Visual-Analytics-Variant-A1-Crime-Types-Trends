I had a club in the next room; I came out for a pen and ink, I saw all my company was gone into that room, and they had left a silver tankard upon the table, near the Prisoner, who stood with his back towards it, and the rest of his company were sitting by the fire, the windows were shut up, and I went back in the other room; they went away at the door that leads to the street; after this my girl called me, and said the man is gone away with your tankard.</p>

Warwick still abode in the house, nor did he endeavour to get away; saying, he would stay with all his heart: then I sent for the constable of the night, and Warwick was taken into custody. I had seen the woman before, and a person gave me intelligence where she lived; I went to her house, and there was a man made answer and said, she was not at home; (we could hear her whisper ) I went back again, and we carried Warwick to New-prison; my lodger said when we came back, if I would go down to the woman, she would open the door to me; he was drinking with them that night in my house, but he has hid himself, and I cannot find him; I fear the woman has sent him out of the way; we went again, and he knocked, and she immediately let him in, and the constable took charge of her; the justice thought proper to admit her to bail. I never saw the tankard since. We searched Warwick to see if he had any knife, or such instruments about him, and I am sure he could not have the tankard about him: the justice admitted Warwick to bail, and upon Thursday evening he took the Prisoner, and sent for me, and he was secured; they went away between 8 or 9 o'clock.</p>

            . On the 11th of Dec. last as I was going along Cheapside. I met the Prisoner, I had not seen him for 4 or 5 Years; he said to me, shall we not drink together ? I said with all my heart. Said I, I'll go to the Hercules and Pillars, in Bow-lane. No, said he, I'll go to a friend at the bottom of Bread-street. We went there, and Mrs. Dyke rapp'd at the sash window, at the Bull's-head: We went in, and drank 7 or 8 Tankards of beer. Said she, I have money to receive of a man who is to meet me at the Hampshire-hog, in Goswell-street. I went with the prisoner and her there, and they staid till about 8 or 9 o'clock; they pretended to play at cards, and after that there came in a man, whom, she said, she was to receive some money of, his name is Hosier, (the person the prosecutor mentioned, who is gone out of the way.) They talked to themselves some time. The company that was at the fire mov'd from it, and we went to it, all but the prisoner at the bar, who kept his place behind the door, on the left hand: This was about an hour before they went away. When the beer came about, he said, he did not care to drink; by and bye I heard liquor spill, I turn'd and saw something like a tankard in his hand, and he cover'd it under the right hand flap of his coat; it was about half cover'd: Presently I heard liquor spill again. I went betwixt the woman, and the man of whom she was to receive money, and whisper'd them, saying, I feared we should come into trouble, for, I thought, he was going to steel away a tankard. She said, pshaw, pshaw. The man made no answer. At going away the woman went first out at the door, and I second, the prisoner after me; he had his left hand under his coat, with something like a pot or a tankard in that hand: I turn'd back at the door, and said, I must speak with this man, meaning Hosier ; but the prisoner laid hold of the skirt of my coat, and said, come along, you have no business with that man I am sure. I told Hosier the prisoner had got a tankard under his coat, or something like it. Said Hosier to the Girl, see if there be any thing missing ? Said I, it will be the best way to go, in the first place, after the man. The Constable was sent for, and I desired he would be so good as to go and take the woman, thinking she would not deny what I whisper'd to her, of my suspicion about the prisoner. The Friday following I took the prisoner in Bedford-court, coming down to Covent-garden: I did not charge him with the thing then, because I had heard of his Character; so I took him to a public house, sent for a constable, charg'd him, and sent for the Prosecutor.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor; I was in the room the best part of the time; they had paid 13 d. half-penny, and there was three half-pence to pay; the woman told me Mr. Hosier would do that; then they went into another box, that is, Warwick, Hosier, and the woman; the prisoner stood where he did before, and I saw the tankard close behind him: The prisoner said he would not go away without another pot of beer, and bid me draw it; Mr. Warwick was then for going without any more; I drew a pot of beer, and carry'd it to the prisoner: He said, young man I am drunk, I can't drink any more; he sat down, saying, I must give it to the company, adding he was sick. I sat down with my back to the prisoner, and heard something spill; I thought somebody had been spewing, or there was water running; the others sat by the fire at this time. I did not see the tankard then, nor have I seen it since I saw it standing behind his back. When I heard it I look'd round, and look'd hard at the prisoner, and he look'd hard at me; then Mr. Warwick call'd for another pot of beer, and I heard beer spill again: then there were 7 d. half penny to pay, the prisoner desired the woman to pay for him, and he would pay her again. I saw Mr. Warwick whisper the woman, and she gave her head a shake, and look'd back; but what she said I cannot tell: And likewise heard Warwick tell Hosier as before mentioned, when the Prisoner was gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any beer in the tankard when it stood behind the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Butler. I cannot tell my Lord.</p>

            . Lawrence. On the 13th of Dec. the day after last Sessions, Brannam being just turned out of Newgate, I went the next day to see him in Webb-Square, there was Purcel with him; he asked me to make Purcel drink, I said I had no money; said he, pawn your ha for a shilling ; said Purcel, I'll pawn my shuttle, and at night I shall get more money; he sent me for it, I brought it, we went to the George and called for a pot of beer, he paid for it, and had three-pence half-penny left, so he would have a dram for each to put us in spirits: said Dennes Brannam, I'll go for a hammer and chissel, and I'll either have money, or I'll go where I come from again. The time he was gone from us, Purcel and I was going down Webb-Square, he made a blow at a Man with a stick and miss'd him, I hit him and knock'd him down, and took his hat, and gave it to Purcel; he went and pawned it for 1 s. 6 d. then we went to the Ship Alehouse in Webb Square, and had a pint of gin which cost 6 d. Brannam came in with two young fellows, so we drank one shilling and six-pence out there. Then we went out, (either to get money by house-breaking, or knocking people down and robbing them) we went along Shore-ditch, and opposite to the Black Dog, there was a sellar open, said Brannam, stay here, I'll go in and see if I can buy a shirt ; the boy belonging to the seller said, Brannam, what are you doing? Brannam came out, seeing the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175001170007"/> master, and walked up the street, and the man followed him, and I followed the man; the man laid hold of him, I struck the man on the side of the head, he let Brannam go and run away; Mr. Whiffin and another man were walking before us.</p>
               <p>Q. to Whiffin. Was there a man along with you?</p>
               <p>Whiffin. There was, my Lord; it was my uncle, who had been along with me; he walked about two yards before me, but he did not see me knock'd down.</p>
               <p>St. Lawrence. Brannam took the hammer out of his bosom, he hit the Prosecutor with it on the side of the head, I struck at him at the same time with a stick, but Brannam's blow fetched him down; I did not hurt him much; then Brannam took his hat and wig; we did intend to take what money he had, but the watch, or some people, came making a noise, so we were obliged to run; Brannam delivered the hat and wig to me; I put the wig on my head, and gave the hat to Purcel, we crossed the way, and ran down the same side of the way the robbery was done. After we had been on the other side a little time, Brannam and I went through Magpye Alley to his brother-in-law's house in Phenix-street; presently up comes Purcel, said Brannam, what signifies staying here, let's go and get some more money. The hat we left there. We went out, and going thro' Wheeler-street, we met another man, and struck at him several times before we could get him down, at last we did; Brannam gave him the last blow with the hammer ; the people came out of the houses, and the place began to be in an uproat; we took his hat and wig and ran away; then we went to White Chapel, and struck at a man there; he staggered against a shop, and we took his hat and wig, and ran away. This was about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Dugley Macanley. Brannam told me the day after the robbery, he was the man that knocked down the prosecutor, and took his hat and wig, and also that he knocked down another man in Houndsditch the same night, and another in White-Chapel: He in Houndsditch was so hurt by the blow, that the blood comes out at his ears; I saw him last Sun-day. He told me of another in Wheeler-street.</p>

My husband made answer, and said, never worse; but I hope I shall be better soon : Said he, do you think this is owing to the blows you got from those Gentlemen, for, said he, I believe you are a dying man, do you lay it to any one in particular? Said he, I lay it to one and all; and added, pray be so good as to see them brought to justice, that I may be righted. About an hour after which he turn'd himself and died.</p>

His belly was swell'd, and he complained of pains and aches all over him. Upon his spitting of blood, I asked the apothecary where it came from? said he, where do you think? but from the bruises your husband has receiv'd.</p>

I went to see him two or three days after, he said he could eat nothing at all: I saw him in his illness I believe ten times; sometimes I thought he would recover, and sometimes I thought he would not. I said a week before he died. he would not live, he seemed to heave, and could hardly fetch his breath, which he said was from an inward bruise; I did not observe his spitting.</p>

I was present when the woman Gains was examined. I did not observe the least obstruction made by the coroner. There was one witness came when Mr. Wright the coroner was summing up the evidence, and that person was refused. On his cross-examination, he said, whether the coroner laugh'd or not, he could not tell, and that he thought, upon the whole evidence, that the matter was a trifling affair.</p>

It was very evident he had received sad blows on his head, which was a good deal swelled; his pulse was very quick; I bled him very largely; I thought he had been drinking. I saw him again the next day, between ten and eleven, he was prodigiously better, but still complain'd of pain, but I have seen people at a boxing-match beat a great deal more, and done well again; his eye was only a common black eye, it was very much swelled. I went before justice Fielding, and said I did not think his Life was in danger, and the affair was made up: (to another Q. he says, he thought him in but very little danger) adding, his head was swelled about as big as half my fist about the face. I saw the deceased when dead, the day the coroner attended his body. There was nothing particular appeared that could be the cause of his death, neither do I think his death was occasioned by what he received this 10th of December.</p>

I come to him on Sunday morning about 8 o'clock, 8 days after he had been beat; he complained of pains all over him; he was short breath'd and severish; he said he had been out and got a great cold, by being carried about and going to town, and I bled him.</p>

The day after he was dead I saw him, he was very black in those parts, and down one side; but this is common to persons who die a natural death, I have seen it in children and grown persons. I believe the catching of cold was the occasion of his death, and not his being beat; he complained of very short breath; I talked with the deceased in conversation; he said he had been beat a great deal worse than this, and got well sooner.</p>

             counted seven; he did not seem very well pleased with her counting them, but desired to see them opened; he desired the other man to lay hold on the other end of the piece, and go to the other part of the shop; the other witness had hold of the other end, and the prisoner hold of the second or third handkerchief ; he counted seven of them, he put them all up in his hand and brought them to the counter; the other witness desired she might sold them up; the man that was with the prisoner said, there was no occasion to trouble herself, upon which he whipp'd them all up in his hand, and ran out of the shop with them. I being on the outside of the counter, ran first to the door, the other witness called out, stop thief ; I ran out, and called the same, to the corner of the window; the end of the handkerchief trailed on the ground, I running after stepped upon it, and with that he let them go; I gathered them all up together, and gave them to the other witness, and ran after him, calling out, stop thief, and Mr. Riley stopped him; he took hold of one arm and I the other, and brought him back to the shop door; he had ran about 20 yards. Master did not chuse to have a mob in the shop, so he desired he might be carried to an alehouse. The next witness will give an account what became of the other man.</p>

            . On the 19th of Dec. I was coming home from Chelsea, between 7 and 8 in the Evening; at my entrance into the first Five Fields, as they call it, I had Mr.

             along with me, he was in liquor and stayed a little behind: I called, Hans, come along; accordingly he did, but very slowly; I went by the <placeName id="t17500117-28-crimeloc125">Crown and Thistle</placeName>

Then I heard the Footsteps of two or three people; the Ground being very wet, I could hear them step. I believe they came out of the Thistle and Crown, for there was a light as I came by: I said again, come along, Hans, I hear some people coming up. The common path-way was ancle-deep, so I was got upon higher ground, he being in liquor kept the path, and went through the dirt; as near as I can recollect it was about the middle of the field; I was about 20 or 30 yards before him, when I heard some blows struck, but no words. I heard Mr. Fowler say, pray don't murder a poor distressed Sailor ; I saw two or three men with large sticks, beating him as he lay on the ground: Two I can swear to. On my turning my head, the prisoner at the bar came up to me, his particular voice I well know, he said, d - n you, you raseal, you villain, your watch and your money, or I'll cut you to pieces. He had got a large stick in his hand, which I took to be a mop or broom-stick, swinging it over my head, attempting to strike at me: I put myself in a posture of defence, so that he never touch'd my head. I having a slight oak-stick in my hand, kept him off, and desired him to be easy; he found I wanted to make to the low ground, so got between me and that place, swearing, at the same time, he'd cut me to pieces if I did not surrender. When he found I could not escape he came to close quarters : He had got either a sword or a bayonnet, I know not which, but he prick'd me in the forehead ; I fell backwards, and he fell down ; as he fell I heard something chink : He held fast hold of my hand, and I of his waistcoat, by his trembling he seemed as much afraid of me as I was of him. I had five Guineas in one pocket, and some Silver in the other, I put my hand in with an intent to sling down two or three of the Guineas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175001170012"/> on the ground, knowing they would not easily find them again till the morrow; he catch'd my hand at the same time, and took the five Guineas from me: The others had got my friend all along, so I begg'd he would not hurt me, nor let my friend be murder'd; I told him I had no watch. Then he walk'd as contentedly as any man could do by my side, while I went back and took up my friend. I said my friend had no money; the others, I suppose, heard what I said, and knowing he had got five Guineas of me, made off. My friend was all over dirt, so I went immediately into the Robin-hood and Little-john, being robb'd within about 20 yards of that house. There was the man of the house, and three or four Invalids drinking ; I told them what had happened, saying, if they could make haste and get help, we might take them before they got over the fields. The man of the house seeing the wound on my forehead, said it was done with a bayonnet : His wife fetch'd down a gun; said he, I cannot go without my shoe-buckles, and then he had his bitch to call. We came out with his Candle to see for Mr. Fowler's stick; but they had taken that away with them. They went with me to the Constable's; at the entring of Chelsea, I went through the College, and met with

On the 19th of December, I was going to London; near eight o'Clock I heard Mr. Miller's Tongue, and said, who's that, Mr. Miller? he had got his handkerchief about his face; I asked him, what was the matter? he told me, he had been robb'd, and advis'd me not to go that way; then came up Mr. Fowler, Sir, said he, do you see how I have been used? I told him, that he had been used very dirtily; he stood upon the Titter-Totter, being in liquor. I went with Mr. Harris to Harp-alley; on the Saturday 7-night, going by Somerset-house, there was a soldier stood century; said Mr. Harris, that is one of the Men who was in company at my house the night Mr. Miller was robb'd; when I got home, I went up to Mr. Babb, and desired him to go and acquaint Mr Miller, that I had saw a Man whom Mr. Harris said was in company with the man who robb'd him that night, at his house: Then Mr. Miller and Mr. Babb came and called upon me, and we all three went to Mr. Harris's. We four went to the Parade, and saw the guards reliev'd; I shewed Mr. Miller the man I saw upon guard; Mr. Miller said, he knew nothing of him. While we was talking, the prisoner was coming along, Mr. Miller said, as soon as he saw him, that is the man who robbed me; Mr. Harris said, that is the man you describ'd to me. Mr. Harris call'd the prisoner to him; Mr. Miller went up to him, and walk'd round him, and said afterwards, he was well satisfied he was the Man. Babb and I followed him to his Lodging, and brought him from thence to an ale-house to Mr. Harris and Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris. I have known the prisoner almost three years; he did belong to Ligonier's Horse. On the 19th of December, he came to my house, with four soldiers, and a trumpeter's wife; they were there from between three and four, till seven. When the reckoning came to be paid, the prisoner, and one of the others, began to quarrel; I went between them, and desired them to desist; one of them,

Said Swinney to Macdonald, you had better stay and lie with me to-night, and I would give the prisoner a bed; but they would not stay, so both went away at seven, and I came in after I had took the reckoning, and found I had receiv'd two bad Shillings of the other man. When I had took up that man, and put him in the Savoy, I hearing Mr. Miller had been robb'd, I sent to him, he came and describ'd the prisoner, saying he was no soldier, but there was soldiers in company that knocked him down, and abused his friend; he described the man who robb'd him, thus - He was a lusty young fellow, was inclin'd to sat, with a full fat hand, black shock hair, or a wigg answerable to it; his hand warm withal, and a very coarse voice, and that he was robbed about half an hour after seven o'clock, and said, he believed they came out of the Thistle and Crown - The rest as the last witness, about going to the Park, &amp;c.</p>

            . I live at the Robin-hood. The prosecutor came into my house about seven o'clock that night: he had a little sprinkle of blood on his left eye. I asked him, what was the matter? He said, he had been robb'd of five Guineas. I was slipshoe'd, and ask'd him, if I should put up my shoes and pursue them? He told me, it was not much matter; saying, he believed they were gone. The man along with him was a little in liquor; who said, he had lost a cane or stick; he desired me to let him have a piece of candle, and go out to see if he could find it, where he had been robb'd. We went to the place ; then he desired me to see him as far as Chelsea, which I did, with my servant my Dog, and my Gun. We saw him as far as the Constable's, there he called for a pint of twopenny, and gave my man twopence; the place was about fifty or sixty yards from my house. It is impossible the prosecutor should see the prisoner's face there by the light of my window.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The place where we went to look for the stick, was the place where Mr. Fowler was robb'd; and the place where I was robb'd, was about half-way between that place, and this man's house: I being before Mr. Fowler, at that time.</p>

            . I have been acquainted with the prisoner upwards of two Years and a half, from his first coming into England; he behaved himself always like a gentleman, express'd great duty to his Father upon all occasions, and, in short, was the moral man as far as I am capable of judging. I am of the other gentleman's opinion, that it must be real necessity that drove him to it; his own Father is chaplain to her Imperial Majesty of Russia; his Father was recalled, and the young person unfortunately left in the Country.</p>

             told me, last Tuesday, that the prisoner had taken some stockings; I saw him, and I followed him to Bull's-alley: I saw him run into a house, a woman came to the door, and said, who is that, that is run up stairs? I ran up stairs, and, almost at the top of the stairs, there was he, and the stockings: I brought him down stairs, and Davenport went and brought the stockings down; so we carried him to Mr. Eliot's shop, who owned the stockings.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This man was but that very morning clear'd from the Gate house; he behaved so very ill, that I never saw a man behave so in in my life. The Justice would not do any thing till he was handcuff'd ; he threatened to shoot the Justice thro' the head, to run a knife into his heart, &amp;c. and called him all the odd names he could think on.</p>

The Prisoner tore my waistcoat, and push'd my horse out of his step. I thought he had been drunk; I swore at him, but he went along, and hurry'd, swinging his hands, &amp;c. I did not think he had took my watch, 'till I came to the spurr inn in the borough. I met a friend, and went to drink a glass of wine there, going to pay for it, I missed my watch. I went home, and, as soon as I alighted from my horse, I went to the Maker, and had it advertised; and, from the 2d day of advertising it, I heard of it. I looked to see what o'clock it was, when I was at St. James's, and I saw the seal, with the anchor and the Key hung to it, as I was coming down Fish-street-hill.</p>

            . She was committed along with the prisoner. I asked her whose it was? she told me, it was a gentleman's at the boot in Princes-street. I thought it might be taken as people came from the play, as the play was just done. I told the woman, I should stop it 'till she brought the owner. She went out, and brought the prisoner at the bar, who told me, it was his watch; then came in another man, and said, it is mine; so give me it, or he would hurt me; then, I said, I would not give it him without his first telling the name. Upon that, he said, he would not, but he would have the watch. It had a green string to it, and the place where a seal should hang, was fresh cut. Before I gave it back, I took the name and number of it upon a card; the maker's name, Sewil, No. 540, Senier. I gave the other man the watch again. So on the 20th of October, I saw a watch advertis'd, lost upon London-bridge, the 18th of October, the name as this. No. forgot. I thought proper to let the man know, that such a thing was offered to me, which I did. The prosecutor came over the water, and asked me, what sort of a man it was? I describ'd him; he said, by the description, it was the same man that did the robbery. Then we went to Justice Fielding's, and took out a warrant, and took up the woman; and we took out a warrant, by the descriptions of the two men; the woman was in custody 'till last sessions. I being attending here, and saw this person come to give evidence, I went home, and got the warrant, and had him secured.</p>

I pull'd my watch out of my pocket, and told them I could not stay. Bennet snatched it out of my hand, but they were both in the room. I went to take it from her; they took me directly, flung me down, and took my silver buckles out of my shoes. I took hold of Howard's hand, while they were taking my buckles, and she had one of them, which tore my thumb with the tongue of it, as she wrenched her hand out of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they fling you down on the floor?</p>
               <p>Jewel It was upon a sort of a bed. One of them got out of the room, I clap'd my back against the door, and kept Howard in: I believe I kept her there two hours. Then there came up a man, with a candle in one hand, and a stick in the other; I let him come into the room: He goes to the upper end of the room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175001170019"/> and said, What does this fellow do in my room? He set down the candle, takes the stick by the middle, and came towards me; I went down stairs, and into the street, and kept an eye on the door for two or three hours longer. I told 20 people of what had been done, but no body would assist me.

             came out, and a sort of a sailor with her: It was the man that came into the room to me. They went arm in arm together, half way up Petticoat lane; I followed them, and met with two men: I desired they would assist me, saying, I had been robbed by that woman. Says one of them, I'll assist you. I jumped across the way directly: The sailor ran away; I took her to Aldgate watch house. The man that assisted me I have not seen since. I took the prisoner on Tuesday last. A man came to me to the sign of the Bee-hive, and said, if I would go along with him, he would help me to the woman who took my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man?</p>
               <p>Jewel He desired I would not bring him here, for fear he should have his brains knock'd out, as he lives in that neighbourhood. He brought me to the house where she was in Stony-lane, within a door or two of the house where I was robb'd. When she saw me, she throw'd herself on her knees to me, and said, she would go along with me, and shew me where my buckles and watch were sold. She went first of all to Mr. Clay, a silver-smith, opposite Houndsditch. The servant show'd me the buckles directly; saying, he bought them for 10 s. and he could not deliver them, without his master was at home; and his master said, when he came home, he would have 10 s. which he gave for them. The woman kept on the other side of the way. Then after that, she went with me to Mr. Green, a Whitechapel Court-Officer, where they had sold the watch; he lives in Half-moon-court, Whitechapel. A woman told me, he was not at home; but would be in about eleven o'clock. Then I charged an officer with the prisoner. Bennet and she were committed. I went again to Mr. Green, and asked him about my watch. Said he, I have not the watch; but I can help you to it; it is my business, said he, to help people to their things when lost.</p>

             two Days. I was coming home to her, and met the prosecutor in Bishopsgate-street; he stopp'd me, and asked me where I was going? I said, what makes you ask me? because, said he, I'll go along with you; which he did, up into the room. He know'd Bennet, and she him; said he. I have got no money, but take my buckles out of my breeches knees. He pulled them out himself, and she pawn'd them for gin and bitters; she went down stairs; as soon as he missed her, he seized me, saying, she had robb'd him. Of what? said I; said he, of my buckles; said I, you gave her them yourself for liquor. I know that, said he, but she has robb'd me of my watch and shoe-buckles said he, I'll keep you. So I let him search me; he found nothing upon me. After I had been in Newgate, he sent word he had found her, and she had been with him to the places where she sold the buckles and watch.</p>

I went from them, and I saw them following me: they came up with me, and began pulling me about, saying, I should go along with this and the other. I clapp'd my hand to my pocket, and miss'd my watch; I thought I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, I laid hold on her, and the other ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not in liquor ?</p>
               <p>Stokes. I cannot say that I was quite drunk: I had been drinking. The whole affair was transacted in four minutes, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give another woman a dram at that place, that night, besides these two?</p>
               <p>Stokes. I might for ought I know; I cannot tell. I charged the Constable with her, she pleaded ignorance, as such people generally do. I never found my watch again.</p>

               <p>BRACHYGRAPHY, or SHORT-WRITING,</p>
               <p>Made easy to the meanest Capacity.</p>
               <p>Particular care has been taken to croud nothing upon the Memory, but what is of absolute necessity to swift writing, and easy to be read at first sight.</p>
               <p>The PERSONS, MOODS, and TENSES, are comprized in such a manner, that the knowledge of little more than the Alphabet is required to the writing hundreds of Sentences, in less time then spoken; improved, after upwards of Thirty Years Practice and Experience. Price 7 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>By T. GURNEY, Watch-maker, in Bennet-Street, near Christ-Church, Surry.</p>
               <p>Good Sense or bad are wrote with equal speed, No need of Grammar Rules to write or read; Less wise or foolish with their Words abound, The faithful Pan shall copy every sound; Ages members shall rise, shall read, and say, Thus! thus! our Fathers did their Minds convey.</p>
               <p>N. B. In the next Session Paper will be inserted the Places where Subscriptions are to be taken in, and Conditions may be seen.</p>
