On the 4th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the shop; two persons were with him - one about two years older than himself; they came in together- the prisoner asked for a pair of stockings: I took down some to show him; I was the only person serving in the shop - there is a staircase leading from the shop to the upper part of the house; I cannot exactly recollect which of them asked for the stockings - they said they only had 6d., and we had none so low; they left the shop - a little boy who was in the shop at the time gave information; I immediately went out, and laid hold of the prisoner and another man - I charged the prisoner with stealing some silk, and found it under his apron - there were sixty yards of it; he had not asked to look at it - it was on the counter, within his reach, when he came into the shop; I was obliged to turn my back to them to get the stockings - they could take it in that time without my seeing them; it is worth upwards of 6l. at the manufacturer's price - I have a good knowledge of the value of silk; I sent for an officer, and had him secured - I took him sixty or seventy yards from the shop door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at the Mansion-house the silk was sixty-five yards. Witness. I said it measured sixty-six yards, but I would call it sixty.</p>

On the 4th of January, I was on the staircase, looking through a window at the top of the door leading into the shop; I could see into the shop, and saw the prisoner there, and three others, I think - I saw the prisoner go to the opposite counter, take this roll of silk, and put it under his apron; I told Paul, who went after him, and brought him back - be let it fall when he was caught; I saw it fall from him when he was caught, and picked it up; my father has no partner - he lives at this house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you put it into your breast in the morning when you dressed? A. I had about half-past nine o'clock in the morning - it could not have slipped out; I am confident it was in my shirt at the time he stopped me; about half an hour before this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140004"/>happened I took off my ruff, which was round my neck, and then felt the pin; the pin was not in the ruff - I had put it on about ten o'clock in the morning; I did not put it on or take it off by a glass - I distinctly felt the pin when I took my ruff off; I did not remove the pin, but felt it safe- I could not well untie the ruff without touching it; that is the reason why I say I touched it - Fish-street-hill was a good deal crowded; it happened just before the crossing, at the bottom of Fish-street-hill, at the corner of Lower Thames-street - he came bolt up against me, seized me, and charged me with running against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have come against each other? A.Certainly. When he laid hold of me he came against me; I attempted to pass him first on one side and then on another, but he kept before me, pushed down my hands, and extracted the pin - I did not see him with the pin, he kept me so fast; I was not aware where I was robbed - I asked if he intended to rob me while he was taking out the pin; I was sure I was robbed, and felt my pocket - I felt my watch safe, then missed my pin, and followed him; I turned round, and pursued him up Eastcheap; I went about three steps before I knew where I was robbed, but was confident I had been robbed - he kept my hands down, and I first felt for my money and watch, then felt my handkerchief, and missed my pin, which accounted for his holding me so fast by the throat; I had green spectacles - my sight was as perfect as it is now: I had a little inflammation in the side of my eye, not in the pupil - I asked him if he intended to throttle me; he held me fast by the neck, and kept my hands down - he was working as hard as he could in my throat; I thought I should be choked - my pin was fastened in as a pin, not as a brooch; I went about three steps before I ascertained where I had been robbed, and during that time my back was towards him - I had lost sight of him; I think I went three steps before I determined to follow him; I did not see him till I laid hold of him in Eastcheap; I went as fast as I could - he crossed over - I went up, and he was standing blowing at something, as if to ascertain the value of it: I laid hold of him instantly: I could not be mistaken in him - this might be three minutes after I was robbed; there was not a crowd, but the usual number of people - when I laid hold of him be knocked me off, and I called Stop thief! I had a little boy with me - the prisoner was immediately pursued; nothing was found on him.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. I apprehended the prisoner in Botolph-lane; I had been up a gateway, and seeing several people together when I came out, I went up, and found him in among them, charged with robbing Mr. Grant of his pin; Mr. Grant and the boy went with me to the Mansion-house - he was examined next day; I could not search him till I got him to the Mansion-house - I found nothing on him but 1s. and a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MR. GRANT. The pin was worth 2l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. How was it possible for me to abstract a pin from the prosecutor without his perceiving it? he stated in his deposition that he never missed his pin till he was out of the crowd, which stood across the road, and when he missed it he came up Fish-street-hill, met me and accused me of it; I told him I knew nothing of it, and asked him to let me go; he would not - I threw myself out of his hands, and fell down - he likewise slipped down- he accused me because he said he saw me looking at something in my hand. Is it feasible that I should stop a man in a public thoroughfare, in the middle of the day, and take property, without being detected? Gentlemen, either of you being on the spot might be as well accused as myself.</p>

            . I am a constable. A little before ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two others, one a little boy, thirteen or fourteen years old, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140005"/>other about nineteen - he was a head taller than the prisoner: in consequence of suspicion I watched them - they went from Cornhill towards Cheapside; I missed them for a minute, and then saw the prisoner looking into Mr. Bult's window - at the same time I saw the boy come out of Mr. Bult's shop; I did not see the third one then - the boy put his hand to the prisoner, and as I suppose gave him something; he appeared handing something to him - I crossed the road as quick as I could, being on the opposite side - the prisoner ran away from the window, down Ironmonger-lane, which is eight or nine doors off: I passed the boy, pursued the prisoner, and twenty or thirty yards down the lane, as I was going to put my hand upon him, he turned round, saw me, and threw something across the road - I picked it up; it was a copper bowl - it had snowed the night before, and I could see no gold; I secured him, and then picked up the bowl - I looked about, but could see no gold; I took him to the shop, went back to where he threw it down, and found some gold - I did not pick it up myself; it was produced at the Mansion-house, and returned to Mr. Bult.</p>
               <p>MR. BULT. I have it here; I saw several grains picked up - the gold in the bowl when I left it on the counter was worth 18l. or 20l. or more - I had left that quantity of gold in it four or five minutes before; nobody had been into the shop after the customer I served from it - the gold now in it is worth 24s. or 25s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went round the City to look for a situation, having been out of work three days, and passing this shop it drew my attention to look in; I stood there half a minute - two young gentlemen came by; one said to me, "I will give you 3d. to take this to Ironmonger-lane;" it was in two bits of whitey brown paper - I had hardly got round the corner before the gentleman seized me by the collar, and knocked it out of my hand.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 20th of December, at half-past six o'clock all my family, consisting of eight persons, went out to church, leaving me alone in the house; it was not quite dark - I believe the house was safe; I had not seen the fastenings in the course of the day, for I had been very unwell the whole day - in about ten minutes after my family were gone out, the front door bell rang twice, very faintly: I did not get up to answer it - about ten minutes after that(there was no noise whatever, every thing was perfectly silent;) I was sitting in the dining-room, up stairs - my face was directed towards the dining-room door, and the door of the room was pushed very slowly open, and part of the head of a person appeared; I immediately rose from my seat, went towards the door, and the head was instantly withdrawn, and the person ran very precipitately down stairs, and made a great noise in going down - I thought it unwise to follow, so I proceeded to the dining-room window, threw it up, gave an alarm, and in rather more than an hour I saw the prisoner in custody - I examined the house, but was not aware that any thing was gone; the street-door was closed in the usual way when I went down - I had not heard it shut when he ran down, if it had I think I must have heard it; I saw two small crow-bars in the back part of the house - I could not discover how the party had got in; I found the street-door bolted on the inside - they could have entered that way, and bolted it afterwards- my family returned about half-past eight o'clock; a hat was found at the bottom of the stairs - I did not see it there myself; the spoons, sugar-tongs, and milk-pot were in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any second Christian name? A. No; I saw no appearance of breaking into the house - I cannot say a person might not have been concealed in the house.</p>
               <p>HENRY CHANDLER. I live at No. 32, Cock-lane, and am a silver spoon maker, in Mr. Chawner's employ. On Sunday, the 20th of December, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, I was sitting in doors, and heard a cry of Murder! and Thieves! my house is a very little distance from the prosecutor's - I ran out to the spot; the cry came from the first floor of Mr. Heath's house - he was giving the alarm, and said, "Go to the front door;" I ran to the front door - it was fast; I had been there about two minutes, and heard a cracking up Cock-lane - I ran there, and saw the shutters fall out; they were pushed out from inside, and I saw the prisoner come out without a hat, and run up the lane - I pursued close at his heels, and never lost sight of him - just as he turned the corner I caught him, about twelve yards down the turning; I could not possibly be mistaken - I could not swear to his face, but I never lost sight of his person; he had no hat on - he ran against Kemp, and had a tussle with him, which enabled me to collar him, and he said, "It is not me - what have I done?" I am sure he is the person that came out of the window; when I could see his face he had a black mark under his nose - I do not know whether it was dirt or a plaister; Hanley came up, and kept the mob off as we took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. An alarm had been given by Mr. Heath before you went? A. I should think about a minute before; I went to the door, and in two minutes went to the window - several neighbours had come out of their houses in consequence of the alarm; I suppose fifteen or sixteen, but not out of the prosecutor's house; the place where the window is is very dark; he came out of the window without his hat - his being taken without a hat did not increase my belief of his being the man, for I never lost sight of him; he turned one slight corner by Munn and Co.'s - the gateway projects, and it is but a slight turn; three or four came up when he was stopped: I had run out without my hat, and there was one person by the window without a hat or coat - he is a man who keeps a coal-shed opposite.</p>

I heard Mr. Heath give an alarm, and saw him on the window leads of the first floor; I went to the front door, found it was fast, and came round to Cock-lane, to what had been a side door, but has been blocked up - I waited there about a minute; the shutters opened, and the prisoner came out first, and another one with him: the prisoner ran up Cock-lane, towards Smithfield; I attempted to lay hold of the other, but stumbled over the shutter, and lost him; I pursued after the prisoner, but lost sight of him as I stumbled over the shutter - I went up Cock-lane, found him in the hands of Kemp, Chandler, and Carter, and laid hold of him; Hanley came up, and took him to the watch-house - I saw Hanley search him; a small pocket-book and I believe three halfpence were found on him: he was the first who came out of the house, and was without a hat- I returned to Mr. Heath's, and on examining the back window which he had come out of in the warehouse, I found a small basket, with two small jemmies in it; I saw a hat found at the bottom of the staircase - it was not claimed by any body; when I came up to the prisoner in Cock-lane he said he had lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw two men come out of the window? A. Yes; I tried to take the second man - my attention was particularly directed to him; there was a number of persons running in the street - I saw nobody without a hat while I was running; there were people without hats at the top of the lane when the prisoner was detained - I cannot tell where they came from; there might be three without hats or more - I did not take an account of them; it was impossible for me to look at every body when my attention was directed to the prisoner - there might be fifty people altogether; I did not hear the prisoner say he had been knocked down, and lost his hat.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I was in Giltspur-street about seven o'clock on Sunday evening, the 20th of December, and heard a great noise and bustle, and near the corner of Giltspur-street there was a great crowd, some crying, "Hold him fast," and others said, "Let him go;" I rushed into the crowd, and saw the prisoner struggling violently with Chandler and Kemp; I laid hold of him, and he then said, "I will go quietly;" after leaving him in the watch-house I went to Mr. Heath's house, and found this hat at the bottom of the stairs, within a yard of the stairs; I searched the house well, and found two jemmies near the window which had been burst open - they laid on a work-board; I tried the largest crow-bar to a desk in the counting-house next day, and it fitted the marks on that desk, which had been broken open; I went to the Compter, tried the hat on the prisoner, and it fitted him exactly, but he denied its being his; Hooker, the officer, had this key in his possession - I saw him fit it next day to the prosecutor's door, and it opened it; I did not see that found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did you get that key from? A. Hooker - he brought it here to-day; he and I both fitted it to the door; the hat would fit other people besides the prisoner no doubt - I found no marks of their having broken into the house; there were marks where they broke out.</p>

            . I am a constable of the City, and live about one hundred yards from Mr. Heath's. I heard a great noise, went out immediately, and about halfway between my house and Mr. Heath's, I heard a great crash of something falling; I went to the corner of Cock-lane, and saw two shutters had fallen outside the house - in consequence of information I saw the crowd going up Cock-lane; I followed, and within a few yards of the lane, near Giltspur-street, I found the prisoner had been stopped - Hanley was there, and they gave him in charge; I then went to Mr. Heath's, but found nothing particular. Next morning, when I went, this key was given to me by Mr. Heath's son; I tried it to the lock of the front door, one end of it opened the door very easily; I saw two jemmies, but did not see them found - the hat was given to me: I saw it tried on the prisoner - it fitted him well; twenty spoons, two pairs of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot were delivered to me next morning - I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Some of them are very small spoons? A. Yes; I did not try the hat on any body else a person could not get in; I did not see a single person without a hat, except the prisoner - I saw Chandler, but cannot say whether he had a hat; I noticed the prisoner more than other people - I think Chandler had his hat on.</p>
               <p>HENRY CHANDLER. There were three persons without hats, I, the prisoner, and a person who came from the opposite house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Heath; I left the house at six o'clock on this evening - I went out at the front door, and shut it; nobody went out with me - I left all the family in the house: I found the door shut, and shut it after me - I saw part of the tea-spoons about ten minutes before I left - nothing was missing then; I returned five minutes before nine - I then found the plate removed from the drawer and closet, and put on the dresser; I am sure they were not there when I went out - they were all put together carelessly on the dresser; I had cleaned them, and put them away before I went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many are there in the family? A. Seven, including myself - there is only one young lady grown up; mistress is alive - I cannot say she had not moved the plate in my absence; nothing was taken out of the house - some of the things were moved from one end of the kitchen to the other, and left on the dresser; I found them all laying together, not tied up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were any of them on the dresser when you left the house? A. No - the closet was merely closed - they were clean.</p>

            . I am Mr. Heath's son. On this Sunday evening, about half-past six o'clock, I went out with the rest of the family; we went out at the street door, which I found fast - I cannot say whether I opened it, or any of the rest of the family; I left my brother behind - he came out with us, but was the last out; he went to church with me - we left nobody in the house but my father; I am sure the door was closed; the key was not in the lock, but was in the house - the prisoner is a perfect stranger; my mother went out with us to church - we all went out at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you undertake to swear which of the family was last at the door? A. Yes, my brother; I had not searched the house - the servant is not in the habit of taking the key out; it hung up inside the passage; my father keeps a warehouse, which is pretty large - I cannot say whether any body was concealed there- I am sure the key was not in the lock, for it is never kept in it; I did not look at the lock, but the key always hangs up.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATH. I can positively swear there was no key in the lock; I particularly examined it before I opened it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell whether any body inside might not have taken it out after the persons came in? A. I found the lock without a key in it; I cannot say whether it was in or out when the family went out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After your family left did you bolt the street door? A. No, it could not be bolted from the outside.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Whether persons in the house, going to rob, might have bolted it, you cannot say? A. No- my premises are very large; it is possible somebody might be concealed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the value of the spoons? A. There are twenty spoons, and two pairs of sugar-tongs, worth about 7l.</p>


               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The milk-pot is not silver? A. No, it is worth very little - some of the spoons are very old and some very small; I have not weighed them - my opinion is they are worth 7l. in their present state.</p>

            . I am Mr. Heath's son, and attend to the business. I went out at half-past six o'clock with my two brothers, my mother, and sister, leaving nobody at home but my father - I was the last person that went out, and shut the door; I do not know where the key was - it is usually left at home; I do not know where it is kept - I returned about eight o'clock; this matter had happened then - I saw this skeleton-key in the house next morning; it did not belong to the house, nor does the hat produced belong to any of the family; I never saw the crow-bars in the house before - we all came home from church together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Whether the jemmies were dropped in the house by a person concealed there you cannot tell? A. No; there were no marks of violence of persons breaking into the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could any body have got into the house except at the street door? A. No - there were no marks of violence on the door; nobody could have got into the house from the warehouse without violence - neither of us went into the kitchen when we went out.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS Q. I suppose you were dressing for church in your own room? A. Yes - the kitchen is behind the dining-room; I cannot say my mother or sister did not go in while I was in my room.</p>

            . The tea-spoons were used at tea, the salt, table, and gravy spoons at dinner; the dessert-spoons were not used that day - I put the table and gravy-spoons into the drawer about two o'clock, after dinner, and the tea-spoons in the closet about ten minutes before I went out; I am quite sure of that - there could be no occasion for them to be used after I left; I found them clean, as I had left them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it customary for your mistress to take the plate up stairs in the evening? A. No, never - they were not locked up.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. HEATH. Q. Have you any recollection of the person who looked into the dining-room? A. No- there could be no spoons wanted after the servant went out, that I know of; I wanted none, and saw none used - my wife occasionally goes into the kitchen: I think the bell rang about ten minutes after the family went out - the ring was repeated in about two minutes, and in about ten minutes the man appeared at my room door; there is a small room, about six feet five inches, between the room I was in and the kitchen; the cupboard might have opened without my hearing it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Passing the prosecutor's house on the night named in the indictment, there was a quantity of persons at the corner of Cock-lane; I passed through the crowd, and at that moment a shutter fell from the prosecutor's window, which knocked me down, and knocked my hat off - I got up, and followed the persons who I suspected; I was secured, and accused of the robbery: what I state is a fact, I assure you - it was evident to the persons who took me, that I had been knocked down; they saw my hands and side all over mud - my witnesses have been here four days, but were not aware of my being tried this morning.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATH. The prisoner told me he had been knocked down; I went to the Compter to see if there was any mark or cut in his hand, as I found a lamp had been knocked down - he shewed me his hand, which had a mark of dry dirt on it; it did not appear to be street dirt - my opinion was that it was not street dirt; his hand was not cut.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What communication is there between the warehouse and dwelling-house? A.There is a door between two rooms, in the further room is the window from which the person escaped; that door was fastened on Saturday night, after the men left, I am certain; it is a ground floor window - the shutters were fastened inside by a screw not: I had two candles burning in my dining-room - the light could be seen outside from three windows, as the shutters were not shut; there is a key-hole to the parlour door; after the robbery the warehouse door between the back and front rooms was found open - no violence had been done to it; it had only been bolted: the warehouse and house are all under one roof - I went down stairs my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140008"/>self after returning to the dining-room, before I went to the window to give an alarm, and before the men had got out of the window.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CARTER. I am a pavior, and live at No. 23, Cock-lane, about one hundred yards from the back of Mr. Heath's premises. On the Sunday night in question I had occasion to come down to the back yard, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran down the street, and the moment I got there the shutter was forced out - it very nearly fell on my shoulder; the prisoner then jumped out of the window, and ran up the street as fast as possible - he was without his hat; I am certain he is the man; I ran after him quite close, and saw him secured - I went back to Mr. Heath's house in about a quarter of an hour, and saw the hat picked up at the bottom of the stairs; on searching a little further I found two small crow-bars on the desk near the window he had jumped out of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you very good sight? A. Yes, pretty fair with one eye - I cannot see with the other eye; the shutter falling did not alarm me - I got out of the way of it; it might distract my attention a little - I only saw one man jump out of the window; I took notice of nobody else, but went after him - whether he had been concealed in the house before I cannot say; the prosecutor's front door is on Snow-bill - it is a public street, and much frequented.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Do you know what time it was? A. I will not positively say, but we took him to the watch-house, and got back by half-past seven o'clock; there is a gaslight in the lane - I was close to him, and saw him come out of the window; I ran close after him, and never lost sight of him for a moment; he was not ten yards from me when he jumped out; Hanley, the officer, ran round with me - I do not know who else was in pursuit.</p>

The prisoner Adams lived in my service fo about seventeen months, but was not in my service on Christmas-eve; he left on the 12th of August - I knew he was in the habit of visiting at the house after that. I spent Christmas-eve out - my plate was kept in a chest, in my bed-room closet, and was there when I left home on Christmas-eve; I returned a little after twelve o'clock, and found the house in a state of alarm - part of my plate was gone; this was Thursday, and on the Sunday following I saw the plate, now produced (looking at it) it is all mine, and has my crest upon it; I know nothing of Mealing - the plate produced is worth about 50l.; the house is my dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. What character did Adams bear in your service? A. I thought he bore a good character or I should not have kept him; I allowed him to visit the house afterwards.</p>

            . I lived with Miss Musgrave on Christmas-eve, and have been twenty-two months in her service; I know Adams and Mealing - I have seen Mealing at the house twice. On Christmas-eve I let in Adams, and Mary Mealing was with him; Adams staid in the kitchen about an hour and a half, or three quarters - we drank some liquor, and played at cards together; Adams did not leave the kitchen after we began to play at cards, but before that,(after he came in) he went out alone for some gin and cloves, and when he returned he rang the bell; I went up and let him in - he had let himself out; about half an hour after we began to play at cards, I heard a noise outside the house, and a whistle; I went into the area to look, but could see nothing - I heard the front door slam too about an hour after that: Adams was with me at that time - I said, "What door is that? it sounds like our street-door;" and told him to come up stairs with me to see - he came up, and after searching some other rooms, I went to mistress' bed-room, found the cupboard door open, and several things laying about the floor; the parlours and drawing-room were not disturbed - I ran down stairs, and called the Police; Adams was with me, and assisted in calling them - Bond and Bates came; I know this plate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Adams before he was in the service? A. No; I lived there all the time with him - he bore an honest character; he assisted me to call the Police when I discovered the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say if her property was found, she would freely pardon the party? A. I believe that was said, but he denied all knowledge of it - Adams did not see her after that, except at the office.</p>

               <p>MISS MUSGRAVE.

            . I am the son of the last witness, and am going on for thirteen years old. I knew Mealing by the name of Warren, and have seen him at my father's house - I saw him there on Christmas-day, about nine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140010"/>o'clock in the morning; I let him in, and observed that he had a basket under the skirts of his coat - he went into the kitchen to his tool-chest, and I went into the parlour to my mother; I did not see him come out of the kitchen he stepped into the back parlour, and had a large handscrew in his hand - that was not in his hand when he went into the kitchen; my mother asked him to stop to breakfast - he said he could not, because he had a young man waiting for him; I could not identify the basket again - I only saw the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him go into the kitchen with the basket - when he came into the parlour had he the basket? A. No - I could not see whether any thing was in the basket.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHURCH. I am a Police-constable. On Christmas-eve I was on duty in Green-street, where Miss Musgrave lives, and saw the prisoner Mealing directly opposite her house, between nine and half-past nine o'clock - it was after nine; I saw him twice within the half-hour in the same street - when I first saw him he was standing there with his hands in his pockets; I walked by him - he turned his back, and walked away deliberately; on seeing him the second time he was in the same street - I saw him all along the street; he came deliberately up the street, and passed Miss Musgrave's house: on observing me he mended his pace, and walked very quick towards Park-lane - I never saw him before, but have not the least doubt of him; I cannot be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. What kind of a night was it? A. The street is very light with gas; I only saw him twice to notice him - it was merely in passing by that I noticed him; I saw him again at the first examination at Marlborough-street, on the Saturday - I took particular notice of him, having suspicion, as I saw him walk down the street, and then return: I swear to his person.</p>
               <p>JOHN FREDERICK CLEMENTS re-examined. I found this basket in the chest, with an apron covered over the plate - it was all thrown into the basket, with the jewellery and different things in a bag.</p>
               <p>MISS MUSGRAVE. The basket does not belong to me- I had seen the property some days before, it was locked in a chest; I am certain it was in my room when I went out, according to my idea - another key was taken out of a drawer to open the closet, and also keys to open the chest.</p>
               <p>Q.When can you take upon yourself to say the chest was actually locked? A. Some days previous - I did not use the plate in that box every day; this chisel does not belong to me - I never saw it till that night.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM APPLEYARD. It appeared to be a basket of this sort.</p>
               <p>Adam's Defence. I doubt whether it will be of any use, but the prosecutrix has denied what she promised on the night of the robbery - Clements has denied what he told me when I wrote what I have, and Bates the same; Mr. Monteith and Captain 
               <persName id="t18300114-5-person160">Monteith</persName>
             came home with the prosecutrix on the night of the robbery - and Mr. Monteith said, "William, do you hear what Miss Musgrave says? if the property is restored she will forgive all." and Bates told me the more I said the better it would be for me - I told him the young women were innocent, and it was wrong for the innocent to suffer for the guilty - he said it was; I told him the promise the prosecutrix had made, and he said, "She may consider of it."</p>

               <p>Mealing's Defence. I am innocent of the robbery - I was at another place that evening, and expect I have witnesses to say where I was; the property might be put into my chest, but not by me, nor had I the key of the chest at the time.</p>
               <p>MRS. APPLEYARD. The chest had been at my house since August or September - he had the key himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mealing. The person I stated was outside the door, when she asked me to stop breakfast, is the person who had the key of my chest, and brought in what was found there, the basket and plate; that basket was never in my possession - he asked me to take care of them; I would not have them - I said, "You may put them into my chest if you like, here is the key;" while I was talking to Mrs. Appleyard I suppose he came in, and put them into my chest privately - I was at Mr. Francis', Spread Eagle, Lambeth-road; I slept there on the night of the robbery - I got there at twenty minutes or a quarter before ten o'clock; it was my handscrew that I got from the chest.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You say he said there was a man waiting for him at the door, did you see whether there was any man at the door? A. No - I am sure nobody came into the house but Mealing; nobody but him went into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mealing. Q.When you let me in you went into the parlour to your mother? A. Yes - I shut the door; I do not know whether I shut it close.</p>

On Wednesday, the 23rd of December, about twenty minutes past seven o'clock, Burgess, my lodger, went out, and in three or four minutes I heard the shop door unlocked, and saw the reflection of a light through the bottom of the door of my bed-room, which is next the shop - I immediately got up, opened the bedroom window, and saw the prisoner running away from the door with a whip in his hand; he was just shutting the shop door too at the time - I did not call to him; as soon as I found out where he lived I went, and found the whip on his premises - that was on the same day; as soon as my lodger came home I went and inquired after him, and went with one McKenzie to his lodgings, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; he was in bed there -I did not see him, but an old lady gave up the whip; I knew it to be the one I had seen in his hand by a particular mark - I had very few of them at that time; it was not my make - it was delivered to McKenzie, who gave it to Hughes; I did not see the prisoner in the house at that time - I inquired of the neighbours for his house; the whip is worth 4s. 6d.; I got a warrant, and searched his house - there was another charge against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to swear you have any other charge against him? A. No- I never had any quarrel with him.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you never ask him not to take notice if you moved any goods out in the night? A. Never - that I swear; I did not call after him, as I did not know but my lodger might have let him have a whip from the shop, as he has done so to other people, and told me afterwards; I have been threatened with an execution for rent - the prisoner came to me tipsy in the evening; I had been to his house then, and got the whip.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was in bed, why not take him? A. I had never been in such a case before, and did not know any thing about it; his wife called at my house in the evening when I was out - when he came he said, "This is a strange thing your accusing me with the whip;" I told him the Watch Committee wished me to prosecute him - they had been to me about it; I did not then give him in charge, as I knew nothing about it - he was taken very soon after; a constable was sent for - I did not send for one; he was allowed to go from my house - I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140012"/>the office with him and the officer; he went willingly - the office was shut, and he returned home; I believe he was on duty next night - I went to the office next day, and saw him and Hughes together on the road going to the office; I swear I found the same whip as I saw him with - I saw the top of it; any one seeing it would know it again - there is a button on the bottom of it; I could not see that as he carried it - I swear it is mine; I cannot say I could identify it when I saw it out of window, but he brought it out of my shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen that whip the night before? A. Yes, and missed it directly I came down stairs; I swear it is the one I lost.</p>

             HUGHES I am a constable of St. Luke, Chelsea. I went by desire of the Watch Committee with the prosecutor to the house of McKenzie, who gave me this whip; we then went to the prisoner's house, in Frances-street, Chelsea, with the whip - his wife called him in out of the yard; I told him I had come to inquire about this whip - that there were strong suspicions about it; he replied, "I found it near the saddler's door" - I said it was necessary we should go before a Magistrate to inquire into it; he said he was very willing to do so, and said it was necessary the ostler of the public-house should be with him, to whom he had made a communication respecting two whips and some reins standing up on the mail-coach as it passed in the morning - I sent for the ostler, and we proceeded for an officer to Queen-square, Westminster; we were too late, and next morning we went to Marlborough-street - I told the prisoner to bring the ostler there with the reins, but he said it was of no consequence; he was examined and remanded for a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Finding the office shut, you let him go for the night? A. Yes; he went on his duty as usual, and next day came to my house by appointment, about ten o'clock; I was not ready - he went away, and came again; he knew he was charged with stealing a whip - I went to the prosecutor's, and found the prisoner waiting for me to go to the office.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURGESS. I am a labourer, and lodge at Briant's. On Wednesday, the 23rd of December, I went out at twenty minutes past seven o'clock; I shut the door - I opened it with a key, and left it on the spring lock; I drew it after me - I always try it, and am sure it was fast.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any thing to do with the whip trade? A. No; I never sold whips out of the prosecutor's shop - I have given out harness which has been repaired; I never gave out whips - I have been there when his child has given out an old whip which has been repaired.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM BRIANT. Q. How could you see him to know him; could you see his face? A. Yes, and he had his lantern.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

             MORRISON. I am a serjeant of the Police. I saw Butler in the watch-house on the 6th of December, and asked him where he lived - he said in the Edgware-road; I asked where there - he said near the turnpike; I asked how many doors from the turnpike - he said he did not know; I asked the number - he said he did not know, and that it was a private house, he believed; I said I thought he did not live in the Edgware-road - I took him down, locked him up, and went to his house immediately, with Weatherly, who took me to Drummond-street (he is not here) we made inquiries at a public-house, and in consequence of information, went to No. 80, Drummond-street, Paddington, and on coming to the door, a little girl came - I went into the house; a female stook in the passage, who said her name was Butler- I only know it to be his house from information; I found in that house, among other property, a fur tippet, two shirts, a silk gown, a buff handkerchief, six keys, and several articles of jewellery; I have had no communication with Butler about these articles. On the Tuesday following, I went to Pichott's, No. 25, Chester-terrace, Regent's-park - I knew he lived there; I found him and his wife there - they were removing; a van stood at the door, loaded with boxes - I told Pichott I was an officer, and asked him if Butler was there last Thursday; he said No, he was there last Sunday week - I then said I had come to search the house; I did so, but found nothing suspicious in the house - I then told him he must go to the watch-house, and I should take the van and goods there also, which I did; he said the whole of them were his boxes - after taking them out of the van I told him I wished him to be present, as I intended to search them; he, his wife, Watkins, and a female were present - I found this shawl, claimed by Sharp, in one of the boxes, and a pair of drops, claimed by Mr. Timewell, in one of them; this was on the 8th of December - I found a skeleton-key in a box, at Pichott's; a pocket tinder-box, and an instantaneous light-box in one of the boxes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You call this a skeleton-key? A. I believe it to be one; it was newly field when I found it - I have been in the Police from the first commencement of the new system; I call a key which has been altered as this is, a skeleton - the wards have certainly been field down; the drop ear-rings were in Pichott's box on the 8th - the owner was not present at the time; I produced them at the office - they were not recognized there; Miss Sharp was present - there were three hearings; they were not recognized till after the prisoner was committed - they have been recognized only to day, by Mr. Timewell; he described them to me particularly before he saw them, and the moment he saw them in my hand he said they were his; he saw what I produced at the office, but I only produced what had been recognized at the watch-house - all the property was at the office, but not produced to him; it lay on the table, but his attention was not directed to them - he had not a full view of every thing on the table; he could not see it, unless he looked down direct upon it, for there were forty or fifty articles produced, and these might be covered over with some others - I believe they were; the witness' attention was only directed to what was recognized at the watch-house, and which I produced as theirs - they were told to look at the property on the table.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD. I know the house, No. 80, Drummond-street, to be Butler's; I have been employed by him himself; he let part of it out - I did not see the things found, and have had no conversation with him about them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you before the Grand Jury on this case? A. Not on this case; I was employed by Butler last about two years ago, but have seen him there since - I was there on the 18th of last September; he had one lodger on the first floor, and I believe there has been no other lodger, for I have had occasion to watch the house; I certainly cannot from my own knowledge say who has lodged there since September.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he had a lodger? A. Yes, a female, who I have executed some warrants for; she had the first-floor, which is two rooms - I believe she had both; she seemed to have access to both.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENRY MORRISON. I found the things in the back parlour, which is occupied as a bed-room; they were not on the first floor - here are some skeleton-keys which I found in Butler's back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether that room might not have been let to a lodger? A. No, only from what Mrs. Butler said - I do not know Butler to be a carpenter.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BURRIDGE. I am a constable of Marylebone Office. On Saturday, the 12th of December, I was hailed by a person in Marylebone-street, and saw a woman in company with a person I knew; she came up and said her name was Pichott - I received from her a bundle, containing two shirts, which Mrs. Sharp claimed at the office.</p>
               <p>JAMES TIMEWELL. I can identify the whole of these articles; some I found myself at Butler's, and some at the office - the bracelets I found in a drawer in the back parlour, the chain, glass, silk dress, and two shirts; they were all in the house at the time of the robbery - I know the drops; I did not see them at the office, or I should have known them - I did not identify any of my property at the office; the drops were in the same drawer as the bracelets, and taken from the same place - the silk dress and tippet were in the front drawing-room; the property found in Pichott's boxes is mine.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.You did not identify the property at the office? A. I mean I did not identify any fresh property there - I had examined it before; I was told to look at the property on the table, but I had examined it, and thought I had seen all that was mine before, but to-day is the first time I saw these drops - if I had seen them I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140014"/>should have known them; I could point them out from among a thousand - the officer was opening a bundle to day, and I saw them, took them out, handed them to another officer, and told him a mark which was on them before I examined them.</p>
               <p>MISS SHARP. This is my mother's shawl, and was in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Had you had it some time? A. Yes, four years, but never wore it; I took it out of the paper a week before the robbery, and looked at it; I know the pattern - there is no particular mark on it, but I am sure of it by the appearance, colour and pattern; I should know it among others, having had it so long.</p>
               <p>Butler's Defence. Respecting the property, it was brought into my house by John Jennings - I did not know it was stolen; respecting the two shirts, I had took two to Mrs. Pichott, and asked her to mark them for me.</p>

               <p>Picholt's Defence. Butler was known to my wife's first husband several years ago, and was at that time foreman at a lime-yard - I knew nothing of him then; it was five or six years ago - when I married my wife I went to live by the New-road; she met Butler, and told him what business I was in, and that I should be glad to serve him - I accordingly worked for him; he called and paid me ready money for every article I made for him, and took them away; I never went to his house - he was always represented to me as possessed of hundreds of pounds, and having a kiln of his own; at one time I heard he was independent.</p>
               <p>HENRY TORIAS HAWKINS. I am a carpenter and joiner, and live at No. 9, Chester-terrace, Regent's-park; I am minding three houses there. On the 22nd of November I left my house at a quarter to six o'clock, and went to a place of worship in Charles-street, Hampstead-road; I got into the chapel about five minutes to six o'clock, and remained there till nine o'clock, I believe - I do not think I had got there more than three or four minutes before I saw Pichott sitting across a form near my pew door; I beckoned him into the pew which I have part of - he came in, and remained there till the service was over, which is generally at eight o'clock, a minute or two before or after; this was a mile and three quarters from some parts of the Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Is Pichott an acquaintance of your's? A. I never exchanged more than ten words with him before; Mr. Wild preached at the chapel that night.</p>
               <p>MARTHA WAGGETT. I live with my father in Henry-street, Hampstead-road. On the 22nd of November I went to the chapel in Charles-street, at six o'clock; Pichott was there when I went in - I sat near the pew in which he and Mr. Hawkins were; he remained there till the end of the service, and I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is he an old acquaintance of yours? A. He subscribes to the Missionary Society, for which I collect, and here is my book - that is the way I knew him; the service ended near eight o'clock.</p>

            . I am the last witnesses' brother - we live with our father. I went to chapel with her on the 22nd of November, and saw Pichott in Mr. Stevens' pew- Mr. Hawkins and his wife also sit there; his wife was not there that evening, she was ill - Pichott was there when the service began, and till it was over, which is generally about a quarter to eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you happen to recollect the 22nd of November? A. I remember my sister speaking to him at the door, and a person at the same time asked my sister what Mr. Jackson was to preach the following Sunday morning, which was our Sunday School anniversary sermon - that was on the 29th; Mr. Wild preached that night.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BLESSLEY. I live at No. 10, William-street, Regent's-park, about a mile and a quarter from Edgware-road. On the 22nd of November I saw Pichott at my house from a few minutes before eight o'clock till half-past ten; I had a sister insane, who had an inclination to have somebody to read to her, and I got him to come for that purpose, but he did not read, for she was not in a fit state; I am certain he came about a quarter before eight o'clock - I saw him out at my door at half-past ten o'clock, with his wife, who had come after him.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at No. 10, William-street, at Blessley's. On Sunday evening, the 22nd of November, about five o'clock, I called at Pichott's house, and remained with him till six, when he went to chapel, and I saw him again about a quarter-past eight - he was in my compay till a quarter after ten o'clock that evening, at Blessley's - his wife was with him when I called at his house; I went to Portland-road, returned about a quarter to seven, and remained in company with Mrs. Pichott till eight o'clock - she was sitting in the room with me, reading; I afterwards went to my lodging, as he had promised to come there to see a woman who was ill in the house; I went there at five or ten minutes past eight, and found him there - he said he had been there ten minutes - his wife came in about ten minutes; she had merely waited for a lodger to come from chapel - she left William-street with him.</p>

               <p>CHARLES FREDERICK JAMES. I am a brewer, and live in Portland-town, directly opposite Mr. Baylis' private door. On Sunday, the 6th of December, I was in my brew-house, and saw two men standing before Mr. Baylis' private door, with their faces towards me - I took no particular notice of them, till I saw the prisoner Butler, who I knew before, by seeing him two or three times before; I saw him go to the private door, put his hand to the keyhole, and as I thought put a key in - he opened the door, went in, and shut it after him; I first saw him try as if the key did not answer the purpose, and then make a second attempt - I saw his hand at the key-hole, but saw nothing in his hand; the door was apparently shut before- I then ran into my parlour, told my wife, then went out, crossed over, looked up and down the street, and saw only a little boy, except the two men, who had shifted to the corner of the house; I went up to them, seeing nobody in the street, and said, "The sooner that man is out of the house the better;" I then went, and brought Webb, the officer - he went into the adjoining house to Baylis, and brought the prisoner out by the collar; I had observed him loitering about the house two or three Sundays previous, but never in the week-day - I went into the house in about two hours, and it was all in confusion; the bed-clothes, bed, and mattress were all turned over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw the hand towards the door? A. Yes - I was across the street, which is narrow; from his position I suppose he was opening the door with a key - he might have been tapping at the door.</p>

            . I am an officer. About half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by my wife -I was asleep in the first floor room; I heard there was a thief in Baylis' house - I dressed, and got to the house in four minutes; I went round to the front door, examined it and found it closed - I then went through the shop of Mr. Pratt, a butcher, next door, and got over the wall into Baylis' yard, as the people surrounding the house said the thief was in the yard; I searched the wash-house and privy - he was not there, but on turning round I saw him through the staircase window, coming down the prosecutor's stairs - it was the prisoner; I went round, and posted two housekeepers at the front door - then returned over the wall into Baylis' yard; I found the back door fastened - I stepped five or six yards from the door, heard it open, and the prisoner came out; I collared him, and brought him through the house into High-street - I then got Jackson to mind the house, took the prisoner down the street, and met Soper, an officer - I then put my hand into the prisoner's coat pocket, and took out this crowbar; Soper took out this picklock-key - a small box-key, and a comb were found on him, and a large blue bag in his hat, with his handkerchief: I handcuffed him, and took him to the watch-house in Regent's-park - he was searched by the serjeant, but nothing more was found, except his handkerchief, which I gave him to wipe his hand which was bleeding very severely when I took him; I returned to the house, and found the front bed-room on the first floor broken open - here is the screw of the case the lock goes into, it appeared to have been forced off by this crow-bar; three bureau drawers were opened, every article taken on, and thrown on the floor - the drawers were open, they stood in the front bed-room; I then saw three boxes open, every article taken out, and strewed about the room - he made no resistance.</p>

            . I live directly opposite Baylis' house. On the 6th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I went out, seeing a few people collected in the street; I saw Webb, and went through the next house over the wall with him - while I was on the wall I saw the prisoner coming down stairs, by the staircase window; he came out at the door - I jumped off the wall, and Webb took him; I went into the house to mind it - I found there three pins, two brooches, and an ear-ring in pasteboard boxes, at the foot of the staircase - I showed them to Alice Baylis, who claimed them; I gave them to the officer - those produced are the same; I found two skeleton-keys under the mat of the door, and gave them to Manning.</p>
               <p>JOHN MANNING. I am an officer. These keys were given to me; I produce them - I had charge of the prisoner during the night of the 6th of December and on the 7th; I held out no threat or promise to him - he asked me if James was in custody; I asked him what James - he said John James, or if Charley Box was in custody; I asked why he inquired - he said, "Because they were with me in it yesterday;" we had been talking about breaking into Baylis' house - he asked me what Baylis had lost; I told him I believed nothing was taken away, but some things were found on the stairs.</p>

On the 10th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the front kitchen, and heard some person trying a key or keys to the middle door in the passage; I sent Evans, the servant, to see who was there - I heard him call Stop thief! I ran up stairs, followed him along the road, and the prisoner was secured by a gentleman; he appeared dreadfully agitated, and begged I would not be hard with him - he seemed greatly penitent, and said he was in great distress; I had neither promised him any thing nor threatened him: two coats hung in my passage five minutes before - they belonged to my brother John - they were gone, and dropped near the outer door; he was brought back to my house, and in my presence three keys were found on him, two of which opened my door, also a strap and dog-collar, and a bit of scented liver, which is used to attract dogs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw him with the coats? A. No - I saw them down in the middle of the passage, on the ground in the inner passage: they had been hanging up on pegs before.</p>

               <p>MR. BAKER.

               <p>COURT. Q. When you went out was the window fast? A. Yes - the pane of glass being broken they could put a hand in and unfasten it; there was a little place broken in the glass in the morning, but not large enough for a hand to be put through - the window was hasped; it is on the ground floor - I found my bed-room window open, which was shut before; they had got out there, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140017"/>suppose - the property was in the bed-room; all my rooms are on the ground floor.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. On what occasion did he tell you he had slept in the shed? A. When I took him into custody I said, "Where have you been sleeping?" as his house was empty, and he took me to the shed - it was near twenty miles from Law's; it was in a lane in the parish of Seacome, near Hertford - he informed me that he and his brother lived together; I took him at the back of the house where it was said they lived, at two o'clock in the morning - I desired him to show me where they slept, and he took me to the shed; this was before the brother was taken.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My brother asked me to go with him to Enfield, to a house he lodged at, as he had some things there when he worked at Theobald-park; when I got there the woman was not at home - I went to a public-house, had a pint of beer, and then came down the lane again; my brother was there with a bundle of things, and when we got home he gave me the frock, trousers, and breeches to put on, and the constable took me with them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you since seen any of the property that was taken away? A. None at all, except the 4d. piece - I said I could swear to that at the office, and that it was marked; I told Priece particularly before I saw it, that it had a hole in it, and a scar down the face; I did not say I could not identify the one produced, as it was not marked. I married a Portugues, but am now a widow.</p>

            . I lodged in the prosecutrix's house. On the 23rd of November I left the house about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; I knew the prisoners by their having lodged there some time by the name of Green - I returned home about twenty minutes past four, went into my room, and found all my property gone; I kept my clothes in a chest of drawers, and saw them there just before I went out that morning; when I came home the two bottom drawers were empty - I had left a pocket-book in my drawer with my linen, and in it was a 20l. and three 5l. Bank notes - the drawer was locked; I had received two of the 5l. notes from my brother George, on the 30th of October, and kept them in that pocket-book; I had seen them there the night before, when I went to bed: I received the other two from Esdaile's bank on the same day, the 30th of October - I found my clothes down stairs, some of them in the kitchen; the bundles had then been opened - I lost three razors.</p>

On Monday, the 23rd of November, about half-past three or four o'clock, the male prisoner came to the shop, and bought a clock for his wife, who was with him; I positively swear to both their persons - he also bought two India silk handkerchiefs; he at first offered me a 20l. Bank of England note, which I objected to change - he then produced a 5l. note; he took it out of an old red leather pocket-book, with one or two more - he gave me the name of James Green, which I wrote on the back of the note; this is the note I received from him, (No. 75, dated the 11th of August, 1829;) it has my writing on it.</p>

On the 23rd of November, at one o'clock, I saw the male prisoner by the side of the prosecutrix's door; I took the newspaper to the house, and gave it to him - he was standing outside the door, which was open; I knew him before, and am sure it was him - I always served him with beer.</p>
               <p>ANN EDWARDS. I have known the prisoners these three years and a half, but was only acquainted with the woman. To the best of my recollection, it was on the night of the 23rd of November, between twelve and one o'clock, the female prisoner knocked at my door, called me by name, and said she wished to leave a bundle with me, which she did - in the morning, between eight and nine o'clock, as I was going to work, I saw the male prisoner at the top of the court where I live; the bundle remained in my place till the Friday following, when the woman took it away herself - Lea, the officer, came the same night in search of it; I never saw it opened.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at Bow-street, where the female prisoner was under examination, on the 5th of December; she had this cloak on, which I afterwards took from her in Clerkenwell prison - she was asked where she got it; she said she bought it in Oxford-road, and gave 1l. for it - I produce a 4d. piece, which I received from Priece on the 5th of December; I traced the male prisoner from the George and Blue Boar on Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140019"/>morning, to Limerick, and took him there - he asked the charge; I told him it was for robbing Mrs. Silva, where he lodged - he said it was true he lodged there, and he had a right to leave her if he thought proper, as he did not owe her a fraction; on the road to Dublin he asked me if there was any other lodger in the house - I said there was another gentleman, but he had left; he asked how long he had left - I said about a fortnight: he then said Mrs. Silva had committed the robbery, and wanted to lay it on him - he said he had slept with his wife at the George and Blue Boar on Tuesday night, and a man named McCormack; I have a letter which I intercepted - I never showed it to him; he said he had sent a letter to his wife: I understand he cannot write - I have the strap and cloth which the bundles were tied in the parlour.</p>
               <p>JAMES REYNOLDS. This is the cloak I sold to the prisoner - it is a particular make.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose there are a great many of the same make? A. Very likely - I have not sold many like it; it was a cloak of this pattern and make - it is made in rather an uncommon way, being trimmed round the cape and down the front with silk; it is a Scotch plaid, but not a common one - I am sure it is the cloak I sold them.</p>

            . On the 23rd of November I was going to see a friend, at No. 13, New Rutland-street, next door to the prosecutrix, and as I drew up to the door, about twenty minutes past one o'clock, I saw the male prisoner coming out of the prosecutrix's door, and shutting it after him; nobody was with him - he had nothing in his possession - as I drew near the door he turned and looked upon me; I thought he was going to speak - he advanced six or seven yards from me, then turned again, looked upon me again, which caused me to take notice of him; I discovered that he was of a light complexion, a long thin visage, and about five feet six inches high; I am certain the prisoner is the man - he had grey trousers, fitting close to his legs, and low shoes; the prosecutrix came home in about a quarter of an hour, and discovered the robbery - I described the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you call the prisoner's a light complexion? A. Yes; I could not tell his height to an inch - I never said he had a drab coat and ancle boots on.</p>
               <p>MRS. E SILVA. This is my 4d. piece, and what I lost on the 23rd - I had seen it about a week before; it was taken out of a pertmanteau in the dining-room closet- there is a hole in it, and a crack near the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not uncommon for trinkets of that kind to have a hole? A. It may not be - I never wore it about my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. I am desired to ask if you did not go with the prisoner and his wife to Whitechapel, lock the door, bid them good bye, and ask them if they came to London again to be so good as to call on you? A. I never did, nor did I know but what they were coming back; this cloth and strap were put round the three bundles - I had seen the cloth before on their table; they used it for a table-cloth: it has a blue stripe on it, and is greasy now.</p>

(Looking at the silk) I swear this is my master's - I do not recollect having seen it during that day; our people were busily engaged with customers - two other young men came into the shop about the same time, which particularly drew my attention to the door; one of them tried to draw my attention to the door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q.When did you become acquainted with me? A.Eight months ago; I saw him at different theatres and places: the commode is three or four feet from the bed - I had left the key of the commode in the bottom drawer, but apparently he did not know that, for it was broken open; the door between the drawing-room and chamber was closed while he was alone in the bed-room - he stopped in the chamber alone for about two hours and a half; he fastened the door, so that I could not get in.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the room door was locked? A. He shut the door himself: one door leading to the staircase is always closed - the door between the two rooms is generally closed, but on this occasion he shut it himself: I remained in the drawing-room - I heard some kind of noise in the bed-room, but thinking I had an honest man in the room I took no notice of it; it was like the wash-hand-stand being moved, no other person was in the house but the master, mistress, and servant; there are no children - no person entered that room during the three days he was there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marylebone. The prosecutrix gave me information of her robbery on Friday evening, the 23rd of December - I went next morning to her apartment, and examined her drawers: I found the right hand top drawer had been attempted to be broken open - I then received from her the handle of a knife, and compared that with the marks; it appeared as if it had been used to force the drawers, and also that something like a pair of scissars had been used -I noticed that the lock had not been forced, and remarked that to her; she said she had left the key in the bottom drawer, and supposed he must have found it there at last, for the lock had not been forced - she delivered me these five notes; I endeavoured to apprehend the prisoner, and found him in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say the lock was not forced? A. No, it had been attempted; it was a small pen-knife - the prosecutrix said she found that knife in the room; the marks matched exactly with the broken part of the blade in several places, and there are other marks, as if a pair of scissars had been used - I have been in the habit of examining places which have been broken open for the last thirteen years; there had not been force enough to get the drawer quite open - she shewed me the drawer the things had been taken from; it was the top drawer on the right-hand, close by the wash-hand stand - I never saw you about, though I looked for you a great many times; the prosecutrix said she had seen you several times on horse-back, and in a yellow-bodied cabriolet, in the Parks, Regent-street, and Pall-mall.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (Partly inaudible.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Not having pecuniary resources to command the aid of counsel, I hope you will make every allowance for me. Fully aware of the perilous and awful situation in which I stand, I shall use the best ability I possess to erase from your minds suspicion of my guilt. In a land of strangers, removed far from friends, being some thousand miles from a single relative, I have not the means of procuring counsel or witnesses; I no doubt appear before you in the semblance of guilt, but hope to satisfy you I am not the individual I am represented to be - I hope you will ponder well before you give your decision, and will be perfectly satisfied; I have but little doubt but you are endeared to your homes by the endeared members of your affectionate family, and will not consign me to an ignominious death; at all events to the degrada<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140022"/>tion of banishment from country, home and friends; to be stigmatised for ever as a felon, and doomed to companionship with the myriads of vice and infamy that colonize that unhappy country, and will give due allowance for my situation and feelings. I will endeavour to make such few comments on the evidence, as my feeble abilities will allow, - first, it is sworn by the prosecutrix, that I called on her, and remained three successive nights and days, and on leaving her I abstracted from her drawers or bureau, jewellery, money, and cash, to the amount of what constitutes a capital charge: that on the morning previous to my leaving her she had examined the jewellery-box, and on being questioned, she says she did not examine it, but went to the drawer to take a towel out - It is not likely an individual going to take out a towel, which would require no looking for, would see every thing in a jewellery-box; I feel satisfied the whole affair has been brought against me with the most vindictive feelings - I have not been spared in any way. With regard to the pieces of paper, I certainly confess I did give them to her; but not accompanied by any observation; I did not say it was money - I did not hand them to her, but placed them in her bosom on leaving the house. The evidence of the pawnbroker must be preposterous; he says he knows me by my size; that I hid my face with my hand, and he did not get a glimpse of my face; then he says, "I think I know the individual" - that of course you will not receive as evidence. A pawnbroker's shop is a receptacle for every individual; many hundreds may call there every day, and unless he knew a person it is scarcely possible he should recognize him. As to Mr. Polack, I have no reason to doubt he observed me on the stairs. I admit having been there, and stopping with the lady three nights; but deny having in any way or shape taken her articles. I have not been in London six months, and am certain I have not been eight months in England. A conversation occurred during the short time I was waiting in this Court where the prosecutrix and her friends stood, which showed a great deal of the callousness of their feelings. I heard them observe, "D-n him! we will finish him this time;" or something of that sort; it shows they did not care whether they swore false or not. The officer says, no lock was broken, but there appeared an attempt to force it - if you will examine the knife, you will find a man must be a very great novice to attempt to force a drawer with such a knife, and it is not my property.</p>

On the 1st of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I counted her sheep - there were thirty-six altogether; I went to the field next day after my son came to me - I found a skin in the possession of my son: I found in the field a sheep's entrails and some blood - I am sure the skin was the skin of the sheep I missed; here is the mark on it, W L, on the off side - I afterwards saw the head and feet of a sheep; I looked over the pales, and saw footmarks of two different people - they were near the spot where the entrails and blood were found; I received the skin into my possession, and put it into the tool-house in the garden, and produce it here; Mead had it from me, and I have got it now from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you get the skin from your son? A. On the 2nd of January - it was snowy weather: I do not know whether it had snowed in the night or not - the fields are frequented by sportsmen at times, but it is paled in, and we prevent them when we can.</p>
               <p>JAMES SAVILL. I am the son of the last witness, and in the employ of Mrs. Lewis. On Saturday morning, the 2nd of January, I went into the field, and counted the sheep; there were thirty-five - I found a skin in the field, and the entrails and some blood; it was under some trees by the side of the pales - there were some dried leaves in the field near to where I found the skin; it was an ewe sheep - I gave the skin to my father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are plenty of leaves about every field where there are trees? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN MEAD. I am beadle of Enfield. On the morning of the 2nd of January, about ten o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to Mrs. Lewis' premises; I went into the park - Savill showed me the entrails of a sheep, and blood; the skin was shown to me in the tool-house - I saw footmarks in the park, close on the spot where the entrails were; the footmarks were not bloody - I looked over the pales, and saw footmarks where they had got over, and traced them nearly three quarters of a mile on the snow, leading towards Enfield, in a direction to Puddifoot's house: I traced them within two hundred yards of his house - he does not live in the high road, but on the Chase green; I went to Puddifoot's house - he was not at home; I searched the house - I had some slight knowledge of him before, and knew he lived there; I went up stairs, and in a butter-firkin, in the bed-room, I found nearly the whole carcase of a sheep, cut up in a very slovenly manner, and put into the firkin covered with a sack, and in the window, in the bed-room, lay a bill and a knife all over blood; I produce them - there was also some fat and small pieces of meat on them; the blood was very fresh - it had not dried; in the sack which covered the tub was a sheep's head with part of the skin on it, and by the side of the tub lay part of the inside of a sheep, and in it what turned out to be a young lamb; I searched the lower part of the house, and under the stairs I found a sheep's pluck, and three sheep's feet concealed - they were not covered, but were on a shelf high up; I found a parcel of ropes, two very large sticks in the bed-room loaded with lead and nails - they are not here; I afterwards apprehended Puddifoot in the barn -I said, "You are the man I want; you must go with me;" he said, "For what?" I said "For Mrs. Lewis' mutton;" he said, "Oh, I will go with you" - he did not resist; I locked him up and went in pursuit of Gratton - Watkins took him that morning, and about twelve o'clock I took his(Grattons) shoes off; there were nails in them, and marks of blood and fat, and small pieces of meat on the shoes - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140023"/>produce them; I looked into the snow, and there were nine nails in the shoes, in a crossway, and so there was in the snow - I did not put them into the snow, because there had been a little thaw; I did not take the shoes to the field when I looked at the footmarks: I compared the sheep's head and feet with the skin produced - they exactly fitted; there were some leaves on the head, and by my laying the head down the leaves dropped off on the skin - I saw some of the dry leaves in the field, by the blood and entrails, and the leaves on the head were the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of trees are there? A. Oak and ash; the sun had come out about twelve or one o'clock, which was the reason I did not take the shoes to fit them- I know it was Puddifoot's house I went to; his wife and family live there, and were there when I went - I never saw him there myself; I was told it was his house - I was before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q.Were not several butchers sent for to try to fit the legs and head in the skin? A. One, named Taylor, was sent for; nobody else - I heard no butcher declare it was impossible to say a sheep cut up in that way would fit the skin; I was there nearly all the time - there were two butchers there, but only one was sent for; the other came in by chance, (Mr. Gocher, who is here) - Taylor did not like to interfere in it; he was spoken to by the Magistrate, and said he had rather decline having any thing to do with it, he did not like to be called out of his business; there was no other butcher there to my knowledge - none were examined, for I was not out of sight of the office; I only went out to wash my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many children live in Puddifoot's house? A.There was a little boy at home, and two work for Mr. Ellis; he told me himself, at the Nag's-head public-house, where I took him, and gave him a pint of beer, that it was his house - he said he knew nothing at all about what was in the house; he had got his dinner - I said,"Come, old man, you sha'n't go in dry," and gave him a pint of beer - I said I had been to his house, and he said,"I live on the green;" he said it was his house - I said I had been to search his house on the green; he said, "What did you find there?" this was in the farm-yard - I told him I found some mutton: there are two houses standing by themselves on the green, one of which is his, and there are some more houses about fifty yards off: there are six or seven cottages on the green in all - the high road passes by the green; the snow was batted down on the road.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Were they footmarks of one or two persons? A. Two; I traced footmarks on the green after they crossed the bridge, across the green again - there was still two footsteps, and blood was traced within two or three hundred yards of the house; Puddifoot's sons are not grown up - there are two children under fourteen years of age; the footmarks were of grown up men.</p>

            . I am a horse patrol of Bow-street, stationed at Enfield.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was this after Puddifoot was taken? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JACOB GOCHER. I am a butcher. I examined the carcase found in Puddifoot's house before the Magistrate: it was produced in a tub by Mead - it was cut up all to pieces, hammocked and spoiled; I examined the head, feet, and skin - I tried the head to the skin; it fitted - we should term it a Welch breed, but it was a little cross; the head matches the skin - the skin on the head is not as a butcher would cut it; I did not compare the feet with the skin.</p>

            . I compared the feet found in Puddifoot's house, with the skin; they matched - I also compared the head, that matched - I produce the feet; it was not a thorough Welch bred sheep, but a little cross.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.If you saw those legs and skins in Yorkshire would you say they were the same? A. I swear the head and skin match, and the feet also; if I had never seen the skin and legs before, I would swear they matched.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you saw them now for the first time, should you think they belonged to the same skin? A. I should.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Suppose you never saw the head and feet before, and met them down in Yorkshire, and did not know that Mrs. Lewis had lost a sheep, would you swear they belonged to the skin? A. Yes, I would; I should not think there is another skin in the kingdom that would match them - about thirty of Mrs. Lewis' sheep are alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose two sheep had been taken, and two skins were produced, could you tell which of the two they had belonged to? A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q. What makes you so certain no other skin would match the head? A.Because it is cut in such a way - different to what sheeps' heads are usually cut; it was an ewe sheep, and I expected it was with lamb - I expected all her ewes were with lamb.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Looking at the head of the sheep, can you tell it belonged to a Welch cross breed? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who called her Mrs. Puddifoot? A. The Magistrate; and when I was going to Newgate, Puddifoot said "I was a lucky man with my old wife, but now have got a d-d fool."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.If the girl might have been ill, why do you say it was pretence? A. I think it was pretence, as she was seen running about at play in the street; I sent the horses to be foraged - that was my only intention in sending them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent any thing else out? A. The people I wash for had my linen, I believe, and I may have sent things from my wardrobe to be repaired, but nothing else; I sent nothing out but my wearing-apparel - I may have let a few of my things go, but it was nothing but wearing-apparel; I sent the prisoner's daughter some silk gowns to repair - there was an execution in the house about, or at the time, at the suit of Mr. Wilson, I believe; the prisoner made the bill for the horses up to the 3rd of December - he had had them a fortnight then; my husband had bought the horses of Mr. Osborne, and given one hundred guineas for them - I have said they did not belong to me, because I had sold them to my cousin; he had given me 50l. in part payment - Mr. O'Brien was in difficulties, and I said so; it was a fact, but my cousin had left them with me for my use and pleasure - I said so to several persons; I was to place them at the cheapest place I could, when I could not ride them - I never offered them to the prisoner for 30l., nor tell his daughters I had called them in to witness their being his in case of an execution - I never said any such thing; the clothes I sent out I should think at the utmost were not worth more than 15l. - I sent them out to be protected; I did not know the prisoner at the time he first had the horses.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you send the clothes to? A. The prisoner's daughter said, "Oh, let me take the things home to my father, and he will take care of them; we have often had executions in our house, and I know they will take every thing;" I think it was his youngest daughter - Watkins, my servant, took some, and his daughters the rest; the execution was subsequently withdrawn; the landlord was paid - there was not enough for the Sheriff.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Your servants knew of your misfortune - did you authorize the prisoner or his daughters to clear your stable out? A.Never; I never saw the prisoner but when he produced the bill of 36s.</p>

            . I live in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove - I am a parish constable, and a furniture broker; the prisoner lived in High-street, Portland-town, about three quarters of a mile from me. On the 19th of December he asked me to come to his place to buy some furniture, as he was about to remove to Prague-street, Paddington - I bought some furniture of him, and on the Monday some fixtures; he told me to bring my cart and take them away - he afterwards said, "Bring a van and take my goods at the same time," as my house is in the direction he was going; I noticed a press-bedstead among other things, being heavy - I went after the prisoner on the 24th of December, and in a barge at Windsor, belonging to Clark and Robinson, I found the same press-bedstead which I had helped to put into the van; it laid on its back, with the two folding doors upwards, and two plates screwed down into the doors - I unscrewed it, and found the saddles and horse-cloths in it; the prosecutrix identified them in the prisoner's presence, at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him? A. Not till he came about the furniture.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DICKENSON. I am a serjeant of the Police. On the 21st of December I was going my rounds, and the prosecutrix called me in, and gave me information, in consequence of which I went in search of the prisoner and horses to Cheltenham, then to Chippenham, and went with Denman to Shenstone, in Wills, and at the Rattlebone public-house Denman brought the prisoner in; Conway, the prosecutrix's gardener, was with me, to identify him - he shook hands with him; I asked if that was Lidyard -Conway said Yes; I told him I had come from London, and that he was my prisoner - that he had escaped with some horses; he was very obstreperous, and wanted to know the particulars - after handcuffing him I told him he was charged with stealing a quantity of bridles, saddles, horse-cloths, and two horses; he said he had never stolen them, that he bought them, and gave 30l. for them; I said if that was the case, if he would go before some country Magistrate, no doubt they would discharge him; the place was quite in a disturbance, for all the inhabitants were on his side - he said he would not go: I said he had better go to the nearest Magistrate we could find, and he should chose one himself, but he said he would not go out of the village; as we went along he said he would give the horses up if Mrs. O'Brien would pay the expences; I had before that asked him where they were, and he would not tell me - he repeatedly said he had bought them for 30l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you state to the Magistrate one word about his not telling you where they were? A. I believe so, I am sure of it in fact; what I said was taken down and read over to me; he said he would go before Mr. Oldfield, the Magistrate at Shenstone, and I took him; he would not interfere, and I brought him to town.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ROBERTS. I am a labourer to the East India Company. I take an account of what goes out of the yard - I have known the prisoner some years; I saw him in the yard on the 3rd of October with a permit in his hand, which he presented for a chest of tea, No. 492, by the Castle Huntley - I took the permit, entered it in the book, and helped the chest on his knot; it is always delivered on the permit being presented - I did not see him again till the 28th of November, when he was in custody; he used to work for different carmen - permits are generally put into a box at the permit-office; a stranger could easily get one at that time, but I believe an alteration has been made.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not book my own name to it? A. I booked your name as the person taking it away; I was in the habit of seeing you before the 3rd of October, off and on, but not for a week or a month - I have not known you to have many chests as a porter.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRICE.

               <p>THOMAS DEVY. I am a constable of Aldgate-ward. I apprehended the prisoner in Thames-street, on the 28th of November, and told him I wanted him to go with me to Crutched-friars warehouse - he went, and the witnesses indentified him as the man who had the chest; he said that on the 3rd of October he had been employed by a gentleman to get a chest of tea out of the warehouse, and take it over the water, and he left it at the foot of London-bridge- I asked at what house he delivered it; he said he delivered it in the street at the foot of the bridge, that the gentleman paid him, and he came away - he did not say what the gentleman did with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Ship in Hart-street, when a gentlemanly dressed man asked for a porter; I went out with him - he gave me this paper from his pocket-book, containing the particulars of the chest, and a description of the party; I went to the yard, selected the paper, and got the permit, went to Jones' in Crutchedfriars and borrowed a knot, and when I went to the yard the call had not commenced - when I got to London-bridge I pitched the chest on the block; the same gentleman came, and said, "I will not trouble you further, I have just met my own porter coming" - he gave me 1s., and I delivered the chest to him; here are the instructions I received - there were two persons in the Ship, one was the Imperial Vintner's porter. I thought that the gentleman was Mr. Forster, whose name was on the paper.</p>
               <p>MR. WATKINS. This paper is not my hand-writing - it is customary for the porter to have the particulars to apply for the request paper by.</p>

On Saturday night, the 5th of December, the prisoner came and looked at some seals, but bought none - on Monday, the 7th, at seven o'clock in the evening, he called, and asked to see those seals again - I showed him a tray, with those in it he had seen before; he said be thought what I pointed out to him were not those he had chosen - I said they were: he considered them dear - he then moved rather from the counter, and snatched a handful from the tray, took seven seals, and got out; I went out into the road, gave an alarm, and he was taken in five minutes - three seals had dropped in the shop, and three were found in Brown's-buildings, about one hundred yards off - the other has not been found; there were ninety-nine in the tray: I am sure the six found are master's - they are gold plated on copper, and worth 6l. or 7l.; they would cost 6l. from the manufacturer's - I think two or three are solid gold, but cannot tell without taking them to pieces.</p>

               <p>JOHN GASKIN. I am a Thames Police-surveyer. I was near Mr. Taylor's, and saw the prisoner run out of the shop - Askey came out, and gave an alarm; I pursued him down St. Mary-axe, and he turned up a sort of court; I was nearly up to him, but met with an obstruction, and lost sight of him for a moment; I then saw him in custody - I brought him back to the shop - I did not see the seals found: I asked him what he was - he said he was a tailor, and if he was to be hung out of the way it would be of no consequence, for he was in distress. I saw two seals on the shop floor, and one on the edge of the counter.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ARTHUR. I am inspector of the ward. I was in Bury-street, and heard an alarm - I pursued to Grey-alley, leading to Brown's-buildings, and saw the prisoner running; I secured him - I have the three seals found in the shop.</p>
               <p>ESTHER COHEN. I live in Bell-court, near Brown's-buildings. I found three seals on the ground in Brown's-building, about five minutes past seven o'clock in the evening - I had not heard the alarm of Stop thief! I produced them before the Magistrate, and Askey swore to them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How much is now produced? A.Eight yards and a quarter - part of it has been cut off; that taken from the window was fourteen yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you before the Magistrate? A. Yes - I did not swear that it corresponded with the quantity, which was eight yards and a quarter; it was a mistake of Mr. Roe's or of mine, I do not which; I had measured it the day before, and there were eight yards and a quarter of it - I went and rectified the mistake within an hour: as soon as I got home I heard that the prisoner proved he had had more than fourteen yards of it - I do not think the number of yards was mentioned in the first instance; I had seen it on Wednesday, and we missed it on Thursday or Friday, but decidedly on the Monday, when it was wanted for a customer; there are four or five shopmen, but we keep<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140029"/>our books very regularly, and if they had sold it it would have been put down - our books are not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You can tell what you sold, but cannot speak for others? A. No - this piece was cut off after we had sold a part of it; this is a piece that had been in my master's window.</p>
               <p>SOLOMON JOSEPHS. I live at No. 26, Wincot-street - I attend sales. I have known the prisoner several years; he came to my house on the 1st of December, and brought these eight yards and a quarter of silk, which I was to sell for him at the west-end of the town, as it was too high a price for his shop - I was to sell it at 8s. or 8s. 6d. a yard; I do not know the value of it; I went to Michael Jonas with it, and we took it to Mr. Pool's to sell it - we were both taken the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the prisoner? A. He now keeps a sale shop, and sells clothes, shoes and boots; his shop is in Portland-town - he has been there two or three years; he had lived at a pawnbroker's - I have dealt with him for second-hand clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Did Mr. Pool take the silk of you? A. I did not go into the shop: I first became acquainted with the prisoner in consequence of his wanting a cloak for a gentleman - I had the means of procuring that cloak; I have dealt with him in different ways- he keeps a shop; I have seen piece-goods there - Portland-town is not a very fashionable place; Pool's house is in Burlington-passage - Jonas left the silk there; I have been out on bail.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I thought you were to sell it? A. Yes, but I met Jonas in the morning, and had this silk in my hand - I had a piece of tabaret to sell, and Jonas took this piece of silk.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL JONAS. I am a general dealer - I buy silks, and ladies' and gentlemen's wardrobes. On the 2nd of December I saw Josephs in Cutler-street, with this piece of silk: I said I had a customer for it, and took it to Mr. Pool's for sale - he was not at home, but I left it there; Josephs staid at the door - I was taken into custody; I do not know the value of the silk, being new - I had never dealt in such a thing before: I was not instructed to take 6s. - I was to ask 8s. for it; I thought it was a moderate price - I had not dealt in silks before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.But you had dealt in second-hand silks? A. Yes - I could not venture to swear to this silk; there may be more like it - it has no mark on it; I took a piece of this pattern, and there was eight yards and a quarter of it - I believe this is it.</p>

            . I am a mercer, and live at No. 4, Old Burlington-street. Jonas came on the 2nd of December, and left this silk at my shop for sale at 8s. a yard; I told my son to look to the invoices, as I was sure it was below the mark - these silks have not been in the market more than six weeks; I gave the witness into custody - it is Lyons silk; I had paid 17s. a yard to the same man for some similar to this - the pattern I think you cannot match.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.But you bought it of a person who sells it? A. Yes - not of the manufacturer; it had not been in the market more than six weeks before this happened - from my knowledge of the business I know it has not; I know it is Lyons silk, and of a new pattern - I have bought second-hand silk of Jonas, but I never saw him with any thing new before; I have sold him second-hand clothes.</p>

            . I received information, and went to Mr. Pool's - I saw Jonas there; the other witness was brought in; I believe this is my property - it is a scarce article, and foreign silk; it has not been manufactured in Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know all the Spitalfields weavers? A. No, I know many of them - I do not know that it has not been imitated; the person I bought it of is in Court - he is the importer; it had been in my stock in the shop - I have several shopmen; I had seen it about three days before there was an alarm that it was missed - my shopmen are not here, but I have made every inquiry among them; I believe it had not been sold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Whether this silk could or could not be imitated, what you bought was of Lyons manufacture, and this is of Lyons manufacture? A. Yes, it is different to British manufacture and in width; I should have sold it at 16s. or 17s. a yard - I do not think if I were to order it in Spitalfields, and give them a month to make it in, that they would be able to make it to match as this pattern does; I believe the pattern and piece to be the same - the ground, flowers, and every thing seem to me to coincide exactly; in trying to imitate it exactly in Spitalfields they would fail to do it nineteen times out of twenty - indeed, if I was to write abroad to the manufacturer, and say,"Make one like this," I think neither the ground nor the flower would correspond exactly as this piece does.</p>

             - he is abroad; this piece of silk is foreign manufacture - we only imported one of this pattern; I firmly believe this is part of it - I would not swear it; I think we could have a piece like this made at Lyons, but decidedly not in this country - they may have another piece by them at Lyons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You think it possible there may be another piece? A. Yes, but very improbable; I do not know how many pieces they might make: two pieces might be so manufactured that a person could not distinguish one from the other, but not to correspond as this pattern does - we imported but one piece, and sold that to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD. I am an officer. In consequence of information I took the prisoner on Wednesday, the 7th of December, in High-street, Portland-town; this piece of silk was produced at the time - he said he knew the silk; he was very much flurried, and I told him to be cautions, as it was stolen - he said he bought it at an auction-room about a fortnight or three weeks before, but he did not know where; I said that was before it was stolen - he then said, "Let me consider, it was about Friday or Saturday last," and concluded by saying, "It was on Friday;" he afterwards said he bought it in a street in Petticoat-lane, and afterwards that it was in a house in Petticoat-lane, and he could produce the man he bought it of: I then gave him in charge of Avis - this is the silk; I have had it ever since - I likewise produce a yard and a quarter more, which I got from Mr. Burnett, who said he got it of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What time did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140030"/>you go to the prisoner's? A.About seven o'clock in the evening; I saw his wife, but did not make myself known - I gave her a fictitious name: there is a shop window, but very few goods in it - the prisoner came home about ten o'clock, and I asked if he knew this silk; he said directly that he knew it, and named the quantity, but he was flurried; I told him, before he made this statement, that it was stolen, and he looked in that kind of way as I should have expected a person would who was guilty - here is a yard and a half in this other piece of silk, according to my measurement.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Schofield outside the door with Josephs; I took the prisoner to the watch-house - I made him no promise or threat, but he told me that he bought the silk in Petticoat-lane, and gave it to Josephs to sell, knowing him to be a better judge of silk than himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Josephs', as I had an order for a gentleman's cloak, and I knew he was acquained with master tailors at the west-end of the town - he got me four cloaks, and I sold one; then there were tassels wanting, and Josephs told me if I would call in the course of a week he would get them - I called, and I happened to have this silk with me; he said if I had not a customer for it he thought he could get me one - I had sold some of the silk, as I can prove; I told Josephs it cost me 8s. per yard, and if he could get any thing more as a profit well and good - I left it with him on commission.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURNETT. I am a master tailor, and live in Upper North-place, Gray's Inn-road. I bought three yards and a quarter of this silk, of the prisoner, the latter end of November, about the last day; it was sealed up in this paper at Marlborough-street office, where I attended with it, and has my signature upon it.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. You are a very good judge of these articles? A. I have made up a great many - I was to give 8s. or 8s. 6d. a yard for this - there is an account between us; I supposed 8s. about the value of it; I have been a tailor all my life - I have worked for the prisoner, and if he has any thing to suit me, he says, "Will that do for you?" I saw this silk, and said, "What do you want for it?" he said 8s. 6d. - I said "I will give you 8s." I have known him ten years; he is a general salesman, and deals in coats, hats, shoes, silks, and other things - he has been about three years in this business; he was before that foreman at a pawnbroker's - I have dealt with him for silks before; I should think that this is an old pattern -I believe I can get some of it within three hundred yards of here, for that price, at a public shop.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.Had you sold things to the prisoner? A. Yes; he asked 8s. 6d. per yard for it - I said I thought 8s. enough for it, to throw it into the window.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the price to be? A. I said,"I will give you 8s." - he said, "When we settle we will see about it;" I did not think it cheap at 8s. 6d. - I thought it enough for it; he was foreman to Mr. Price, a pawnbroker, in Wentworth-street - I had worked for him at that time, but had no dealings with him; I had not heard that Mr. Price had been in difficulties - I have been to the house two or three times; I believe within these last twelve months he has been a bankrupt.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live at Brunswick-parade, White Conduit-fields. I bought a yard of silk of the prisoner on a Tuesday or Wednesday the latter end of November; I had it made into a waistcoat, and this is it - I think it was about the 24th or 25th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Are you a master linen-draper? A. Yes, in a small way; purchasing silks is not in the way of my business, except for my own wear - I gave 8s. for this yard, and thought it a fair price; I have sold silks in my shop, but am not acquainted with this sort of article.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know him living with Mr. Price? A. Yes - he served his time to him, and I think lived there for twenty years; I never knew Price was in trouble.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q.How long have you been a linen-draper? A. I served my time to it, and have been five years with a linen-draper of Bishopsgate-street - twelve months ago I was warehouseman at a house.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORD. I am a baker, and live in Portland-town. I bought three quarters of a yard of silk of the prisoner, which I had made into this waistcoat; it was on the Monday previous to his going away.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM STEPHENS. I am a Police-constable. On the 17th of December, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in Sidney's-alley<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140031"/>with this chaise-cover wrapped round his body; I asked what he had got - he said a roquelaire; I took him, and found it was this cover - I found the initials upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming through Windsor, where I had applied for relief, and they told me I must come to St. George's parish; a gentleman gave me this to keep me warm - I came to London, and went to Mr. Powell, who gave me a note to go to the workhouse; they gave me a slice of bread and cheese, and 3d - I could not get a lodging for that, and was obliged to walk the streets; I got to Sidney's-alley, and the officer stopped me.</p>

On the 26th of October I fastened up their hop-warehouse, which has a double door, a bolt at the top and bottom, and a lock. On the 27th I went and found the doors pulled too, but they had been broken open, and some bags of hops had been removed - upon examination, six bags were missing; I gave information to the Police; they were taken entirely away out of the warehouse, and an old padlock was left behind, which did not belong to the prosecutors.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BACK. I belong to the brewery. Danbrook came to me on the 27th of October, about ten o'clock in the morning; I went to Bell-lane store-house, and missed three bags from the right-hand side, and three from the left, immediately on getting in at the door - I had been there on the 24th, and all was safe then; on the 9th of November, I was sent for, and saw Mr. Willis and a constable - Mr. Willis had a sample of hops, which I compared with the hops which had been used that morning, and they corresponded exactly - I know Farren, and I told Willis to agree with Crouchman for the hops - on the 11th of November, I was at the corner of Wynyatt-street, and saw three bags of one mark, which were stolen, and one bag of another mark, which was stolen, in a cart, which was coming down the street, with Crouchman and Willis in it; they were delivered at a private brew-house, belonging to Mr. Farren's brother - these four bags were part of the property which was taken; I can swear they were part of the property of Messrs. Hanbury and Co.; Crouchman was then taken into custody - they were hops of two different growths,</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crouchman. There might be some hundreds of bags of that growth, which Hanbury's did not buy. Witness. There were one hundred and sixty bags of the mark of Selby, and they bought the whole of that growth.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 27th of October, I was walking adjoining Hanbury's brew-house, as I went along Bell-lane in the morning: it struck six o'clock - I saw a van standing at Hanbury's warehouse door, and a man in the van, pressing down the fourth bag of hops; the morning being so dark I could not swear to the man - he was dressed in a dark brown dress; I cannot say Crouchman is the man - he has not the same dress on now, but by his size he appears to me to be the same person; I staid there a little while.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say at the office? A. I said I believed that was the man - he appeared to me to be the same sized person; that was five days after I had seen him - I believed he was the person then, and I believe so now.</p>

               <p>ROBERT CRANE. I live in Dorsett-street. On the morning of the 27th of October I was in Bell-lane and saw a van loaded with hops, and drawn with one horse -I could not see what horse it was; there were two men with it - each had fustian coats on; it was going from the place where the hops had been towards Spitalfields-market.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HAYES. I am a watchman, and live in Cow-alley. On the morning of Tuesday, the 27th of October, I was in Aldersgate-street, about half-past six o'clock; I saw the prisoner Crouchman driving a van - I had seen him before, and have no doubt he is the man; there were six bags in it - I suppose that is three quarters or a mile from Hanbury's.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILLIS. I know Crouchman - I met him in Old-street, and went with him to the Rum Puncheon, where we stopped an hour or more; he said, "I want to speak to you: I have got four bags of hops to sell, can you get me a customer for them?" I said I could not - he called me out again afterwards and I said, "I can't tell whether I can get you a customer or not" - he said, "If you will meet me at the Cock, at the corner of Golden-lane, I will bring you a sample;" I bade him good day, and did not see him again till the Wednesday morning, when he came to my house - I asked him if he had got rid of the hops: he said No - he wished I had got a customer for him; I said I had got one - by the customer I meant Mr. Farren, whom I had before agreed with; Crouchman came to my house afterwards, and we went to Mr. Farren's who agreed about the hops - I saw the hops in the place where they were deposited; I was to deliver the hops - I took the sample of hops to the prosecutor's - Crouchman carted the hops to Farren's from a place in Goswell-street-road, which I believe to belong to Crouchman; I helped to load them - when we got to Exmouth-street we were taken into custody by the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes, with the four bags of hops which were in the cart - I did not know, till the 11th of November, that the hops had been stolen, when Crouchman told me whose they were.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Did he say from whom he got them? A. He said he got them from Trueman and Hanbury's; that he had sold two bags, and had only four left - he said afterwards where he had sold the other two.</p>

I said I had heard a little about it - the prisoner said, "It is a troublesome concern, I wish I was rid of them;" he said that he and another man took them from Hanbury's - I gave information.</p>

            . I am a constable of Staines. On the 23rd of December, at six or seven o'clock in the evening, I saw James Hall turn the corner of my house with this gun concealed under his arm, with the butt against his foot - I went up to him, knowing him very well; he said,"I have a gun here" - I said, "Why are you seen about in the evening with a gun, when you know what a bad character you have in the town? take my advice, and go with the gun;" I looked at it, and gave it him back again - instead of returning home he went towards London, and it struck me that a person had informed me a gun had been stolen; I followed James, and saw his brother John join him, and he gave the gun to John - I called James, and he stopped; I said, "I want John, he has got the gun" - I went up to him and said, "Let me have the gun;" he resisted my having it, but James said "Let him have it;" James then said he had bought it - I said,"Tell me of whom, and I will go with you to the person"- but he would not; I took him to Mr. Bean, who had informed me the gun had been stolen - the prosecutor came and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. It was between six and seven o'clock in the evening when you saw James Hall? A. Yes; he was alone - I have seen a number a persons go out shooting; they do not carry their guns in the same way I think - it was not till after I had given him the gun back that John came up: they had gone about fifty or sixty yards - I know a man named Stepley, and I think he ought to have been here; James Hall did not say he bought it of Stepley for 17s. - I have an idea that Stepley was in the robbery; he was at the top of the lane when I spoke to James Hall.</p>

On the 1st of December the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to me, and said he had some leather to sell; I asked where he came from; he said, "The leather is coming out of the country" - he said he had five butts of it; I asked whether he was a boatman - he said he was, and appointed to bring me the leather the same night; on the 2nd he came to me again in the Edgware-road, and asked whether I would have that or not - I had not appointed to meet him there: he said he would bring it in half an hour, it was all quite ready, the stamps were all cut out, and it was drawn into the canal - I thought he meant the duty stamp, as all leather is marked before it leaves the tan-pit; he then brought me one butt doubled up in a sack, and said, if he could depend on me and I upon him we should do well - he turned the butt out of a sack into my passage: I asked what he wanted for it - he said, 25s.; I said, "You ask too much, I suppose you will take 1l." - we left it there and went to a public-house to get bread and cheese; I made an excuse that money was rather short, went out, and got the constable; he came and took him - he told me the second day I saw him that he had eight of them.</p>

Chard applied to me on the 1st of December, and told me that a man had offered him some leather, and on the 2nd he told me that the prisoner was the man; he had one butt in his possession at the time - the prisoner said he had bought it, and had given 15s. for it, to some boatman, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, near the stop of Paddington canal; I had known him before - he worked at a brick-maker's yard; he has been out of employ for some time - he said he could point out the man if he saw him; they were gone down to the City-basin - we went to Mr. Pickford's wharf; there were three boats in - he saw all the men, but said it was none of these; we then went to the lock - he said it was none of them; I at last found Mr. Stevens.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. He told you at once that he bought it? A. Yes; he did not propose to take me to his master.</p>

The canal runs through there; I assisted the Excise-officer in marking and weighing the leather, on Saturday, the 14th of November - the next morning I went to the warehouse, and saw the window open, and a piece of leather lying there; there were nine butts missing - I examined this butt when I was before the Magistrate; the Excise-office mark is cut out, but our private mark is still here, and I know it is my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose the Excise marks are the same in one as in another? A. They are not the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140034"/>at different tanners; they have moveable letters - my master puts the same mark on every one he tans, and we sell a great many; I cannot swear that this had not been sold.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are an auctioneer? A. Yes - I do not know of any such phrase in our trade as a knock out; there is among the brokers - it means when an article has been bought at a low price it is put up among themselves, and the advance is divided among them; there never was a knock out on my premises, to my knowledge - I do not remember any wine, or two bottles, which came to my share; I have had no quarrel with the prisoner - there was a carpet sold to Mr. Beckford, but there was no quarrel about that; I am so particular about the Excise duty, that I always leave it to be made out by the clerk; the prisoner has never threatened to lay an information against me for any sale- he has never threatened me with an Exchequer process; he has gone into another person's employ - I never had a sale through his means; I believe he has brought some bidders - he made himself very useful; while he was with me the sales increased - he was in Mr. Foster's employ before he came to me; I know an auctioneer named Parnell - I recollect a gentleman here present did send me some sales of wine; I believe it was in consequence of the prisoner being with me, but this was an addenda to the sale; there might be thirty dozen - there were not sixty dozen sold; the prisoner was a very industrious servant - I do not know that I have lost his interest since he left me; the parties he solicited come to me, I think, as many as before he left me - I did not send my son to the prisoner's brother-in-law, and do not know of his going.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner left your service, and gone to another auctioneer, before you made your charge? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN RITCHIE. I am a porter. I was standing at Mr. Cox's door, and the prisoner said he should have a job for me bye and bye; I cannot say when - it was three weeks before I was before the Magistrate; the prisoner said it was to take this glass to Mr. Fairchild's, in Portland-street - I took it, and he overtook me; he went with me to the house, and asked permission to leave it there till the evening - it was wrapped up in some bedfurniture; he said he wanted to get it away on the sly, as it did not suit him to pay for it on the Saturday night, and if he got it away he should not have to pay for it till Saturday week - he gave it to me in the little room at Mr. Cox's, about half-past two or three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not think there was any thing wrong in it? A. No - the foreman at a sale takes directions to send goods home to gentlemen, and what I thought he meant by the sly, was, that he was not prepared to pay for it - he wrapped it up.</p>
               <p>HENRY ROBERTS. I am a carver and gilder. I made this glass, and took it to Mr. Cox's on the 11th of October.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BALLARD. I am an officer. Mr. Cox's son gave charge of the prisoner - I asked if he knew any thing of a looking-glass; he said No, at first, and then said he had told Mr. Hollands all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know any thing about an Exchequer process? A. Yes - something was said to Mr. Cox, Jun., but the prosecutor was not there then; I replied, "If you had not said that, perhaps he would not have been so severe about this."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did he say? A. He said he would bring Mr. Cox to book for some duty not being paid on some sale - he said this after he was in my custody; he did not say he had threatened that before - he said he would do it.</p>

            . I am a porter at the Green Man and Still. Nine parcels came from Cheltenham on Saturday, the 21st of November - they were unloaded from the waggon, and put down on the pavement; I saw the directions on them - I took the way-bill into the office, put it on the desk, and when I came out I missed two trunks - one was a round black trunk, and one was in a black cloth; I could not see which way they were gone - it was very foggy.</p>
               <p>JAMES CONDIE. I am a Police-officer. On Saturday morning, the 21st of November, I was in Hanover-square, a little after five o'clock, speaking to a private watchman, and I heard a coach driving as rapidly as it could - it came down Princes-street, and passed by a gas-light; I saw the prisoner riding with the coachman on the box - the coach went up Hanover-street, down Regent-street, and there I saw two other young men; the coach stopped in Poland-street, and the prisoner got off the box - another man, with a white coat or jacket, went and opened the coach door, and a man in a dark coat came out and shut the door; I went up, and said, "What have you got here?" the coachman drove on - I took hold of the handle, and called to him to stop, but he would not: I at last took hold of the traces, and one of the horses fell - I looked round, and the men were all gone from the pavement; I then opened the door, to take the man who went inside, but he was gone - these two boxes were in the coach; the coachman took the coach and boxes to the office - the prosecutrix identified them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You say Lilly was on the box? A. Yes - I have known him some years - he was employed about the rank; I do not know that the coachman was his intimate friend - I am quite satisfied Lilly was on the box; the coachman was prosecuted here last Session, but was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The Police-man came to the lock-up place, and said, "Which is Lilly?" he did not know me, and then he came into the office and said he had known me three or four years - I expected the coachman, but he is not here.</p>

               <p>JAMES CONDIE. I know him by sight, but not by name - I was asked if I wanted Lilly, and I said I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q.Was it not foggy? A. Yes; I was at no great distance when the coach passed me - when I saw the prisoner he was standing against a post, holding up his face, and bidding the coachman good night.</p>

            's Defence. I and my brother, went between two and three o'clock, to Covent-garden-market, to buy some oranges - we took them home, and a young woman said Mr. Crandon wanted us; we went to ask what he wanted, and his wife said, "They are not the boys;" we went away: on the Monday morning, about ten o'clock, as we were going to market, this gentleman came and said he wanted us, as he heard we had stolen some meat I said, "Can you bring any body to prove it?" he said Yes, and took me to Mr. Frampton's - he went with us to Mr. Frampton's, and then to the office, and they got this girl Dunn, who has been thieving about the market all her life.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH CRANDON re-examined. Q. Did you hear from Mrs. Wildey about these boys? A. Yes; I had seen them about a quarter of an hour before the meat was lost - they were seen on the Monday morning, and I went after them; I left my wife while I went to seek after the boys - I took another boy that evening, named Buxey, and Dunn said that was not the boy.</p>

I saw his father, who showed me two skins at his barn door; they had both got my mark on them; I found the bark and fat of the off shoulder on one of them - in the off thigh, part of the skin was out of the hide; I went to the prisoner's cottage next morning, the 4th of December, and found Mrs. Ball there -Levick. the constable, was with me; I found a leg and shoulder of mutton boiled in the cupboard - there was a piece cut out across the leg, as if it had been eaten; the shoulder had the fat and bark torn off the back - it was the off shoulder; the leg had got a piece of skin on the thigh, and matched with the skin - it was the off leg; I compared the leg and shoulder with the skin - they corresponded; I have no doubt the meat found belonged to that skin - I have been a butcher these twenty years; we went and apprehended the prisoner's son, at Roxey, about a mile off - he said something to me; he was discharged by the Magistrate, and we had orders to take the father - we went on Saturday, and took him at Mr. Holsden's; he said something before Colonel

            , which was taken down I believe - I went to his cottage on Saturday, and found a raw leg of mutton, part of it cut away; it was in a blue handkerchief, and placed on the top of the bedstead in the prisoner's bed-room - there was a saucepan on the fire, with a pot full of pieces boiling; they were very dirty outside, and in a state it never could come from a butcher's - I found a knife and chopper in the back-room, and the blade of the knife had wool and fat on it; it had been used to cut and skin a sheep - the chopper had blood and fat on it, and a little wool in places - it appeared as if it had been used to cut up mutton hot, when it was just dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner is married? A. No - I do not know his daughter Emily. not by that name; I understand he is not married, but lives with a woman - he has two or three children; his family came to my house to kick up a row after the son was taken up - I have seen that young woman (

               <p>Q. Did you not tell him that Ball was taken and had split, and said that he, Bolton, had stolen the sheep? A. I did not - I knew Bolton, because he wanted to steal some sheep a year ago; I was at Brentford when Bolton was there - he was taken there to acquaint Colonel Clithe row about it, if he wanted him Colonel; Clitherow said we had no occasion to have him examined - I found the wool in the hedge on the Saturday, but did not go into the cottage to search till the Friday following, as I had not found the skins - I had no authority to go before; I did not search minutely on the Friday - I came away on finding the mutton, to go and look for the skins; boiling does not alter the colour of the fat much, and makes very little difference in the appearance; any butcher could identify it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the prisoner was working nine miles off when you lost your sheep? A. He came home the night they were lost; my man had missed them on the 27th - he is not here; I keep a public-house, and am a butcher also - I never made

            . I am a butcher, and live in North-street, Edgware-road. I examined the skins of two down sheep at the prosecutor's house, and compared one with a leg and shoulder of mutton, on the Saturday before Christmas-day; there was a deficiency of the bark on the shoulder, and the remainder of the bark was left on the skin - they matched; there was a piece of skin cut off the thigh of the mutton - it caused a hole in the skin, and tallied with the leg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you brought the leg here? A. Yes - it was boiled when I saw it; I compared it a full month after it was lost; I believe the shoulder was the first I ever saw boiled - the bark is not likely to come off in boiling.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEVICK. I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's house on the 4th of December to search for two pigs which were lost, and found a whole shoulder and part of a leg of mutton - the shoulder attracted my notice by the bone not being broken; Hitchcock was backward - I called him in, and shewed it to him; I took the prisoner - I searched the house again on the Saturday morning. and on the tester of the bed found a leg of mutton tied up in a handkerchief; I produce the mutton and the skin - I saw the shoulder compared, and it matched; here is part of the skin left over it - the pieces in the pot were very dirty outside; I found a chopper and knife - there is wool and hair on the knife now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Now do you call this a leg, or is there the third of a leg here? A. I never swore it was a leg: it is part of a leg - I am not a butcher; I saw it matched - the skin on it fits the place; there is only a piece cut off the shoulder - it has been over boiled; it was in this state then, except that it has shrivelled up.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. When you matched it, were you quite satisfied it tallied with the skin? A. I was.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter. I know Hitchcock, and have often spoken to him; I was never at his house till my brother was taken - there are some little woods in a field near my father's house; Hitchcock proposed to me to go into those woods - I refused; when I went out to go to Roxey he followed me, and offered me 5l., and then 10l. to go with him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.What, to go into a wood with him? A.No, into a field; he enticed me over the wood - I am seventeen years old next April; I have been out of place six months - I lived with Mr. Knight, at Knightsbridge, and was not strong enough to do the work; it was a place of all work - I lived there six months; I went to the prosecutor's house when my brother was taken - they pushed me out of the house, and I told his wife how he had behaved to me; when I had done telling her I went home; I did not use violent language - I only told his wife how he had behaved to me; I live with my father - my brother had brought the mutton home on Thursday evening - there were two legs and a shoulder, but no pieces; the pieces found were cut up to boil - my brother had bought it on Tuesday at Watford, and brought it home on Thursday; we often put victuals on the top of the bed as we are troubled with mice and rats - my brother put it up there; we had chopped wood with the chopper on the Friday - I saw no blood on it or the knife; they hung up in the back kitchen when I left the house on Saturday morning, and I will be on my oath there was no blood on them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time did you leave? A. Between seven and eight o'clock on Saturday morning; I went to the prosecutor's to see my brother; that was the cause of the disturbance.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you complain of this offer before this? A. Yes, to my mother-in-law; she is here.</p>
               <p>JAMES BALL. I am the prisoner's son. I and my father left the house on Tuesday morning for Watford to work - we returned on Thursday, and brought home two legs and a shoulder of mutton from Watford market - I was taken up for this on the Friday; I did not tell where I bought it - I was before Colonel 
               <persName id="t18300114-53-person484">Clitherow</persName>
            , who discharged me - Watford is nine miles from our house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Are you acquainted with Bolton? A.No; I have known him three or four years - I have not seen him for near a month; I have not lived at my father's lately, as there was no work doing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, when taken up, that you bought the mutton in London? A.No. so help me God, I did not; I swear I never did - I had slept at home for several nights before I was taken; my sister slept at Shepherd's-bush at her sister's - she stays there for a week, then comes home again; it is about nine miles off - she often goes there with Mr. Herbert's carter; I do not know that there was any wool on the mutton, or any dirt - I did not observe any wool on it, or any fat turn off the shoulder; I gave 5 1/2 d. a lb. for it - it came to 7s. 6d.; I do not know what it weighed - I think the chopper hung in the back kitchen when I saw it last; there is some blood and wool on it now, and some wool on the knife - the sheep got through the hedge into my father's garden, through a hole which was made to drain the ground, and I suppose tore the wool off in coming through; they told us, when we got home, that they had crept through - I did not see it myself.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When your sister did not sleep at home, was she at her sister's? A. Yes; that sister is married - her husband used to drive Scott's brick-cart; Herbert's carman goes that way, and gives her a lift - we have known him some years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you go on leaving the shop? A.Into the parlour: I had some friends, and sat with my back to the shop door - I have a lodger, who might have come down; I did not notice that the prisoner was tipsy - it might have been a jest.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I met Prendergast - we went to the Three Tuns: I walked home with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140043"/>him - we passed the work-house, and met seven men together: one of them ran against him - Prendergast wished him to go on; the man shoved against him - I said, "This man is an officer;" He said, "Oh, d - n an officer," and sung out "Jack, Jack," and the whole six came back - Jack hit Prendergast and knocked him down: I went to his assistance - I was pulled back by two of them; they struck me on each said of my head - another came up and hit me twice, and cut my lip: Jack then came up, as I thought to strike me - I said, "Jack, I know you well:" he said,"D - n him, let him go," and they did so - I went to Prendergast's assistance, and saw some of them picking money up off the pavement: I heard it jink - they walked away: the prisoner is the man they called Jack, and who knocked the prosecutor down - he went away with the rest of the gang: about five minutes after Prendergast met a man, and wished to take him - they had a scuffle, and gave charge for charge; that was not one of the party, and he was let go; I have known the prisoner six or seven years - I cannot say who picked up the money: Prendergast said he did not know whether he had lost any thing - he had been drinking, but could walk - I was sober; he came to me next morning to know how this was - we apprehended the prisoner in the evening.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PRENDERGAST. I lost two sovereigns and twenty-five shillings - I had four sovereigns when I met Anderton, and some silver: I changed a sovereign, spent about 18d., and when I got home I had a sovereign, five sixpences, and 2 1/2d. left.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH STRANGE. I am an officer. I went with Prendergast to the Two Brewers, and took the prisoner - he denied the charge.</p>

               <p>HENRY MOORE. I am a constable of Broad-street ward. On the 4th of January I received information from the messenger of the Company, that books had been stolen: on Friday, the 8th of January, I and my brother officer watched the premises, and about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner come out of the house, with a bundle under his arm - he walked towards Leman's biscuit shop. about three hundred yards from the house, looked at the clock, then turned down Broad-street, Throgmorton-street, returned, and crossed over into Broad-street: Mecleburgh then crossed over and spoke to him - they went into the Rose and Crown; the prisoner came to the door in a half a minute - I stopped him, and asked what he had in that bundle; he said Nothing -I searched him, and found four volumes of bound books, which the messenger claimed: he never said how he came by them - I afterwards learnt where he lived; I went to his lodging, and found thirty-two book covers with "Mexican Mining Association" stamped on them.</p>
               <p>MR. MATHER. I know these books to belong to the Association; we paid 3l. 13s. for them - I know them by frequently perusing them.</p>
               <p>JOHN MECLEBURGH. I am messenger to the Company. The prisoner was not in their employ - I was present when he was apprehended; he said he merely wanted to read the books - the covers produced belong to the Company; the prisoner was acquainted with the female servant of the house - the books were kept in a wardrobe in Mr. Heathfield's office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it an open wardrobe? A. It is open in the day time, but locked at night.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, pleading distress, and stated that nothing but having to support a sick mother would have induced him to commit the act.</p>

To my brother's trustee, because he is not in a fit state to attend to the concern - he has a committee; I have brought the rough cash-book here, as I have been requested - there is an entry of this sum received from Watts; it does not state when it was received - I put 13th against it myself three or four days ago: it is entered in the regular place, but it is not entered as received, because the cash-keeper's signature should be against it, as receiving it from him; I had access to this book, but this entry was not made till the day he was apprehended - I saw him do it; I said he had better enter in that book what he had received and not accounted for, and he wrote this 46l.; I did not mean to say it would be better for him if he entered it; I did not mean it as an inducement - I was aware what sums he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140044"/>had taken; we have a fair cash-book, but I understood the notice I had was to produce this book, it being the one he made the entry in - he does not make entries in the other cash-book; it is a copy of this rough book, and is made up once a month - the notice mentions a book containing entries made by him, as such I have brought this one; I ascertained on Thursday that he had taken 20l. and not accounted for it - I went through the rough book that evening, and went to several customers, to ask what sums had been paid, and on looking at the cash-book I found several sums inserted, and endeavoured to be covered by a payment to Cowley, which was never made, and next day I got him to the books; I saw him enter this sum the night he was arrested, and he copied the other cash-book up from the rough one - I saw him enter it in both, because the other book was not made up; I insisted on his making it up, as the books were much behind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was it his duty to enter it first in the rough cash-book? A. Yes, and to pay the money over to the cash-keeper, and get his acknowledgement for it immediately.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WATTS. I deal with Mr. Nunn, and owed him 46l., which I paid to the prisoner on the 13th of June, and took this memorandum from him; I saw him write it- (read, "By bill and cash, 46l, 
               <persName id="t18300114-59-person515">R. C. </persName>
            Norris); Mr. Nunn applied to me about this in December - I gave the prisoner a 30l. bill, due on the 29th of July, which unfortunately was not paid; he brought it back to me himself the day after it was due, and I gave him the money - I gave him part of the 16l. in cash.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He signed his name to your account, which could be produced at any time? A. Exactly so; I live within thirty yards of Mr. Nunn.</p>
               <p>MR. NUNN. The prisoner never brought me that bill.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody - I asked how he accounted for the absence of the money; he said he had parted with it by lending it to people, and treating people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Had that cash-book been produced I should have satisfied your Lordship the amount I am accused of entering on the Saturday night was posted, as the marginal folio in the book will prove - I have never concealed nor disguised any thing; he asked me, in a friendly manner, to tea, the day he took me, and treated me like a brother - I entered the sum about the time I ought to have entered it; the cash-book would clearly prove it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. NUNN. Q. Is this a copy of the notice served on you? A. I believe it is - I conceived this to be the book required, but I will send for the cashbook.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. The entry in the cash-book would be made by the prisoner from the rough book. [The witness fetched the fair cash-book, and then continued his evidence.] Here is the cash-book.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there a ledger? A. Yes, that is at the counting-house; there are entries here to Watts; I have never seen the ledger myself - I have nothing to do with it; here is "Folio 119;" I do not know what that means - I never refer to the ledger, except to ascertain if a person should be trusted further.</p>
               <p>MR. NUNN. I said I saw this entry made on Saturday night, and tell you candidly, from seeing this, that I have said wrong - it was another entry, a little further, on which you will see; I have said nothing intentionally wrong; I saw him make a quantity of entries, and conceived this was one, but there were a great many sums he had appropriated to his own purpose - I am not now perfectly satisfied that I am wrong, but I see this folio there, by which I presume it was posted prior to that; I cannot tell whether I am right or wrong, for there are five or six entries without a folio, some before and some after that, and those entries were put down on that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has the money been paid to you? A. It never has.</p>

            . I heard of the fire in Drury-lane, and went towards it; I looked about some time, and then went to Leicester-square, where I saw the prisoner with his hands in his pockets and no hat on - I asked where his hat was; he said he did not know - I then felt his pockets and found this book; I asked what it was - he said "Only a pocketbook," but it proved to be the Amulet; in his other pockets I found these other four books - this was about six o'clock on the Sunday morning; the fire was on the Saturday night - I took him to the watch-house, and, on searching him, I found this leaf of one of the books in his trousers' pocket; it has the prosecutrix's name on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found he had lost his hat? A. Yes; he appeared to be flurried and as if he had been exerting himself - I think he had been drinking; I had not seen him at the fire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking at the Cheshire Cheese, a practice to which I am quite unaccustomed; I heard of the fire, and exerted myself in saving the things - I was much excited; I have no recollection of putting the books into my pocket, and I suppose I put them there to bring down some other property, and forgot to take them out.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAREY. I am a boot-maker. I saw the fire, and saw the prisoner particularly active in bringing out a great deal of property, which he deposited in my shop, just opposite - he brought a great deal over: one was a glass jug, which I should think was more valuable than these books; he did not appear quite sober - I do not know that he lost his hat; he seemed very quick, and anxious about the goods- he came to my house with a friend after twelve o'clock, and his coat was very much burnt with the burning lead which fell from the roof; I had not known him before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ACTON. I was assisting at the fire; I went with the prisoner - he was very active in extinguishing the fire; he was in a great state of excitement, and I think it likely he might have put some of these books into his pocket without remembering it - he exposed himself to greater danger than I was disposed to do; I saw the lead fall upon his coat, and warned him of his danger - he said,"The devil a bit do I care about it;" he might have concealed female apparel and other things.</p>
               <p>COURT to ANDERSON. Q. Did he say how he came by the books? A. He said he had bought them on Saturday night; I am sorry I did not mention that before - he said he bought four of them in Drury-lane, and the other in the Strand; he appeared in a great stupor.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he appear in such a state as not to know what he was doing? A.He did.</p>

On the 6th of January, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the evening, Mr. Murray told me this bacon was taken; I then looked and missed it - it weighed about twenty-four or twenty-five pounds; I had left it safe on the bacon-board in the shop when I went into my parlour - I saw it again, and can swear it is mine; it corresponds in every respect - I know the cut of it; this cut was in it at the time; it was in two pieces, as it is now.</p>
               <p>DAVID MURRAY.

               <p>Williams. Q. Yes you did the first time, and then the second time you said I went into the shop. A.Certainly not, but while the clerk was taking down the examination they changed places, and I had not known their names before - it was Williams went and took it; I am quite positive, and he gave it to Wood.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH NORMAN. I am a labourer, and live at Waterford, near Hertford. On the 12th of October, about seven or half-past seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner offered me two coats for sale - one was a box coat, and the other a market frock coat: I had not money enough to buy them, and he tied them up in his bundle - he took out some bills belonging to Mr. James Dickinson; I had known the coats, as I had seen Mr. Dickinson wear them - I saw Mr. Dickinson about three days afterwards, and told him: I did not read the bills, and cannot say what was on them -I saw no marks on the coats, but the large one was a box coat, a kind of snuff colour; I do not know how many capes it had - it was not new, but it was a good one: I cannot tell whether the collar was velvet or silk - it was the same colour as the coat; I cannot say whether the pockets were inside or out - it was a smooth coat and had an edging round it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Could you swear to that coat from among half a dozen others? A. Yes, I could - I did not notice whether there were any buttons to the sleeves; there were no straps.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the other coat? A. It was a fustian market coat, smooth, like a drover's; I could pick them both out.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON re-examined. Q. What was the colour of the big coat? A. It was a drab; I cannot be positive whether it was bound round or not - it had not a velvet collar: the other was a fustian frock, which I generally wear, with four or five capes to it; the prisoner was out of the way for some time - Norman did live next door to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAMP. I am an officer of Edmonton. I took up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140048"/>the prisoner at Enfield fair, the last day of November - he was here last Session, but he was not tried; I did not know about the coats when I took him - but the prosecutor told me of it in about an hour: I then asked the prisoner, and he said he knew nothing about them: he lived with the prosecutor three or four years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Dickinson saw me several times - he saw me at Kingston fair.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON. Yes, I had seen him, but was a great distance from him - I never saw him near me after I lost the coats.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him before you knew the coats were gone? A.Perhaps I might - I missed my coats one morning, and the same day the witness told me of it; the two horse-cloths were taken to a shop and sold.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH NORMAN. I did say something of that sort when they kept bothering me - I do not know whether I said any thing about his knocking me about; I might or I might not.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DODSON. I heard Norman say to the prisoner, after he had been before Mr. Mores, when the prisoner looked in his face and said, "Joe, you know you have foresworn me" - "I know it, but it is because you hit me; but never mind, when I come up I will not hurt a hair of your head:" I said to Jeffkins the officer, "Do you hear that?" and he said, "No, I did not;" Norman gave him sixpence and I said, "If you have foresworn you ought to have your head knocked off;" he said he would make a flaw in the indictment.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH NORMAN re-examined. He said something of that kind, but I did not say "I know I have;" I cannot say justly what I said - I kept telling them not to bother me; I do not think I said I would make a flaw in the indictment, and that I would not hurt a hair of his head.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. About ten days previous to last September a circumstance took place in which they attempted to implicate me in taking eleven sovereigns and a watch -I found the person who had been guilty of it; I advised him to return, but he would not - I then promised that I would take it all upon myself; I wrote a letter to my mother-in-law, stating that I had eight sovereigns and a half, and if they would send to me I would deliver them up - a Bow-street officer accompanied them, and took me; I was in confinement, and when I went into society again I could get no situation - I had one hundred and four guineas a year in my former situation; I had discharged some men for drunkenness, and they took this opportunity of injuring me - I am guilty of this crime, but previous I had been like Caesar's wife, beyond suspicion; I told the officer that I sought for transportation, as I was miserable - happiness is the pursuit of every man, and I must seek it through the means of transportation.</p>

               <p>JOHN CLARK. On Saturday, the 26th of December, I went with the prisoner to a house in <placeName id="t18300114-77-crimeloc426">George-street, St. Giles'</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the watch, and that he knows; he gave me a penny to go and buy a candle when the candle went out; and when he came out of the public-house he began fighting with two men. Witness. There was no fighting - I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>DAVID CLYDE. I met Clark as I was going to a tobacco-shop, and took him to a public-house to treat him with a quartern of gin; when I came out he did not come out - I looked, and saw him talking to the prisoner and some other girls - he afterwards came out; the prisoner came out and called to him to go with her - this was at the corner of Crown-street, at the bottom of Tottenham-court-road - he was sober; he came to me on the Tuesday following, and said the girl I saw him with had taken his watch from him; I said I would look for her; I afterwards saw the prisoner dressed differently to what she was that night; I went to her and said, "If you will give me the duplicate, I will let you go;" she said she would give it me; I went to her house - I would not go up stairs, I said I would wait - I waited, but she did not come down; I described her to the Police-man - he went in and took her.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SIMMONS. Clyde told me to take the prisoner - I asked if his friend would come forward - he said he did not know, but he came again in two hours and said his friend would; I found her next day from the description, and took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On boxing-night the prosecutor was with four women talking in the street - he came over and asked if I would have any thing to drink - he took me to Mr. Clark's, and there we drank for about two hours; when we came out, a young Irishman and the prosecutor began fighting - I took him away - he said he would go home with me all night - I said I would take him to a house, and he gave me a penny to get a candle; I went out - there was a piece of work in the street, and two girls were taken to the watch-house; I went with them - I never saw this watch.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JONES. I was sent for, and found the five thimbles loose in the prisoner's pocket - the box has not been found; there was nothing found upon the other person who was with her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I live in Titchfield-street. I went to a raffle on the 7th of December, and had a cloak, which I put over a bedstead up - it was in a poor person's room; the bed was turned up - I saw the made prisoner there; this is my cloak - I partly made it myself, and know my own work; the woman was not there - the man returned a little before eleven o'clock, and that excited my suspicion.</p>

            . I saw this witness at the raffle, and put the cloak over the bed, at half-past nine o'clock; the male prisoner came, took the cloak, and wrapped it up - I said, "What are you going to do with that?" he said, "Nothing, but keep it clean, and out of harm;" he afterwards pulled his coat off, and put that by the side of the bed - he went away about eleven o'clock, and put the coat under his arm; I did not see him take the cloak with him.</p>

            . I met the prisoner Williams near Temple-bar, on the 13th of December, and she asked me to walk with her - we went together to a house; as soon as I got in I was frightened, and wanted to get out, but she would not let me - she pushed me up stairs, and asked me for 1s.; she then pushed me into another room, and asked what money I had - I gave her 5s. 6d.; she said I had two sovereigns and a watch, and she would have them-she got me into another room, shut the shutters and the door, and began to knock me about: I tried to call out, but she would not let me - the male prisoner then came into the room; she said I had two sovereigns - he then asked for my money; I put the two sovereigns into my hat, and the man took my hat from me - they both then came round me, and took my pencil-case from me; the man got my hat from me and knocked me down - he called another woman and told her to take my clothes off, but as she came in I made my escape: I got my hat and the sovereigns - I went down and found the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You met the female prisoner, You say, at Temple-bar? A. Yes; there was no dispute between her and me as to the terms when we got to the house - I was sober; she demanded is. in the room she first pushed me into - I gave it her; she did not tell Smith that I had two sovereigns and a watch belonging to her; I did not before say that I had only lost 2s. - I did not lose my sovereigns, my hat, nor my watch; I did not give them sixpence to fetch gin - there was some gin brought in, and they wanted to drink; I know the landlord of the Angel inn - I never sent him to settle this if they would give me 5l.; I did not go back to the house and say if they would give me the 5s. I should be satisfied- I gave this 5s. 6d. to the woman because she asked for it.</p>
               <p>Williams. I met him close by the Angel inn, and he had another young man, named Thomas, with him, who lodged at the Red Lion; the prosecutor said his mistress had turned him away from his place at a moment's warning, and he asked me for a lodging - I said I had known persons get lodgings at the Angel, and he went there and got a lodging at 6d. per night: on the Sunday night I met him again, and he said he would treat me - he went with me to this house, and gave me a shilling, which I took to the landlord; he then gave me sixpence, and I got a quarter, and half of gin - he said he was cold, and I took him into a room where there was a fire - he then gave me 3s.; which he took out of a sunff-box; he was with me for an hour and a half, and wished me to stay the remainder of the evening - I said I could not, and he wished to get the money out of my hand again, knocked me down, and tried to wrench it out of my hand; he then opened the door and ran down stairs - his hat fell off, and the landlord took it up and said, "Here is your hat;" I never saw a bit of gold about him. Witness. I did not try for wrench the money from her - I wanted to leave the house; I took up my hat in the room and the sovereigns were in it - I snatched them out, and then he took my hat and threw it down - my watch was in my fob, and my fob was twisted.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Are you subject to fits? A. I had one fit once, but I had none at that time; I fainted in the officer's arms.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140054"/>night of the 13th of December I was in Crown-court, and heard a cry of Watch! - I ran up the lane and saw this young man bleeding very much at the month; he said, "I have been very ill used in this house," pointing to No. 6, Little Shire-lane - I took him into the house, and the moment he got in he fainted away: he said Smith and Williams had both ill-used him - there was no pencil-case found; I accused Williams of being with him, and she turned her back to the fire, and dropped a shilling into it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many public-houses have you been in this morning? A. I do not know - I was as sober then as I am now, and as sober now as I was then.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the blood on the prosecutor's face appear to be fresh? A. Yes, he was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Williams' Defence. The prosecutor brought in this Police-man and gave charge; I said I was willing to go with him - I had 1s. in my hand; I said the gentleman had given me 5s.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. On that Sunday evening I was sitting by the fire, reading the paper; the prosecutor had been in the house above an hour, and I heard a noise, and went up stairs, but it was all over and the prosecutor was coming towards the door - his hat was lying in the door-way: I asked what was the matter - he made no answer, but went out and brought in the Police-man; he then asked me if I would give him the 5s. which he gave the girl - I said I knew nothing about that, what he gave her she might keep; he then fell down on the stairs, and I ordered the servant to get a chair - his mouth was covered with blood; I called for towel and water to wash his face - the inside of his top lip was cut; the Police-man said, "He has got a watch," and he was putting it into his fob - the prosecutor jumped up and said, "I have got two sovereigns also;" he again asked me if I would give him 5s. - I said No; he then said he would give me and the girl in charge or illusing him - one of the Police-men asked if he had been robbed; he said, No, he had given the girl the 5s., and the shilling which he knew was to pay for the room, and 6d. for the gin, and in going out at the door he offered one of them 2s. to see him home, which they refused - in half an hour they returned and took me; nothing was said about a pencil-case at Bow-street, but only extorting 5s. by threats.</p>

            . re-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor tell you, in the first place, that he had been robbed both by a man and a woman? A. Yes, and had been very much ill-used: he did mention about the pencil-case at Bow-street - there was another officer with me; he did go away from the house, and afterwards return with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you not take the prisoners into custody in the first instance? A.

Take greatest care of, and put it under lock and key when you reach home. I will give you a shilling, Whatever you do, do not disappoint. I have something in view I think will be a great advantage to you; can say nothing till Sunday evening, when I hope to come for an hour or two. Excuse me, last Sunday I was an hour behind time. I shall have my kitchen window open, which faces the front of the street, because there if one side goes up Charles-street. Do not knock, I will look out for you. I wish you could make it convenient to go up west end between this and Sunday, to ascertain if that person has left, if you find he has, ask for the cook, and make all inquiries you can when he went, and further add, his wife sent you, then you will be able to judge for me. I must see him, but do not tell her so. Pray go if you can, and I will pay you. Also the parcel belongs to him, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140055"/>am in fear he will find me out, for his brother see me cleaning the door-way yesterday. I am determined he shall not have it.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GEORGE BREAVINGTON. I am a labourer. I have known the prisoner seven or eight months - I received this letter, which I believe came from her; I gave information to Thomas, and he took the measures he has stated - I received the parcel containing these spoons from the prisoner at the kitchen window, in Long-acre; I gave the letter to Mr. Thomas.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness persuaded me to do it on the Sunday evening, when I called at his house.</p>

Smith said Yes - I said, "I have plenty that will fit her;" they said they would wait till next day, and they both left the shop - soon afterwards, I missed three pairs of stays from the corner of the window which Smith had been standing near; the officer afterwards brought the stays to my shop - I had never seen the prisoners before; McCollin offered me a bribe, which I refused.</p>

            . I am a newsman, and live nearly opposite the prosecutor. On this night week I saw the prisoner and five others parading before his door, and watching his house - I watched; one of them went into the house and bought a candle, and when he came out he put it into his pocket, and buttoned it up - the prisoner then went into the shop, and bought a candle; he came out with that in his hand, and this bundle of wax candles under his arm -I went and asked him where he got them; he said he had been in the shop and bought them - I took him, and the the others all ran off.</p>

               <p>EDWARD ALEWOOD. I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner, and have the candles.</p>
               <p>MR. FREEMAN. These are my candles, and are all marked; I was in the shop, and served the candles - I missed this parcel about five minutes after they left.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The candles were taken in Leicester-square, and I was taken near St. Martin's church.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was it? A.Half-past six o'clock in the evening; I had never seen the prisoner before - he was in the shop about five minutes; I have always said I knew his person - I did not say at the Police-office that I thought he was like the man; I am quite sure he is the man - he only asked me two questions; he was there about three minutes.</p>

On the 1st of October, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I saw Brown coming from westward - he made a communication to me: I went to Lieutenant Warren, the commanding officer, who sent me and Brown westward to see about a boat - it was about half-past one; as I came within twenty or thirty yards of No. 55 tower, I saw a party of men coming over the full of the beach - there might be forty or fifty, or more; they were on the highest part of the beach, coming from the land side, with bats in their hands, some six or seven feet long, and some shorter - they are sticks; they sung out, "Here are the bl - y b - g - rs," and rushed towards us, lifting up their bats in the air - the nearest of them was within ten yards of us; I fired my pistol at them, expecting to be knocked down every moment - I retreated rather back, and as I fired a second pistol I received a blow which cut me down: the pistol went off as they hit me on the crown of my hat with one of their bats - I then received another blow in the eye, which knocked me down; I had a scuffle, and they took one of my pistols from me, but I got clear of them - I received several blows from them, about my body and thigh; my eye was swollen: I retreated eastward and met Sullivan coming to my assistance - I told him the smugglers had got Brown down then, and beating him; he was singing out - a great many of them were then in chase of me and were within ten yards of me; Sullivan fired his musket in among them, and they knocked him down - they stopped with him; I loaded my pistol and discharged it in among them - they followed me again: I retreated, and they turned on 
               <persName id="t18300114-111-person804">Brown</persName>
             a second time, and I followed them- they got round the tower, No. 55, and fell in with Campbell, who was coming out; I fired six rounds with my pistol - then they went towards a farm-house, and I saw no more of them; Brown was bleeding and cut about the head - next morning, about seven or eight o'clock, I went with Lieutenant Warren and some men to the prisoner's house, and inquired for him; he was denied - after coming out of the house his wife came out presently, and made across the field to the Star public house; our people ran a-head of her, and got into the Star before her - the prisoner and six more were drinking inside there; he tried to get out at the back door to escape with the rest, but a man named Pinner seized him at the door - we had said nothing of what we came about; we were dressed as preventive men - he was taken to No. 55, tower; there was blood on his smock-frock, and I believe there was a little drop of blood on his trousers; it seemed fresh - it was a clear star light morning. I observed a kind of round circle at the end of one of the bats, but could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time did you see these men coming over the beach? A. I suppose between two and three o'clock - I was twenty or thirty yards from them; I saw the boat afterwards, about one hundred and fifty yards west of No. 55 - she was beached to the extreme of No. 55 station; the men were not coming as if from there - I saw nothing doing about the boat; I went to it next morning - there was nothing in it; it was the Dove, of Rye - the nearest men were ten yards from me when I fired; they were nearly together with their bats lifted - I do not know that their bats would hit me at that distance; a blow came on me as I fired the second time - I heard of nobody being killed or wounded from my firing; there is a canal close to the back door of the Star - he was going out at the back door as we entered; he could get away without going over the canal, he could get over a field - the blood on his frock appeared fresh; it was on the bosom, a small quantity; it ran down in a little thin stream - we have the frock and trousers here; he had a short frock on under the one I took off - the night was clear enough to distinguish one man from another.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPPARD. Q. When they were ten yards from you on the beach were they standing still? A. No, running towards me - they came up and knocked me down: I produce the frock.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. On the 2nd of October, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I was near the Martello tower, and saw some persons coming over the full of the beach, with bats in their hands, which they held up, and said, "Come up you b - g - rs;" Ellis was with me - they rushed down upon us off the full, holding their bats up, and as they were coming towards me I discharged my pistol - they could not be above six yards off me at the time, and their bats were raised; after I fired they knocked the pistol out of my hand with a blow of a bat on my arm - they knocked me down with a blow on my left side, and beat me very severely, and while I was on the ground they jumped on me, and hurt me severely; it made me insensible - when I recovered both my pistols were gone; I think I should know one of the men who appeared on the full: I thought the prisoner was one of them, but I did not know him at the time - I went towards my own tower; Campbell came to my assistance - there was a lot of men round the tower, and away to the west; I saw Campbell afterwards - he had been beat - it was a star-light night; there was light enough to know an acquaintance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near should you know an acquaintance? A. At the distance they were from me, six or eight yards. There might be about thirty men; I think it was nearer three o'clock than two - we keep time by watches - it might be half-past two, to the best of my opinion; I was the first man that was knocked down -I cannot tell whether Ellis fired; the mail generally passes our station between two and three o'clock - I do not know whether is had passed that night.</p>

            . I am on the preventive-service, and was stationed on this night between towers Nos. 54 and 55; I heard a firing between two and three o'clock - went towards it, and met Ellis coming along the fall of the beach, and a party of between fifty and sixty men, armed with bats, running after him; as soon as I came up I fired my musket at them: Stubberfield and two more of the party then came down, armed with bats, and struck me - five or six more then came down and joined them, they struck me altogether, knocked me down, and took my arms from me - they beat me; I saw another man among them whom I know, he is not in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were fifty or sixty men? A. Yes; I suppose they were the same party as were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140060"/>engaged with Brown - they were running after Ellis when I came up; I am sure there were more than twenty or thirty; as soon as the prisoner came within three yards of me I knew him; I was struck immediately; I saw him just as he was coming down upon me - I was quite positive about him - that was the only opportunity I had of observing him.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been positive about one Stonestreet? A. I swore to the best of my knowledge he was one of the men - he was taken into custody - but I never did swear positively to him; he was in custody three or four days; I believe when I told the Magistrate I could not swear to him plump and plain he was discharged; I had known him about two months; I only said, that to the best of my knowledge he was there; I said from the first that I could not be certain of him; I have known the prisoner nine months, and saw him often - I was well acquainted with his face and appearance, and am quite certain he is one of the men - I have always said so.</p>
               <p>JAMES CAMPBELL. On the night between the 1st and 2nd of October I was employed on the preventive-service at the Martello tower, No. 55 - between two and three o'clock I heard Brown's wife sing out that her husband was being murdered, and immediately after I heard a firing; I got up, put part of my clothes on, and went out with my musket and pistol, to his assistance; I saw a great number of men about the tower - when I came down the ladder Brown was standing alongside, and the men laying on him; I tried to fire my musket, but it would not go off - I tried to reach over to hit them, but their bats were so long it would not reach them; I immediately fired my pistol - a man hit me over the shoulder and struck me with a bat; I seized a man who struck me with a bat, and who I take to be Stubberfield - we struggled some time as I seized his bat, and tried to take it from him; they gathered before and behind, and knocked me down against the man's breast who I suppose to be Stubberfield, and beat me most dreadfully - Stubberfield is the man; my head was cut - blood gushed out of my head befored I fell against him - I was knocked down and heat dreadfully; when I was down I think Stubberfield is the man that said "Come off, he is dead enough now;" he called them off, and they all ran over a stile; since that I have heard the prisoner speak, when I was laying in the hospital, and believed him to be the man - he was brought to the hospital to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who brought him there? A. I think it was the Quarter-master; another young man was in custody with him. Whose name, I think, was Tysart - he was quite a small man, not so big as the prisoner; I heard the other man speak, but paid no attention to what he said - they were brought to the hospital to be examined - there was a Justice there; I had no knowledge of the prisoner before that night - I know him by his size and speech; I only heard him say "He is dead enough, come off;" I dare say sixty or seventy men were about me at that time - they were all making a noise; I had one wound before I pitched my head in the bosom of the man - I got the other afterwards; the first wound was not so very bad - blood came out - there was not a considerable deal of blood - it ran down all parts of me.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPPARD. Q. You fell down at the foot of the man? A. I fell on his breast - I was lying down close to him when I heard him say those words - the prisoner's voice struck me at the hospital.</p>

            . In October I was in the employ of the preventive-service, and in command of the party at the tower, 53; I sent Ellis, and Brown on duty to watch for smuggling cutters - there was an alarm that night, and next morning, in consequence of information from Sullivan, I went to Stubberfield's house, and inquired for him, but did not find that he was at home; it was about six o'clock - I did not look at my watch; I saw his wife going towards the Star public-house, and ordered the party to go on, and get before her- I went and saw the prisoner coming out of the Star, in custody of one of the people I had sent; Campbell and Sullivan were under my command that night, employed to prevent smuggling; when the prisoner was apprehended I observed blood about his frock, some on his breast, and some on his trousers behind - the blood on the breast appeared to be fresh. I was an officer on full pay at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure it was as early as six o'clock when you got to the Star, for Ellias says it was eight? A. To the best of my recollection it was about six - it was clear day-light; it might have been half - past six - I cannot swear to the time.</p>

I was looking out of window on the night, between the 1st and 2nd of October, about three o'clock, as I heard a firing; I saw a party of people coming along the road from the sea; they passed my house, and appeared to have something on their backs - I do not know what it was, as it was dark; I supposed it to be tubs, but am not certain - I guess there were one hundred people, but cannot tell; a good many of them had something on their backs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you undertake to swear there was as tab on any one man's back? A.

            . I am surgeon of this division of the coast blockade. On the morning of the 2nd of October, I attended Sullivan, Ellis, Brown, and Campbell - Campbell was injured the severest; he had two wounds on his head - one about an inch long; his left arm, and shoulder were severly contused and swollen - his back and thigh severly bruised; Ellis had a wound in his left check bone- Brown was severly bruised over his left shoulder, arm, and thing; Sullivan was wounded over his left shoulder and thigh - I conceive them to be such wounds as might be inflicted by bats; the wound on the back of Campbell's head put on an unpleasant appearance- that was the only serious wound; he was confined to his bed about ten days, and ill about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were Campbell's wounds?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140061"/>A. On the left side of the bone, at the back of the head, and he had one small wound at the left side.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were his severe wounds? A. The one on the back of the head was a severe wound - danger was to be apprehended from the wounds on the head, but there was no apparent danger; dangerous symptoms often follow a wound in the head - no one dangerous symptom presented itself in this case.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a long written. Defence, avowing himself a smuggler, and stating that at ten o'clock, on the night in question, he arrived off Pervensey-sluice, in a boat from Bolougne, having a few things attached by slings to stones, as sinkers, and had cut his thumb in the act of cutting off some of the sinkers; having got his goods ashore, he conveyed them to Hooe; that in the morning he found he had torn his trousers, and having but a short frock, he borrowed the one he was apprehended in, in order to cover his torn trousers. [The remainder of his defence will be seen by the following evidence.]</p>

             I live at Sluice, in the parish of Bexhill, and am a carpenter. On the 1st of October, at ten o'clock at night, the prisoner called on me at my house, and in consequence of what he said, I went over the beach, and found something tied on a line to sinkers, which are heavy stones; we cut the sinkers off - Hammond, Quife, and Stonestreet were there; the prisoner was over the back of the beach - we met a cart out in the marsh, at Chapel-bridge, about a mile from Sluice, and put these things into it; we all four returned, and the prisoner went away in the cart, about one o'clock in the morning, going towards Hooe, which is about two miles from Chapel-bridge; it is about four miles from No. 55, tower.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from the sluice is Chapel-bridge? A. A mile - the things might be twenty rods from my house; we were from ten till one o'clock about this.</p>

            . On the night of the 1st of October, Hammond called me - I went over to the sluice, to the water, found some things there, and carried them away; they were tied to sinkers - we carried them to Chapel-bridge, which is about a mile from the water-side; I went twice - there were four of us - we all carried the things over the beach; then Hammond went for the cart, which we put the things into, at Chapel-bridge, and I went home - the prisoner got into the cart; it was then about one o'clock - a lad named Samuel Freeman, went with him in the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was your object to get the work done as quick as possible? A. Yes; there was no particular hurry - we walked as quick as we could; we carried the things part of the way first, then went and got the rest - we hid them down over the beach, and took part of them to Chapel-bridge - the cart had not come; we then fetched the rest - the cart had not come then; I waited till it came, and as soon as the things were put in I went home - the prisoner got in, and went away with Freeman; I looked at my watch, and could see that it was one o'clock - Stubberfield asked me what o'clock it was; the house clock struck one just as I was called - I looked at my watch at Chapel-bridge; I had no lantern - it was dark, but I managed to see the time; it was not very star-light, but light enough for that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Did you hold your watch very close to your eyes to see the time? A. Yes, very - we carried the things a little way first, because we wanted to get the others away, as we did not think any body would find them over the beach.</p>
               <p>NIMROD STONESTREET. I live at the sluice. On the 1st of October Hammond called me up - I went over the beach after some things; I do not know what they were - we got fifteen; there were five men - Pearce, Hammond, Stubberfield, Quife, and myself; the things were on a line on the surface of the water - some stones were attached to the line; we carried them up the marsh, just beyond the Star and hid them, and after that carried them on to the marsh into Chapel-bridge - there was a cart there; Freeman and Hammond were with it - Freeman and the prisoner went away in it a few minutes after one o'clock; 1 know that, for Quife had a watch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who brought the cart? A. Hammond and Freeman - I first saw the prisoner about ten o'clock on the beach; Pearce was with him - I swear I could not tell what was in the things; Stubberfield stood back on the land side of the beach - I knew where he was all the time; I am sure he was there all the time, from ten o'clock to one; he did not go away - we found the things on the beach.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Though you do not know what the things were, perhaps you had a pretty good guess? A. Yes; when I first saw the prisoner he had a short frock on, a hat, and trousers.</p>

On the night of the 1st of October Hammond came to my father's for me to get the horse and cart - I went with it to Chapel-bridge, which is between three and four miles from Hooe; when I got there I saw the prisoner and other men - they put some things into my cart; the prisoner came away with me to Hooe in the cart - it was then about one o'clock; when we got to my father's, he asked for some cold bread and meat, which we gave him; he then asked if he could sleep in our stable - we told him he could not, because there were two horses there and it was very dirty; he went away - this was near two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had gone to bed when they first called you? A. Yes; it was then about twelve o'clock - I am not certain of the time; it was a green cart, and one that drives quick - I did not drive very fast; I was more than half an hour going to Chapel-bridge - I found these men there with the things on getting there; they were put into the cart, and I drove off directly - the cart was left at our house with the things - Stubberfield lives about a mile from Chapel-bridge; I drove part of the way, and Stubberfield the rest - I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140062"/>not know at what time we left Chapel-bridge; I did not hear any body say what o'clock it was: if they had I think I must have heard them - we were altogether; I did not stay there above a minute or two - they merely put the things in, and then went off.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Might a man ask what o'clock it was without your hearing? A. Yes; they were sometimes apart; I was minding the cart - there is a parish road from Chapel-bridge to our house; the prisoner was dressed in a short frock, which came down to his waist - he had nothing over that.</p>

            . I keep the Red Lion at Hooe, and am a butcher. I have supplied the preventive-service with a few things, but not for these two months, or more; I had no contract for them. On the morning of the 2nd of October, I saw the prisoner, at two o'clock, at my house - I knew him before; he had a bed there, and I saw him at half-past five o'clock in the morning; I had locked the doors, and bolted them after showing him to bed - I was the first that got up in the morning; he came down at half-past five, and asked me to lend him a frock- before that I had been and called him; I found him asleep; I lent him a frock, as he had a very short one on- I did not know why he wanted me to lend him one; I believe it was longer than his own - the one I lent him was dirty; I had used it several times when I killed cattle - the one produced is what I lent him; I expect to find blood on it - I certainly expected to find it dirtier than what it is; here is a patch on the sleeve, which I know it by - when I heard the prisoner was in custody, I had business with Lieutenant Warren, and mentioned the prisoner's case to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you lend the frock to him? A. About six o'clock, within a few minutes of that time; he was not in possession of it before six - I expected there was more blood on it than I find, as I frequently kill in it; he did not leave his short frock with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How do you know when this was? A. I am in the habit of keeping accounts, and write the day of the month every day; I cannot remember whether he knocked at my door, or came in - I was not gone to bed; I had some friends smoking, and they had just left - if I had been in bed I should have got up to accommodate him; my house is two miles from Chapel-bridge, or perhaps more; I cannot say, for it is a road I never frequent - he did not come to my house to change his dress at one o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How far is it from your house to No. 55 tower? A. Between four and five miles, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

            . I keep the Star. The prisoner was taken at my house; he had come in, and had a pint of porter - he had cut his thumb, and wiped it on his trousers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did he first come in? A.About seven o'clock - I think about a quarter to seven; my house is about three miles, or three and a half from Hooe; I went to the bar to get a bit of rag for his thumb, and while I was gone the preventive-men came and took him - he did not attempt to run away; he came into my room to have the rag put on.</p>

On the 24th of December I saw this cloak moving from my shop, but did not see the face of the person who took it; an alarm was given - I ran out, and caught sight of the prisoner about ten yards off; he was looking round - he then ran down Jewry-street, and was stopped without my losing sight of him; I saw him throw something from under his arm, which turned out to be the cloak - I laid hold of him the moment he was stopped, and the cloak was brought to the watch-house; it hung on a line just within the door; he made a great resistance, struck me, and kicked my shins - he struck my son, and injured him very much; he was unable to lift his arm for two or three days.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mansion-house. I took the prisoner in Martin's-lane, Thames-street, and told him the charge was taking a watch out of a water-closet in Size-lane, the day previous: he denied all knowledge of it, and said he lived at No. 14, Brook-street, Walworth-road, but afterwards said No. 5, Chiswell-street, Camberwell, and gave his name Smith - as I came from the Compter he told me his name was Hammond, and that I had mistaken him in saying his name was Smith: I went to Chiswell-street, found his wife next day, and asked her for the duplicate of the watch her husband gave her the night before, and she gave me this: when I was going to lock him up after the examination, he said, "To tell you the truth, I have got the watch, and it is pledged in the Walworth-road," but he could not exactly tell where.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not add that he had found it? A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence, stating that he found the watch in the privy, and was not aware he was committing felony. He received a good character.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BROWN. I am a carman. I stood at the corner of College-hill, between six and seven o'clock that evening: I did not see the waggon, but heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned round out of our stable-door, and saw two men running - I stopped one of them, which was the prisoner; he had nothing then - Passey came up with the box in a minute or two, and charged him with stealing it; the prisoner wished to be let go, saying he had flogged him enough for it with the whip.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I was not the man at the Mansion-house. Witness. I said no such thing: I said I thought he had a different dress on then, but was certain he was the man; I was not certain he was the man I stopped.</p>

               <p>JOHN HANHAM. I am an officer. I took the prisoner - she said she had disposed of the fire-irons, but said nothing about the tea-canister; she told me of several shops, which I went to, but could not find them; I took this apron from the prisoner, which the prosecutrix claimed.</p>

I never saw the man;" I said, "You slept with him last night" - she denied it; I then searched her, and found this watch wrapped up in a handkerchief in her bosom; she then said some woman gave it to her.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CRISPIN. This man and woman came to my house and had the lodging - the man paid 1s. for it; I afterwards found the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave it me at seven o'clock on Saturday night, and told me to pawn it - he said he had no money; I said I would not, as he was drunk, and might make away with the duplicate; he might come on Monday and have it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What office was it at? A.Marylebone, before Mr. Rawlinson - we had a six month's character with the woman - she was very much agitated; she hung her head, and would give no answer - the man was complaining of the Police-men</p>
               <p>THOMAS YOUNG. I am a Police-constable. On the morning of the 13th of December I was in St. John's-wood-road, on a bit of waste ground, and saw Hutchinson with a basket; I asked what was in it - he said a gown and two petticoats, which belonged to his sister; I let him go, and in about an hour he came back - he saw me and my comrade: he called out, "I have a bigger load now than I had before: why don't you come now and search me?" I said, "We will search you," and we found the property stated in the basket - this was about two miles and a half from the prosecutor's; he then said these things were in the basket when I saw it first - I said, "You may as well tell me I am a liar at once;" he said, "You are. and a d-d liar" - we took him to the section-house, and then to the prosecutor; he told me at half-past five in the morning, when I first saw him, that he was going there, and that his sister lived there, and we went there with him about seven - I rang the bell, and Eaton came to the gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he called you to look into his basket? A. Yes; I should not have touched him if he had not called us - I have been in the army, but never went by any name but Young; I had met my comrade in the cross-road, but had not told him of this - we went together with the prisoner to the section-house: he carried the basket, and I took the prisoner - I told the serjeant this story, and asked him to go with us; I did not ask him for any thing to drink, nor did Staines, I swear; nor for any money for any drink, nor for 5s. - Staines did not ask him for money to let him go; I was in the 12th Royal Lancers - I did not know the male prisoner before; I never saw him to my knowledge - I was not with him that I know of; I did not know Staines abroad - he tells me he did belong to the 10th Hussars, but I did not know him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STAINES. On the morning of the 13th of December, I saw Hutchinson at the corner of Grove-end-road; he hailed my brother-officer, and said, "I have a heavier load than I had before, you had better come and search me" - he was standing still; I took up his basket, took it to the lamp, and saw what it was - he then abused us, and said he had it given him where he worked, and they had been in his cupboard for the rabbits; I said, "We had better take him to our place and let our serjeant see him; and while we were at the section-house he offered us gin, and we refused to take it - when the serjeant came, he said he had been to Kilburn-place to Mr. Dickinson's, to take some things to his sister; we asked him where he got the things in his basket - he said they were there before, and my comrade said they were not; he went with us to the place - he put his finger to the bell, and said, "This is the house;" Eaton came out, and said she would not open the gate, and she could not call Mr. Dickinson - I said I would call him if she would let me in; the other servant went to call him - Hutchinson was very abusive; he said he took these things to his sister, because she could not eat the bread in the house - I did not hear him say where he brought them from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never parted company with them? A.No; I heard all he said - I did not hear him mention any market where he bought the things; my comrade was present in the section-room when he offered us gin - he was quite a stranger to me - I did not know a man in the artillery of the name of Walker; I never went by that name - I went by the name of Payne in the 10th Hussars, because I ran away from my friends; I was in the artillery when a boy, by the name of Staines - my uncle bought me out; I was in Portugal in the 10th Hussars - I do not recollect a town there called Mellor; I was discharged on the reducement; I swear I did not know the prisoner in the army.</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. Q. Were you never in Captain Blackwell's troop? A. No never in my life; I did not tell the other officer so.</p>
               <p>Hutchinon. We were all killed but thirty-six men, and were obliged to borrow some men from other troops; and witness was one of them; he knew me, and I knew him well in 1811 and 1812. Witness. I never knew him in my life; I belonged to Captain Blackgrove's troop, and left in 1803 - I was only driver of the waggon - I did not know Corporal Batty.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went by the name of Payne in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140067"/>Hussars? A. I enlisted in 1802 in the artillery; I was then but thirteen years of age - I was there two years; in 1806 I enlisted in the Hussars in the name of Payne, and at the time his present Majesty was made Prince Regent, there was an order that every man should go by his right name, and I then took my name of Staines; I never went by any other names upon my oath.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOMAS YOUNG. Q. Did this witness say any thing to you about being in the artillery? A. No; the prisoner did not appear to know Staines.</p>
               <p>Hutchinson's Defence. When Young stopped me in St. John's-wood-road, he says it was half-past five o'clock, and I was not out of bed at that time; it was near eight when I saw him again - my evidence will prove where these things were got; I made my sister turn out her clothes, and the officer took them away; the prosecutor says he paid her wages to the officer - she has never had any thing, and would have perished if a friend had not lent her this cloak.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STAINES. Her clothes are at the section-house.</p>
               <p>Eaton's Defence. I sent for my wages and clothes, and my master sent word he had given them to the officer - I had been but a month in the house, and had given warning to leave; my mistress sent for me the morning afterwards to know if I would stop - I said No, she did not allow me common necessaries to cook with; she said I had not had an opportunity of knowing whether I liked her situation or not, would I stop another month I should not find a situation like hers in London.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was there a woman of the name of White with you? A. Yes; she lodged in the same house with us, in Boswell-court - she is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOMAS YOUNG. Q. When you first saw the man with the basket did you take hold of it? A. Yes, and raised up the petticoats; there was some sugar and an apron, and nothing else - I can swear to that; when I took it again it was heavier than it was at first.</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. Q. When you took it I said there were some clothes for my sister, and you were welcome look? A. I lifted up the petticoats, and saw the sugar and apron - there was nothing else I can swear; this is the basket; here is the dripping, the potatoes, and the cheese - this is the loaf, and I suppose this is the pan it was baked in; here are some pieces of bread.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON re-examined. Q. Do you know any thing of this pan? A. We have used it these twelve years - the cook baked that very loaf in it.</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. That loaf my sister baked for me; my daughter was in the habit of putting things in the basket at night, because we are troubled with mice.</p>

On the 29th of December I went to a sale at the Two Mariners; while I was there the prisoner, whom I knew before, came over - the sale did not come on; I left at three o'clock, and went with the prisoner to No. 8, Vinegar-lane; I had been there many times before - I was not tipsy; I went with a young man who had been at the sale, and there were several persons there; we sent for some ale, and entered into conversation for the remainder of the afternoon - during that time the young man, the person who lived up stairs, the prisoner, and I got quite jolly: I went with the prisoner to another public-house, and in returning my foot stumbled, I fell, it being slippery, and knocked my head against the wall of the house - I then lost sight of the prisoner; I had been sitting on the sofa with her in the afternoon - she had been kissing me, and attempting to put her hand into my pocket; Richard Price, an acquaintance of mine, came up and helped me; the prisoner and I had been about one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards towards the Back-road - I had not my watch when I fell; I went with Price to the prisoner's house - she was not there, but another female was; in consequence of what the other female said, Price went out and returned with Mr. Fell - when they came, the prisoner came into the room and laid on the sofa - I was sitting by her; Price and Fell saw her hand in a situation it had been before -I did not see her do any thing; neither of them said any thing to her about my watch that I recollect - I was stunned by the blow; the officer has the watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see your watch before you lost it? A.About four o'clock; the prisoner was present then - I can swear that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What are you? A. A carpenter. I knew the prisoner first in the middle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140068"/>of 1825 - I was on the same terms with her that any man would be with a prostitute; I am married - my wife did not find out this till after I had the prisoner at thie Police-office - I told her of it myself; I had had some she rry and ale in the morning - I went with the prisoner about three o'clock - I saw Mr. Price about six o'clock; I was in a stupor from the fall - the liquor might have a little effect on me - I was not in a state of perfect drunkenness; what money I trusted the prisoner with I gave her - I never gave her a 10l. note - I never had one in her house in my life; I saw her perhaps six times in 1805, and not again for two years - I saw her perhaps six times afterwards; I did not find that she had got married - I had seen her the night before; I recollect having the watch, and missing it after I fell; I was at another house about one o'clock in the day, and a young man wound up my watch, as it was down, but that was not at the prisoner's - I took it out at her house to lend the young man my key; Price went for an officer, and I was sitting upright on the sofa when he came back; I did not speak to the prisoner - she was lying behind me; I had missed my watch and my money, and told Price who I suspected had taken it, and while he was gone, she came in, laid herself down, and was wanting to put her hand in my pocket; I was sitting by her when the officer came, but I was stunned; I was hardly capable of speaking - I do not recollect that I spoke to any one.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PRICE. I am a builder, and live in Ratliff-highway, near Vinegar-lane. I found the prosecutor on the pavement and picked him up: he appeared to be quite stunned by the fall - he said he had lost his watch and money at No. 8, Vinegar-lane; I went there, but did not see the prisoner - I saw a female, and in consequence of what she said I went for an officer: I was sober - when I went out I saw Fell and his wife; I knew Fell and sent him for an officer - I went to the prisoner's house, and stood at the door till Fell and the watchman came; we then went into the parlour, and saw the prisoner lying at full length on the sofa behind the prosecutor, who was sitting up and appeared quite in a stupor: I did not hear any thing said to the prisoner by any one, but I gave charge of her to the watchman for robbing my friend of his watch and money- I am sure I mentioned the watch; the prisoner ran to the fire-place, took up the poker, and struck me in several places - she struck me in the small of the back with a three-legged stool, and followed me some distance out of the house; I did not hear her say any thing about the watch - she was taken by the watchman and some others to the watch-house - she might have said something about the watch without my hearing it, while she was hammering about me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the prosecutor before he was on the ground? A. No, not for several days- I did not consider him drunk; he told me very sensibly and clearly, that he had lost his watch - he was three or four yards from the door: I did not see that he was bleeding - when the watchman came the prosecutor was sitting on a sofa; he did not attempt to put his hand into the prisoner's bosom in my sight - I did not hear her say,"I have the man's watch, and I will give it to no one but him, when he is sober."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he tell the same story he has to-day? A. Yes, it varies very little indeed.</p>

             FELL. I am a glazier. I was passing with my wife; Price came and spoke to me - I got a watchman, went to the house, and Price gave charge of the prisoner for taking the watch and money; she made no reply, but got the poker and began to hit Price - I heard her say out of doors, that she had the watch and would give it to no one but him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q.Then she did admit that she had it? A. Yes, in the street; I cannot say that she had been out of the house and returned - I cannot say she was sober.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SUMMERS. I am watch-house-keeper; the prisoner was brought in custody of the two last witnesses, and a watchman - the prosecutor was not there at the time; it was stated that she had robbed a gentleman of his watch and some money; I asked her for the watch - she said she had not got it, and should not give any answer; I went to search her, and from some part of her person she took the watch - I forced it out of her hand; I found on her 19s. in silver, and 4 1/2d. in copper - I was sober and am positive she denied having the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did either of the witnesses tell you she had acknowledged having it in the street? A. No; when I said, "I must search you, where is this watch?" she said, "I have got no watch;" she afterwards took it from some part of her person, and it was in her hand - Fell and Price both appeared in a state of alarm, and said they never saw such a violent woman.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JAMES HAVARD. Q. What did you lose? A. A silver watch, a sovereign, and, I think, 3s., but I will not be positive - I told Price I had lost a watch and a sovereign.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You say there were several persons in the room? A. There was a woman who lodges there, Fletcher, a (man who associates with her) a young man who was in possession at the Two Mariners, the prisoner, and myself - none of them are here; I returned to the house after I missed the watch, and the prisoner was not there - I do not know whether she could have got rid of the watch; she had not been out of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the other woman tell you who had the watch? A. Yes; I would not bring such a woman as that here - her evidence would not be believed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This gentleman gave his watch into my hand at three o'clock, to wind Mr. Fletcher's watch up, as it was down, and his own key would not do: he said, "This person drew up mine last night, and perhaps she can yours" - I bit the key and made it do; I returned the prosecutor his watch - my lodger then said, "Will you lend me 5s.?" he said, "I have but 3s., will that do?" she said No - he pulled out a sovereign; I went out, got change, and brought in half a gallon of ale, and 1s. worth of gin - they drank it, and then the others went up stairs; I was going out, and said to the prosecutor, "You had better give me your watch to take care of, I don't know who may come in;" he laid on the sofa, and my washerwoman put two pillows under his head - when I returned we drank again, and he asked me for the change; I said, "You slept with me last night, and I think there is not a great deal due to you" -I wanted him to go home to his wife, but he would not as he was jealous of the other man, and he said he would not do it - he knows he took me out of life, and first drew me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140069"/>aside; I was acquainted with him four years before; I knew he had a wife - I then went to sea with a captain who was single; the prosecutor found me out twelve months afterwards, and used to come and drink with my husband, and told him I used to live with him - my husband got very suspicious of him, and used to ill-use me; I put my husband twice into the watch-house - I could not keep the prosecutor away; he dined with me on Christmas-day, and the next day he beckoned me over to the Two Mariners -I went there, and had a glass of brandy; then he came to my house, and drank till three o'clock - he gave me the watch and sovereign.</p>

I received information on the 31st of December, and found the watch at Harrison's - I went and took the prisoner, and said I wanted her for a watch, and that a man was in Newgate for it; I said I should search her for the duplicate - she said I need not search, as it was burnt; I found no duplicate, except one for a petticoat - a bill was filed against Elder, a soldier, and the prisoner was a witness.</p>

I lived with the prisoner at No. 7, Old Pye-street; she came home on the evening of Christmas-day between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; she had this watch in her right-hand - she said the young man was fighting, and she went between them and drew him of his watch - she went out the next morning, and pawned it for 3s.; she bought the bonnet which she has here for 1s. 9d., and the other money she gave the officer.</p>

On the 14th of December I went to my tea at a quarter before six o'clock, and the cheeses were safe under my portico, on a pile up to the top of the doorway; I came from tea in about twenty minutes, and said to my shopman, "Richard, there is a cheese gone;" he had not missed it - this is the cheese; it has my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know whether this cheese was on the pile? A. Yes - they were all marked No. 2, being of one particular dairy; I had sold some that day, but this is marked 24, which no other was - the shopman could not sell a whole cheese without my knowledge; there were eight of them, part of which I had put up.</p>
               <p>JAMES FOGG. I saw the prisoner in Rosemary-lane, with the cheese, on the evening of the 14th of December; it was in a small green bag, on his head, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's - I asked where he got it; he hesitated some time, and then said two men gave it him at the corner of Four Awl-court, and I might go and see them - I put him into a shop, and handcuffed him; as we were going along he saw two men, and said, "They have just cut down the lane now;" he afterwards saw his brother, and told him to go with me and show me the persons, and said one of them was named Phillips; I went with his brother to the City of Carlisle public-house - he went in, and two young men ran out; one of them we took, but the other, whom he called Phillips, got away - when I had that young man before the Magistrate the prisoner said it was not him, but Phillips gave it him.</p>

On the 8th of December I went to the Pavilion, in Whitechapel-road, with a friend; I had the head-ache, and did not like it - I went out, and was standing in the street - Fagerty came, and accosted me - we talked some time; Williams came up - they asked me for some gin, and we all went and had some; I then went to a house with the two women, and went into a room up stairs; I took out my watch, and locked at the time - it was past six o'clock - I gave them half a crown a piece, and then 1s. to get some gin, which Wiliams went for; Fagerty then kneeled before me, and we made an agreement; she took the watch from my pocket, but I did not see her do it; she had not been out of the room, but had gone to the door and come back - then I put my hand, and missed my watch; I said, "You have got my watch;" she began to cry, and the landlady came up - she asked her where the watch was, and took the candle to look on the bed; Fagerty said, "I took it from him, put it into my bosom, and gave it to Mary Williams - why did she go away and leave me; I will go and look for her;" I said,"I must take care of you - you shall not go till I have my watch;" I went down stairs to the people in the house - the landlady and I were going to look for Williams, we met Mr. Prendergrass - Fagerty said the same thing to him as she had to me; he took her - we went and found Williams, who took us into the room, and said to the landlady"If you will promise me three things, I will tell you where the watch is - if you will wish that you may never see your husband any more; that your house may be burnt to ashes, and that you may be burnt to brimstone, if you tell, I will tell you where the watch is - I took it, and gave it to Rowe"- we went and took Rowe; he swore in coming along, that he had it, but had not got it then - the watch has never been found; I went before the Magistrate the next day, and while I was in the public-house a rascally fellow came and spoke to me; I then went into the room to Rowe - he said, "I suppose you have lost your watch;" I said,"Yes, you know that as well as I do;" he said, "If you will go to such a house, I will treat you with a bottle of wine, and send for a man who will get the watch;" a man came showed me a duplicate, and said, "I have got the duplicate from Rowe;" it was pawned for 25s. - I went to White Horse-street, and saw it, but it was not my watch.</p>

I was passing the street, and saw the two prisoners; Hawes had the bundle - the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140074"/>spoke to him, and called out, "Hold this one;" I took him into a house, while the prosecutor pursued Glassop; when they came back I opened the bundle, which contained a piece of beef, weighing about 6 lbs.</p>
               <p>Hawes's Defence. On the 15th of December I went to my uncle's, who is ill; as I went up Slater-street a man came and asked if I would have a bit of meat - I said Yes; I was going up the street, and the prosecutor came and took me.</p>
               <p>Glassop's Defence. The only reason I had for running away was, because I own I am not one of the best of characters - I had been up at Worship-street, and I thought I was known there.</p>

               <p>JAMES TERRY. I am a patrol.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you the first who spoke to him, and asked the name of his employer? A. The constable did in my presence; he stated who he worked for, and where he lived.</p>
               <p>JOHN MILLER. I was watch-house keeper; I searched the prisoner, and took the basket from him with these 10lbs. of nails in it - I searched his lodgings, and found a gimblet, a quantity of wood, these nails and screws.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How did you find his lodging? A. He gave me his address.</p>

On the 4th of January I was about half a mile on this side Bow, at a quarter before six o'clock - I met the prisoner coming towards town, carrying this muff tied up in a handkerchief, doubled up in his right hand; as he passed he shifted it to his left hand, and brought it before him - I stepped back, and asked where he got it - he said it belonged to his aunt; I did not believe him, and took him into custody.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 19th of December, at half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to leave the street door open - I did not go out of the house, but to the end of the passage: I returned in a minute, and met the prisoner at the parlour door, with my master's coat under his arm, which had been in the parlour - she ran away, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140077"/>could not stop her as I had something in my hand; I ran up the street after her - she threw the coat on the rails; she did not get out of my sight - she was taken in Arling-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you servant at the house? A. Yes; I saw the coat under her arm; it had been on the counter in the parlour - my master called me to let the dustmen in; the dustmen were two doors off taking the dust from another house.</p>

             LLOYD. I live two or three doors from the prosecutor's. I saw the witness running after the prisoner - the coat was on the railings, which the prisoner had run by.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you before the Magistrate? A. Yes; I did not say I saw the coat on the ground.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHARLES RAY. I saw the prisoner running, and stopped her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was that from the prosecutor's? A.About a quarter of a mile - there were about three turnings; the witness was behind her all the way - she could not be out of her sight.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going as far as the City-road, and this young woman came and accused me - they found nothing on me; they let me go - I got half way up the street, and the man came after me and said there was a coat missing - it was near an hour before the coat was produced; I was not near the house till the servant took me there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For three hours and a half you had not been there? A. No; I had been at home all the time, and saw the prisoner in the house; he asked me for some paper to go down stairs - I do not know that he had ever been to the privy before; it is on the left hand and the wash-house on the right - there was no light below;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140078"/>persons do not go to the water-closet without leave: he had not been down above ten minutes - I saw him come in at half-past ten.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No. instrument of house-breaking? A. No: he had a knife.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I had a candle in my hand when I opened the wash-house door; there was no light there - the door was shut. <rs id="t18300114-159-verdict860" type="verdictDescription">

            . My father sent me and my cousin Galliers home about five o'clock; I found the house safe- we unlocked the street door - the front parlour door was locked; I saw my cousin fasten the window-shutter and window - we left a rushlight in the room; I saw him lock the outer and inner doors and tried both to see they were fast; the front door was double-locked - we took the keys to my mother; I returned about eight o'clock with my brother - we took the keys; I looked through a crack in the shutter and could not distinguish the light - I heard something fall in the front parlour; I went next door but one, and got Mr. Hopley - he opened the street door with the key, and I saw two men rush out of the parlour into the passage; we shut the door - they pulled inside, but we kept it too; I placed myself by the front window and saw two men open the shutters and jump out, one directly after the other - there is a gas-light opposite; the first man was shortish, in a dark great coat and blue trousers, and a black hat - the other was taller, and in dark clothes; he had on a tail coat - they ran together, but one left the other when they got a little up the street; I called Stop thief, and stood by the window, and in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes the patrols brought the prisoner into our parlour; he had on a dark great coat, blue trousers, and a hat covered with snow - he is a short stout man, and the same size as the one who first came out of the window; I believe him to be the man by his dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate you could not say it was a black hat? A. Not to my recollection; I might have said so as I was frightened - the snow laid on the ground.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GALLIERS. On Christmas-day, about five o'clock, I went to the house with my cousin; I fastened the window and shutters, locked the parlour, and double locked the street door - I left a light there, and gave the keys to Mrs. Card.</p>

            . On Christmas-night, a little before eight o'clock, William Card applied to me; I went with him - the street door was singly locked; I put the key in, turned the lock, pushed it open a little way, and felt somebody pulling within - I closed the door, called Watch! and heard a noise, as if they were getting out the backway; I then heard a noise in the front room - the shutter opened, and two men came out nearly together, and both ran down the street, towards the gas-light; I saw one had a dark great coat flying open - he was about five feet four inches high, and appeared rather stout in his great coat - it was a rough great coat; the other had no great coat, and I think was a little taller - I kept calling Watch! as I ran, and about fifty yards from the house, I saw Fry, the beadle; he turned up Kent-street with me - they were then running along Kent-street; we there lost one, and the other in the great coat turned down Cumberland-street - I lost sight of him for a second or two in turning the corner, but there was nobody else in the street - I was within five or six yards of him; when he turned Cumberland-street he had no hat on, which he had when he left Brunswick-street - I pursued him about one hundred yards down Cumberland-street, and he leaped into a hollow space, left for some houses; I left him there, and left Fry going into the hollow, with the hat in his hand, with two patrols, who came up; I returned to Card's house - he had not got home; two or three doors appeared to have been broken open, apparently by a chisel; a tea-caddy lay on the floor, with the glass broken - I had heard a smash; I went home, and saw a mob coming up Kent-street, with the prisoner in custody: he had a dark drab great coat on, but no hat; it was a coat of the same description as the man I pursued wore - I saw it as I passed the gas-light; I conclude he was the man from every circumstance - there was a gas-light between twenty and thirty yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it chiefly from the colour of his coat you speak to him? A. No; the great coat was something of an olive brown - I lost sight of him momentarily at two corners, and in the vacant space, which is no thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FRY. I am beadle of Shoreditch. I was in Brunswick-street, thirty or forty yards from Card's house a little before eight o'clock, heard an alarm of thieves, and observed two men come out of Card's house, but could not see from what part, one was dressed in a great coat - he ran on the same side as the house (I think the other had a small body coat); I tried to catch the other, but missed my hold, and crossing the field opposite Haggerstone church, where there is a little cut, near the end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140079"/>Kent-street, the one in the great coat fell down - his hat came off - I picked it up; the snow was about five inches deep on the ground - I did not notice whether there was snow on the hat; I kept four or five yards from that man all the way - he went along Kent-street and turned down Cumberland-street; I lost sight of him for a minute as he turned the corner - he turned the corner of a vacant space, and I lost him; I went into that space - there is a rough sort of paling there, at the side of some gardens; I heard a crack like the palings cracking - I saw two patrols coming in the same direction; they came down to the space - Taylor looked over the paling and said something; I then looked over the paling and saw the man in the great coat laying down inside the paling - he got up out of the corner and sidled to a wash-house, then made his way over the next garden paling; I left the patrols to guard that end, and went through a private house at the end, about fifteen houses off, and afterwards found the prisoner in custody - he had the same sort of dress as the man I pursued; I think he had a hat on then - I gave Roberts the hat I picked up before I saw the prisoner with a hat on; I will not swear he is the man, but he is the same size; I observed at the watch-house that his trousers were torn across the left thigh - they were a dark colour; I saw his hat took off at the watch-house, and knew it to be the one I picked up, by the string which confines the leather being out of the loops - I had observed that when I picked it up - there were twelve or fourteen loops out; I looked at it in the garden when I had a lantern lent me; I observed snow on it as we went to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often did you lose sight of him? A.Twice. There was 2l. 6s. 6d. found on him at the watch-house, which was returned him; I consider him the man by the colour of his body-coat, I took it to be a dark olive - his great coat was unbuttoned.</p>

I was on duty in Kingsland-road, and heard an alarm given towards the new church at Haggerstone, which is near Card's house; I saw Price run across the fields into Cumberland-street, and saw Fry with a hat in his hand near the vacant space, which he directed my attention to; he was not above four yards from that space - I looked over the pales there, and told Fry that I saw a man - he was laying down, with his face to the ground; he got up as I went over the pales, and got over the pales of the next garden - he had a dark great coat and no hat on; he went over into several gardens - the pales were low enough for me to keep him in sight; I followed, but lost sight of him as he turned to the left in one garden - I looked about there, and saw him laying flat on the tiles of a wash-house in that garden, with his face towards the tiles; I ordered him down, and he came - he had no hat, a dark great coat, and trousers torn at the left thigh; Roberts, the patrol, was there, and gave him a hat, which he put on - it appeared to fit him; the prosecutor's drawers appeared to have been broken open by a flat instrument, about an inch wide - a chisel would have made such marks.</p>

The prisoner and I have lived together<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140080"/>for eight years: we lodged in St. John's-court - the decaesed child was twelve months old: its name was Joseph - it was mine; he is the father - we have two more. On Sunday evening, about six o'clock, we were both very much intoxicated; we were in the back room second floor, with the three children - we have two rooms; the prisoner was by the fire - I aggravated him a great deal, more than a man could bear, and spit in his face; he had the iron heater in his hand, and was going to stir the fire with it - after spitting in his face I went about two yards from him, and he accidentally threw the heater, not with the intention of hurting me or the child - it went through the child's head - the child was at my breast; I went to the fireplace when I spit at him - I went very quick, and sat down two yards from him; he then threw the iron - he threw himself down on the ground, cried, and got up again; he flew to the table where the knives and forks were, and was going to make away with himself - I took them from him, and said, "Don't, Charles, make away with yourself;" he went out for a few minutes, and then returned - a gentleman came and took him in charge; when the iron struck the child, I showed him what he had done - he said, "Mary, Oh, my God! I have hurt my baby;" I kept it in my arms - blood came from it - he took it into his arms, kissed it, and told me to put it to the breast - I said it was of no use, for it was dead; he wished it to be taken to a doctor, but it was of no use - it did not live above two minutes after it was struck; we had been quarrelling for a quarter of an hour - he was always very fond of the children, and indulged them in their faults; no blows had passed between us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was he not particularly fond of this child? A. Yes; he maintained and treated me kindly - I had been brought home very drunk that morning, and he was a good deal intoxicated; the heater was in his hand at the time I spit at him; it was the heater of an Italian iron - the child being killed sobered me, and I recollect what happened; I do not recollect raising my hand to him - I am sure I spit at him.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH STEWART. I live in the room over the prisoner.

On the 6th of December, about seven o'clock, I was directed to the prisoner's lodgings by the patrol; I found him and Blagg sitting in the room, with two or three children - I asked what had been the matter there; they seemed confused, and I thought endeavoured to conceal the real cause - I said it had been intimated to me that murder had been committed in the house, and I would open every room but what I would find it out - Blagg then said, "I and my husband have been quarrelling, and our child has been hurt;" I asked where it was - she took me into the next room; I there saw the child on the bed, a little warm, but quite dead - she told me how it happened; the prisoner was not in the room - I went into the room where he was; she took the iron from the fire-side, and said that was the iron it was done with - they both appeared half drunk, and, I am sorry to say, he did not appear to have the feeling he ought; a conversation passed with him, which I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was half drunk? A. Yes, and rather confused in his manner - the woman appeared more alarmed than him; the iron was clean, but perhaps it had been in the fire.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 6th of December, at a quarter-past six o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner at the corner of Sharp's-alley, West-street, very much in liquor; I said, "What brought you out in this state? you are drunk, go home" - he said, "Patrol, I wish you or somebody would shoot me;" I pressed him to go home - he asked me to shake hands, saying he would go home. I went to the house about seven o'clock with Hooker, and found the child dead - Hooker said, "How was it done?" Perry answered, "Neither of us did it, it was done between us" - Hooker asked what it was done with;" the woman said, "The iron-heater," and gave it to them from the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he and his wife had been quarrelling? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am house surgeon of St. Bartholomew's-hospital. I saw the child about eight o'clock that evening; it was quite dead - I found a wound on the left side of the head; next day I opened the head, and found another wound in the right side, in which the bones were broken inward - they had broken outward at the other wound; there was a wound through the brain leading from one fracture to the other - all the wounds had been given at one time; the instrument had pierced through - this iron would have effected it, if thrown with violence; the point must have struck the head - if it had struck in any other way, it might have produced death, but would not have made such a wound; if the iron had struck the woman, I cannot say what would have been the effect; it would depend on the strength of the throw - I think she might have had a severe wound, if it had struck her with the point; the child's wound would produce almost instant death.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It might not have penetrated the scull of a grown person? A. I should not expect that it would.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I solemnly assure you I had no intention of doing it, neither before nor at the time; she abused me more than a man could hear, and attempted to strike me, then spit in my face, and ran across the room - having the iron in my hand to stir the fire, I threw it at her, and struck the child; no man can have suffered more than I have since.</p>

               <p>JURY to ROBERT TAYLOR. Q. Had he an opportunity of going round the counter? A. He had no business there- he must have gone there to get at the till; he could not reach over - Brown had occasion to leave the shop for two minutes to come to me in the warehouse - the prisoner was then alone in the shop, and I may have left the till while I was in charge of it.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HERDSFIELD. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner last Tuesday, in St. Mary-axe, and told him the charge - he said he was very sorry, that he was in great distress, and that I should find the looking-glass at Bassett's, in Queen-street, Long-acre; I found it there -I asked what he had done with the books; he said he cut the covers off and burnt them, cut the books in two, and sold them to two cheesemonger's in St. Giles'.</p>
               <p>JAMES BASSETT. I am a pawnbroker, of Great Queen-street. On the 28th of September this looking-glass was pawned with me for 20s - I am not certain of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(Glass produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HENRY BARRETT. I am a cheesemonger, of High-street, St. Giles'. I bought of the prisoner three or four times printed books, as waste-paper - there was about 5lbs. each time: I gave him 4d. a pound; I used it in my shop, and did not read it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I merely did it out of necessity; I was to have 2s. a week to stay at the chambers every day from half-past ten o'clock till two, to receive letters and forward them - I had no other employ, and was much distressed; I went and asked Mr. Thomas, a friend of the prosecutor's, to advance me 5s. of my wages - he wrote to master to know if he might; master wrote that I was not to have a farthing, and I made away with a few things.</p>

               <p>JOHN WILLIAM WINTLE. I deal in iron. The prisoner came and asked if I bought iron, and produced a piece; I said I did not buy such as that - he had a piece in his hand, and the rest, I believe, in a parcel on his shoulder.</p>

By shoe-binding; I have one other female lodger; I never lent her things to pawn; I met her in the Old Bailey after this, and I said, "Oh, Ellen, how could you rob me so?" she said, "I never did;" I said, "Give me the ticket;" she said she would pay me, and I promised to forgive her; I have had no quarrel with her since; we went to a public-house and had a pint of beer, which I paid for, because it was so cold.</p>

He went home with me and Taylor, and said he had no money and nothing but his watch, which he gave into my hands for 5s. each - I went to see if I could get a light, and could not get one; he wanted some liquor; I left him and Taylor in bed, and went to try to get some. Witness. It is totally false; I did not send for liquor.</p>
               <p>Taylor. He said he would leave his watch for 10s. with us; he was quite agreeable to have some liquor sent for, and Smith went for it - he was so tipsy he fell down on the stairs. Witness. I was not aware of it.</p>

            . I saw Smith in the Strand; she was running along at some distance from Ship-yard - I laid hold of her and said I must search her; I took her into a shop and she said, "I know what you want, you want the watch;" the prosecutor had come to me undressed, and stated what he had lost; I put my hand into Smith's bosom, but could not find the watch - she then gave it me; she said it had been left in pawn, but did not say she was going for drink; the prosecutor gave a distinct account.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THORPE. At a quarter-past five o'clock, the prosecutor said Taylor was active in the robbery; I went up stairs, found the door locked, and the things on the stairs - I demanded admission; there was no answer - I waited three minutes, and then broke open the door; I found Taylor there with her clothes on - she denied all knowledge of the watch, and said nothing about its being left in pawn; the prosecutor was not so very tipsy - he gave a pretty fair account of the thing; he said if the watch was given up he would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>Smith put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had given her the watch to raise money upon to procure liquor.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. He took part of his clothes off in the room, and he ran down stairs undressed as he was - he said he was married, and wanted to get home; he said he would settle with me next day - he has said he has sent three females out of the country, and he will try how many more he can send.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLLING. I do not remember saying so; I have not done so, and do not remember asserting any thing of the kind - I have not sent any woman out of the country.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Are you aware of having no money in your pocket? A. I believe I had not; it was arranged between Taylor and myself - I had not known her before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.How many children have you? A. Two; I had not been in any gin-shop that night - I had been in two public-houses that day; I was as sober as I am now - it was not a particularly dark night: there were shops all the way; I did not say I did not think she was the woman, but the voice was like hers: I swear to her person and her voice - she was not discharged by the Magistrate, nor by the night-officer; there were two drunken charges in the watch-house, but she never went out - I understood she was told to go about her business, but I interfered; I do not remember the Magistrate saying, if I could not give a better account she must be discharged - I positively deny saying at the watch-house, that I could only swear to by her voice; I never mentioned such a word as that I did not think she was the person; there was no row when the watch was taken from me, nor when she was taken into custody - I saw no one but her; I felt some one pinion my arm - I followed her into a house about one hundred and fifty yards off; it was not exactly a straight road, but I am quite sure I did not lose sight of her - I saw her into the house; she might be with me a quarter of an hour - I understood she was taken a quarter before twelve o'clock; no other wo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140087"/>man was taken on this charge - I was talking to the Police-man when the prisoner came up to know what the row was: I do not know what the row was about - I positively deny that it was about my charging another woman with stealing my watch; I am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said you had seen her conversing with some one before you lost your watch? A. Yes; I pursued her up stairs in the house, but from fear that something might happen, I came down and spoke to the man in the parlour - he said he could not give me any advice what to do; while I was talking to him I heard some one come down and go out at the street-door - I ran out right and left, and the door was shut - I could not find the house again.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CAMPPEN. I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 24th of December there was a drunken woman fell down in the street; my fellow-officer and a woman were by - the prisoner came up the street, and the prosecutor said that was the woman; he did not hesitate a moment - I had seen him about five minutes before; I thought him sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he give a clear account? A. Yes, of his being robbed, and the time; he and the prisoner were on the opposite side to where the row was- he said she was the person; he did not say he could swear to her by her voice - the watch-house keeper did not say if he could not give a better account she must be discharged; there are gas-lights about where he was robbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was she set at liberty? A. No; the Magistrate did not say any thing about his not telling a clear story.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was looking at the row when he looked at me and said, "Take this woman;" I said,"What for?" he said, for his watch, and if I would tell him who had it, he would not take me; he said he knew me by my voice - the night officer said he would not take the charge from such a drunken man, and he said I was discharged; I staid a few minutes, and the prosecutor said he would insist that I was the person - the Magistrate asked if he was not drunk - the Police-man said he was a little in liquor, but not so drunk but he could tell the person; I had gone out for some butter when I was taken - they asked for the key of my room, and I gave it up; I had not been out ten minutes; the prosecutor said he did not think I was the person, but I was one of the party - the Police-man swears false, for he heard the officer say he would not take me on the charge of such a drunken man; I will send for my landlord, and persons who saw me, to say I was at home all night - it does not appear very likely that I would stand looking at him.</p>

             WESTCOTT. On the 10th of December, I took the prisoner, and found in his pockets six duplicates, three of which are for these articles; I charged him with taking the tools; he said "I do not deny it."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You never asked whether I had pawned the planes? A. Yes I did, and you said I do not deny it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had been left in the house with his master's son, who was a notorious pick-pocket, and had been twice in prison, and he had persuaded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140090"/>him to pawn the tools to raise money he had received on his master's account, and which the son had taken from him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GLIBBERY re-examined. Q. Is there any truth in this? A. There may be in some parts, but the principal part I can stoutly deny; he behaved well for about six months, but he is a most notorious liar, my son-in-law has been wild, but I can declare the prisoner has been 100l. out of my way; I have heard that my son has been charged at Clerkenwell, but not till lately - I should think that has nothing to do with this case; I can swear to these planes and this tool.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PAUL. I know these tools to be the prosecutor's property; I missed them about the time the prisoner was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HENRY WESTCOTT. The prisoner said he certainly had taken them, and said to one of the sons as we were going to Bow-street, "You have done for yourself now."</p>

Salt's, the bankers, and desired him to make haste back; he was to get 18l. 7s. 6d. for a cheque - he never returned, and I did not see him again till the 21st; when his wife had committed some assault, and he went to bail her - my servant saw him, and gave charge of him; he had been eight months in my service.</p>

This is the cheque - when he was brought to me he said his wife had got 10l, which he would give me the next day - I said to him, "You are a pretty fellow, what is the reason you did not return with the money?" I am sure I said that; he said he was very sorry, he had been robbed of it.</p>

               <p>GEORGE TAYLOR. I am a watchman of Shoreditch. On the 28th of November I was standing at the corner of Church-street, a little before seven o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner and another man walking together; I followed them; they both came together - just before I came up, the prisoner hung back, and got before me; I asked what he was about; he made no answer - I collared the other man, who had the tub of butter; he threw it back, which broke my hold, and he ran away - I pursued, but lost them both; I took the butter to the watch-house -I suppose it was thirty or forty yards from Mr. Needham's where I saw them; I inquired, but could not find any one who had lost it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You never saw the prisoner with any tub? A. No, the other person had it - the prisoner was with him at first; it was Saturday morning, and many people were about with carts.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you see the prisoner do? A. Nothing; but when I went to make up to the man who had the butter, he got before me, and tried to prevent my getting to him.</p>

               <p>CHARLES GREEN. I live in Union-street, Middlesex Hospital. I met the prisoners on the 11th of December, at ten minutes after five o'clock; I watched them - they attempted several shops; I saw them go to Mr. William Williams' - Wright took a pair of stays down, and gave them to Hawkes; he then came back, and took another pair; I took Wright, and the officer took Hawkes,</p>
               <p>JAMES AUSTICE. I am an errand-boy. On the 11th of December I was coming down Tottenham-court-road, and saw Wright take a pair of stays, and give them to Hawkes; he then took another pair, went over the way to a public-house, and was taken there.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILSON. I am the officer. I took Wright, then went, and took Hawkes with the two pairs of stays.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Wright's Defence. I was in the public-house, and the officer came and took me; a person said the other prisoner had got them - he let me go, and took him.</p>

On the evening of the 9th of December I was taking care of the shop - there was no one at home but me; I saw the two prisoners walking up and down about the door for about a quarter of an hour; Duff then came to me, and said, "Is your master out;" I said Yes - he then came and wanted to play with me, and to tickle me; Morris was walking up and down by the wine-vaults next door - Morris then said,"I should like a mutton-chop for my supper;" I said he should have it if he paid for it - he laughed at that; they walked up and down, and wanted me to play with them - they had made a mess before the door, and I took the broom to sweep it away; the handle came out - Duff took the broom, threw it through the window, and broke it; he then put his hand into the window, and I thought he wanted to steal something - they then came into the shop, and Duff held me down and put saw-dust into my mouth, while Morris took a rump of beef and ran off with it, and in a few minutes Duff ran away; they were taken in about a quarter of an hour - my master never got his rump of beef; I am sure they are the men - I had seen them about before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Then you knew Duff? A. I had seen him about, and knew his name - I do not know whether it was what they call larking - Duff staid in the shop a minute or two; I saw Morris reach his hand up, take the beef, and put it on his right shoulder; Duff was with me till Morris was gone; a man came to the shop and asked me if I had lost any thing, but I did not think of this at that minute - I thought he meant something off the block; that was about five minutes after: I know the consequences of an oath, and swear I saw the beef taken, but when the man came I thought he meant something off the block - I did not think of this at that time; this happened between eight and nine o'clock - I saw the prisoners again in a coffee-shop in Bedfordbury, a little before nine; I said they were the men - I looked round the shop to see if I had lost any thing when the person came to ask me, and I began to cry; I thought my master would be very angry.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.There was a rump of beef hanging up, and it was gone? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS YOUNG. I sell hardware in the market. On the night of the 9th of December I saw the two prisoners running about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's - Duff was running first: he called out, "Charley, you make haste on;" Morris said, "D-n you, I am making haste;" Morris had a rump of beef on his shoulder, and the hook fell out of it - I took up the book, and went to the prosecutor's shop; this boy was standing outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. Between eight and nine o'clock; it was dark, but I know both the prisoners - they lived in the neighbourhood; I went to the shop, and saw the boy - I asked if he had lost any thing, and at first he said No; I said, "Has there not been two men here?" he then burst out into very heavy tears, and said, "I have lost a rump of beef;" he was crying at the door when I first went - he said his mouth had been crammed with saw-dust.</p>

The prisoners came to my shop on the night in question, and brought in some ragged pieces of beef, not much like a rump - I should think there were 3lbs. or 4lbs. of it; I did not see any bone - they filled the fryingpan with it twice; it was about a quarter-past nine o'clock- my shop is about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's; the Police-man came and took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then they brought no more steak than would serve two men? A. I do not know; the Police-men took it away, and eat it the next day.</p>

               <p>Duff's Defence. I left work a little after eight o'clock, and met Morris at the corner of New-street, Covent-garden - he had some steaks, which he said he bought in Clare-market, his father was not at home, and he was going to cook them at a public-house; I said, "I am going to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140093"/>coffee-shop, if you like to go there you may;" we went there, and I had a bit on a bit of bread - I had no plate; the officer came and took me - I was earning 5s., or 6s. a day: if I stood on a scaffold instead of here I should say I was innocent - the boy says he saw Morris take the meat, and if I held his head down how could he see it; I declare before God, my maker, I had no act in it.</p>
               <p>Morris' Defence. I bought the steaks in Clare-market- I met Duff, who said he was going to a coffee-shop; I said, "I am going to have some steaks, if you like to have any you may;" they were just turned out of the pan when the officer came and took us.</p>

The prosecutor came to the office and got a search-warrant; I went to the prisoner's house on Saffron-hill - he is a marine-store dealer; he was sitting smoking his pipe in his back-parlour - while I was searching I turned and found he had decamped; we went out, and I traced by the snow that he had gone to the next yard - Duke staid there while I went into the next house, and found him in a cupboard; he made great resistance - I was surrounded by about six people, and had great difficulty in making a capture of him; I lost my hat and handkerchief for some time - here is the watch; I found it under the window in his back room under some old iron.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUKE. I was with Waddington, and was holding the candle to him; I turned, and the prisoner was gone - what has been stated is correct; he denied knowing any thing about it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, representing that he was in the habit of visiting the prosecutrix in her husband's absence: that on the day in question he was intoxicated, and she proposed to go and live with him, intimating that he could have the plate and watch; that she frequently put the watch into his hand, and on getting home, and becoming sober next morning, he found he had brought it away.</p>

               <p>EDWIN BATCHELOR. I live next door to Mr. William McBean. On the evening of the 4th of December I was standing at my door at nine o'clock, and saw Hobson at the rails; in a few minutes Creed came out of the prosecutor's house with a white bag, which he gave to Hobson, who put it under his coat, and they both ran down the street together - Mrs. McBean came to the door, and I told her - I knew Creed before and had seen Hobson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you at the Police-office? A. Yes; I said I thought they were the men - I did not like to say before their face that they were the men, but when they were away I said I was sure they were; I am thirteen years of age - I had not known Hobson long; I did not say I was afraid the officer would beat me if I did not say they were the men.</p>

            . I am the wife of William McBean; he keeps a pie-shop. On the day in question, a little before nine o'clock, we had a bag in our shop which contained about five quarterns of flour, and by the side of it about six pounds of meat; I was in the back parlour, and heard a noise - I went out and missed them; I have never seen them since.</p>

I was going round about nine o'clock; the witness called me and said she had lost the flour; I ran down two or three streets, but could see nothing of it - I told another Policeman, came back, and this boy gave me a description of them; I took the prisoners about ten o'clock - there was a mark of flour on Hobson's waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Hobson? A. Yes; when I lived in Chelsea he was waiter at the Woodman and had a good character - this lad did not like to say any thing because he knew Creed.</p>
               <p>Creed's Defence. I had carried a box to Baker-street and met Hobson as I returned; we were coming up Chapel-street, and the officer said to him, "I want you;" and he said to me, "You may as well come" - he took us to the shop, and the little boy said he did not think we were the persons.</p>

Four or five; we have them in a row - if one is taken we can tell; these are the same size as those I lost - perhaps there were eight or nine on the board; I have sold a great many locks - Mr. Leary lives next door; my house is very handy to him.</p>

            . I am inspector of the Islington watch. On the 17th of December I was with a patrol at the foot of the canal bridge, and saw the two prisoners coming out of Mr. Rhodes's brick-field - I got off my horse and asked Cakes what he did in the field; he said he was looking for work - I examined his pockets, and found two fowls; the patrol searched Hatton, and found two fowls in his pocket, and a quantity of snares - this was about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's; I showed him the same fowls, and he owned them.</p>
               <p>JOHN LOYEDER. I was with Morgan - what he has stated is correct; the fowls were dead.</p>

               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; I sometimes have my doors locked; I never authorized her to pawn any thing, nor suspected her.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MOXON. I am a pawnbroker; I have a pair of trousers, a silk handkerchief, seven yards of cotton, a gown, a pair of shoes, and a waistcoat, pawned on the 5th of January; the cotton, handkerchief, and trousers, by the prisoner, two in the prosecutor's name, and one in the name of Donnahue.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. No; she pawned some of these at a quarter before eight o'clock on the 5th of January; she was in the shop five minutes - there were other persons there; I can swear she is the same woman.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She brought up two Police-men, and one of them asked if she suspected this woman; she said she is the stoutest woman I can find - I took them into my bed-room, and overhauled every thing; I then went with them to this pawnbroker's, and he said I pawned them- "Look back to your conscience (says I) and do not say that I ever was in your place."</p>

On Sunday morning, the 20th of December, about nine o'clock, when I got up, a person rang my bell, and said my house was broken open; I found the bar of the shutter forced, and a large square of glass broken out of the window - there was room for a person to go through; it was fast the night before; I found the things turned over one another in the shop, and missed nine cheeses - my house is at the corner of Pell-street; I had heard a noise about seven o'clock, but did not think my house could be broken open at that hour, and took no notice; the glass was jagged, as if a hand had been forced through, and blood on it. Captain

               <p>ROBERT YOUNG. I string shoes, and am nearly fourteen years old - I live in Thomas-place, Pell-street. On Sunday morning, the 20th of December, between seven and half-past seven o'clock, I was sweeping the snow from the door, and heard a disturbance in the street; I ran to the bottom of the court, and saw two men in Pell-street, carrying cheeses - they were so heavily loaded that they rested, and left two cheeses at Captain

            ' door, which is nearly opposite; they carried the rest up the street, rested, and changed arms by the pump - they turned to the right; I watched them half way up Christian-street, and lost sight of them - I first saw them about a dozen doors from Brown's, and coming in a direction from there; they came back in a quarter of an hour for the other two cheeses, and knocked at Captain 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1440">Williams</persName>
            ' door three times, but he would not let them have them - I had seen him take the cheeses in five minutes after they left them there; they both went up the street together, and I saw no more of them - I had seen them before, but did not know their names; about a quarter of an hour after they had gone, a man came up, and asked if I had seen two men go along with some cheeses - I said No; he ran up the street, met one of them, and said, "Halloo! how get you on?" the other said,"Oh, very well," and both went up the street together; Welch was the third man - Walker and Lewis are the men I saw in the street with the cheeses; I saw 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1441">Lewis</persName>
             that night at the Sweedish Flag, Princes-street, and saw Welch there on Monday morning; I had only seen Walker once before, but Lewis three or four times - they were in my sight about ten minutes; I am sure of all three.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was it not rather foggy? A. No, it was snowy; the disturbance was they kept saying, "I will go and fetch a knot;" I was asked at the office to point out who had the cheeses - I do not think I touched all three, but cannot be certain; I had seen Walker once; it might be a year before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long after you saw them with the cheeses did you see Welch? A. A quarter of an hour; he came from Ratcliff-highway - that was in a direction from Brown's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Did the officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140097"/>tell you you were going to see somebody suspected of the robbery? A. Yes, he told me he was going to take me to see if I knew the men - I went into the tap-room to see them; I had seen 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1442">Lewis</persName>
             a week or a fortnight before - I told the Magistrate he had a dark dirty blue coat on; I recollect having said it was black.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why do you now say it was dirty blue? A.Because the gentleman told me to think; I did not call it to mind just at that moment - at first I thought it was blue; now I recollect it was a dirty black - Welch was in a rough white coat, and Walker in a sailor's jacket; I heard Mr. Brown had been robbed, and went and told him- Lewis' mother lives in Betsey-street; I believe he lives with her.</p>

I am fourteen years old, and live in Pennington-street; I was going by Pell-street about seven o'clock, and saw two men standing up by Mr. Brown's shutters, in Pell-street; Lewis stood by the door, as if he was drunk; he said to me, "Little boy, can you tell me where Wellclose-square is?" he had his clothes down almost - he said, "If you do I will give you a halfpenny;" I said, "Yes, Sir," and he gave me a halfpenny; I showed him the square, but he did not go on, and I noticed him, seeing him drunk, and the two men by the shutter - I thought something was the matter; a sailor came by, and he asked him the same question, and in two or three minutes I thought I heard a smash - I would not go back, as I thought something was the matter, and they would do something to me; I was coming down Rosemary-lane, about half-past eight o'clock, and saw the three prisoners and a lot more men; I turned to look at them, and Walker up with his foot and kicked me - I could not move for about two minutes; I then went home; I said nothing to any body, but on Monday morning, when I went out for coals, I went and told Mr. Brown's son what I had seen - he asked me to come over presently; I did not like, but on Tuesday Brown and Prendergass fetched me to Lambeth-street, but I was not examined till the next time -Lewis was dressed in a blue coat; I did not see Walker and Welch so particularly then, but I saw their dress -Walker had a blue jacket and trousers, and a light waistcoat; Welch had a white coat, gaiters, and boots, like a carman - when the glass broke Lewis went off; I did not see what became of the others - I had not seen either of them before; I speak to them by their dress, and looking at them; the man who gave me the halfpenny said, "Go up to No. 47, in that alley, and I will come and give you such a tuck out" - the alley is in the square; this was a little before I heard the glass break - I did not go to the alley; there are not above twenty houses in it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you have no great kindness towards Walker for kicking you? A. No; I know he is the man that did the robbery - I saw him up the street; I would not wish to do him any harm or good; Prendergass took me to the watch-house - they told all the men to stand up, but I could not see exactly; there were about fourteen - I told the officer directly I came out that black-eyed Billy, which was the name I understand he goes by, was the man who kicked me; I did not know them exactly in a moment, and said I did not know them - the three were afterwards brought into the office by themselves; I was told they were the men suspected; I am not certain who said so - it was one of the officers, but I knew them by their dress; I could see them better then - the Magistrate did not ask me any questions the first time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. After saying you could not speak to them exactly, did not one of the officers say, "We have got the wrong men?" A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you quite sure it was a blue coat? A. Yes, I am sure two were in blue, and one like a carman; I did not go to Brown on Sunday, as his shop is never open - I was never in trouble.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was the first examination after the second? A. I went first on Tuesday - I was examined, I believe, on the Thursday week after.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRENDERGASS. I belong to Lambeth-street office. I saw MR. Brown on Sunday night, and about six o'clock went to Young's - in consequence of what I heard from him I apprehended 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1444">Lewis</persName>
             that evening, and Welch next morning, and Walker on Tuesday, in consequence of Young's description; he identified Lewis at the Swedish Flag, Welch next morning, and Walker at night - on Wednesday morning the prosecutor sent 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1445">Walker</persName>
             a pint of porter - he held out his left hand to take it; I asked him to put out his right hand - he did so, and the middle knuckle was cut; I asked how it was done - he said with striking his old woman: I saw her on Wednesday, and she had no visible marks of violence - the first examination was on Wednesday, the next on Monday, and the third on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Walker tell you he had hit the wall in trying to strike the woman? A. He did not; I took Whowell to the lock - up place, but did not talk to him about the prisoners; I know a suspicious character, called Gipsy - he wears sailor's clothes, and every kind of dress; I did not tell 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1446">Walker</persName>
             I was looking for Gipsy, and if I had found him I would not have taken him (Walker) - I told Whowell I was taking him to the lock-up place, to see if he could identify the men; Gipsy is taller than either of the prisoners - I have not been looking for him; he was in the house when I took Lewis, if I had wanted him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you mean to say you have not been looking after other persons? A. Not about this robbery, but in consequence of information which came from the prisoners in Newgate; I took Whowell to the lock-up place - we had about nine people there; I desired them all to stand up, and immediately he looked round he said, "None of the men are here;" as such we paid no more attention to him, but when they were coming out to be examined, he said,"Why, I can identify all these three men, they were in Mr. Brown's robbery" - that was immediately they were brought in; he was sworn, but what he said was not taken down then - I have heard him say he was not examined, but he was; he was fully examined the second day - Welch was in bed when I took him; he put on a pair of cord breeches, and a long fustian coat.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. The cheeses were delivered to me by Captain Williams, who went to sea the next day; I have had them ever since - I lost seven more.</p>

            . Some of them were cheeses like these.</p>
               <p>Welch's Defence. I can prove I was in bed at the time; when I was taken, the boy said he did not know me, except seeing me in the highway with two girls, on Sunday morning - Prendergass took him aside, then came to me, and said, "You are identified; the boy says you had top boots on, a long jacket, and was carrying four cheeses;" the boy could not be off knowing me, for I have stood in Princes-street four years - Prendergass said he was satisfied it was not me, and if he could have seen Gipsy, he should not have taken me.</p>
               <p>Lewis and Walker both stated they could prove an alibi.</p>
               <p>ANN MARTIN. My husband is a labourer at the London-docks. On the Sunday before Christmas-day, at five o'clock in the morning, Walker called on his uncle, who lodges with me, in Wells-place, Goodman's-fields; he wanted to go to Woolwich, to see his aunt, and they went out together in five minutes, to the Windmill public-house; I went to the Windmill at seven o'clock, and saw them there - it is about a quarter of mile from our house; I staid there with them till half-past eight - he then came home with us, and stopped at my house till twelve o'clock, and then went home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What enables you to say it was the 20th of December? A. I had a little boy lying ill, and have the doctor's bill to prove it.</p>

               <p>JOHN MARTIN. Walker's uncle lodges with me. On the Sunday before Christmas-day, I and his uncle went with him to the Windmill, about twenty minutes after five o'clock, and staid there till about half-past eight - he then went to my house; he has an aunt and uncle at Woolwich, named Haines.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What took you to a public-house at five o'clock on Sunday morning? A. We went to have something to drink - one of our young ones was ill, and we got up early - they did not go to Woolwich, as it was too late, and they had rather too much to drink; they returned to my house at half-past eight o'clock, and staid there till nearly two o'clock, as Walker was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you attend here for the first time? A. This is the first time; I was was not desired to come before- nobody has asked me to come now; this is the first time his uncle or my wife have come - I do not know who desired us to come; I heard he was in prison a day or two after he was taken - I have not seen him in prison; I heard somebody say he was going to be tried to-day.</p>

            . Walker is my nephew; I live at Martin's. On the Sunday before Christmas day, Walker came there about five o'clock in the morning, with the intention of going to Woolwich - I went to the Windmill with him and Martin, and staid there from half-past five o'clock till nine o'clock, I suppose; I do not wear a watch - we then returned to Martin's - there was a child ill there; I believe Walker did not go to Woolwich.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you going to Woolwich? A. We intended to go that morning; I am a journeyman bricklayer - his uncle Harris married my sister; we sat drinking till nine o'clock - I do not know the landlord's name, it had been shut up before he took it; we got rather in liquor, and went home - Walker staid at Martin's till about twelve o'clock; I then went with him to his own place, helives in Albion-street - I have been here every day since Thursday last; when I heard he was in custody, I said to Martin, "Why he was with me at the house, and it cannot be him" - Martin and his wife came here with me, on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and yesterday.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH MORRIS. I am single, and live in Thomas-street New-road, St. George's in the East; my father is a copper-smith - Welch lodges with us; I let him in on the Saturday night before Christmas-day, between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock; he slept at home - I heard him come down about a quarter-past nine in the morning, when I was in the back-room down stairs - I knew him by a particular cough which he has; I saw him about ten o'clock, in the New-road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he came down, he did not come into your room? A. No; our house is about five minutes walk from Brown's - nobody could come in or out without my hearing them; I got up about seven o'clock - my father got up about six o'clock, and went out; the prisoner is always at home on Sunday morning - I did not notice this more than any other Sunday, but I heard his father talking to him; my father is ill, and not able to attend - my sisters were up, but neither of them are here.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WELCH. The prisoner Welch is my son, and lodged at the house of Morris - he slept with me the Saturday night before Christmas; he was in bed all night, got up at half-past eight o'clock, and left the house at a quarter-past nine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where did he breakfast that morning? A. I believe at Allen's, in the highway - he is a carman; he came home at half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday night - I was in bed then; I have been here every day since the Session began.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA WHITE. My husband is a coal-whipper, we live at Shadwell - I know Lewis. On Saturday night, the 19th of December, at twelve o'clock, he came up with John, (our landlord's boy) to bed, at the house I lodge at - he lodges at the same house, on the same stairhead; I asked John if I should take down some things which I had hung in his room? He said No, it was only George Lewis; Lewis said, "Don't go away in the morning without me, I am going down the river with you in the boat" - I saw him again on the Sunday morning, at two minutes past seven o'clock, and went to call the boy up to open the shutters; I did not see him after that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How was Lewis dressed that morning? A. In a black coat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is Smith here? A. I have not seen him since; I was sober; I was not drunk - I did not strike the landlord at the watch-house; there was not a blow struck - I might push the watchman; the inspector of the night took the chain - I supposed the chain found on Allen to be mine when it was taken out of his pocket, it being a steel chain; I said it was mine, and that I would swear to it - I cannot say the constable changed it; I did not lay, any wagers that night - I threw down two sovereigns by mistake, and then put them into my purse; that was before I went into the tap-room - I had three glasses of warm wine, and one of noyean; no rum - I had another glass of noyean in the tap-room; I had only two glasses before I went there - I had four in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after the light was extinguished that you saw the prisoner do this? A. There was a glimmering light from the fire; no man could get to me so quick as they did after the light was put out - Relf's hand was in my pocket directly; I said to Allen, "You villain, I have transported one man, and will transport you, if it costs 60l.;" a chain and a piece of one was found on him- all the persons in the tap-room fled like a swarm of bees on my crying Murder! I was sober at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you not at that house six half-pint glasses of hot wine? A. I had not; they were small glasses, and are 2d. each; I had five glasses of noyean during the day - I said I only had four at the King and Queen; I think there are two boxes in the tap-room - the right-hand side is open, with a table in the middle; the other persons were sitting round on the other side - I did not perceive any body in the next box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear there was sufficient fire-light to enable you to discern the person of any one? A. Yes, if I was looking at them - but it was done so instantly; Allen was in the box when the landlord came, hustling with me; he got my handkerchief from me after the landlord came in.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINS. Q. Are you quite sure the chain taken from Allen was part of your's? A. I thought so then, and said I could swear to it; Relf sat outside me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Neither of the prisoners put out the light? A. I do not believe they did; I did not see the cock turned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason for swearing to the prisoners than their being nearest to you, and thinking nobody else could have got to you in so short a time? A. That is my reason; Relf never left my side - Allen's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140100"/>hand was examined before the Magistrate, and a piece was bit right out of his finger - Weeks found the chain on him - I did not see the end of it; I said there were three keys to mine - the constable of the night said there were only two; I said one might have been taken off in the scuffle - I said before the Magistrate that I bit Allen's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect whether you did not say one of the prisoners endeavoured to stop your mouth with a cloth, and you bit through the cloth and the person's hand? A. I did say that; I had produced a sovereign at the bar -Smith and his two friends, as he called them, were at the bar; Relf was one - I do not know the other.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN RENEW. I am a watchman. About half-past eleven o'clock I was two doors from the King and Queen, and heard a call of Watch! and Murder! - I called Williams over, and we both went in; I put my back against the door, and saw the prosecutor with his breeches down and his hat off - he said he was robbed, and gave Allen in charge - he staid at the bar.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILLIAMS. I am a watchman. I went into the house and saw the prosecutor - he said he was robbed; Allen stood against the bar - Renew sent me for the inspector, and he asked Fairburn if he could point out any body; he pointed out Allen - he was capable of answering me - he at first said he had two sovereigns, but at the watch-house he said two and a half; he said he had lost his watch, but on pulling his breeches up he found that - he was a little in liquor, but gave the name of the watch-maker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he drunk or sober? A. I cannot say he was particularly drunk - he appeared a little intoxicated and flurried; I saw him push my partner from the door - I do not know why.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. I was called in - the prosecutor was in front of the bar, with his clothes in a disordered state; I saw his watch handed over to the landlord - the prosecutor and Allen were having an altercation; Allen was saying, "Did I rob you?" or, "Was it I robbed you?" I then said,"Did this man rob you?" he said, "If he did not, he knows who did;" he was throwing his arms about and stamping - I cannot say he was sober; I searched Allen, and found on him two pieces of chain, and he handed over another piece - the two I found proved to be a whole chain, and had one brass key attached to it; I found a sixpence and a few halfpence on him - as I took the chain from him, the prosecutor said it was his, but on the Monday morning he disowned it, and it was restored to Allen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You have heard him say to-day it was not the same chain? A. It was the same as I found on the prisoner - I thought the prosecutor confused, and a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>THOMAS NICHOLS. I am constable of the night. Allen was brought to the watch-house - part of a chain was found on him, which the prosecutor claimed, and afterwards said it was not his; I considered him very much in liquor - he stated what he had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He seemed very much intoxicated? A. Yes; he at first said he had lost two sovereigns - then said two sovereigns and a half, and a black leather purse.</p>
               <p>HENRIETTA PARRINGTON. My father keeps the King and Queen; the prosecutor was not sober when he came in - when he came out of the tap-room he complained of losing his purse and chain; Allen said, "If you suspect me take me to the watch-house and search me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him strike your father? A. Yes; he also struck the watchman - when he first came into the house he stood at the bar, put a sovereign on the counter, and wanted to bet about a patent for blowing the gas out; no wager was laid - he appeared to have drank a great deal before he came in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did he charge any body besides Allen with robbing him? A. Yes, the watchman that he struck, and he also charged my father with it - I am sure my father had no candle when he came into the tap-room.</p>

               <p>JOHN POULTON. I am servant to Sir John Robinson, and was dining in the servant's hall. I heard a noise in the area steps, and saw the prisoner going up; I ran out and saw her crossing the road, with this desk under her arm - I followed and took her with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give it to you and tell you I had seen a person drop it? No; I saw her going up the steps with it - she said it was a box of linen; I said No, it was a desk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor; I saw a person drop the desk down the area - I ran down and slipped; I took it up, and directly the man came up I gave it to him.</p>

S. Pratt" - The 2nd of January was on a Saturday; the bristles were lying at Botolph wharf; an invoice was made out on Saturday respecting the delivery-order; an order was given for weighing the goods off on Saturday - I gave that order to his clerk; he had said he would send some body for the order to have the goods weighed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any arrangement made between you and the prisoner respecting the delivery-order and the payment? A. The cash was to be paid directly, because he wanted the goods immediately, as he wished two casks to send directly to Birmingham; when his clerk called for the order, he had not got the money - I said I could not give him the order for the delivery without the money, but I said I would send somebody with him to see them weighed, and would send our clerk on Monday with the delivery-order, and to receive the money - I sent Brown on Monday; he returned about twelve oapos;clock with the delivery-order, and without the money, and about half an hour after he returned the prisoner came to the counting-house, and said, "

You have sent the delivery-order for the money" - I said Yes; he said "Well, I will pay you directly" - the clerk had brought the delivery-order back, and it was on the desk in the counting-house; he said, "I have not got a cheque now in my pocket, but I will pay you directly, may I not have the delivery-order?" I said, "If you wish to pay me directly, I have no objection to give you the delivery-order" - I gave it to him; he went away with it - I went to Botolph-wharf directly after; I followed him immediately; and on getting there he had arrived, and was busy in removing the bristles away, putting them in a cart, loading them - I said, "You cannot have the bristles without first paying for them;" he said Why - I told him I did not know him and the reference he had given me was one which I could not trust; he said he would pay for them as soon as he had got them to his house - the cart was at this time standing on the wharf, and the carter with him; he said nothing about my accompanying the cart - he said he would pay as soon as they were at his house - as I did not trust him; he had no business to trust me, and he would not pay before the bristles were at his house, he mentioned, that he would pay for them at two oapos;clock, which was about the time they would be at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hour of two mentioned? A. Yes; it was mentioned by Mr. Pratt - this was about one oapos;clock; I consented to their being carted to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they to be delivered when they got there without his paying for them? A. Why, I expected he would pay for them; I had no authority to deliver them without being paid for, but I sold him the bristles, but my intention was not to let them go without the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have delivered them to him unless he was to pay for them on their arrival in Crispin-street? A. No, I would not have delivered them; Brown, the clerk of Botolph-wharf was present at part of the conversation - I then went home, intending to send another clerk to Crispin-street which I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your master sever appeared at all in the transaction? A. No, I did what I thought proper; there is a dealing in our trade called prompt - by that I understand cash down; so many days prompt means so many days credit - prompt without naming any days, I should think does not mean fourteen days; I should not understand it so; I gave the weighing order on Saturday - I sent the delivery order first on Monday; I afterwards gave it to the prisoner, and went soon after to the wharf - he had not got the bristles in the cart; he was busy when I came, but I stopped them - we then had a conversation, and he was to pay when they got to his house, which would be about two oapos;clock; I let him go on that, and hearing Brown, the warehouseman at the wharf, say he had known him several times receiving goods in a regular way before.</p>
               <p>Q. On those considerations you let the goods go, to be paid for when they got to his house, which you understood to be at two oapos;clock? A. Yes; I did not send anybody with the cart - I intended to send somebody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In consequence of what he said, did you let them go on condition that they should be paid for when they got to his house? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go to the prisoner's house afterwards? A. Not myself; I sent Brown, our clerk, to his house a little before two o'clock to receive the money, and I called on the 5th but not for the money - I called to get the money, or to see Mr. Pratt about the bristles - this invoice (looking at it) was written in our counting-house by one of our clerks; it is headed "Plaw and Co." which is the firm, but I do not know of any partner - the prisoner had written down references; I went to them, but was not satisfied with them at all - I did not state so before the Alderman I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the use of the reference, if he was to pay ready money? A. Because he might have brought more; we wish to know with whom we deal, and always have a reference.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Does prompt on delivery. mean fourteen days after? A. No; the four casks weighed about 20 cwt., and were worth 198l. odd.</p>
               <p>HUTCHINSON BROWN. I am clerk to Mr. Plaw. On the 4th of January, the last witness sent me to the prisoner's residence, No. 40, Crispin-street, to obtain the money for the bristles, before they were delivered out of the cart - I arrived there a little before two o'clock; the prisoner was not at home - the cart and the bristles did not come there; I remained there till five minutes past three, and left in consequence of being informed it was not likely he would return - there was abundance of time, from one till three o'clock, to carry the goods from the wharf, to that place again and again; I returned and told my employer what had occurred, and Henry Crump was sent there - he returned almost directly; I saw the bristles in the same casks as they were weighed in, at Mr. Kentapos;s in Falcon-square, on Tuesday, the 5th, about half-past three oapos;clock - he is a respectable gentleman, and deals largely.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140102"/>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.They were to be paid for at Crispin-street? A. My directions were to receive the money - the wharf is about a mile and a quarter from Crispin-street; I found he resided at the address he gave, and saw some females there.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you go on the Monday with the delivery-ticket? A. Yes, previously, and not seeing him there, and not receiving the money, I brought it back - I was told he was gone out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time would it take to convey the bristles from Botolph-wharf to Paucras-lane? A. About twenty minutes - that is not in the way to Crispin-street, but quite out of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did not Spaeth agree to let them go, provided he would pay him next day? A. I heard no such conversation between them -I am rather deaf, but if there had been a conversation of that sort in my presence, I should have heard it.</p>

            . I am a carman. On the 4th of January I took four casks of bristles out of a cart into my own, and took them to Pancras-lane, Queen-street, Cheapside - the prisoner directed me to go there, and came after me: he was there when I delivered them, and told me if I was asked where I delivered them, to say I delivered them into a waggon at Smithfield - they were housed in a warehouse on the left-hand side of Pancras-lane.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.When was you applied to to go to Broad-street? A.Between two and three o'clock; I was at the regular cart stand in Bishopsgate-street - Mr. Pratt merely said, "Bring your cart this way as fast as you can;" Roach was there with his cart when I got up.</p>

Kents would be in the way.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HIGGINS. I am foreman to Messrs. Kents. On the 5th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to the counting-house; I did not know he had been there before - in consequence of what passed I accompanied him to Pancras-lane, by order of Messrs. Kents, to examine four casks of bristles, which I found there - there was nothing else whatever; the place was quite empty - while I was examining the bristles he said he hoped I should report them as an article Messrs. Kents would purchase, as he had taken them for a bad debt; he asked what I thought they were worth - I said it was not a fair question to ask me; when I reported them to Mr. Kent, he would know how to deal with him - he then said,"My reason for asking is, because I don't know whether they may be worth 1d. a pound, or 20s.," (I think) - they were then brought in a cart to our warehouse; the prisoner followed them - an officer was waiting at our house, and took him into custody with the same bristles; "Brown's warehouse" was written over the door in Pancras-lane -I have seen a Mr. Brown, who I understand belongs to the premises; he went with us to see the bristles - he was waiting outside our premises, and the prisoner represented him as a friend of his, who had lost a great deal of money, and as we went along Brown said, "You may depend on it they are a good article, Sir, and I am only sorry for Mr. Pratt, for he has lost a good deal of money" - he gave the same account as the prisoner did, of having taken them for a bad debt, that it was all Pratt could get, and he had been a very great sufferer; I have not seen Brown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140103"/>since - I did not hear from him in the prisoner's presence that they were his premises, and did not know but they were the prisoner's.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty in Rose-street, Covent-garden; I heard the prosecutor talking with the prisoner, and passed them about five yards - he said, "This girl has robbed me of my watch;" I took her about four feet from him, and said, "Search yourself, and be sure you have not got it;" he searched himself down his thighs, and every where, and said, "I am certain I have not got it" - I pulled the prisoner's right-hand out of her muff, and then pulled the muff off the other's hand, and gave it to the prosecutor; she sprang to him and said, "You shan't have my muff," and put her hand into his trousers - he said, "She has put something into my trousers, I think it is my watch - take hold of my trousers, and don't let it fall, it may break;" I took up the watch, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you not every opportunity of looking into her hand before it got to the prosecutor? A. No, Sir - I thought it the best way for him to search himself, as he might be mistaken; she denied having seen it - she seemed a little the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking with him; he said,"Good God, I have lost my watch!" he put his hand into his trousers, and the watch fell on the ground.</p>

            . I am a barge-man. A load of corn was delivered to my care on the 12th of January, at the Adelphi; I assisted in loading the waggon - the loft they speak of is under the arches of the Adelphi, about one hundred and forty yards from where the waggon was - it is a loft not made use of, and I do not think it belongs to any one - sixty-five sacks were put into the waggon; I went for further orders, and the horses were put to it - the prisoner has worked for me several times, but not for a month before this; the oats were to go to Mr. Shenton, in Northrow - when they got there, one sack was missing; we lost three sacks about a month before - I was called to look at the oats, and have no doubt they belonged to Mr. Samuel Knight: the sack that had the oats in it, was marked 60, that I should know it.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Stanwell. I was in Stanwell-park on the night of the 5th of January; when I first saw the men they were hailed by the footman and gardener; as they were coming out of the wood they said, "Stand off, for our guns are loaded"- five of them had guns; I saw Sir John Gibbons down with one of the party, and a gun was levelled at him, a trigger was pulled, and fire struck; there was a flash not more than three yards from him, and it was levelled at him; I saw all the prisoners at the bar there - there were eight or nine persons there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Have you any doubt that they were there for the purpose of destroying game? A. No.</p>
               <p>CHARLES COODREE. I am a patrol. I assisted in taking Pond into custody, and the next morning we took the other two; White asked whether we had gone after any of the people down at Datchet; we said No - he then asked whether we had Carrod; we said No - he said he would go and show us his house; I had not told him what I took him for - while he stood in the street with my partner he said five of the others were to be found at Datchet; Carrod said but very little - he put on his shoes and stockings, and said he hoped he should not go to Clerkenwell; they asked if we had seen any of those who were with them, and who lived at Datchet; we said No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was the male prisoner discharged? A. Yes, on the 12th; I took him again yesterday week - he went to a public-house with his brother, who gave his word that he would not let him go.</p>

No; I succeeded him in the business; he was in the habit of dealing with me - the prisoner might enter any thing he purchased - there has been an entry in my book in the name of Duffield, but it has been scratched out by Mr. Duffield, because he did not order the goods; he lives about four hundred yards from me - the male prisoner left my shop about two o'clock in the afternoon on the 7th of December, and I did not see him again till he was in custody; he was not discharged by me, but he was let out of custody on the 12th of December, and was taken again last Monday at his brother's in the City, because I had fresh evidence from a person named Crute, a green-grocer - I knew Crute, but he told me nothing of this till Monday week: my book is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Are you able to say whether the male prisoner was at your house on the morning of the 7th of December? A. Yes, about seven o'clock in the morning - I saw Duffield scratch out the entry, which had been made by

On the 18th of December I saw Hook, whom I have known some years: he engaged me to drive this rope and twine over to the Borough, and promised to meet me there, but he did not come - I brought it back to my own yard, and it remained there till the 21st, when it was taken away; on Sunday, the 20th, I saw Hook, Wakeley, and another man - they were looking about my yard, and at the cart, and the goods in it; I was in the stable - they afterwards came into the stable to me, and asked if I or Amsdell were going to stand any thing to drink; I fetched some gin, and it was drank between us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Then you had these in your possession four or five days? A.

            . I am a Thames Police-officer. On the 23rd of December I apprehended Hook at his house; I told him it was on suspicion of a robbery at Mr. Newman's, at Deptford-creek - I did not threaten or promise him any thing, but the next day he told me that two men in a ship's boat, came and brought a quantity of line and twine to him - that he had hired a cart of Fitch's, and Fitch was not at home; he said he did not know the man who brought it to him, but he was to dispose of it, if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140108"/>could; that he could not dispose of it, and took it to Limehouse-cut, and hove it overboard; I asked if he knew the two men; he said he would tell me no more, as he had told me enough; I went to Wakeley's on the 22nd (I believe) with Judge and White - I found a quantity of lines, twines, and a bundle of box cord; some of them were in a water-butt; the officer who executed the warrant asked him about them, and he said Goddard brought them to his house - Wakeley is a dealer in marine-stores, and keeps a melting place: he had a crucible on the fire, and ran down 2 cwt. of metal while we were there: he is in an extensive line.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been an officer? A.Thirteen years; I never saw any silver melted at Wakeley's, but I have copper - it might be in his way of trade; he was in his back premises - the place is open in the day time; there was some new copper concealed under some sacks - White took that, but we have found no charge against him for that, but he could not give a satisfactory account of it before the Magistrate; he has been employed at that for years; I saw the twine found in the butt - I was at the cut on the 24th or 25th, I believe - I did not see Turner there; it was in the afternoon - I found some rope, which was rather dirty; that was not the reason which Wakeley assigned for putting it into the water-butt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.You did not persuade Hook to say any thing? A. No; I did not upon my oath - he boys some sort of twine for use in his business; I asked if he knew the two men, and he said he did not - I did not caution him against telling any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What time did you go to the cut? A.About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JUDGE. I went with this witness and White to Wakeley's premises, and in a stable, at the back of the premises; I saw a water-butt - I found something in it, got the tongs, and found a bundle of twelve skeins of box cord - Goddard and Wakeley were both present; I went the next day to the cut, with White, Gray, and Hughes, and found twenty-two skeins of what is called ground twine and thirty-eight skeins of twine and line - this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.What did either Wakeley or Goddard say? A.Goddard said, "We washed it all there;" we went to the cut, because Goddard said, if any body would go with him to the place, he would show where he took it up; he said, there was some more, no doubt - on the first day I had only a boat-hook and a rake to get it out, and on the second day, I got a pair of drags.</p>

            . This is the ticket which was on the ground twine at Mr. Newman's; I have looked at all the property, and believe it is all, that which was stolen from his premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Can you swear to this ticket as your hand-writing? A. Yes; it is never sent out with the goods - it is my place to take it off, and enter the goods in the book; I have sent out the goods ever since I have been there.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON to MR. NEWMAN. Q. Is the cord in the state, in which it is sold? A. It is a little altered with the wet - it has all little pieces of string to which tickets have been attached, and they have been torn off, which they are not when it is sold; the persons who came to me on the 11th of December, came to sell rope - we frequently buy old rope.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have customers any thing to do with the window, you saw Hook examining? A. No.</p>

            . I live in Hampshire - I had been here from a fortnight before Christmas. On the 31st of December I fell in with the prisoner and another man, about four o'clock in the afternoon, in Whitechapel; his companion spoke to me first, and we went into a public-house; the prisoner came in soon afterwards - we had a pint of ale; the prisoner spoke to the other man, and said he had lent a woman 5l. in the morning to go and get a bonnet - I told him he would never see the bonnet nor the money any more; he said he had been to the Bank, and had 800l. - I did not believe that; he asked if I had any money, and wanted me to pull it out -I pulled 19s. 6d. out of a purse, laid it on the table, and one of them put it into a hat; the other man then called me to the door, and said he was going to get change for a draft - he told me to go back, and take care of the prisoner; I went back to the room, but the prisoner was gone, and the money; I had been out of the room but a very few minutes - I had only 1 1/2d. left; I saw the prisoner in a week afterwards - there was no other person in the room who could have taken it; there was another door on the left-hand side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you told us all that happened? A. Yes; I did not tell the Magistrate that Dawson, the officer, told me what to say - I dare say I should not have come here if it had not been for him; I did not toss for any gin, but we drank 6d. of gin and water, which the prisoner paid for - the prisoner and the other man tossed, but I did not; there was some chalk made on the table, which they called their game, but I did not join in it - there was a piece of paper put into my hand, which they called a note, but I think it was not a note; I did not play any game with them - there was no other person in the tap-room; a boy brought in the gin and water; both the prisoner and his companion ran away - I did not call the landlord; the officer came in, and asked what I had been about - I told him; he had been watching them he told me; he went with my brother to look for them the next day - I do not remember the officer telling me what to say.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol, and have been so for four years. I was in Whitechapel a little after four o'clock, on the 31st of December; I saw the prisoner and a man named Duffey - seeing them with the prosecutor I watched them; they went down Brick-lane, and went into the Frying Pan - I said about twenty minutes, and saw the prosecutor and Duffey come to one door; the prisoner came out at another, and ran down Thrawl-street - Duffey left the prosecutor, and went towards Spitalfields; I went and asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing, and from what he said I took the prisoner on the following Thursday.</p>

            . I am steward of a ship. I was in the watch-house when the officer brought in the prisoner - the next morning the prisoner wanted some person to go and fetch his brother, but Dawson gave strict charge that no person was to see him: I interceded with a beadle, and he gave me permission to go for his brother, who came down with me; I was in the office next morning, and Dawson told the prosecutor to say he laid down the money through fear, and he tutored him what to say - I am sure he said so; I told the prisoner's brother; little did I think I should he called on here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to be at the watch-house? A. There was a fire, and I helped to extinguish it - I was to be paid for going to the prisoner's brother.</p>

I do not know such a man;" I said,"Do not you know the young man to whom you proposed to do that job for you at the counting-house?" he said,"I don't know him;" I said, "You must know the young man you gave 3l. to, to say nothing about it" - he went in, and staid about ten minutes, when he came out and said, "I can't see the other parties to-day;" I said, "It must be settled to-day between one and two o'clock, there is 50l. reward, and you must do the best you can, or things will go forward in the job" - he said,"Will you have any thing to drink?" I said, "I do not mind," and we went into a public-house, I believe the Antelope - I said I did not like gin, and we had a quartern of rum; we came out, and he said, "I will meet you to-morrow at the Robin Hood and Little John, between four and five o'clock" - I said that would do, but I did not go.</p>

               <p>- GHRIMES. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, and found a jemmy on him, five skeleton-keys, a bit of candle and a gimblet.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM REA. I am a commodore in the Company's employ. On the 28th of November I had charge of the room No. 83, on the third floor; the prisoner had no business there - I fastened that warehouse up at three o'clock; it was secured by iron doors - it contained chests of tea, piled up for delivery; a person could easily conceal themselves among the chests - on the Monday morning, about nine o'clock, I went to that warehouse, unlocked the door, and found some person had been there, and removed eight chests to make a platform under a loop-hole, which had been fastened up; a person could get on them, and reach the ceiling - there were marks of a crow-bar or instrument having been used to break through the ceiling, but it had not succeeded; there is a window in that room, leading to a staircase - I found the centre iron bar of that window was forced from the frame, and two squares of glass broken, so that they could get on the staircase; and that leads to a trap-door, communicating with a space between the ceiling and roof; there are steps on which a person could get up to the trap-door, and the hinges were forced off it - they could then get on the roof by unbolting another door; I informed French, the elder.</p>

               <p>JEREMIAH THOMPSON. I am a commodore in the Company's employ, and had charge of the rooms Nos. 68 and 69, in the Bengal department. On the 26th of November these rooms contained silks of various descriptions, crape, shawls, and very valuable property from China and Madras - I fastened both these rooms at three o'clock in the afternoon with iron doors; I returned on Monday at nine, and on entering No. 68 I found it in the utmost confusion, a number of presses were opened, silk goods taken from them, and scattered about the floor; no force had been used to the door of the room - a quantity of goods were gone from the tables and presses; I discovered two apertures in the ceiling, communicating with the roof - one would admit a man through it from the roof; I went into No. 69, found that in a similar state, and two holes in that ceiling, and a quantity of silk goods taken away; I found a bunch of small keys and a saw on the floor of that room - the boxes, containing the silk, had been opened; I am certain the ceilings of both rooms were entire on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>JAMES POPE. I am an elder, in the Company's service. I came to the warehouses, in Cutler-street, a little before nine o'clock: in consequence of an alarm, I went to the roof of the Bengal department, over Nos. 68 and 69, and found two large holes in the roofs of both rooms - a person could get on that roof, through the trap-door of No. 83.</p>

Butler called me: I went on the roof, and in different places I found a quantity of loose handkerchiefs, with a rope and crow-bar - the rope came down near the cistern; a man descending by it would come into the cistern - I went into Petticoat-lane, and found goods.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEALEY. Q.How far were you from the prosecutor's door, when you first saw the prisoner? A. It might be one hundred yards; he ran in a straight direction to the end of John-street, where he turned - that was two or three hundred yards from where he was stopped; he only turned twice, but I did not lose sight of him -I was a very short distance from him all the way.</p>

            . I am a broker. I was standing at the corner of Brick-lane - I saw the prisoner running with the bundle of flannel; I pursued him till he dropped it - I took it up and gave it to Mr. Goodinge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How far from the house did he drop it? A. Perhaps one hundred yards; it was dark, the gas was lighted - that part is very well lighted, it is near the gas-house; I did not see the prisoner stopped; I had not seen him before, but I met him then, and can swear to him.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am the officer. The prisoner was brought to me with this flannel; I searched, and found on him, this phosphorus-box, and a duplicate of a coat, which he said he had picked up.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I had been to Mr. Lawrence, in Clarendon-street, to fetch a box for Mr. Henderson, in Howland-street; I had but just got down stairs, when I heard Stop thief! called - I turned in the direction they were running, when I knocked against the man who took me - the watchman came up and said, I had a long coat on, and I was the thief - Mr. Brown would not allow me to send to Clarendon-street.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ALDRIDGE. Clarendon-street was not mentioned then; he asked if he could send to his friend - I did not hear the name of Lawrence.</p>

On the evening of the 9th of January I had been watching the prisoner and two others for some time - I missed them, and thought they had gone up White Lion-street; I turned, and met my partner - a person touched me on the shoulder and said,"Do you see what is going forward here?" I looked into the prosecutor's shop, and saw the three lads there - the prisoner and another went to the further end of the shop, and then two of them went to the counter - the shopman served them; I saw a brown paper bundle on the counter - the other two lads then went to the door, and the prisoner dropped this bundle from under his coat; I came round, and the other person had let the prisoner slip by him - I told my partner the prisoner had gone across the road; he went and brought him instantly - I had seen him go across the road and run down an alley; I am quite sure he is the person the parcel fell from.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you give information? A. About a quarter of an hour afterwards; I had never seen Coleman before, to my knowledge - this was about a quarter or half-past five o'clock: it was dusk - all I saw was Coleman receive some paper from one man and hand it to another; I had seen him come down the alley before he received the paper; I let out trucks. In June or July last I was taken up about some peas, but was acquitted; I had been tried two or three years before, for having been standing by some property which had been stolen - I was in prison here before the trial, but was not imprisoned six months afterwards here - I was tried over the water at the Town-hall, on suspicion of robbing my master, and committed to prison; I had not been on shore long before that - I was discharged in 1815; I have not been on shore ever since - I have made voyages to the East Indies; I never was transported - I have lived eighteen months or two years in Horse Shoe-alley; only one misfortune has happened to me since I have been there.</p>

On the evening of Thursday, the 31st of December, the witness gave me information - I went with Armstrong and Attfield to No. 4, Sander's-buildings, which the witness pointed out - I went to the first floor, where I saw the four male prisoners; the other two officers got in before me - I saw five reams of paper on the table, and a great quantity in a box; I saw Coleman throw something over a bedstead- I went there, and found this wrapper and this string, which he was pushing under the bedstead with his foot; Cook said we are all marplotted; Armstrong asked all the prisoners, one by one, about this paper, and they all answered that they knew nothing about it - Coleman said he had just come from the Salmon and Ball, in Bunhill-row, and had seen my son go in there; I said it was all right then: part of the paper was muddy - these covers were found there; this one is marked - some of the other reams had covers on them, but a great deal had been stripped off - we took the paper and the prisoners. I afterwards saw Mr. Alderman Key, who showed me some other wrappers, with marks on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did not Coleman say he had come there to a tailor to repair some of his clothes? A. No, he did not; my son is not here, but I have no doubt but he did go to the Salmon and Ball.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did not you say before the Magistrate that you believed Cook said they were all marplotted? A. I swore it there positively, as I do now, but the Magistrate said he thought it fairest that it should be inserted "I believe so;" I think

             was there, but I will not be positive - there was not a great deal of talking; they were all very quiet: I swear, to my belief, that Cook did use the expression - I never heard him say he had come home with the female prisoner half an hour before, and was regularly taken in; I do not think it is a house to which men and women resort.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BROWN re-examined. Q. How soon after you saw them go into the house did you give the information? A.About a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>JOHN COLES. I live with my father, who is a paper-manufacturer, at Wells, in Somersetshire. I have looked at this paper; it is our manufacture - we supply a person in Fleet-market, of the name of Morgan, with paper; we sent a lot of paper to him in a regular way, on the 14th of December - the first ream was No. 522, and the last was No. 612 - we put the letter 
               <persName id="t18300114-260-person1756">M. </persName>
            outside it - it is made with a stamp, which I cut out myself; it is but a common 
               <persName id="t18300114-260-person1757">M. </persName>
            - this M. on the wrapper, looks very much like it, and I believe it is the same - here is one ream of this; these reams are Nos. 536, 529, 562, 558, and 527.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you number your lots of paper? A. Every quarter of the year we begin with No. 1. - we have another customer, whose name begins with M. and mark his paper with the same stamp; I have our book here, and it appears that we sent these numbers to Morgan, in the second quarter of 1830 - our first quarter of 1830 began in July last, and ended in October, and our second quarter is from October to January - next July will be 1831 with us.</p>

            , ESQ. My partner's name is Jonathan Muckelstone Key - he is the only partner I have; we examined our stock of paper made by Coles, and missed ten reams; we received the paper from Mr. Morgan, of Fleet-market - the lots were from No. 522, to 612; I have examined the paper that was found - five of the wrappers have been destroyed, but I have examined the wrappers which were found, and in every instance we have the preceding number, and the succeeding one; we lost ten reams - they are worth about 9l. 10s. - I have no doubt these are ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see the numbers on those papers yourself? A. Yes; we wanted them for a particular purpose, and I waited till they came in - fifty-six reams were sent out the next day; when I heard of these being found, I went to the place they were sent to, and found fifty-two of them remaining at His Majesty's stationery office - I found the preceding, and the succeeding numbers to these, on those which remained at home; I am sure these had not been sent out.</p>

            ' Defence. I was coming down London-wall; I cast my eye up a gateway, where I stopped, and saw this paper lying in the wet - I brought it down as far as the gateway, and a boy was coming by - I asked him to lend me a hand to carry it, which he did; when we got to the place, it was heavy, and he let it fall off his shoulder - there was a young woman coming by, and I asked if we might leave it at a chandler's shop; the woman said No - I said we would take it up stairs; I did take it up, and tore off part of the dirty paper, and was going to put it into the box, to be out of the way; Cook and my sister did not come in for half an hour.</p>

On the 14th of September, I heard that Pichott had been to my house on the 13th; I then went to his house, and found my boxes, which were both open, and empty - when I sent them, one had been locked, and both were corded: there was a blanket laying on the floor- Pichott showed them to me, and he had left word at my house that he wanted me to go up there: when I went, he opened the door, and said he had been robbed, and all my things were gone - he then showed me my trunks, which were empty - I took Schofield there the next morning; he went out, and when he returned he said he had very good grounds for taking Pichott, as he believed Pichott or his wife, or some one in the habit of coming there, had committed the robbery; it was no stranger, he was quite sure - I then asked Pichott who was in the habit of coming there; he said, "Nobody but respectable people, indeed, none at all" - on the Thursday, I received information that Butler visited him; I went to Pichott, and told him what I had heard - he said, I must be very much mistaken, as he was a very respectable man; he said he did not know where he lived, but he believed his wife did - his wife was then called; she said she did not know - he then said he believed it was No. 80, Drummond-street I said I should go there the next day, and left the house - I went with the officer to No. 80, Drummond-street the next day - I saw Mrs. Butler; she said her husband was not at home, but a neighbour opposite said he was at home - I saw round Mrs. Butler's neck a coral necklace, which was mine, and had been in one of my boxes; directly we went in, she caught up a duster, and threw it round her neck, but it did not entirely conceal the necklace - the officer had some conversation with her; I said I had every reason to believe that was my necklace- she said it was not; I said it was, and described it, the clasp as a gold one, with a ring at each end and twisted; the officer told her to take it off, but she would not; I believe this veil and smelling-bottle to be mine, and these napkins - they were in the trunk - I afterwards went with the officer to Pichott's, and he said I must be mistaken, as there were so many necklaces alike, that I could not swear to it - the officer asked him if he had sent his wife to tell Butler; he said Yes, and he should again, if he liked - the officer said it was very improper, after having said he would assist me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Has not Pichott been a very respectable man? A. Yes; some of my property was found at Drummond-street - I have seen these napkins; one of the boxes was locked - I did not go with the porter, but I saw the boxes on his premises afterwards, though I did not open them when I went to tell Pichott that my husband was not coming there - he was arrested for debt on the 22nd or 23rd of August, and I had sent them there at the beginning of August; Pichott said he had come to me on the Sunday night - I did not see him, but I did not disbelieve what he said; he did not request me to take away the things that remained - I think Mrs. Pichott named that to me; he said he had left his house that Sunday at ten o'clock in the morning, and came home at nine or half-past nine in the evening, and then found the house had been robbed; I heard on the Tuesday after, from Mrs. Murray, who lives at No. 20, in the same place, that a strange man had been seen at Pichott's door - she also gave me information re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140120"/>specting Butler coming to Pichott's, and said she did not like him; she did not know now he got his living.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Had you known Butler before? A. No; I know the house I went to is their residence, because Pichott took me there, and the officer told her what I came about; the officer did not take the necklace from her neck - he said he would if I would give charge of her, but I must be very particular, and I wanted to go to a friend for her to see it as well as myself; I never got it at all; I went to Pichott's, and told him of it.</p>

            . On the morning of Tuesday, the 15th of September, I went to Pichott's house on a complaint of a trunk and box having been broken open - I saw Pichott who showed me a box at the entrance of the area, which he said had been left there full of articles on the Sunday, when he went out with his wife to spend the day, leaving the house quite safe - he said he likewise left a trunk full of articles belonging to Mr. Bellingham; I asked how he supposed they got in - he said by the area door he supposed, which had been left on the single lock; he showed me a shutter put too so as not to be seen, and likewise a key-hole, with some paper put in, in a door which he said he supposed they entered; it was not broken at all - he then took me up stairs to the parlour floor, and showed me a trunk, which he said he supposed had been taken up stairs, that it might not be so public as from the window below - both the boxes had been broken open as it appeared with an instrument with two prongs; I asked if any body had been to see him lately - he said no one, but there was a person living over the stable who might have access to the premises, and there was a door leading out of the stable - I went out, saw the coachman, and then went into the mews, and from what I heard there I returned, and wished Mrs. Bellingham to give charge of Pichott; she said she had known him so long she could not suspect him, and he went on appealing to God that he was no thief - I said, when he had done, "I must do my duty:" I then asked where he had been that day - he said to dine with a friend, and had returned in the evening; that he had left no one in the house, and had no strangers to visit him; on the following Thursday I got further information from the same parties, in consequence of which I suspected Butler - I got Mrs. Bellingham to the office, but in consequence of her good opinion of Pichott she would not take the oath; we went to Butler's, and saw the necklace round Mrs. Butler's neck - Mrs. Bellingham said it was hers; I told her to be very cautions, as I had seen a similar one round her neck before, and she would not give charge of her- Mrs. Butler said she would let Mrs. Bellingham go about the house with her, but not me, as I had no warrant; some words took place, and Mrs. Bellingham ran out of the house I staid some time, and then I went out; Mrs. Bellingham then said she would go to Pichott's; we went there, and found him and his wife - I told them about the necklace; Pichott said it was all false, it was not her necklace, he was sure -I then said I could do no more; I thought they were all bad characters together, and I left the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did not Pichott offer you every assistance throughout the business? A. Yes, he did, and the prosecutrix refused to give him in charge; I did not take him - he had time to run away if he chose; I did not see Butler on any of these occasions, but the prosecutrix would not take out a warrant - Mrs. Butler showed her her drawers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear on the Tuesday that Mrs. Murray had said some person was about the house? A. She gave me information at first that a person had been lurking about there, but she only described his person; she afterwards told me she heard his name was Butler - when I went to Pichott's on the Friday, I said, "You know you sent your wife last night to Butler, to warn them of my coming" - he said he had, and he had a right to do it; he was a very respectable man.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police. On Sunday, the 6th of December, Butler was taken on another charge; I searched his house, No. 80, Drummond-street - I found in a chest of drawers, in the back parlour, these five table napkins, a white lace veil, these pieces of lace, a smelling-bottle and work-box, and in the kitchen I found this large table-cloth; on Tuesday, the 8th, I went to No. 25, Chester-terrace, and saw Pichott moving his goods in a four-wheeled van - the man belonging to the van was coming up with a table on his shoulder; I asked Pichott if Butler was there on the Thursday- he said No, but he was there on the Sunday: I said I was an officer, and wanted to search the house - he said I was welcome to do so; the van was full of boxes, which were taken to the watch-house, and Pichott also - he said all the boxes were his property; when we got to the watch-house, I got a light, and said, "I am going to search the boxes, which are yours?" he said, "The whole of them"- Mrs. Pichott was present at the time; I found this sheet and these table-napkins in the boxes - this centre-bit, these picklock-keys, and these tools, I found at Butler's.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was Butler in custody on the Sunday? A. Yes, on another charge - I found this key in one of Pichott's boxes, which has been altered, - I call it a skeleton-key; it did not open the prosecutor's box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Do you know what a skeleton-key is? A. Yes - I consider this to he one, because it has been altered; Pichott did say his wife knew more about these things than he did - it was on the Tuesday after I found these things at Butlet's, that I took up Pichott; I do not know whether he knew that I had found things at Butler's - I know that Pichott had only been minding that house for Mr. Robins, and he was obliged to remove that day; Mr. Robins' clerk was there - both Pichott and his wife persisted in saying they were all their's till they were going away, and then one of them said there was a little square oak box, which belonged to Watkins, a lodger; I took Watkins into custody - I received some information from Mrs. Murray, and took up another person, which I supposed was in this business; that was a person named Stevens, or Simpson, who I believe is here: I did not take up any other man; I have not confused the articles found at the different prisoners; I could not put any of the articles found at Butler's into Pichott's boxes, because they were locked up - some persons came to look at the things; I had them taken out, and put aside - I put them in, but one sheet was left out; I would not unlock the boxes again, as I was very tired, and I put it into Watkins' box - I am quite sure I did not make any other alteration; I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140121"/>to Mrs. Pichott those things which the Magistrate ordered me - I had given her things to furnish one room, and she was dissatisfied with it; she came before the Magistrate, and had every thing that was in the place -I had a receipt from her, and she wanted me to have something to drink, but I would not till one afternoon, when she and her friends urged me to have some.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.What day did you go to Butler's? A. On Sunday, the 6th of December -I do not know when Schofield went; I saw Mrs. Butler in the passage - a young woman lodges in the house, a little girl, and a lad; no resistance was offered to my searching.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You say one sheet was put into Watkins' box? A. Yes; that sheet has not been given back - it is at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>MRS. BELLINGHAM. These three napkins and this sheet are mine; I have some of the same - they are not marked, but I can swear to the work and the width of them; they were bought about two years ago - I have the fellow sheet, and this exactly agrees in size; it is Russia sheeting - I bought the remnant; each of these napkins are separate and complete - they are not cut out of one piece; they are all alike, and all perfect - this table-cloth was marked with ink, but it does not appear; all these things, and a great many more, were in the boxes I sent to Pichott's -I lost every thing but what I stood up in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is your husband in confinement? A. He is in prison for debt; I had the charge of my own property and linen - he had not applied to the Court; he had no schedule at the time - Pichott said he had called to let me know of the robbery on the Sunday, and he called on the Monday; I do not know that Butler was more acquainted with Mrs. Pichott than with him - the house in Chester-terrace is a large respectable house.</p>

            . I am coachman to Colonel Beechy, of No. 22, Chester-terrace. I live in the house, and my wife lives in the mews at the back of those premises; I heard of this robbery on the Monday, from Mrs. Pichott - there was nothing in the course of the Sunday, the 13th of September, to give me any alarm; my wife had locked the back premises of No. 25, and put the key in a secret place for me - I found it there; my wife took care of the back premises for Mr. Nourse, the builder.</p>
               <p>ANN MURRAY. I live at No. 20. Chester-terrace. I remember the robbery on the Sunday; I did not see any person waiting about, and did not give any information to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. On Sunday, the 13th of September, did you see any person with bundles? A. I saw a man coming out of No. 25, with bundles, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, while the bells were going for church; he passed me, and I remarked it to Mr. Jones, my next door neighbour - I do not know that I had seen that man before or since; I am quite sure he came out of the house - he did not shut the door, nor attempt to shut it; Mrs. Jones said she thought Pichott was out of work, and might be going in the country - I have seen Butler coming to the house - I have heard he is an acquaintance of Mrs. Pichott's; I did not know Pichott till after this - I have seen Butler watching till he went in.</p>
               <p>Picholt's Defence. I have only to observe, that on the Sunday morning I went out with my wife to a place of worship near Fleet-market; I dined with a friend in Fleet-street, and then went over to a friend in the Borought - I went to the same place of worship in the evening, and returned home at nine o'clock; I opened my house, and it had been robbed - I never saw such confusion in my life; I called in the watchman, and we went over the house - the bed and bed-clothes were thrown about the room; I cannot help saying that I am surprised at Mrs. Bellingham lodging a detainer against me, after knowing me for sixteen years, and I defy her to charge me with one blot in my character - I never was confined in a watch-house for half an hour for drunkenness or bad behaviour, much less for such a crime as this; I am innocent in the sight of God and to your sights - it will be proved by the watchman.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH JONES. I am married. On the 13th of September I lived at No. 21, Chester-terrace. I was standing at the hall door, and saw a person come out of No. 25, with a large bag over his right shoulder, and a large bundle; I know Pichott and Mrs. Pichott - I never saw Butler go in there soon after Pichott had come out; I saw Butler one morning stand at the end of the terrace, but I do not know whether Pichott was at home - it attracted my notice - it might be about ten minutes past eight o'clock in the morning; he was waiting at the bottom of the terrace, and then he walked too and fro - I did not observe any thing more; I do not know whether he went in or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you see the person come out of the house? A. No; he passed close by me - it was not Butler.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make application to any Police-office? A. No, I was not ordered; Pichott came and said "My house is robbed - you go in with my wife; I am going a little way, and shall soon be back;" I fetched Smith, the next watchman.</p>

            . I live in Maze-pond, and am a tailor. On Sunday, the 13th of September, Pichott was at my house to tea; I think between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What makes you sure it was that day? A.On account of my other friends telling me it was that day - I have no other proof, only what my friends have told me.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.Did you understand where he was going when he left you? A. I understood to Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WELLS. I am a cheesemonger, and live at No. 58, Blackman-street. I have known Pichott seven years - he has had a very honest character; he came to me some time the latter end of last year, and said he had been robbed of some things of his own, but he did not care about them, but he had lost some things of a friend, which he was very sorry for - it was one Saturday night as I was outside my shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was that? A. I think he said he had been robbed the Sunday before; it might be in September or October, but I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>- WATKINS. I lodged with Pichott; Butler was in the habit of coming to the house, and I understood Mrs. Pichott had known him previous to her marriage - I do not recollect seeing Butler there above once, which was about a fortnight or three weeks before the apprehension of Pichott; I was at home, and Mr. and Mrs. Pichott, and I believe another person; I recollect Butler seemed a great deal agitated - he said he was determined to leave his wife, and he had been trying to make it up with her for two years - he had a great coat on his arm, and I heard that two bundles were brought in; I heard Pichott advise Mrs. Pichott not to have any thing to do with them, because Mrs. Butler might come; I do not recollect seeing the bundles, but I understood they were taken away again.</p>
               <p>MRS. DAINTRY. I live at No. 24, Walnut-tree-place, Lambeth - I happened to call at Pichott's about a fortnight before he was apprehended; I saw Butler come there about six o'clock in the evening; he rang the area bell, and Mrs. Pichott answered him - he came into the bed-room where Mrs. Pichott and I were talking; he passed the room in which Pichott and Watkins were sitting; he said he called for the bundle, and I saw two bundles produced, and two great coats - he took something out of one of the bundles, and took the bundles away; he put on one great coat, and took the other with him on his arm - he took something out of one of the bundles, gave it to Mrs. Pichott, and said, "I wish you would give these shirts to be made for me as soon as you can;" he was not in Pichott's or Watkins' company at all that day, unless he saw them in going down the area steps.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOSKINS. I live in Fleet-street, and am a merchant. Pichott came and dined with me on the 13th of September - we dined about two o'clock, I believe, and he left me about three.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know it was the 13th of September? A. From a printed plan; I have no memorandum of it - it was brought to my recollection when I heard of this; I do not belong to the congregation in Harp-alley - here is the plan by which I know he came.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Is it not a regular plan that one of your friends takes the preacher to dine with them? A. Yes - it was so then from a written plan.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Would he have dined with you if he had not preached that day? A. No - I have no acquaintance with him, but as a preacher.</p>
               <p>COURT to MRS. BELLINGHAM. Q. Had you taken lodgings there? A. I was to lodge there for six weeks or two months till my husband returned; I was to pay him for it, and find the bed.</p>
               <p>Pichott. She had not taken any lodging, it was a matter of favour.</p>
               <p>Butler. This man is innocent - James is the man who did the robbery, and the things found in his possession were left there.</p>

On the 23rd of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was behind the counter; the prisoner came in, and asked for some ribbon which she had left a little while before - she asked for some flowers, bought one, and paid for it; I saw her take this piece of ribbon out of the drawer, put it on the counter, and cover it with her pocket - handkerchief, and while I put away the ribbon drawer she put the ribbon into the handkerchief, and put it into her bosom; I gave her a bill for what she had bought, which came to 11 1/2d. - she gave me a shilling, and I went to get a farthing; I told Mr. Butt what I had seen - he came up and said,"What have you got in your pocket-handkerchief?" she said, "This is what I have got." and she took it out of her handkerchief - this is the ribbon.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker , and was in my master's shop in Wheeler-street. I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor about twenty minutes before nine o'clock - I heard Stop thief ! repeated ; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner, and the prosecutor challenging him, and desiring him to give him his cap - I heard the prisoner say, "I will give you a bl - y punch in the mouth;" the prisoner was walking fast, but not running - the prosecutor was in the road by the side of the curb - I left my door when I heard the threat repeated, and said to the prisoner, "Give the boy his cap:" the prisoner said he had not the cap, and had not taken it, but as the snow had fallen the day before, I saw something like a cap , but I cannot say it was that - it was gone in a moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down the street , and saw the prosecutor and some other boys playing at snowballs; the prosecutor then came and asked me for his cap - I said I had not his cap, and had not had it; I told him I would hit him in the mouth - the witness said he saw me throw the cap down; he went away, and some other persons came up - the witness then returned , and said he did not see me throw it down.</p>
