                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Mr. Huntley Bacon, who lives at Bound's-green, in the parish of Tottenham—he has a wood near his house, called Dampford-wood, in which game is preserved. On Sunday, the 20th of last March, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was in the neigh<lb/>bourhood of the wood, and saw five persons at a little distance—the pri<lb/>soner was one of them, and Kitley, the two Pages, and Cartwright were the others—when I first saw them they were Coming towards Dampford-wood—they beat the wood—there was game in it—they had two dogs with them—they saw me, and began to run away—I said "It is no use for you to run away; I am determined to have you"—at that time I was by the side of the wood—as I was passing by the side of the field adjoining the wood I saw a dog coming towards me—it was a lurcher, which is a dog used by persons who go after game—I shot it and went towards the men—another dog came out soon after, and I called out to scott, the shep<lb/>herd, who was coming towards me, to shoot that dog, because my gun was fired—Scott shot the dog—I called to him to do so loud enough for three or four of the men to hear, but I cannot say about them all—some were in advance of the others—I think some of them could see the shepherd shoot the dog—we then went round to the end of the wood where the men were, and they were running away—when we got to the end they had all got into Mr. Rhodes's land—I did not follow them out of Mr. Bacon's premises, seeing their number was greater than ours—I did not go beyond master's land, but turned back for more assistance—I did not procure it directly—I did not return to the wood for a long while afterwards—I left Scott to see what was done—I returned I suppose in about two hours after, but did not find any of them there, but as I was returning, they all five followed me running up, and Smith called out "Shoot the b——b—"—when I returned they were in Mr. Rhodes's field—I did not see Kitely have any thing at that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300006"/>
               <p>time—Smith had a gun when I saw him in the first instance—that was a few minutes before I shot the dog—two hours elapsed between that and my return—he had no gun with him when he made use of the expression—upon his saying, "Shoot the b——b——," the two Pages, Kitley, and Cartwright ran up after me and hallooed out to me in the same manner—the prisoners ran with them—he was first—I ran as fast as I could towards home to get away from them—when I got into a field called Twenty-acre Bottom, which joins the wood, I observed Kitley in advance of the rest—I turned my head round to see where he was, thinking I was getting further from him, but still he was gaining ground on me—he had a gun in his hand—after running some distance, as soon as I turned round to see where he was, he fired at me—he appeared to me to level the gun as opposite to me as he could, and then fired at me—I was about fifteen yards from the end of the field—when the gun was discharged I heard the contents rattle over my head like a hail-storm, and rush into the hedge behind me—I should say Kitley was from forty to fifty yards from me when he fired—after he fired at me I told Scott to fire at him, and he did, and I then went home for assistance—Kitley and George Page were taken that night—I believe Smith was in Mr. Rhodes's field at the time Kitley fired at me, close by—I think he had not got over the hedge at the time Kitley fired-Kitley had come through Mr. Rhodes's field to the Bottom, but I belive the prisoner had not got over the hedge—I saw Smith again that same evening, about six o'clock, very near Colney-hatch, walking on the cause-way with young Page—I afterwards saw him in custody—he was hand<lb/>cuffed to young Page, and put into a cart by Foster and Fowler the con<lb/>stables, and they were consigned to the care of Scott the shepherd—from that time I have not seen him till within these last few days—I believe he lived in the parish of Finchley—search was made after him from that time—I searched for him myself, but was never able to find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mrs. Anne Talfourd, who lives in Nor<lb/>man-house, North-end, in the parish of Fuiham. I have been in her service better than four months—on the 14th of January, about a quarter put seven o'clock in the morning, I found the back parlour shutters and window open—it is on the ground floor—I was in that room the night before about ten o'clock—Mrs. Talfourd was in that room at ten o'clock—the left the room to go to bed then—I was there then and observed that the window was fastened with a little catch which goes into a loop—I fastened it myself—there were three other servants in the house—I was up first in the morning—I observed some castors on the floor, and the chiffonier there they bad been the night before, open—I missed four salt-spoons from the chiffonier, a mustard-spoon, a silver tea-pot, a silver cream-jug, the silver top of the pepper-castor, and the Missionary box, which is a box to collect money for the ministers abroad—I found the Missionary box in the garden open and empty, and I found a work-box under a tree opposite side window—that was not open—I have not found any of the silver or other articles—I observed some footmarks on the flower bed—one footstep was right up to the window—they were. the footsteps of two people—I saw a ladder at the bottom of the garden, up against the wall, on the garden side—it is a very high wall—the ladder belongs to a market gardener next door—it was a strange ladder to me—I saw footsteps going towards the ladder from the flower bed—the ladder was more than the length of this court from the window—the window had been opened with a chisel—there were marks of a chisel having been put in underneath and prised it up—there was a curious mark in one heel of the footsteps—I know nothing of the prisoner—it was not light enough to see without a candle when I got up—I should not have known the face of a man without a light—Mrs. Tal<lb/>fourd is a widow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Fulham—I know Mrs. Talfourd's house, it is in the parish of Fulham—I heard of the robbery between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, the 14th—on the night before, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was in Star-lane, Fulham-fields, about four hundred yards from Mrs. Talfourd's garden wall, and saw the prisoner and two others—they were going in a direction towards the garden, and they said, "Good night"—I knew the prisoner before—I was side by side with him—I was going to Hammer<lb/>smith, and he was going towards Norman House—I am quite positive of him—there was a constable with me—the prisoner said, "Good night," and the constable said, <hi rend="italic">"Night"</hi>—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—I have not the least doubt of him—I took him into custody about seven o'clock the next evening, in a public-house at Hammer-smith—I found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I took him to the station-house and gave him in charge—I also found a pair of gloves and a silk handkerchief on him—on the Sunday morning I took his shoes off—he is lame, and both his feet are not alike—here are the shoes—I went with them to the garden between to and eleven o'clock—I noticed the window, it had been prised up to force</p>

               <p>the thing off the hook—they could then get in—there is a flower-bed under the window, there were tracks upon it of only one person—the window might be about four feet from the bed—any body opening the window, could get in easily enough—I also observed tracks in other parts of the, garden towards the garden wall—there appeared tracks of two persons in, the garden, and three outside—I observed the tracks of two persons just under the window, as if walking backwards and forwards—they had been to two windows—there was only the track of one person under the window which was open—the tracks of the other person were within two yards of that window—there was the mark of the heel of a left foot without a tip under the window—the shoes were right and left—on the right foot there was a quantity of nail marks to be seen—there has been a piece of of iron round this heel, but the half is worn off—the ground was all fresh dag, and was soft—I applied this shoe in the presence of the witness, and the Inspec<lb/>tor—I looked at the foot, then put it down gently to see if it fitted, and it fitted in every respect—I also put it down at the side of the impression once, and found it corresponded—it left an impression just the same—there are three nails—there was only the impression of one which sticks up the highest—I could not discern the others—here is a double row of iron nails, I could not discern that, but they corresponded in every degree, and so did the im<lb/>pression I made with the shoe—the prisoner being lame, this right shoe in made high to keep him level—there are seven nails on one side, and six and four on the other, and as he came from the ladder, this was the first foot he had put down—the flower-bed goes all round the garden from the ladder to the window, and I traced that from the ladder, right up to the window step by step—the precise number of nails were to be seen, and where he had made a false step the impression was to be seen—we could count the nails—on one place was seven nails, and the other places two rows of six, and the shoe is worn more down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the police—I was present on Sunday, the 15th, when the two shoes were applied to the tracks in the gar<lb/>den—they agreed in every respect—I applied the one with the tip off the heel, to the side of the other mark, and it entirely corresponded with it, and then we applied it to the track itself—we applied the right shoe in the same way in several places, both in the track, and by making one with it, in my judgment both exactly fitted—it is quite a common thing for a man in the prisoner's station in life to have nails and iron tips—I could make out the precise number of nails—seven nails—six within and four on the opposite side—the servant saw them compared inside the garden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in the Liverpool-road on the night of the 10th, and about two o'clock in the morning I observed a light moving about in the bar of the Rainbow pub<lb/>lic-house—part of the bar window is towards the street—I likewise heard a noise similar to something being wrenched off a door—I think that noise was at the street door, but I cannot be certain—I then crossed over the road, and as soon as I stepped up to the door, on the pavement, the light dis<lb/>appeared—I then went round to the back part of the house to see if any body was going up stairs with a light—I could see no light at all—I then came round quickly to the front of the house, and the light was again in the bar—I made a noise with my feet, and the light again disappeared—I waited a short time and it appeared again, and shortly afterwards my brother officer came up—I spoke to him—he went to the back, and I gave an alarm at the front of the house—I knocked at the door—the light was burning when I knocked, but disappeared immediately—I waited a few minutes, but finding nobody came, I went round to the side wall—the prisoner was in the prosecutor's yard—he immediately jumped over at the bottom, and crossed a piece of waste ground to the outer wall—he got on the prosecu<lb/>tor's wall, and I kept him in sight till he was taken on the outer wall—I got into the prosecutor's yard, but could see nobody else, and we took him to the front of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook in the service of Mrs. Booth. On the 9th of December I got up from seven o'clock to twenty minutes after—I went down into the kitchen, and opened the kitchen window next to the cup<lb/>board—I had seen that cupboard safe the night before, and had the key in my pocket—I found the cupboard broken open, and my bonnet-box, which had been in it, broken open and drawn out, and the things in great disorder—it is a box which locks—I missed out of the cupboard a gown and three collars—the kitchen drawers were pulled out, and the kitchen is great disorder—the window-shutters were fastened, I think, as I had left them overnight—I cannot swear to that, but they were fastened in the morning—the area door door stuck so fast that I could not open it—I was obliged to get out of the kitchen window to force it in—we could not pall it in from the inside—it is the kitchen door, leading to the area—I do not know what made it stick so fast—I went up stairs immediately to call the house-maid, who was in the act of dressing—I called up the footman, who slept in the next room to us at the top of the house—nobody slept down stairs—the footman and I went down stairs first, and went into the dining room—I do not think it was above twenty minutes after seven o'clock when I called him—he got up, and merely put on some of his things—he was not quite dressed when he came down—I found him fast asleep when I went into his room—his door does not lock—his time of rising was ge<lb/>nerally later than that—I was generally the first down—on going into the dining-room with him, we could observe a silver cover, which laid on the carpet, shine from the reflection of the gas over the fan-light as the dining<lb/>room door was open—we went down into the kitchen—the house maid by that time met us, and we returned to the dining-room with a light—we saw the things were gone out of the dining-room, as we saw the drawers forced open—the cupboard door was open where the plate was kept, and the side-board drawer, where the silver knives and forks were kept, was open—the cupboard is in part of the side-board—the plate is kept in a different cupboard—there is a side-board besides—plate was kept both in the cupboard and side-board, and they were both broken open—the lock of a tea-caddy was broken open which stood alongside the side-board on legs—I had nothing to do with the plate in the dining-room, and cannot say what was missed—I sent the house-maid up for my mistress immedi<lb/>ately, while we were in the dining-room—I found the street door on the spring-lock—I believe the footman fastened it the night before—there are two bolts, a chain, and lock and key to it—I never saw either of the pri<lb/>sonors till I saw them at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>I now live at No. 11, Vere-street—on the 9th of December I lived at No. 18, Vere-street—the prisoners Livingston and Ligo were living there together as man and wife all the time I was there, which was thirteen months—I knew Ligo by the name of Mrs. Livingston—on a Friday morning, in the early part of December, (I had been up the chief of the night,) and about six o'clock, I heard a coach draw up to the door—being so soon in the morning I threw up the window sash—the window looks into Vere-street—I saw Henry Livingston and two other men get out of a hack<lb/>ney-coach, and saw Ligo looking out of the window of the room below at the time, she had her head out—I saw Livingston and the other men bring some bags out of the coach—they were dark black bags—they brought them in at the street-door, and I then left the window—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a bag</hi>) the bags were like that—I went out on to the landing, and heard Ligo on the stairs—I heard them bringing up the bags—they went into Livingston's room—about half-past seven o'clock I met Ligo on the staircase, she was bringing in some bread and something white in a cup, which smelt to me like aquafortis—I passed her and smelt it—it has a very strong smell—I saw a great many persons in Livingston's room in the course of the day—I saw Jones there going in and out—I should think I saw him there as early as nine o'clock in the morning—I noticed the features of the two other men who came in the coach with Livingston, and should know them again—I saw Jones several times in the course of the day—I did not see him doing any thing—he was only on the stairs going into Livingston's room—he went to it and returned several times in the course of the day—I saw Livingston between two and three o'clock that afternoon go out of the house with a large hamper on his back—he carried it to a hackney-coach which was waiting at the top of Vere-street, in Duke-street, and put it in—it was five or six houses from No. 18—there was no difficulty in drawing the coach up to the house—the coach was coming there, but the persons inside called to the coachman to turn back and wait at the top of the street—after Living<lb/>ston put the hamper into the coach it went away—I saw Ligo in Living<lb/>ston's room that evening—the police-officers came to the house that same evening—I am sure it was the same evening—I took Ligo some breakfast next morning to the station-house—she said she was much obliged to me for bringing it—she took two rings off her finger and asked me if I would pledge them for her, to get her some money, as she had none, and I took them—that was on the same Saturday—I saw the prisoner Jones, I believe it was on the Tuesday afterwards, at a stable-yard—he asked me if Ligo had said any thing—I said she had not said any thing to hurt any one—he said he hoped she would not, for if she did, it would bring a world of people into trouble—he said I was to beg of her not to mention his name, for as he was in it he thought of going away, but he could stop until Livingston was taken—he did not say any thing more then—I saw him again at the same place—it is about five minutes' walk from Vere-street, at the bottom of Drury-lane, where he worked—I asked him for some money for Ligo—he said he could not send her any, for he must keep what he had for him self, because, he said, if Livingston was taken he must get away, and he thought as it was, the sooner he got away the better—I had seen Livingston on the Thursday evening, the night before the coach came, between eight and nine o'clock—I went into his room to ask him to let me have a little boiling water—there was a looking-glass in the room and two candles before the glass—he was dressing his hair, and when he turned round to</p>

On the 9th of December, a little after six o'clock in the evening, I went to No. 18, Vere-street, Clare<lb/>market—I went into the front-room first floor and found Ligo there alone—on going in she said, "You have made a mistake, and come into the wrong room"—I said, "Oh no, I have not"—she said, "Yes, you have; there is nothing here"—I had not intimated that there was any thing there—I looked about the room and saw this hamper—it was tied together, and a smaller sized hamper stood by the side of it, which had nothing in it—two bundles were standing on the chair by the side of the hamper, and in them I found property which Mrs. Booth has identified—I found these two black bags by the side of the chair, and in a drawer 1 found a blue bag—I asked Ligo who lived there with her, and what bis name was—she said she did not know—I asked her how he got his living; she said she did not know what his name was, nor what he did for a living; she had been there but a short time, and could give no account of him at</p>

               <p>all—I cut the hamper open and found four plated dish-heaters, which Mrs. Booth has identified, three plated dishes, and two ice-pails—the insides are not in them—I have seen them since at Mrs. Booth's—Ligo was present when I took the things from the hamper—I do not remember asking her any questions about them—she said she did not know how they came there, for she had been out—she was not speaking of those particular dishes—she said she had been out—that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had made her go out, taking the poker and threatening to knock her down, or kill her with the poker, if she did not go out—she said she had been out the whole of the day—I am tore of that—I searched the drawers—they were all unlocked—I found a dark lantern, wrapped up, and a handkerchief containing a lamp, these two life-preservers (they are loaded with lead, the handle is of whalebone, and is flexible) a centre bit, a quantity of skeleton keys, some lucifer matches, and a piece of sand-paper, which will ignite them—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here drew the match through the sand-paper, and it ignited</hi>)—I also found two pairs of scales, and three Sets of plate weights, which are used to weigh gold and silver metal—I saw Fletcher take down a tea-cup containing aquafortis—that is not here—I found those articles of jewellery which have been produced to Mrs. Booth—here is a metal bell, the top of box, gold, an enamelled case, a gold figure seal, a small crucifix, another mull gold seal, with an owl on it, a gold frame of a box, a wine label, and a swivel seal, broken—three drinking glasses were on the table, with a decanter empty by the side of them, and some pipes, three of which had been used—here is a piece of green baize, which was found in the bottom of one of the wine-coolers—it is the bottom of a candlestick—there is resin on it, and it is also burnt by fire—aquafortis is used for the purpose of trying gold, by dipping things in it and applying it to the gold, if it is good gold it has no effect, but if base metal it immediately turns green—I took Ligo into custody—I was with my brother officer when Jones was apprehended in Zoar-street, Gravel-lane, Lambeth—I know he carried on business in Drury-lane—I had been to look after him there before that, but could not find him—I did not ask for him—I had been looking out for him for more than a week—I cannot exactly say how long—he is a van-man, as I understood—his brother and he have a van and a cart between them for the purpose of moving goods—when we apprehended him, Keys said, "Oh Jones, we want you"—I believe he asked what it was for—Keys and I were together—he went in rather before me at the door—I did not hear the whole of the conversation—I know that Keys said something about the robbery to him, and Jones said he knew nothing about it—I heard him say so—he was taken into custody—Livingston was afterwards taken, I saw him in custody at Bow-street, and asked him who he would wish to have the things that were in his room—he said his brother—his brother was present at the time—he was called up, and I called Fletcher up to give him the key—he had not got it then, but he had it afterwards—I asked him at another time respecting two boxes, containing some women's wearing apparel, and said Ligo's sister had claimed them, and asked him whether I should let her have them—he said yes, they were hers, she might as well have them—there was a new shawl found in the drawer—I said Ligo's sister claimed that, and he said she might have it—went to Mrs. Booth's house, and examined the kitchen window—the fastening was out of order, and a person from the outside could throw the window either up or down—there were shutters—by pushing one shutter, and drawing the other towards you, you might introduce a thing of this</p>

On friday, the 27th of January, I was coming down that street, about a quarter before eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing close to the window of Mr. Watkins's shop—as I passed the window I beard a crash of glass—I immediately looked round and saw his hand in the window—I am quite sure I saw his hand within the window—he ran away—I ran after him, and collared him—he said he had only broken the window—he knocked off my hat—I let him go, but did not leave him—I took him back to Mr. Watkins—he walked back with me, as a mob had assembled he could not get away—a policeman was sent for, and he came—a person spoke to the prisoner as I was leading him back to Mr. Watkins's, but I could not tell what the person said to him.</p>

On Friday night the 27th of January, a little before eight o'clock, I was in the parlour, and heard a dreadful crash—I immediately ran out and found the shop window broken—I missed the watch, chain, and seal, which I had seen there about six o'clock that evening—the window-pane was very much broken—it was quite sound at six o'clock—the prisoner was brought to the shop in five or ten minutes—he could reach the watch, it was close to the glass.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 106.) I live in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell. On the 27th of January, in the evening, I was called to Mr. Watkins's shop, and took the prisoner into custody—there was about two hundred people about the door—the prisoner was in the shop—I saw no disturbance on his part.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been drinking in the afternoon with a friend, in fact I had not been near Mr. Watkins's shop that evening—I was stand<lb/>ing leaning against a post at the corner of Bury-street, very sick. I saw the witness and other men running down Hooper-street, calling "Stop thief"—I, being in liquor, made way for them to go by—they went up a street, the name of which I don't know, and turned the corner—I walked to the bottom of Bury-street, and was standing by a baker's shop when Hell collared me—I did not say I had broken a window, he said, "you have broken a window;"I said, "I have not broken any window, let me go"—probably his hat fell off, I dare say it did—a crowed collected, some said, "Let the man go;" others said, "If you have not broken a window, go with him;" and I did go with him to Mr. Watkins's shop, and when in the shop feeling sick again, I went to the door not to go out, but not wishing to make a <hi rend="italic">mess</hi> on the mat, but two men seized me by the collar and pulled me back—I called for no rescue, for I had not a person near the place whom I knew—I did call Murdei—he people said "What is the matter?"I said "They are ill using me, force the door open"—I went to the station-house—after the witness let go of my collar, I walked with him by myself voluntarily I could have gone away if I had chosen—when I went in I said to Miss. Watkins, "Did you see me break the window?" She said, "No, I cer<lb/>tainly did not." I particularly requested the policeman to look at my hands, for if they had been inside a broken window they must have been cut—I was not within sixty yards of the shop at any time—come which way I could I could not be within sixty yards of the shop, and if I had been at the window, and the witness where he says he was, instead of my escaping from him, I must have run into his arras—there was no pos<lb/>sibility of going any other way—I can only say, really I am not the</p>

               <p>person—it had been raining, and was a very dark night—he says in his deposition he never lost sight of me—if it had been me, and taking three turnings he could not be off losing sight of me—at the baker's shop a man came running past me, before Bell came up, and ran through a passage, but I did not offer to stop him, being in liquor—the policeman searched me—Miss. Watkins owns it was not above four or five minutes from the I time the window was broken and my being brought back, and the round the witness went could not be accomplished in that time—if I had run from Mr. Watkins's shop window down Sutton-street into Allen-street again, it is half a mile round, and I could not have done that in four minutes—he must be mistaken in me.</p>

                  </hi>. On Monday, the 9th of January, Sharpe, my foreman, told me something—we called the prisoner up, after he had passed through one of the gates into the ware-room, and asked him if he had any metal about him—he said no, he had not—he was then told that metal had been found secreted in different places, that some of it was gone, and from circumstances we suspected he had taken it—he said he had not—I said, "Send for an officer"—he then said, yes, he had some metal about him, and took out a piece, I think, from his side pocket, and said that was all he had—the officer found more metal upon him in different parts—this is it—some is copper, some brass, and some lead—I have more than one partner—we are largely in the copper and metal line—some of this is old metal, some is faulty casting, but it would be of the same use as the others—after the officer found several pieces about him, he again said that was all he had about him—I said, "Look in his hat," and in his hat some more was found—one of our workmen had found some secreted away, and it went away from time to time—there was no other man in the yard that afternoon, but the one who had given the information.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in York-place, Walworth. I am a surgeon, but have retired from practice—I am one of the Court of Exa<lb/>miners appointed by the Apothecaries' Company—I was present at an examination which took place at Apothecaries-hall, on Thursday the 22nd of December—the prisoner at the bar was one of the candidates for exa<lb/>mination—his answers, (such as I heard) were very unsatisfactory—Mr. Este, Mr. Randall, and Mr. Tegart were there at the time I was, and part of the time, Mr. Ridout—the prisoner sat at the end of the table, and these gentle<lb/>men sat at the sides—it was not a round table—in reply to some questions asked him, the prisoner said, more than once, I think, but once, certainly—"How the devil can I answer, when I am badgered in this way?"—there was no ground for such an observation whatever—Mr. Este's manner during the examination was exceedingly kind and forbearing, and he endeavoured as far as was consistent (and I thought rather more than was consistent with his duty) to suggest the kind of answers the prisoner ought to have given—at the conclusion of the examination, or towards it, he said he never could answer questions, and when a boy at school he never could answer ques<lb/>tions—I was about half an hour at the table—during that time I did not put one question—towards the end of the examination I said to Mr. Este, (seeing that the questions were put in such a manner that it was intended almost what the prisoner should say, and that even then he did not answer them) "If you will excuse the liberty I take, I wish you would put two or three plain questions to the candidate, and let him answer them him<lb/>self,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300040"/>
               <p>and then we shall be able to form an opinion whether the gentleman possesses sufficient information, to justify the court in granting him his cer<lb/>tificate—in pursuance of that suggestion, Mr. Este continued to examine him—and I offered no further observations—I do not think I remained at the table more than ten minutes after that observation—at the end of which time, I went into another room for the purpose of signing some certificates which were lying there for that purpose—I did not remain in that room five minutes—I returned again to the room in which the examination was going on—I did not sit down, but stood behind the chair in which the prisoners was sitting, for about two inutes—I believe I might possibly lean on it—I believe I did lean on it, but I did not touch the prisoner—I thought he was not aware of my being there, but he looked round immediately and saw me and I withdrew a step or so—I ceased to lean on the chair—when I entered the room in the first instance, before any thing happened, on going up to the table, I had observed what I considered a very extraordinary demeanor on the part of the prisoner—he was taking sarsaparilla which was lying before him, and chewing it with an air of more than indifference—indeed I may say of defiance—and he said more than once—"How the devil can I answer, when lam bad—gered in this way"—he was chewing pieces of sarsaparilla, throwing it from and taking other pieces up—I said to him—"In the many years I have been an examiner, Sir, I never saw a candidate conduct himself in the manner you are doing"—I said nothing else whatever—all this passed before I went into the other room to sign the certificates—after my return from that room, I heard Mr. Este tell the prisoner that he was not capable of passing his examination—that was, as near as I can recollect, about ten minutes after my return to the room—upon the prisoner being told that he could not pass his examina<lb/>tion, he said, "I wish you would examine me in anatomy—I have studied that part of my profession—I like anatomy—I have lived in the dead-house"—Mr. Este bowed and remarked to him, that he could not continue the examination—another gentleman made another remark—the prisoner then observed, he was glad he did not depend on his profession entirely for his subsistence, but that he would not be disgraced by rejection, and further that he would rather swing for it—after uttering those words he got up, and stepped back about a couple of feet—I saw the motion of his hand with extreme rapidity—he said, "You were one of those "and I immediately felt myself severely struck on the left side of my forehead, on the frontal bone—this mark on my forehead is the remains of the blow—it did not make me lose my senses—the immediate effect was an excessive flow of blood—I felt my eyes filled with blood, and took hold of the table to support myself—I felt pain from the blow, and felt my face covered with blood—as soon as I recovered from the effect of the blow, I observed some gentle<lb/>men near me—I saw Dr. Merriman bleeding very profusely, and Mr. Este bleeding not so profusely—it was a fortnight before I could appear at Guildhall—but I was three weeks confined—I was first attended by Mr. Bacot, and next by Mr. Key, a surgeon of Guy's-hospital.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You thought he purposely meant to insult the examiners who had his interest at stake in their hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I admonished him on his conduct, and it was after that I leant over his chair—I heard no other gentleman admonish him—it was after this insolence that he re<lb/>spectfully asked to be examined in anatomy—he is a young man—I never saw him before the examination—he raised his hand with great rapidity—I saw a quick motion, and felt myself wounded immediately—I fancy I saw his hand, I saw a quick motion—I cannot say whether he had his glove on, his movement was so quick, I cannot recollect—I saw it hand move, that is all I do recollect—there it a small mark remaining on my forehead now—it was done six weeks ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Finsbury-square, and am a sur<lb/>geon—I am one of the Court of Examiners. I was at Apothecaries' Hall on the 22nd of December in the execution of my duty—on that occasion, in order to accommodate the number of pupils coming up, an extra table was put, making five tables in all—I was at the table part of the time while the prisoner was being examined—Mr. Este was the principal ex<lb/>aminer—I am not clear who were the others, because I did not attend the table till late—Mr. Tegart was sitting at the table when I came—he arose and desired me to assist in the prisoner's examination—I heard ques<lb/>tions put to the prisoner by Mr. Este respecting <hi rend="italic">cubebs,</hi> which is a species of pepper—he first pointed to the article and asked him what it was—the prisoner not knowing, or apparently not knowing, (not answering, I should more correctly say,) Mr. Este said, "Don't you recollect it is a species of pepper?"—the prisoner said, "Oh yes, I know it very well"—that is a drug in common use—I should say a man was not fit to be an apothecary if he did not know it—Mr. Este then said, "Don't you know it is used in a specific mucous discharge?" wishing to bring it to his mind—he said, "Oh yes," but still did not name the article—Mr. Este then said, (the prisoner having told him he had attended St. George's,) "Have you not seen it used in the Lock hospital?"—"Oh yes," he said, but still did not name it—Mr. Este said, "Don't you recollect it is <hi rend="italic">cubebs?"</hi>—he said, "Oh yes, I know it very well"—Mr. Este then asked him How it was to be used, not answering, I said to the prisoner, "The gentleman means, sir, what is the form of preparation you would use," explaining it that he might not be puzzled by the general question, How it is to be used—the prisoner immediately turned to me and said, "How the devil can I answer questions, if you are all badgering me in this kind of way?"—I should think there was nothing in our manner to deserve that term—our conduct was friendly and kind to him, I conceive—Mr. Este taking up the question, said, "Would you give it in the form of pills, powder, or mixture"—after a little hesitation, he said, he would give it in the form of essential oil dropped into a mixture—that is not the common mode of mixture—Mr. Este said, "Don't you know the general form of exhibiting is that of powder?"—he said, "Oh yes, I know that very well, I have often seen it given"—Mr. Este put no more questions on that subject, but pointed to some specimens of bark which were on the tray—after putting several questions, and getting no satisfactory answers, though rather assisting him to answer, I heard Mr. Hardy say, "Pardon me, sir, I think the better plan would be to put to the gentleman two or three simple questions, and let him answer them himself, then we shall be better able to judge whether it is our duty to grant him his certificate"—that was not said in the least offensively—Mr. Hardy very shortly afterwards left the table, and Mr. Este proceeded with some questions relative to the bark, and Mr. Ridout came to the table—I saw Mr. Hardy speak to him and he came—Mr. Este was pursuing some questions relative to intermittent fever, which the prisoner knew nothing about—he returned no satisfactory answers—Mr. Ridout then asked him some specific questions relative to the treatment of the cold stage of an intermittent, but no satisfactory answers</p>

               <p>could be elicited, he simply stated—"I never can answer questions when I asked, I never could do so at school—though I knew every thing as well as any boy at school"—Mr. Ridout, in a kind manner, observed to him that the answers he gave there, were the only test they had of his quail<lb/>fications to practise; and although they by no means wished to hurt any young man's feelings, they had an important duty to the public to perform—the prisoner immediately, in a hasty manner, said, "Oh, Sir, you have behaved very gentlemanly, I am sure, and so has that gentleman, "Pointing to Mr. Este—some few questions were put afterwards by Mr. Este, relative to doses of laudanum, but being about to terminate the examination, stating he was sorry, he was not fit to receive his certificate, the prisoner, addressing himself to Mr. Ridout, said, "Pray examine me in anatomy, I love anatomy, I have lived in the dead-house" (it is part of the duty of the Court to examine in anatomy,) Mr. Ridout replied, "That is a science which more decidedly comes under the province of the college of surgeons, and although we expect a gentleman to have sufficient knowledge of it to practise, yet, if he has ever such a knowledge of it, and is ignorant of <hi rend="italic">materia medica</hi>, we could not grant his certificate"—the examination in <hi rend="italic">materia medica</hi> always precedes the examination in anatomy—while Mr. Ridout was terminating his sentence, Mr. Este looked across the table to me and said, "Do you think it worth while to continue this examination, Sir," or something to that effect—I replied, "I certainly think not, espe<lb/>dallyss the gentleman himself says he cannot answer any questions"—Mr. Este then addressing himself to the prisoner said, "I am very sorry Sir, but I cannot consider it my duty to recommend you to the court to receive your certificate"—the prisoner then muttered something to himself and suddenly raising his voice, said, "Your certificate is of no consequence to me, in a pecuniary point of view; I am going abroad, and I have good resources, but do you think I am going to be disgraced before my family by such a set as you are—no, be d—d if I will be—I would die first—I would swing for it"—on saying this he rose from his chair, a little behind which was Mr. Hardy—Mr. Hardy had not interfered, or said one word during all this conversation—he had done nothing to annoy him in the least, but was behind his chair, when he started up, the prisoner then stepped back a few paces, put both his hands behind him as though they were in his back coat pocket, fixed his eyes on Mr. Hardy, and suddenly I saw his right arm raised above his head, and a severe blow inflicted on Mr. Hardy—expressing at the same time, "You are one of those that have been hard upon roe, or against me"—I could not see what he struck with—I instantly saw blood proceeding from Mr. Hardy—I saw Dr. Merriman attempt to secure the prisoner, when he received a blow which bled profusely—Mr. Este, in attempting to assist, also received a blow—I then got close to where the prisoner and those two or three gentlemen were, and saw Mr. Tegart with this instrument in his hand—I did not see whether Mr. Tegart got it from him or not—he said in the hearing of the prisoner, "I have just taken that out of the gentleman's hand"—seeing the prisoner was secured, I then sent out for a policeman—I did not examine Mr. Hardy's wound—I took no further notice of it—I merely requested somebody to bring him some water—there was a very considerable flow of blood from him, over his clothes and over mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Portugal-street, Grosvenor-square. I am chairman of the Court of Examiners—I was there, and was called on to examine Mr. Hardy as soon as the wound was inflicted—he was bleeding from a severe contused wound on the left side of the forehead—he was bleeding copiously, and supporting himself with his hand on the table—he appeared in pain, and rather faintish—I saw him every follow<lb/>ing day, till his appearance before the Magistrate, (except on Sunday which was Christmas-day,) the wound itself was not serious, for it had not affected the bone, but its consequences were very much to be apprehended—on the following Monday Mr. Key was called in to assist.</p>

On Thursday, the 22nd of December, I was a candidate for examination at Apothecaries—hall, and saw the prisoner taken out in custody—while he was on the stairs in the custody of two policemen, he said he was glad for what he had done, or he would do it again—I cannot exactly recollect the terms, and do not recollect which—I believe I had made some remark as to the folly of what he had done.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 21st of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I was returning home from Islington, where I had been to see a sick person—Short-street, Moorfields, is near my residence—just as I stepped from the curb-stone there, I received a blow behind, which brought me to the ground, and stunned me—when I recovered a little, I called "Watch," and a person came to me—I do not remember whether he lifted me from the ground—I was quite stupified by the blow—before I was knocked down I had a green silk purse with two or three sixpence in it—I had four or five shillings loose in my pocket, and there was a key in the purse—two keys in my pocket, and a penny—I do not know who gave me the blow—I do not know whether I was struck more than once, and that was from behind—I have no recollection of being knocked down by any body coming in front of me—I was so stupified by the first blow I do not recoiled any thing—I think it possible I might have risen from the ground, and been knocked down again by a person coming against me, without my knowing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ealing, near Hayes, in Middlesex. On the night of the 21st of January I saw the two Whites and Powell at the Jolly Horse public-house—about twelve o'clock I saw Ryder and went home with her—when we went into the house she fastened the door—I put the articles stated into my pocket, which I laid in the chair, and stripped and got into bed—I expected her to follow, she did not, but she got up in five minutes and opened the door, and the three male prisoners came in—I am sure of them—two of them put their hands over my mouth and tried to stop my breath—I cannot say which two it was—Ryder was in the room at the time, and she cried, I do not know for what—she had opened the door to them—they hallooed and rapped at the door first—I got away from them and saw John White routing my pockets—I had several blows in the room—as soon as I could get my clothes on, I tried to get out—they did not stop me from getting my clothes on, but I had several hits while put-log them on—they let me put them on, and then shoved me out of doors—when I got out I found I had lost four handkerchiefs, a nightcap, two pairs of stockings, a pair of trowsers, a bag, a crown, and three shillings—was struck, but I cannot say by whom—after I came out I went back to the room and asked them for a small parcel, and they all three came out and fell upon me and struck me violently—I had two black eyes—I slipped by them and ran away—I am certain of the three men.</p>

On this Saturday evening, between twelve and one o'clock, the prosecutor came to me representing that he was robbed—about that time Powell came up—I asked the prosecutor if he was one—he said he was—I took him into custody, and he said if I would allow him to speak to the prosecutor he would tell the b——fool where his parcels were; but instead of telling him, he shoved the watch-box door back and made his escape—I called King, and we got the constable—we went to White's and took them both into custody, and afterwards retook Powell.</p>

I was called, and went to Ryder's house—I found a padlock outside the door—I then went to White's house and apprehended them—the prosecutor identified them, in bed with another man—I went from there to Powell's house and found him in bed—King identitifed him directly he saw him—Powell wished to speak a few words to him and he said, "This man has not been robbed at all; if you will go to Ryder's, there are the things as he left them"—I said, "I can't get in; there is a padlock outside the door"—he said, "Go to White's, you will find the key there"—he said he heard a screaming in the house, and went to the girl's assistance, and that the prosecutor said he would set fire to set house—I went to Ryder's and found the padlock off, and the door fastened inside—White's mother was there—I said I had come for the man's clothes—Ryder said he had brought nothing into the house—I said I must go up stairs—she said, "You need not go up stairs; the man did not go up stairs"—I went, and on the stairs found the braces, which the prosecutor claims—we went back to White's, but found nothing.

                  </hi>. I am employed in the shop of Mr. Peter Broad, in Tavistock-street, Covent Garden—he is an oil and colourman—he has a shop in King-street, Seven Dials. On Tuesday, the 3rd of January, I saw the prisoner there at half-past eight o'clock—he ordered a quarter of a cwt. of yellow soap, and 14lbs. of pearlash—he said he would call again by and by—he called at a quarter-past eleven o'clock, and I was sent with him,—he said he would return with me with the money and pay the shopman—he did not say where the goods were to be sent to, but they were for a person in Holborn—at the prisoner's desire I carried them—I believe there was a bill made out and given to the prisoner—16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to be brought back—I went with him as far as Gray's-inn-lane, and he went down some court into a little low public house—he wished me to go in, I refused—I told him I should go back with the goods—he told me to stop there while he went to the top of the court—he joined me again at the top of the court, and went into Holborn till he came to the corner of Red Lion Street—he told me he had sold the goods there, and took the basket from me—he went in and told me to wait outside—he came out in about five minutes and brought back the pearl ash and basket, and told me they were too busy now to pay at<lb/>tention to him, they wanted more things—I asked him if he had got the money, he said, "Yes"—he went back to the shop with me, and told the shopman he had not got the money and they wanted more things—it was bees' wax, I think, and a quarter of a cwt. of pumice stone—I saw him the next day in Middle-row and asked him where the soap was, he said, he was going to call at eleven o'clock to pay—I took him back to the shop and fetched my master, and he was given into custody.</p>

I was on duty near George-street, Portman-square, and heard the report of a pistol, and immediately a female scream out—I ran down George-street, past Gloucester-place, and saw the prisoner coming up on the right-hand side—Welch, another constable, stopped him, and when I came up, Bourke had got hold of him by the collar and right arm—he said to me, "Take hold of him, he has shot at me"—I laid hold of his right arm, and another policeman, coming up, took hold of the other side of him—I saw Bourke spit something from his mouth—the prisoner then began to plunge about a good deal—he jumped forward, and threw his arms about to try to get away from me—I said, "Be quiet; you have shot at a man"—he said, "He is an Irishman; I hate those villains, those cowardly rascals that will take a mean advantage of any one"I like an Englishman, that won't take advantage of any one"—I said, "Bequiet, and come along"—he then said, "I think I have lost one of my fingers"—I looked at his right hand, and saw two of his fingers bleeding very much—I said, "You have not lost one of your fingers; what have you done it with?"—he said, "It was only a bullet"—I got him to the station-house, and was searching him—he said, "I know I have done wrong, and am sorry for it"—I found a gold watch on him a knife, an empty purse, a flint-case, and a guard-chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I came up immediately I heard the rattle, and found Bourke had got the prisoner secure by the collar—I said, "Is there any body else in it?"—not receiving any reply, I turned round to the woman, who said he had fired at the constable—at the station-house the prisoner could not stand steadily at the bar, and was sitting on a bench—he said, "Loose my arm, and I will show you the reason I carry the pistol"—he then took two false teeth out of his mouth, and said, In consequence of having these struck out by a blow at the Saloon, in pie<lb/>cadilly, I carry this pistol for my protection, but I mean no harm towards</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and live at Acton, I wast called on to attend the prisoner first in 1824, when be came home from school in an insane state of mind—there was no obvious cause for the derangement except his too intense study at school—I attended him on that occasion for about six months—his mind was in a complete state of Aberration the whole time, with some trifling intervals—I think his mind on the whole was on pious feelings, but occasionally obscene and profane—these circumstances do constantly mingle in persons in this state of mind—I was next called on to attend him in October, 1826, until October, 1827—his mind was then in a very similar state to the former period—he had always a keeper with him—he was not in a fit state to be left alone for one moment—his mind was very similar to what it was at first—pious feelings, mingled with incongruous ideas—hit person was occasionally very filthy, and at other times he was earnestly desirous of being very clean—when his mind was at the wont he was exceedingly filthy—that it frequently the case with persons afflicted with madness—he was occasionally mischievous—towards the close of it he had something similar to epilepsy—I attended him again from 1833 to July, 1884—there was no material deviation then, he was as before—he was occasionally so ill as to have two keepers—a person named Gracey, as far as 1 can recollect, was one—he was attended by Sir George Tothill, who was a physician at Bedlam, but is now dead—he was occasionally very loquacious, and at other times very taciturn—he broke in the panel of a door on one occasion, and he would throw any thing into the fire—he would sometimes call himself St. Jerome, and address me under the title of St. James—he had a strait waistcoat on occasionally, but not always—there was always a mark of intellectual derangement about his eyes, closing them for a long time occasionally, daring which time he would never speak—bis laugh was idiotic.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at St. John's Wood; for the last nine years I have been accustomed to the care of insane persons. The prisoner was placed under my care in December, 1833, for about six weeks—the greater part of that time he was in a state of total aberration of mind—I went down on a Sunday by order <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Sir George Tothill, about the 29th of December, and found Mr. Kelly in bed—his father was to introduce me to him—he would not make any observation at all, nor open his eyes, but laid in bed quite in a torpid state—he remained so for several days—I with a great deal of persuasion aroused him as well as I was capable—during that time he took but very little food, and would not open his eyes or speak to any body—three or four days afterwards, by persuasion and a little manceu<lb/>vering, be got up and took a little breakfast—we walked round the garden together—he took hold of my arm, but never spoke to roe, and bad his eyes closed the whole time, we walked for I suppose half an hour—Mr. Day came and spoke to him, but he would not speak to him—we walked up to the bed-room, and he went to bed, and was in the same state, kneeling down to prayers and so <hi rend="italic">on</hi>—in a few days he rather roused—I persuaded him to come down and play at billiards, and he did, but played in a very incoherent manner—some ladies were coming by the window at the tine; he made a thrust at the window, and if I had not stopped him the cue would have gone through the window at them—they were persons for whom he ought to have entertained affection—he would sometimes flourish the cue over my head, but would look at me, pat me on the shoulder, and say he would not hurt me—he was in the habit of looking up in the skies—I could not un<lb/>derstand what he meant, but at last found he meant that God's eye was looking on us both, and that we were as one person—he showed a decided antipathy to his father, whose conduct was always particularly kind to him—he had a cap and snuff-box, and threw them on the fire—it is often the case that insane persons are sometimes mischievous, and sometimes melancholy—at times he was very dirty in bis person—the cleanest people become dirty when insane—I remember his calling for the angel Gabriel, and ask<lb/>ing for the keys of Heaven—I have not the slightest doubt of his insanity—the least excitement would produce it.</p>

I accompanied his father to New gate, on Saturday the 22nd of January—the prisoner then conversed very freely and rationally for a considerable period, but as I was about to leave, I remembered that I had heard that he had put on a new blue coat at twelve o'clock on the night in question, and said to him, it was something extraordinary he should put on a new coat to walk out in at that time of night—I said to him first, "You had not even taken the silver paper off this coat, and were careful to take it off then"—he said, "Yes, that was the mistake, my putting on that coat—I put it on before the time God had willed—I should not have put on that coat till I went hunting"—and then he told me why he had had this coat made in a particular fashion, to serve the particular purpose of hunting in it, and also being a dress coat—he then said, "Yes, but still it was appointed that I should not wear it till</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to one of the learned Judges. On the 10th of January, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I was returning home from Westminster-bridge, I had been with some friends, and had taken a good deal of wine—I believe I was in Lee-street on my way home, and went into Hadlow-street—one street leads into another—I fell into company with Frances Farr, and went with her to No. 34, Hadlow-street, into the front parlour—I there found the prisoner Davis, and the witness Milton, whom Farr represented as her brandy—they partook of it—I did not drink any of it—after being there two or three hours the room door opened, and Elizabeth Stan<lb/>nard and another woman presented themselves at the door—prior to that, however, Davis had left the room for some time, and had re<lb/>turned to the room again—when Mrs. Stannard and the other woman came in, they began complaining of our keeping them up so long, as they had work to do in the morning, and in a very uncivil kind of way—I immediately turned round to Farr, and asked whether that woman was her landlady—she said no, she was a servant, and that the other woman was her landlady—the other woman was very mild in her manner—the female prisoner was very violent, and I became indignant—I thought I was insulted, as well as every one in the room—I turned round to Farr, and said, "Do you allow yourself and us to be insulted in that way by that broad-faced Scotch woman?" (I cannot say I really was convinced of her being Scotch, but that was my idea,) she immediately flew at me like a tigress, siezed the frill of my shirt, tore my shirt right through my body, and beat me about in a most unmerciful manner—(<hi rend="italic">producing a shirt</hi>) here is the blood on it which came from me—whether Davis participated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300066"/>
               <p>in the beating it is impossible to say—I was dreadfully mutilated, and was bleeding at the nose—a knock came at the door, and the man Stannard presented himself—I immediately took my hat up. and made a rush, I was fortunate enough to pass in time; I caught hold of the street-door lock, and was about to push it back, when Davis rushed at me, caught hold of my watch, and forced it away from my fob; and at the same instant a silver guard which was round my neck, attached to a silver watch which I had in my waistcoat-pocket, was taken away—the watch was held by a silk guard under my waistcoat—that guard was broken, and I have part of it here—I did not lose the other watch—I had a Bristol diamond-pin in my shirt, which I lost—Stannard came to the door before I lost my watch, but after I lost my pin—I cannot say that he did any thing to me—I did not observe it—I rushed out of the house and called the police—one came at first, and then two others—they knocked at the door, and asked to be admitted—they were kept a long time without being admitted (on my rushing out of the house I had heard the door bolted) at last the police were admitted, and I went with one of them into the front<lb/>parlour—that was the room I had been in—we then went into the back-parlour, and then into the yard—the policemen heard something, and im<lb/>mediately scaled the wall—of course I know nothing more, except that my property was afterwards produced—when I went to the house I was under the influence of wine, but after the beating I got sober, and I was quite collected—I had been in the house two hours and a half, or three hours—I drank nothing in the house—the policeman had the opportunity of seeing the state I was in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you drink in this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was not in any other house but Nicholls' hotel, at the foot of Westminster-bridge—I had walked from there, and went into this house—they asked me to have a share of the drink, but I declined it—Farr asked me—we were not on the sofa together—she was on one chair and I on another, and the two young men were on chairs—there was a sofa in the room—I believe they all drank but me—Farr and I were friendly while I was there—they behaved remarkably kind to me—the two young men, and Miss Farr did—I thought it a very pleasant evening at the time—they fetched some water up to put into the brandy, as I refused to allow Miss Farr to drink it in the neat state—I said, "This is my brandy at all events; you shall not drink it without water"—to the best of my recollection, it was Davis went down for the water—he behaved re<lb/>markably well—he said he had been to St. Sebastian, and was going back—I recommended him not to go back—Milton said he was a tailor, and he showed me some patterns, and asked me for an order—we were all very comfortable—I took Davis for a young gentleman—if it had not been for the woman Standard, I believe it would all have gone on well—I have no reason to believe otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had it not been for the unfortunate observation you made abort her having a broad Scotch face, do not you think nothing would have hap<lb/>pened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Indeed, I will not swear that in the affirmative, for Davis went out of the room and returned just before them, and I was surrounded by the two men and that woman; she laying on with tremendous blows—Farr was not one of the women surrounding me—she behaved very well to me, and tried to protect me—I thought she turned very pale—I am not certain of receiving any blows from any body but the Scotch woman; and they were tremendous blows—she is a very powerful woman—I would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300067"/>
               <p>not contend against a woman of that sort—I would not strike a woman—I would not condescend—I had my knuckles wounded in defending myself I am decidedly no match for her—I was defending myself from the ssault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not during this affray in a dreadful state of agitation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; I was as collected as I am now, except the little excite<lb/>ment remaining from the wine—I believe the combat made me more sensible from the loss of blood—I was astonished at such conduct—I had a very good opportunity of observing what was done, except when being actually beaten, but I could see her thumping my head almost to atoms—it wss almost like a jelly—I wonder I am alive to tell the story—it was all done instantaneously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While you and Miss Farr were in agreeable conversation together before this happened, might your hand have gone as far as hers shoulder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly—it was round her neck; and I kissed her too—I will not disguise any thing—you shall have every thing you want—the truth, and nothing but the truth—I took her hand—I did not rest it on my lap—I am quite satisfied I did not—I should not be to ungentlemanly—I know your allusion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you go to the house for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is another thing—very likely for the same purpose as all foolish young men go for—I certainly can not recollect all that took place in the room, but I was never alone with Farr—I was introduced by her to the young men as her brothers—they re<lb/>mained chatting with me a great time, and then Davis went out—I had sobered down almost to my collected ideas before the women came into the room—they offered me drink, and I refused it, I knew I had enough—when Mrs. Stannard first came into the room, she addressed herself to Farr—she did not speak to me before I spoke to her—I did not call her a broad face Scotch b——I will swear that positively—for. I do not believe a baser term can be applied to a woman, and I am sure my gentlemanly feelings would not allow it—I had been two hours and a half or three hours in the house, and I was sobered down—I distinctly said, "broad-faced Scotch woman," and not the other term which I won't dirty my lips with—it was after that that she attacked me—I had the pin in my shirt—m taking hold of my shirt the pin would come out first, and here is the hole where it came out—I have certainly said I did not see her hands on the pin, but there is the hole in the frill as if it was torn out—she flew at me like a tigress at once, speak<lb/>tog to me and tearing at me—it was instantaneously done—she said some<lb/>thing, but what it was I cannot say—directly the words were out of my mouth, she flew at me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. On the 10th of January, I met Mr. Raynolds about twelve o'clock or a little after, and we went together to the ground floor of No. 34, Hadlow-street—Davis and Milton were in the room and Mrs. Morgan, the landlady's daughter—we had some brandy and water to drink—about two hours or two hours and half after we had been in the room, Mrs. Stannard came in—Milton and Davis were both in the room during that time—I was not left alone with Mr. Raynolds at all—Mrs. Stannard entered the room with Mrs. Morgan, and said, "We are working people, now are you not going to bed?"—I said, "Mrs. Stannard, I am quite ready to go to bed, but there are people in the house who are going out; you are not my landlady, I wish my landlady to speak, if there is any thing the matter"—and said it was a liberty she had taken in insulting me in my own place—the gentleman then arose, and said, "Farr, do you allow yourself to be insulted by a broad-faced Scotchwoman like that?"—I am tare he said "Scotch woman"—Mrs. Stannard then collared him, and beat him between the two doors up to the parlour window, and ill treated him very much—I went to take his part, so far as to lay hold of her arm, and begged her to be quiet and not kick up a disturbance, as nothing of the kind had occurred where I had lived before—she turned her hand, and said to me "D—your eyes if you do not stand off I will murder you"—and of course I was afraid of my own life—Mrs. Stannard and Davis took the prosecutor up into the corner of the room, beat him very much, and ill-treated him—the moment Mr. Stannard entered the room, Mrs. Stannard released the gentleman, who took his hat and rushed out of the parlour as fast as he could into the passage—I did not go into the passage—the candle was put out by Mrs. Stannard—the door was open, there was a great scuffle in the passage with Mr. and Mrs. Stannard and Davis—I did not see what took place in the passage—Davis and the other two prisoners were there at the time, but nobody else that I know of, the door was fastened—it was not open, that I know of—after the scuffle, Mrs. Stannard turned out of the passage blew out the light in my room, and after that the three prisoners got over the back wall, which I dare say is about four feet high—Mr. Stannard did not come into the room till after Mr. Raynolds had been ill-treated I saw a breast-pin in Mr. Raynold's shirt—I remember Davis leaving the room and coming back, about half an hour before Mrs. Stannard came in.</p>

I heard a rattle spring—I went to No. 37, Hadlow-street, and there found the three prisoners in the yard, and the daughter of one of them—I took them to No. 34, where Mr. Raynolds was—he said, in their presence, that they had robbed him—he spoke rather doubtingly about the man Stannard, and I let him go—when the prosecutor saw Davis and Mrs. Stannard he said they had robbed him and ill-treated him, and stolen from him a watch and silver guard—they neither of them made any reply—as we were going to the station-house Mrs. Stannard said, they could not hurt her, they could not prove she had stolen the watch; and Davis said he had nothing at all to do with it—I think he said, nothing to do with the robbery—next day I took Stannard again—he told me he was not present, and he had nothing to do with it—I also took Farr—she was released and made a wit<lb/>ness—before I took Mrs. Stannard and Davis to the station, I went into the front parlour of the house and found Shields there—he showed me a silver watch-guard, and a watch and seals attached to it.</p>

On the 10th of January, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was in Hadlow-street, and saw the prosecutor pushed out of a house—it appeared to me to be the male prisoner Stannard who pushed him out—the passage at that time was full of persons—Stannard did not come out of the house—it appeared a violent push—the prosecutor would hare fallen, had I not put out my arms and caught him.</p>

               <p>go with him to Charles-street to get the money—I told him I received no orders to leave the goods without the money—he did not say to what house—I refused at first, but then consented—he said if I did not get the money, I should have the goods back—I said, "I understand you, if I don't get the money I shall have the goods back," and he said, "Yes"—he offered me a note first which I was to take to get this money, and asked me to go to Charles-street to get the money—I told him I received no orders to take any notes, that I was to have the money when I delivered the goods—he said that they had all his property there, and that they paid his bills—he wanted me to take the note, and he wanted to return; but I refused unless he went with me—he said, "You know where Charles-street is, you can go on with the note, I am going back to breakfast"—he was then nearly facing Conduit-street or Regent-street—I said, "No; you pro<lb/>mised to go along with me, and I will not go without you do"—we walked up Conduit-street as far as Bruton-street, and then he said he did not like to be dragged about the streets by me, and that he had written that letter to Mr. Kettle for the purpose of his paying me; if I took that to Mr. Kettle, at Lord Lonsdale's, I should be paid—I told him again I received no orders to go—he said, "Has not your master sent there before?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Was he not paid?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You will be paid too if you take this letter"(the letter was sealed)—I said I wished to know what was in the letter—he said there was no occasion, he had written to Mr. Kettle for this to be paid—I went on and saw a gentleman with his arm in a sling—I said, "Are you Mr. Kettle?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I brought this letter"—in consequence of what he said I then ran back, but I could not find the prisoner—I saw the mistress of the house where the prisoner lodged—I went to Marlborough street, and gave notice—the next day a letter came, which I have here—I do not know whose writing it is, but we compared it with the letter he gave me—he had left the boots in his room, and said he would go with me to Charles-street to get the mo<lb/>ney—I did not know he meant to cheat me out of the money—this thing has greatly injured my character, it being supposed that I wanted to extract money from Lord Lonsdale.</p>

On the 25th of November, the prisoner took a furnished room in my house—on the 8th of December, Morgan came, bring<lb/>ing two pairs of boots—I took them up stairs to the prisoner—he said he was shaving, he would come down and settle with the young man—he came down, and they went out together—the prisoner returned in half an hour—he remained two or three minutes and then went out—he had not given us warning to go—he had taken the lodgings for a fortnight, that was up—he had not paid—when I went up stairs into his room, I did not find the boots—he left nothing behind him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor. The house No. 9, Cook's-court was occupied by myself and partner as offices—the deceased, Ann Broughton, was our servant there for eighteen months—she was the only person latterly allowed to live in the house, that I know of—about three months after she entered my service I found she was married, but I did not know her hus<lb/>band ever slept there, and never but once knew he came there—I did not know where he lived—on Saturday night, the 28th of January, about half-past ten o'clock, the deceased let me out, and shut the door after me as usual—I think she was about thirty-eight or forty years of age—she ap<lb/>peared to be in very good health—she was a strong, hearty, healthy looking woman—I desired her, on quitting the office, to lay the office fire on Sunday, (but not to light it,) as I must be there on Sunday—I went about five o'clock on Sunday afternoon and knocked and rang several times, but could gain no admission—about a quarter to seven o'clock Mr. Lovett, the surgeon, fetched me, and I saw the woman in the kitchen, by the side of the fire-place—she was dead—she was sitting on a chair by the side of the</p>

B.," but the shirts were not marked—they were men's shirts, and washed, but not ironed, rough dried—I have not the slightest knowledge of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>smeltastrong smell as if linen had been burning—it smelt strongest in the back kitchen—not where his wife was—there was a copper in the kitchen—I said to him in the passage, "How long has your wife been ill?" He made no reply—he appeared agitated when he came to my house, and very much flurried—I never saw him before—he went down for light, and came up with it to light me down—I was at the top of the stairs—I followed him down, and the first thing I per<lb/>ceived was a little pool of blood on the stone flooring in the passage, and also down on the bottom stair—I said, "Holloa, how came this blood here"—he said his wife had fallen down the stain on the Saturday evening—I said, "Where is your wife?"—he said, "She is sitting in the kitchen on a chair, fast asleep"—I then went into the kitchen, and saw her sitting in a chair—I felt her hand, and found she had been dead about three hours, from the warmness of the body—the warmth was not entirely gone—there was a fire in the grate, but not a large one—I attribute the warmth to the remainder of life, it could not arise from the fire—the prisoner was holding the can—die close to the body at the time I took her hand—I said to him, "She has been dead about three hours"—he made no reply—I cannot say whether be heard me—I spoke loud enough for him to hear me—I told him to re<lb/>main there, and I would be back in a short time, while I went to fetch my instruments—in the mean time, I went and told Mr. Nichols—I came back with him and two policemen, about twenty-five minutes to seven o'clock—the prisoner then was gone, and I did not see him again that night—I ex<lb/>amined the blood, the larger quantity was on the pavement at the bot<lb/>tom of the last stair, close under the last step—there was about six ounces—there was also some on the last step itself, and that step appeared as if it had been wiped—I should say the blood had not been there above three or four hours—I should say four hours, from the colour, and from the coagulation which had taken place—it was not much clotted, nor of a very deep colour—blood keeps getting deeper and thicker the longer it has been shed—I made a re<lb/>mark to the prisoner at the time about the wiping of the stairs—I said, "How did this happen?"—he made no reply to the question.</p>

I went to Sharman's house on Sunday night, the 29th, about half-past nine o'clock—I was shown into the workshop, and a box was pointed out to me—it was unlocked—I found a leather apron in the top of the box with marks of blood on it, and two pocket-books, some duplicates, and a silver fruit knife—this is the apron—the marks of blood are inside and also outside—some were wet and some were dry—I went to Eustace's house and brought away a coat—the blood is chiefly at the top of the sleeve—it was all dry then—it was after twelve o'clock—the appearance of it is still very plain at the top of the right shoulder, and also on the cloth.</p>

I was in the parlour when my sister came to ask the price of a coat—I looked into the shop, and saw, the prisoner and another man—I saw his companion go out with a coat under his arm—I called out, "He is gone"—the prisoner directly ran out of the shop, and pulled the door after him; but it would not close, as my sister's arm was between it—I ran out into the street—one went to the right, and the other to the left—the other man was three or four doors a—head of the prisoner—I followed the man who had something, and saw him throw the coat across the road—I picked it up—he escaped—my brother went after the prisoner—when he was brought back to the shop, he said he could have a character if he would allow him to send for one, and he hoped they would forgive him—I think that was what he said.</p>

I know where I took it in change," and he immediately put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and gave me a good one—he had taken the other from his fob—the moment I saw it was bad, I put it on a shelf under the counter—there was no other money there, I am certain—I gave him change for the good shilling—after he drank his gin, he held his hand over the counter, and said, "I want my shilling"—I said, "You will get no shilling of me, I never give bad money back again"—he was very insolent—I went round, and said, "I shall give you in charge"—I took up the shilling and went to the door, and called the police, and while I did that, he endeavoured to escape—I pushed him inside, and kept him till the officer came—I then marked the shilling, and gave it to Berry.</p>

They occupied a shop, a parlour behind the shop, and a bed-room on the first floor—I live in the first-floor front room, over their shop—on the 16th of December, be<lb/>tween twelve and one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came home in liquor—he was always intoxicated—I never saw him sober—alter became home that day, I beard him and his wife talking together—there was nobody in the parlour but them I believe—he spoke in an angry tone—I did not hear her answer him angrily—it appeared to me that they were quarrelling (I could hear hex voice)—that continued as much as twenty minutes—after that they were very quiet—after the talking I heard a scuffle, and it was after the scuffle they were quiet—about an hour after that the deceased came up stairs into my room—the complained of her head, and showed me something on it—it was very much swollen in the middle of her forehead, such as would be caused by a blow—I continued to see her from day to day after that—she went about her work as usual—she was obliged to take to her bed on Christmas eve—she had complained of her head every day, from the time this happened till then—the first week of her illness I was with her every day, three or four times a day—the died on Friday the 6th of January—on the Wednes<lb/>day week before that, she said she considered herself in considerable danger, and asked me to recommend her a doctor, but I could not—the doctor came the next day—she said on the Wednesday, that unless her head was easier the could not possibly live, that the pain was so great—she kept saying after that, that she was afraid she should not recover—the prisoner continued in the house during her illness—I never heard him say any thing respecting his wife's situation—he frequently went into the room and locked the door that nobody else should come in—I was never in the room with him, and never heard him speak to her.</p>

I entered behind Keys, and saw the girl at the door, in the act of moving forward to come out—I beard the bolt of the lock shot—I saw Robert sitting on the right-side of the fire-place, and John on the left-side, with their faces towards the fire—Keys immediately laid hold of Robert—I passed as quick as possible be<lb/>hind him, and saw John with something in his hand, which he attempted immediately to rub to pieces—I leaned over him, put my arms round him, got hold of his wrist, and pulled his arms apart—some of the pieces fell from his hand, and one piece I made him put on the chair—they have since been put together in my presence by Mr. Powell—there are some pieces deficient—it has the impression of the reverse side of a sixpence—I saw Keys take a spoon out of the fire—it was a sort of slow clear cinder fire—he laid the spoon down, and I took it up—it was an iron one, knocked up to make a tip to pour the metal out—under the grate were a great many pieces of plas<lb/>ter of Paris, with no impression on them—they are pieces of metal broken up—there was some metal in the iron-spoon, hard as it is now—I never saw it fused.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to his Majesty's mint, and have been in the habit of examining coin for many years. Here is part of a plaster of Paris mould produced by Keys—it appears to hare been used for the purpose of casting counterfeit shillings—it bean the impression of the reverse side of a shilling perfect, and from the discolour<lb/>ation of the plaster I believe it has been used—here is another piece of a plaster of Paris mould which is broken, but it bears the impression of the greater part of the obverse side of a shilling—these two pieces, when put together would form a whole mould for casting a shilling—here is a counterfeit shilling produced by the same witness, and which he described as being in the mould, and warm when he found it—it is Britannia metal—it appears to have been cast in this mould—I have applied it—here is a good shilling produced by Keys, which I believe has been used to make the mould produced, as it corresponds with it in all respects</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300107"/>
               <p>—here is a counterfeit sixpence produced by the witness, made in the same way as the shilling—there is no mould corresponding with that—this is the half of a mould for casting sixpences, but it does not appear to Have been used—it has the good coin now in it, with the obverse side of a six-pence—these two spoons are Britannia metal, and correspond with the metal of the counterfeit money—one of the spoons has plaster of Paris in it, which has been in a liquid state—here is a portion of a broken knife which is necessary to make the channel for the metal to run through—shackell has produced four sixpences, all of which are counterfeit, but not cast in any mould produced—here is another part of a mould for sixpences, having part of the reverse side of a sixpence on it, making the impression of both sides—this iron spoon has metal in it which has been in a state of fusion—the file has white metal in the teeth of it—here is some powder of plaster of Paris, of which the moulds are formed.</p>

On the 11th of November Mr. Webb sent me to Brewer's Quay, with a horse and cart, to fetch some butter, about two o'clock or a little after—I drove it to Billingsgate, when a man came up to me, and in consequence of what he said I returned to Brewers Quay—when I came back, the horse and cart, which I had left at Billings<lb/>gate,</p>

On the 11th of November I lived in the house of stebbings, in Cable-street, leading out of Rosemary-lane—about half-past four o'clock that afternoon, the prisoner came there along with Collins, (who was convicted last sessions)—I have known the prisoner for eight years—he said, "I understand you have a horse and cart to let"—Stebbings said, "The cart is out"—the prisoner said, "Do you know where I can get one?"—Stebbings said, "Two or three doors off"—the prisoner and Collins then went away—they came back in about three minutes, and said they could not get one—Stebbings said, "My partnet's van is in the stable, if that will do you can have it"—they said that would do, and Stebbings went away with them—he was away about a quarter of an hour—about two hours and a half after, I saw Potter's van and Steb<lb/>bings's horse going up Rosemary-lane—the van seemed full of butter firkins—the prisoner and Collins were with it—I was going out at the time—it stopped at the corner of Cartwright-street, by Coxson's door—I saw the prisoner come to the van, take one cask out, and take it into Coxson's—Collins was standing by the hone's head, on the pavement—the prisoner then came and took another in, and was coming to the van again for more, when Coxson stopped him, and said, "I won't have any more, as you have brought the van to the door, or else I would have had four."</p>

On the afternoon of that day I was waiting for my master, Mr. Potter, who keeps a van, and saw Stebbings, Collins, and the prisoner come up the horse-ride together—Stebbings wrenched the padlock off the stable-door, where his own hone and master's were kept, and said to me, "Now I want the cart, I suppose I cannot have it"—he said to the prisoner and Collins, "Will a van do?" they answered "Yes"—with that, Stebbings opened the gate where the van was kept, and drew it out—I held up the shafts—he harnessed the horse in a great hurry, and</p>

               <p>put the breeching on wrong—Collins jumped up into the van, and laid hold of the reins—I said to Stebbings, "There is no whip at home, master has it out; here is only this old piece of stick"—he said, "Let us have it"—he handed it to Collins, up in the van, and Collins drove off—the prisoner and Stebbings walked on the pavement, facing the van, keeping up to it—this was about half-past three o'clock.</p>

On Tuesday the 10th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop to pawn tome things—soon after I missed a pair of trowsers—we ran out after him and saw him going up the court very quickly—as soon as be turned the corner we stopped him, and took these trowsers from under his cloak.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 38.) I was on duty on the 21st of January, in the Acton-road, in Hanwell parish. I met tone wagoners, who complained that they had been ill used, and robbed of a scraper, and they wished us to go in search of the thieves—we went back to the Green Man, at Ealing—the wagoners there pointed out four persons as being concerned in the robbery; and one in particular, who bad the scraper with him—I took that man into custody, and was taking him towards Ealing to the station-house—I had seen this prisoner in the tap-room, he was not one of the parties accused—it was said he bad assaulted the wagoners, hut I did not take the prisoner into custody then—I took another man—when I was going along the prisoner struck me a violent blow on the left side, and the prisoner I had escaped at the time—I tell I suppose ten yards, and got up and took the prisoner and called my brother officer, Cook, to take him—I ran after the man who had ran away, but I could not find him—it was entirely through the prisoner striking me that the other man escaped—he sprained my thumb.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shoreditch. The prisoner Smith has been in my employ, the last time, about six months—the first time, I think, about four months—about half-past nine o'clock, on the 12th of January, I received information from Weston—I examined my stock, and found it all right, except five firkins which were in use for the retail counter—I asked Smith if any one had taken any butter out that morning—he said, "No"—I then asked if any body had been there—he said, "No" to that also—I meant in the wholesale department—he said there had been customers at the retail counter—he said it must be a mistake of the witness Weston to say that a firkin of butter bad gone out that morning—Weston had spoke it plainly before him—I again asked Smith if he was sure no one had gone out—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Has no one been here?"—he then said there had been a person inquiring the price of butter—I went to the prisoner Fairburn's shop—I have heard what the officer and witnesses have stated, which is correct—I saw some butter, which I looked at and tasted, and which I believe came out of my shop—we found the staves and the bottom' but not the head, although we made diligent search—I asked Waters some questions, and Robert Fairburn said, "Do not answer any question this it not the place to answer any questions—let them be answered at Worship-street"—I said we had better go Worship-street—I have been fourteen or fifteen years in the trade—it is not the custom to smash up firkins, except in a case of necessity, when the butter cannot be got out without—in general they are kept and sold—the butter weighed about 691bs.</p>

Last Saturday-night week there was a neighbour of ours lay dead, and we were at the there—the prisoner came there—I was there between six and seven o'clock in the evening, about a quarter of an hour before him, and he stopped then till six o'clock in the morning—Mrs. Donoghue was there also.</p>

On the evening of the 14th of January, at six o'clock, I was sitting in the parlour behind the shop, and saw the prisoner come in through the window—I arose from my seat, expecting he was a customer, and as I went into the shop I saw him snatch at a hat which stood on the stand in the window—the hat and stand both fell into the shop—he instantly picked up the hat and ran a short distance with it in hit hand, up the street—he then threw it down—I was close behind him and secured him, and gave him into custody.</p>

On the 12th of January I saw the prisoners on Shooter's-hill with a dog cart, selling hearth-stones, opposite the prosecutrix's premises—I went along my beat, and received information from the prosecutrix—I traced the wheels of the dog cart to cart to wool-wich—I saw Spruce behind the cart, and the other prisoner was gone into a shop to sell hearth-stone—Spruce saw me coming across, and ran away from the back of the cart—I called to him, but he did not stop—I went to the cart and waited till Burford came out of the shop—I found the gown and a sheet in the cart—I took him into custody, and asked him who it was that ran away from the back of the cart—he said it was his brother.</p>

I was out with his cart on the 9th of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, in Old Charlton—I went into a customer's house, and left my cart for about four minutes, and then the coat was gone—I am sure it was in the cart when I went in—in consequence of what I heard I went in pursuit of the prisoner down a lane, by the side of old Charlton church, and saw the prisoner walking with a bag on his shoulder—he saw me and put the bag down, then threw my coat out, and went on—I took it up, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a timber-merchant, and live in Albion-street, Rotherhithe. On the night of Saturday, the 21st of January, I met a female, who is not in custody, in Church-street, Greenwich—it was from ten minutes to half-past twelve o'clock—I went to a house in Tranter's-buildings—there were two beds in the room—I retired to rest, and placed my waistcoat and trowsers on a chest in the room—I had six half-crowns, three shillings, and one sixpence in my waistcoat pocket—I placed my stockings across them, to know if they should be meddled with—in the morning when I arose I discovered that my clothes had been removed—I examined the pocket which contained the money, and five half-crowns were gone—I sent the person belonging to the house for a policeman—he came, and told the prisoners, who were all in the other bed, if they had the money the better plan would be to give it up to me, and all proceedings would be stopped—they had come up subsequent to our going there—the other woman was remaining in the bed—the prisoners appeared asleep—I charged them with taking my money—they said they had not, and called forth many bitter oaths, which 1 did not believe—I stated to the policeman that one was a new-looking half-crown, and one was worn very much at the edges—I assisted the policeman in searching the bed the prisoners were in, and I discovered one half-crown in the pillow and three in a purse, and then we opened the pillow and found the other among the feathers—I found one worn at the edges—when the five half-crowns were found, the policeman asked them who took the money—one said, "I did not take it;" another said, "I did not;" and then they said, "We are all alike, one is as bad as the other"—I believe it was still said that—the others did not contradict it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. William Miller Christy and others. There are more than two partners—Pearson is a labourer in their employ—he had been about four years in their service, and then was discharged—he came back about Christmas twelvemonth—Brooks had been in their service from about June—there is a part of the manufactory which is warmed by steam—that closes at seven o'clock—it is then my duty to go and see that all is right—on the 24th of January, in going round at seven o'clock, after the engine had stopped, I came to a saw-mill, or shed, which is about thirty-nine feet long—it is open at one end, and closed at the other—there is no thoroughfare through it—there are a whole range of windows on one side—I was standing at the open end of the shed—the gas was out—there is a range of shops opposite this shed, with glass windows, and the gas was alight there; that in a good measure lighted the saw-mill—there was a candle burning in the shed—about seven feet down there are some pegs on which the men hang their jackets, about where the candle was—I believe Pearson usually hung his jacket there—he would leave work at seven o'clock—I first saw the light, and said, "Halloo! Who has left a light there?"—I then saw a person nearly at the end, with a bundle in his hand, whom I thought was Samuel Pearson, being well acquainted with his figure—I then thought something was wrong—I went down the mill, and Pearson came up and met me—he had then nothing in his hand but his hat—that was not what he had in his hand at the bottom—he had his hat on then—he said, "It is only me, Sir, looking for my hat"—he then took his hat off, waved it, put it on, and passed on—he sail, "Good night, Sir"—I saw him first on the other side of the candle—when he came towards me he took the candle, and was going to blow it out, and I said, "Don't put it out, I will light the gas"—he then went away—I proceeded to the bottom of the shed where I had noticed him standing—I found this parcel—it contains fine German wool—I searched the shed thoroughly—I found no other parcel there.</p>
