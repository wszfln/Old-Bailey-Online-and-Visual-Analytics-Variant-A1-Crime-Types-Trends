               <p>Q. Could you discern the features of a man by the light of day at that time? A. Yes - I cannot tell how long there had been sufficient daylight to discern the features of a man - I came down directly I got up, and I found all the doors open which I had left shut and locked the previous night - the pair of folding-doors exactly opposite the warehouse were wide open, they are inner doors - at the back part of the premises there is a room looking into a small yard belonging to the next house by a window - that window was open, and a pair of shutters which fasten inside, and were fast overnight, were forced open - I immediately called in an officer and went over the premises, and found the till had been robbed of its contents - I missed about 8s. or 10s. as near as I could judge - there was half-a-crown, 3 shillings or more, and two sixpences, and about 2s. in copper - there was more than 1s. in copper - the warehouse-door was ajar and the chain down - that was shut overnight - the counting-house-door was open - the party had entered through the back window - I missed nothing else myself - a desk in the counting-house, which was not locked overnight, had been opened, and the papers strewed about - the house was entirely secure overnight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Are there any other persons in the concern? A. No - the elder Mr. Sutton's name is not William Henry - I am sure the back window was fastened - I did not do it myself, but I saw that it was done - I do not know who did it - I looked round the premises and saw it was fastened - I did not lift up the window to see if the shutters were bolted, for they are inside shutters - the window is outside.</p>

            . I received a crow-bar from Batten between five and six o'clock on the morning of the 13th of January, it was before daylight - I kept possession of it till we went before the Lord Mayor, at twelve o'clock - the prisoners were then remanded till next day, and I kept possession of it till Tuesday, at twelve or one o'clock, when the magistrate sat; and, as I was not bound over, I gave it over to Batten; but, on the Monday night, I went to Mr. Sutton's premises, between five and six o'clock, and applied the crow-bar to the marks on the shutter; it fitted two marks out of three exactly; it did not exactly fit the third place, but it might have been made by the same instrument - one prong of this crow-bar is shorter than the other - there was the same appearance in the marks, and they exactly fitted it on the back - they were sliding shutters - I could be on my oath that the marks were made by such an instrument - they had every appearance of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not that a common-sized crowbar? A. It may be, for what I know - I have seen crowbars before, but very seldom - I have not seen many similar ones - I have seen a larger and a smaller one, but not one broken exactly as that is - I might have seen them, but never had them in my possession - I could not account for the crow-bar not fitting the third mark - two marks were on one shutter, and one on the other - they might be three or four inches apart - Batten gave me the crow-bar about five o'clock in the morning - I saw it found on Brown at the watch-house - I had it in my custody from then (Monday), till about twelve o'clock on Tuesday - it was never out of my possession from five o'clock on Monday till twelve o'clock on Tuesday, more than handing it to the officer.</p>

I remember taking it from him when they were committed - I am mistaken in saying I had it from him on Monday, it was on Tuesday when they were committed - I gave it to Slate on Monday morning at the watch-house - I took it from the prisoner Brown in his presence - I did not find the snuff-box - I saw a fellow-watchman pick it up - he is not here - he picked it up going up Holborn-hill, nearly opposite St. Andrew's church; it rolled off the pavement opposite St. Andrew's church, Holborn - I had the two prisoners in custody at the time - they were passing along where it was found - I and another watchman and the prisoners were present, and one or two of St. Sepulchre's watchmen, and two other prisoners - there were in all four watchmen and four prisoners, and people following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You mean to say it was purely a mistake when you said you had the crow-bar out of your possession only six or seven hours? A. It was quite a mistake - when I heard Slate say it was not so, I recollected myself from the prisoners being remanded - I have kept the crow-bar ever since on my premises in my top cupboard, in my front parlour, locked up, and I have always kept the key - I have trusted my wife with the key when I have been present, but never when I have been absent - I do not swear the cupboard was always locked, because it was frequently unlocked - it has never been unlocked while I have been absent.</p>
               <p>Packer's Defence. I had been to Epping on Sunday morning - I returned and got to Farringdon-street about half-past two o'clock - it was too late to go home - being too soon for the coffee-shop to open, I stood about on Holborn-hill until three o'clock, when the doors were open- I went in and had some coffee; and about five minutes after I went in, the other prisoner came in - I knew nothing of him - he sat in the box - I had what I called for, and paid for it - there was another lad in the box besides me - before I went in he had gone into the box - well, in came two others, who were taken up afterwards - one of them was making a disturbance with a man - the woman said, if we were not quiet she would have us turned out - she went and fetched two watchmen, who turned us out, and then a watchman came, collared me, took me to the watch-house, he found nothing on me but the money - I know nothing of the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Brown made no defence.</p>

            . I have been a proprietor of cabs till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200005"/>about six weeks ago, and live at Walworth - Brown was in my service about eight months, not exactly driving, but looking after the stables; and sometimes he drove - I have known him at least six years - I knew him when he lived with Dr. Box, on Ludgate-hill - he bore the character of a very honest man indeed - he was driving a cab for me on the 12th of January; and at one o'clock that morning he drove the cab home, and put up and fed his horse at my stables at Walworth - I believe he lodged in Searle's-place, Carey-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him on Sunday night? - A. Yes, at Walworth, on Sunday night, the 12th of January, at one o'clock - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Would his way from Walworth to Searle's-place be over Blackfriars'-bridge? - A. Yes; I should say so - I believe the coffee-shop in Farringdon-street is at this end - it would take him not above half an hour to go from the stables to Carey-street - he left the stables after one o'clock - during the time he was with me I believe him to bear an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he leave with his cab or on foot? - A. On foot - Searle's-place is in Carey-street - it would take about half an hour to go from Walworth to the coffee-shop - I know Bow church-yard - it would not take much longer to go there.</p>

             (policeman). On the morning of the 17th of January I was in the neighbourhood of this house, about a quarter after three o'clock, and saw the door of the Queen's Head (which is the prosecutor's house) open a little, and some person was looking out - I went across, and the door was closed against me - I suppose he saw me coming, but I do not know - I pushed the door, it would not open, and then I called Mr. Dummert - when I found he did not answer me, I pushed the door open, and saw the prisoner standing in the passage, by the light of the gas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200006"/>which was burning in the passage - when he saw me he turned into the tap-room, and from his manner I thought he was going to throw something away - I told him to come into the passage - I asked if he had any thing about him - he said, "Nothing;" - I asked what business he had there - he said the landlord had given him leave to sleep there - I then commenced searching him, and in an inside pocket I found this rag, with some money in it, 8s. in silver, and 4s. 61/2d. in copper, in another pocket 71/2d. in copper, and in his hat, (I believe it was,) I found a penny loaf - I called the landlord down stairs; when he came down I asked if he had given the prisoner leave to sleep there - the landlord said, "No, certainly not;" the prisoner was present - the landlord's sister came down - I told her to look into the cupboard, and she missed a penny loaf in the prisoner's presence - I took the prisoner to the station-house - he never got out of custody - at the station-house he said he got the eight shillings from St. George's Workhouse - he did not account for the copper, and in the morning I told him I would take him to St. George's Workhouse to see if he got the eight shillings there - he then said he got but two shillings there.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by a terrible crash? A. Breaking in the windows and window-frames with brick-bats and stones; and part of a flat iron, without a handle, was thrown into the bar - I could hardly hear their expressions; for the shouts were very tremendous, and some observations passed - there was a general huzza; they broke in the windows and frames, and demolished the chairs in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did people come in through the window? A. Yes, they did - I could see four or five; but how many were outside it was impossible to state - when they came in, they endeavoured to catch hold of Mr. Miller and part of his men - he was under the necessity of leaving the house entirely to their mercy; and both Mr. Miller and the coallumpers, whom he employed, were obliged to leave the house and fly for their lives in all directions - Mr. Miller had some money in a basin on the table in the kitchen, which is a back room - a good deal more damage was done to my house, - they went up stairs - they pulled down a partition in the tap-room and the parlour, and the brick wall was pulled down - the brick wall which was pulled down was behind the house, in the garden - that was part of the house - I did not see any of the persons to distinguish their persons.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is Miller? A. A person who employs a number of men as lumpers in the coal trade - my house is a beer-shop, in which the men were usually paid - I have nothing to do with the coal trade myself - Miller has no interest in my house at all - I had not the least quarrel myself with the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing to induce them to have any animosity towards you, whatever they might have had towards Miller? A. Not the least - I believe there was some ill will on the part of the men towards Miller, but I had nothing to do with it - I have not the least doubt that Miller would have been murdered, if he had not made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have very little doubt their object was to wreak a very atrocious vengeance on him? A. I rather think it was so.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Before they came to where Miller was, did they break in your windows as you have described? A. Yes; they knew that Miller resorted to my house to pay his men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it a notorious thing in the neighbourhood that Miller's pay-table was at your house? A. He used to check and pay there almost every evening - he has sometimes paid a hundred and fifty men of a night there - I have seen from a hundred to a hundred and twenty paid there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200007"/>Q. Was there a difference among the coal-whippers - were they in two parties? A. It is impossible for me to say - I believe some worked at one price and some at another - there was never a disturbance at my house before - I lost 3l. 16s. from my up-stairs room - some of the mob went up stairs - I do not know what became of Miller's basin and money - I cannot say how many persons there were at the time the mob entered; I should suppose there were twenty-five or thirty - the mob dispersed us all - I was under the necessity of disguising myself, and getting into the next house, and the people there tried to prevent my remaining there - they were afraid of being murdered as well - I was not kept out of my own house more than seven or eight minutes myself, before I returned to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the policemen come? A. Yes; two of them acted like men; they were Barton and Sheen; they certainly did their duty - they called me from over the wall, and said the mob were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When the mob came in through the window which was broken, did they do anything directly to the partition between that room and the next? A. Brick-bats and stones were thrown to such an extent that every part was demolished, both the window-frame and everything.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the partition between that room and the other pulled down? A. Quite demolished - that was between the tap-room and the parlour.</p>

Yes; I pay them now a penny a ton - there was no discontent among my men - I believe there has been a great deal of dissention on the subject on the coast of Wapping - it was formerly three halfpence a ton, then reduced to five farthings, and then to a penny - there have been disorders among the whippers at several houses on the coast of Wapping, and several breaches of the peace, but not at our house - these prisoners were not among the men I employed.</p>

             (policeman). I went to the White Lion on the evening of the 6th - I was in Stepney-fields about two hundred yards from the White Lion, and heard a shout of huzza - I ran towards the house - when I got to the corner of the street, I saw a body of persons, I should think between four and five hundred, as near as I can calculate - I heard the stones rattling against the house, at the time I got to the corner - I then ran between the house and the mob, drawing my staff at the same time, and told them to withdraw - I then jumped over the ditch - I saw two or three stones thrown at the house, while I was there - I received one blow from a stone or brick-bat - before I jumped the ditch, I saw Batt standing on the opposite side, among the mob - in fact, he was in front of the mob - he threw two stones or brick-bats - I cannot say which - after going a little way back into the field, I jumped over the ditch again, went to the house, and was about entering the house - I had one leg in, when the stones came rattling about me - I got over the ditch again, and drove the mob further back - I returned to the house, entered it, and called for the landlord - I received no answer, and called a light, which my brother constable brought - I turned round to the window, and saw some respectable persons, as I took them to be - I charged them to aid and assist, and enter the house with me - they did so - we searched the bottom of the house, and then went up stairs - I found the front bed-room door broken open - the back bed-room door was fastened - I returned down stairs, and went out into the back yard; called for the landlord; found him in the next yard - he spoke to me at the wall - I returned to the White Lion - there was search made, and some money found scattered about - it was picked up by different persons - there was eight shillings in silver, and four shillings and seven pence halfpenny in copper - I heard, some time afterwards, that a person was taken into custody - I went to the watch-house, about two hours and a half after, and saw the prisoner Batt in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say anything to the mob assembled about their proceedings? A. I told them to desist throwing; and the first man who threw a stone I would knock down, and take him in custody; but I knew my life was in danger - I cannot identify the other men; but next day I apprehended Kippin from information - I asked where he was the night before - he said, "At the White Lion," but he knew nothing about the row.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did they go to the White Lion after or before they went to the Pewter Platter? A. I do not know; it is three quarters of a mile from the Pewter Platter - Donoghue appeared to be one of the mob - this was close upon the stroke of nine o'clock, I should think.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What made you think Donoghue was one of the mob? A. He addressed the mob who was walking with him, and said, "Here is one."</p>

            . I keep the George public-house, Cock-hill, which is three quarters of a mile or a mile from Lidyard's house - on the Thursday evening from four to five hundred persons came to my house - they were coal-whippers - I saw none of the prisoners there - when the mob was going from my house a large number of voices called out, "Away for Miller's, and pull the b-s house down," and they went off - that was the cry of the mob - before that they had been threatening my house - they went towards Miller's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know where Miller lives? A. I do not; I know where Lidyard lives - I did not see the prisoners among the party at my house - they broke my lamp - they could have done what they liked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do coal-whippers frequent your house? A. Yes; some who work at one penny, and some at one penny farthing - I pay them myself for the masters - I paid some one penny, and some one penny farthing, at that time.</p>

            . I am a surveyor - I examined the house of Mr. Lidyard, and found the sashes of the window in the front of the tap-room broken to pieces, as well as the glass that was in - the sash was broken to pieces, but not the outside frames - the middle frame, which we call the sash, which are the divisions between the panes - the frames were merely damaged with blows - the window of the front bed-room, over the tap-room, was literally broken, and the sash part and the frame damaged - the top part of the street-door had a sash, which was broken to pieces, and the door injured with blows from stones and brick-bats - the tap-room door, or rather the passage-door between the passage and tap-room, had the sash broken in, and the casement which turns on hinges - there was a pair of doors between the tap-room and parlour - one of those doors had a sash in it which was broken to pieces, and the panel of the other door was broken out - the back-yard wall was taken down, and the chairs in the tap-room broken to pieces - the wainscoat between the tap-room and the room behind was broken, and one panel broken out, and a panel between the tap-room and passage broken, and the partition very much injured with heavy blows - this all appeared to have been done with stones and brick-bats, by violent means.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MILLER re-examined. Q. Where do you live? A. In Pleasant-row, Stepney-green, about three hundred yards from the public-house - no mob came to my house, nor was any damage done to it that night.</p>

               <p>Kippin's Defence. I went to the house, and called for a pint of beer, not knowing the mob was near the house at all - as soon as they came, I came out, and went on.</p>

The value of the silver I missed was 20l. or 25l. - some of it was old silver - Adlam said they were washing in the washhouse when they heard some silver rattling - they were both together, and both said the same thing, but not together - Adlam said while she was washing she heard a noise in the servant's-hall, and that they took a light and went to see who was there, or what was the matter, and they saw the sash down, the window broken, and the silver taken away - I went to bed, and between eight and nine o'clock Pugh came up to me, with five tea-spoons in her hand, which she gave me - Adlam was not there- when I was disturbed in the morning, I went round to the doors and found them all locked, and the windows fast except that one - I had not been in the servants'-hall the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your groom here? A. No - he is a grown-up man - his name is Edward - the prisoner had a little black box - it was large enough to hold the spoons - I did not search her box at any time, because the spoons were found between three and four o'clock in the afternoon - Mead, the constable, brought them to me.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was there a lock on the drawer the plate was kept in? A. There was on the cupboard in which the drawers are - there is not a lock on the drawers, because the cupboard-door locks them in.</p>

            . I have lived in the prosecutrix's service five months last January - on the morning of the 8th of January, I was called up by the prisoner - I have the care of the plate - I put it into the drawer in the butler's pantry the night before, and shut the drawer - the windows were shut and the shutters, but the screws were not put in - I locked the door of the room the night before, and left the key outside, and went to bed - I sleep in the adjoining room, three or four yards from the place - I was awoke in the morning - I do not know what awoke me - I got up at a quarter past four o'clock - I was awoke about three quarters of an hour before that, and did not go to sleep again - I heard the rattling of silver in the hall (which is a room next to mine, and the room in which the plate was kept) - and I heard it in the kitchen next - and I heard footsteps and talking in the kitchen, and silver rattling - I heard the rattling of the silver first, and then the talking - I heard nothing else - there were about two persons talking - I did not understand their voices - I could not tell who they were by their voices - it seemed like the housemaid's voice - I looked at the clock when I got up - it was just twenty-five minutes past four o'clock - I went into the kitchen and saw both the prisoners - Adlam left the kitchen about a quarter to five o'clock - I saw her come back - she brought in five tea-spoons with her and gave them to me - they were wet and muddy - she said she had picked them up on the green - it was about five o'clock - she had been out about a quarter of an hour - it was quite dark then - I do not recollect whether she took a lanthorn out - we were burning candles in the house - there is a lanthorn generally kept in the kitchen - I do not remember seeing it there when she was absent - it might have been there without my seeing it - I wiped the spoons, and put them into the drawer where the plate was kept - I did not give them to the other prisoner - this was after mistress had been down stairs.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you shut up the drawer after putting the spoons into it? A. Yes - I did not lock the cupboard - the housemaid came into the hall and took the five spoons up to mistress - they are the spoons Adlam said she had found, and gave to me - she might have had the lanthorn out and I not perceive it - I was a little frightened - the housemaid's was the only voice I could recognise - Edward was the groom - he was nothing else - he did not live in the house - he was an ordinary labouring man, who came and acted as groom - by pushing the shutter down a person outside could open it - Edward was discharged before this - I am sure of that - he had no right to come to the house - he did not come after he was turned away - he came one night - how often he might have come without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200011"/>my knowledge I cannot say - I do not recollect whether there had been rain the night before, nor whether the lawn was wet or dry - I do not know how far Edward lived from mistress - Adlam has lived there since October - I do not know how many trunks she had.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Before you went to bed, had you locked the cupboard where the plate was kept? A. Yes, and left the key in it - I do not know whether the window was broken or not the night before - I had not looked at it - I had seen it at seven o'clock that night, and am sure it was not broken then - the shutters are inside the window - the shutters were put up, but not screwed - I do not know where the screws were.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were there any fastenings to the windows? A. Yes, a latch inside - it is a sash window - it was the bottom pane of the upper sash that was broken, just over the latch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What night was it that Edward came there? A. I think it is on the 7th, the day before this happened - I do not know at what time of night he came - he did not stay all night - it was either Monday or Tuesday, I cannot say which - this happened on Wednesday morning - I think it was on Tuesday he came - I am not quite sure of it - he went away soon after he came - he came about seven or eight o'clock at night - he did not see my mistress - he stayed a short time, and went away soon after.</p>

            . I am gardener to the prosecutrix - I do not sleep in the house - on the morning of the 8th of January, I went to work about seven o'clock - I went first up to the stable, and saw the new groom, (not Edward) - I went to work after this, and afterwards went to the house - I examined the premises where the window was broken - there were no footsteps outside, either on the green or the gravel walk - there is a gravel walk immediately under the window - I tried to lift up the window, but could not, because the bottom sash was pressed down so hard - the broken pane was in the top sash, which was down below, and the bottom sash above - they stuck fast and could not be moved - I and a carpenter afterwards tried to move them, but could not - the carpenter was obliged to get tools to do it - it had been wet that night, and there had been a great deal of wet before - the paths outside the window were soft - I could not see one footmark there - I did not leave any footsteps there in walking particularly - about the middle of the day I went into the house, I looked on the floor by the window, I saw no footmark there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you outside the window on the gravel walk; a good while, I suppose, trying to lift it up? A. Yes; we left footmarks then, but not when I went to look at first.</p>

             - I saw the prosecutrix there - I went into the butler's room and saw the window broken - I did not observe any glass on the floor - I saw glass outside, and two drawers in the butler's room were open - I did not observe any footmarks on the floor, but it was so long afterwards, I did not take notice - I am sure there was no glass on the floor - I went outside the house with Watkins and the housemaid (Pugh) - I examined the place and observed the path under the window - there were footmarks there then, as if there had been a great many people about - the window had been put up before I came - I afterwards searched the house, but found nothing - I went into the back yard, and found in the dust bin, wrapped up in a blue apron, a quantity of plate which I have had in my possession ever since - I found the silver in this apron - I brought it into the house - I think the first person I met in the house was Adlam - I had not seen what was in the apron then, but only judged it by the weight - I said to her,"Whose apron is this?" she said it belonged to the other prisoner, Ann, who was present herself - I then took Pugh into custody - while Pugh was going to the cage she said something - I went to the house next morning and took Adlam into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what time in the day did you take Pugh? A.

            . I am a labourer, and live at No. 17, Craven-street, Soho - I was in company with Burke when he met the prisoner - he asked him what he had done with his ring - he said he had been into the country, and had been robbed of his clothes and the ring likewise; and if he would not take him before the magistrate, he would make the ring good.</p>

               <p>F. J. BURKE re-examined. The ring was of more value than 5l. - it was a gift from my sister - it could not have been bought for that; for the ruby was worth more than that - my father is a licensed victualler; and my sister lived with him - I had worn it eight or nine months - I am certain I never gave or lent it to him, except to show it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the ring himself - I wore it six months in his presence, and was robbed of it with my clothes and all at Birmingham four years ago - the prosecutor cannot take a righteous oath respecting the conversation passing between us so many years ago - the ruby was all cracked to pieces - it was not worth one shilling and eightpence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it at an auction you bought them? A. No; I bought them of Mr. Evans, cabinet-maker, High Holborn - he is a manufacturer - I cannot say how long they have been in use - in the day-time, the shop-front is entirely out - I have no shop-boy - I saw them safe at ten minutes after four o'clock - I could swear it was about twenty inches inside the shop, but I said eighteen, to be quite certain - no part of it was outside - I had pulled it more into the shop for safety when I went into the room to tea - I could not have seen it in the parlour if I had left it where it was - the prisoner did not tell me that a gentleman directed him to carry it, and promised him eighteen-pence, nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you live and sleep at the shop? A. Yes: the shop communicates with the dwelling-house, and is part of it.</p>

I live at Mr. Silk's, No. 8, Longacre, next door to Mr. Whitaker - on the afternoon of the 20th of January I saw the man take the table on his shoulder - it was the prisoner - I cannot say where the table stood, but I saw him take it on his shoulder - I had only just come out of master's shop - whether it was inside the shop, or outside, I do not know, but I saw him whip the table up on his shoulder very quick, and run off with it - I saw him take it up - he was just by the shop-front when I saw him take it on his shoulder - I saw nobody near him at the time - I am sure he went up Rose-street - he walked very quick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the shop when you saw him take the table? A. About a dozen yards, on the same side of the way - I could see him - he made no resistance with me - he said nothing till he came before the magistrate, when he said a gentleman gave him eighteen-pence to take it to New Church in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman met me at the corner of Rose-street, as I was talking to a young woman who lodged with me twelve months before - the gentleman asked me if I wanted a job - I told him I did - he said if I would take the table to the corner of New Church, to the booking office, he would give me eighteen-pence, and the woman said, "Go on, you cannot get eighteen-pence every day" - I took the table - he said he had to call in King-street, Covent Garden, and would meet me - I was coming from master's at the Savoy, Strand, at the time, where I had done a day's work.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I apprehended the prisoner the second time at a house in White Bear Gardens, Kent-street, and took this cap off her head - there was an umbrella in the room which the prosecutrix identifies.</p>
               <p>MRS. JOHNSON. This is my cap, it was in the chest that was broken open - I had not lent it to her - the umbrella is mine, and was in the kitchen, not in the chest - the ring and the chain are mine - the chain was fastened to the watch, and the ring was in a little box which was in the chest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The cap she lent me, and she had my cap on which I have on my head at present; and the umbrella was lent to me, or anybody in the house, to use when it rained; the chain is my own - I have had it four years.</p>

            . I am a gardener - on Saturday, the 18th of January, I was near Mr. Newsom's shop, and saw Ware and Elliott - when I first saw them they were about eight yards from Newsom's shop - I looked after them, and saw Ware with his two thumbs pressing against the glass of the window - Elliott stood about three yards from him - it is a great thoroughfare about there - I was about eight yards from them - they saw me looking at them, and went away - I then saw the prisoner, Hall, come out of Castleton's beer-shop - I had not seen him with the other two - he crossed the road, and made a sign with his hand - Elliott and Ware had just turned the corner - they might have been in his sight but not in mine - I then saw him walk on the road, about twenty yards away from Mr. Newsom's towards London - he then came across the road, and went as far as the beer-shop door again, that is opposite Newsom's - I then went and rang Newsom's Bell - I had not seen anybody else go to the shop - Newsom's shopman(Fletcher) came out to me - he called Newsom up, and I told him what I had seen - Newsom went over to the beershop in consequence of what I told him - there was a hole made in the window when the two boys went away - I had not seen anything of the prosecutor at the time - I think the boy was pressing his thumbs a little lower than where I saw the hole - I should think about six inches below - I did not see him put his hand in it at all, and never saw him (Hall) with the other two - nor did I see Blake with them.</p>
               <p>MR. NEWSOM re-examined. I went over to the beershop, and saw Blake and Hall there, but not the others - in consequence of something - I told them I suspected they had cut my shop window - Blake said he was a very respectable young man, and a dealer in hare skins, and was quite above any such thing - Hall said he knew nothing at all about the transaction, and that they had never seen each other before - they had a pint of ale drinking together - I gave them into custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How many heifers had your father? A. Three - I did not go in the field again till next morning - the gates were both shut, and had a lock on; but the lock was out of repair - I saw two footmarks in, and two out; there was two one way and two the other - there were the footmarks of two persons having been into the field, and two out.</p>

I have a small farm at Pinner - on Thursday, the 6th of February, I had three heifers in a field a little distance from my house - I remember their being missed - I went into the field, and saw footmarks of two persons going in and coming out of the field - I traced the footsteps of two heifers towards Harrow, down Mud-lane - they might go that way to Smithfield - I went to Smithfield, got there a few minutes past three o'clock in the afternoon, and found Turle in the Ram-yard - I know the three prisoners, and they know my farm - I had seen them in the neighbourhood shortly before - I never saw them together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw footmarks of two persons? A. Yes; I noticed there was two in and two out- I am certain both had gone in at one time and came out- they could not take step by step regularly as persons walking - they did not step, step by step, but side by side - they both went in together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the feet of different sizes or the same size? A. I cannot swear they were not the same footmarks of one person.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. They went side by side, as if walking in and out together? A. Yes; and the heifers appeared to walk in the same way - the footmarks were behind the heifers - I saw the footmarks of the same men coming in and going out, but the heifers only going out.</p>

             - I know people who live round Elstree, and asked him if he knew Mr. Wheel, or Gurney - he said, "No" - I asked if he knew any master-butcher there- he said, "No," and I gave him into custody - I have not seen the heifers since - I saw them go down the Rose-yard - I delivered them there myself - I left them in care of the ostler, where we put beasts.</p>

I am a policeman - on Friday morning, the 7th of February, I came on duty at five o'clock in the morning - Lathbury applied to me - I accompanied him to the Rose-inn, and there saw Armstrong - after some conversation between him and Lathbury, I asked where he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200017"/>came from - he said from Elstree, and had bought the beasts at Barnet fair, in September last - I asked where he had been living since - he could not give me an answer, and I took him into custody - I went to the Ram, and told the ostler to deliver the beasts to nobody but myself - Element came to town between three and four in the afternoon, and I showed him the two heifers which had been delivered into my care - he identified them: about two hours after taking Armstrong I had information and found the Deacons at the Crown, in Smithfield.</p>

             re-examined. I untied the heifers and took them down the yard with Mr. Lathbury - I took the same heifers out when Mr. Element was there - they were the same as I had taken down there, and the same as I had tied up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen either of the prisoners with them? A. When I tied them up Armstrong was with them - I saw the heifers again the same afternoon after I had been to Guildhall - I was about the market most of the day - I had untied them in the morning when Lathbury bought them - that was about an hour after I had tied them up - Lathbury told me to untie them, and put them down the yard - that was in the morning - Element was not present then - it was market-day - there are not a great number of heifers on Fridays there - there might be one hundred, two hundred, or more - I had been employed tying up beasts, sheep, and calves, that day - I tied up no beasts that day, except the two heifers.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there particular about these two heifers? A. They were both white-backed ones - I cannot say how many white-backed ones there might be in the market; but these were in my hands, and I tied them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anything to prevent somebody untying them and putting two others there? A. Yes: Mr. Lathbury put three clips on their hips - I saw him do that, and saw that mark again when Element was there.</p>

Certainly - many customers deal with me, and may not know but that I am Mr. Williams - I have never given them reason to believe that I was Mr. Williams, or that I was not - I may have put "Williams &amp; Co." when I have received money - I have put the name of Burchett more frequently than Williams - Mr. Williams became a bankrupt, and Mr. Hurder took the stock - he was security to the assigness - Williams is my brother-in-law, and so is Hurder - Williams's name is rated in the parish books - the business is in the name of Williams - it goes on as it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200018"/>did before - Mr. Hurder's name is not entered in the gas rate-book.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been free? - A. I do not know that I am compelled to state - I do not choose to tell you- when I summoned Britian, I did not represent that the business was not mine, and take out a summons in the name of Williams, and sign the name of Williams - on the contrary, the summons was taken out in both names - both my name and Williams were given in, as the firm stood in Williams's name - they would not grant a summons without both names were given in - I remember the shop being robbed at one time by a man who was charged with it - the prisoner was a principal witness on that occasion; and I then told the prisoner, as the name of the firm was Williams, he ought to have given in the name of Williams - I did not tell him to state that I was managing the concern for Williams, who was a lunatic - I might have told him to say Williams was a lunatic - I do not remember that I did - I cannot say either way - I did not tell him to say anything - I merely said, as the firm went by that name, that it would be more proper to give in the name of Williams as the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mean you recommended him to give the name of Williams as the prosecutor, when he was not? - A. It was after the prosecution; he gave in my name - I said, "I think you ought to have given the name of Williams" - not as proprietor of the goods - I did not instruct him to state the property belonged to Williams.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You did not hear him state that? A. I was not present - I never told him to say Williams was owner of the goods, or that I managed the business for him - I did not say I had rather the man had got clear than I should be represented as the proprietor - I think I can swear that - I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you tell the magistrate, when you went before him, that the firm of Williams and Co. kept no books? A. We do not keep books - I have a book which I call a memorandum-book - we sell for ready money - I could not say that we kept no books, because I produced a book - I said we did not book goods - I did not state we kept no books whatever - I said we kept no book but a memorandum-book - I said that the first time - when I was before the magistrate, the second time, I said I had a memorandum-book, and a book merely for me to put down daily accounts - the third time I produced another book, and said that was all the books I had - we have a book in which we enter measures, but nothing of money transactions - that book is for orders and addresses - I only keep those three books - I never had any destroyed - one is a memorandum-book, the other merely states the money taken in the day - I have that here; it contains the account of the receipts of the till - I never had any more than these three books - I do not keep a bill-book - I do not enter bills in any book - I have no Bills of Exchange - they pass through my hands in business - I accept bills in the course of business, one, two, three, or four, perhaps, in a month - not so many as fifty - I have no book in which I keep an account of those bills - I make a note of them on loose papers, which I put into my desk - they are not afterwards sewn together - I never had a bill-book to enter bills in - my son knows nothing about my bill transactions - the business is transacted in my name, and I accept them in my own name - I never accepted a bill in the name of Williams, never in my life, and never kept a bill-book - those three books are all I have kept - if anybody should say I kept more than that, he would be mistaken - Mr. Hurder is in court - he has nothing to do with the business of Williams and Co. - he is attending merely out of curiosity - he has no interest in the business at all - I purchased the stock from him - I had been in business in the same line before in Crown-street, Finsbury - I live there now - Mr. Hurder lives in the house where the business is carried on - it is let to him - nobody constitutes the firm of Williams and Co. but myself - I have not allowed my children to receive money on my account for the last two years - I had a person in my service of the name of Baines - I have not the third book here, it is merely an order-book and memorandum-book - I believe there is not a shilling of money entered in it - I am sure of that - I had no motive at all for keeping that book back - I could produce it in a few minutes, if you wish - I am not in the habit of drawing bills on Williams and Co. - I never did such a thing - I accept bills in my own name.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you prove under Williams's estate? A. Yes, I did, not on bills, I will swear that - I proved a debt - I think it was for goods he had of me - that is the same Williams and Co. whose name is over the door.</p>

            . I live in Bucklersbury - in September last, I saw the prisoner - I paid him sixteen shillings, about the 13th of February, for a pair of boots which I had from Mr. Williams's, No. 29, Cheapside - I never saw Mr. Burchett till he waited on me on this business - I frequently send to the shop for shoes, but never was in the shop - I paid the prisoner the money - it is a ready-money business, and I took no memorandum of the payment - I did not know Mr. Williams, nor whether he was a servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You said you did not know whetheir it was Mr. Williams, or a servant? A. Yes - I mean the prisoner; I did not know whether he was Mr. Williams - I never saw Burchett - I never heard of his name till he came to me - I knew nothing of Williams or Burchett's concerns.</p>
               <p>MR. HURDER examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know when Mr. Burchett took up his freedom? A. No; I do not know whether he was free of the City when the prisoner was taken into custody - I have not heard him say so - I will swear that - I do not know whether he has taken it out since this prosecution - I sold the business to Mr. Burchett, in 1829, as agent to the assignees - the prisoner has fetched goods from my house in Skinner-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether Mr. Burchett carried on the business on his own account? A. I know, on my oath, that he has, since 1829.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did williams, the lunatic, become a bankrupt? A. In 1829 - Mr. Barker, of Northampton-place, and Mr. Brown, of Bermondsey, the two assignees, had all the property - I had my share of it - I had a dividend - I had the whole of the goods - I had no goods out of Willimas's shop after his bankruptey, nor before - I never had any of his goods.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have been asked if any of the goods belonging to the bankrupt came into your possession? A. When he became a bankrupt, two assignees were chosen - Barker and Brown were the two assignees, and they gave the whole of the property into my hands, as their agent - I sold it on their account, and they received every farthing of the money - I was employed by the assignees to realize what I could from the property - I did not sell all the goods - he had all the goods in Cheapside; but there are four other shops - Burchett paid the price put on the goods by the assignees.</p>
               <p>WM. BURCHETT re-examined. Q. When did you make yourself free of the City? A. I have made two or three applications, but did not take it till to-day - I made my first application two or three weeks ago - the prisoner was taken on the 3d of January - I think it was after that time I applied for the freedom, but I cannot say to a certainty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you apply for it just now? A. It had nothing to do with this prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you not cross-examined by the magistrate as to whether you had taken out your freedom before he would commit the prisoner? A. No; it was not put to me at all - the question was asked me by the attorney, but not by the magistrate - the magistrate said he had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Deeply sensible as I feel at being placed in so disgraceful a situation, and knowing myself innocent, I entreat you duly to consider every circumstance. You will observe by the evidence that I have been for four years engaged in a house of business (for some mysterious motive or other) carried on by three or four different names, each one appearing in the character of proprietor, until some peculiar circumstance calls for the right owner of the property - and one is immediately put forward as such proprictor - such is the case now. Burchett has nothing to do with the property, nor, indeed, half so much as Hurder: I was hired by Hurder and paid several times by him; and I have been in the habit of making out bills and receipts of the firm always in the name of Williams; and on the occasion of a man robbing his shop, I solemnly and distinctly swear he cautioned me not to name him in court, for the penalties he would incur for doing business without his freedom; and he said, "Rather than name it before the grand jury, let the bill be thrown out." Had my counsel have called his son, I should have been borne out in that by the witness. Before the magistrate at the examination, he distinctly swore he kept no books - it can clearly be seen by the jury, if they will inspect the manner the cash-book is kept; it is a mere jargon of figures which no gentleman can understand. The prosecution is merely malicious, because they were aware one of the firm or party would have proceedings instituted against them, and to get me out of the way, being almost the oldest servant in the concern, they bring the charge - there are eight persons who receive money; the prosecutor, Mr. Hurder, Williams, the lunatic, the uncertificated bankrupt has even received money in the shop due to the firm under his own name, and put it in his pocket, and laughed at the way he was cheating the assignees - this is a fact; my fellow shopman, Barnes, would bear me out - it was usual for me on receiving monies immediately to pay them to whoever was in the shop empowered to receive them - they could produce two or three hundred bills in my handwriting and receipts - I was desired by Burchett never to sign his name, but Williams's, which I always did- I never objected to sign my own name, if a customer asked it - I call your particular attention to the fact that none of the witnesses could say I received the money; nor did I; I never received a halfpenny from either of the gentlemen appearing against me - the prosecutor begged Mr. Al<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200020"/>derman Winchester, I believe, to punish me in a summary way, to give me a month, and not to have anything more to do with it; he refused - he was asked to produce his books and he swore he had none - I am certain the inspection of the book will clear me from any charge - several customers have paid money - there is not a distinction made; if a customer paid 2l. 10s. and another 2s., it would be immediately placed in the book as 2l. 12s.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol - on the 24th of January I heard of this robbery - I examined the footmarks which led into the shed from the pales of the playground - I found four books under some loose hay in the shed - I knew the prisoners, and took them on suspicion - I afterwards saw Ready in company with two other persons - I asked if they knew anybody in their line who had received some books of some body? - Ready said he had; and he went home and got these gooks - I took him to the cage, and he identified the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I come to you that morning for? A. I do not know - I do not know why I went into the back place - you had a dog in a string - I did not buy it of you - I got to town about half-past five or six - I did not offer to compromise this for 2l.; but you said if I had a mind to go to a friend of yours, I should be made welcome, and you would give me 2l., and 4l. after you had been out a fortnight - I called on you the other day, because you sent for me to come to you by a letter, which you told the person to tear as soon as he had read it to me.</p>

               <p>MR. SCAIFE. These are a pair which I know - they were made for a particular man - these are the first I made in this way - they are quite experimental ones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you make these experimental ones? A. About two years ago - I have not made any breeches-drawers like these since - I have made some pantaloon-drawers for the same gentleman - he returned these, as he did not approve of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not these been washed? A. I should say decidedly not - I will not swear it; but, on looking at the button-holes, which is the best criterion to go by, I should say they have not - I cut these out myself.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor - my brother and Thornton called on me that evening - I took them into the kitchen - I and my brother went out, and he gave me a shilling to get change, and to get a pennyworth of gin - I left the watch safe when I went out - when we returned, Thornton was standing at the door; my brother did not go into the kitchen, but he went away with her - I went into the kitchen, and missed the watch in about twenty minutes after they were gone; no one else had been in the kitchen that I know of; Thornton came back the same evening for my brother's pen-knife; I gave it to her, and told her the watch was gone; I asked her if any one came while we were out - she said, "Yes; some man came down into the kitchen, that she said, "What do you please to want?" and he said, "What is that to you?" and he went out of the kitchen - and she said to me, "Do not say we have been here, or we shall be caught;" my brother was very much in liquor.</p>

             is on some of the duplicates - I went to the Holland Arms, from information, and found the prisoner Powell bedding up some horses - I asked him if he knew the cook who had lived at the Holland Arms - he said"Yes" - I said, "Did you pawn anything for her?" - he said,"No, by my God, I never did" - he denied it several times- I told him to be cautious, as what he said I should have to tell in another place; and that I had some duplicates with his name, in full length, on them - he then said, "I will tell you all about it: I went to the back of the house, and the cook threw the pair of sheets out of the two-pair window, and I caught them and pawned them."</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Is your private mark on it? A. No; not now - I cannot tell whether there was one when this was in the shop - we generally put them on gum tickets, which are apt to come off - I put a piece of this pattern and colour on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many pieces did you put down the second time? A. I cannot say, there was only one of this pattern - I know every pattern we have in the house - I cannot tell how many pieces we have- there are five piles about a foot high - if a handkerchief was taken I should miss it immediately, though there were twelve or fifteen pieces in a pile - the young ladies I mentioned it to were those who serve in the shop - I know this piece, as it had been in the window about three months before, and the part that was uppermost, when it was folded, was rather faded - I remember putting this particular piece in the window - I cannot say whether it was on the top of the pile or in the middle - I cannot find any trace of the gum mark on them - I missed this piece and another - the one I first missed has not been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been giving the jury and me to understand that you missed this piece? A. I missed this, but this was not the one I missed first.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you talked about your knowing it by its being faded, and by the fold, why did you not say that you did not mean this one? A. I have not had an opportunity - the prisoners were minutely searched for the other piece, but it has not been found - it was a British twill, a shell pattern, and a scarlet colour - I described it to the officer - I think there was only one young lady in the shop when the prisoners were there - she was twenty yards from me - but there were more when I missed the handkerchiefs - I did not see this piece found on the prisoner, but I saw it in about a quarter of an hour - I could not swear to it, but I went back and missed it from the shop - I cannot now swear it is ours, but to the best of my belief it is.</p>

I am a relation of the prosecutor's - I was in his shop - I saw the prisoners there - I received information - I went out and sent for an officer, and when the prisoners came out I was at the door with the policeman - he took them in charge - Anderson made a violent attempt to get into the shop again, and so did Johnson, but I prevented it - Anderson said he had bought the handkerchief, or a handkerchief, and he ought to be treated like a gentleman - I followed them to the station-house and watched them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do I understand you that from the time they left the prosecutor's till they got to the station-house you were behind them and watching them? A. Yes; I do not believe they dropped anything in the street, but they might in the police-office - I saw Anderson searched there, and nothing was found on him; but Johnson went down with the cook, and she might have been bribed to take anything.</p>

             (police-constable D 74). I was at the station-house when the prisoners were brought in - the man was searched, and after looking under the woman's cloak I took her down stairs, where a woman searched her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200029"/>while I stood at the door; she found nothing on her - I was not satisfied, and took her to another woman, and as I was directing her to search her, she dropped this piece of handkerchief; I took it up and said, "What is this?" she said,"It is what you are looking for."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Johnson said, "This is what you are looking for?" A. Yes, I stated that before the Magistrate; I suppose it was taken down - there was nothing found on Anderson which the prosecutor claimed - I did not find anything dropped in the station-house, nor in the room below, but this piece.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence. When the officer came and stopped me, I asked for what - he said, "I will tell you at the station-house" - I said, "This is the shop I have been in," and I wanted to go in, as I did not like to be stared at in the street - Mr. Wood put his hand to my bosom, and shoved me back, and said, "I shall not allow you to come in, you must go to the station-house" - I went, and was searched three times, and then twice more down stairs - after that, the shopman brought some handkerchiefs down and said, "Here are some handkerchiefs for you, do you know these?" - I said, "All the handkerchiefs I have are my own, and the one I have paid six shillings for."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you quite sure the window was not cracked before? A. There was a crack across the pane, but not in the part he broke - the glass was all in the window before I heard the crack - I had seen the crack that day, but I had not looked at it that evening - I cannot swear it was not more broken before ten o'clock - on coming out I saw the man at the window - my brother had goods in the window - people frequently stopped to look in - I saw the prisoner and another at the window - there were no things hanging in the window to prevent my seeing - there was plenty of space, and I could see his person through the shop, because there was plenty of light - the other man ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, were not the rings found on the spot where the other man stood? A. No, they might have been half-a-foot from where he stood.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Gerrard, of Hornsey, and look after his sheep - May came to me on the night of the 14th of January, and Watling with him - in consequence of what he said, I went with him to the field where master's sheep are kept - I had seen the sheep a quarter before four that evening - there were six sheep then - the field was fenced round - when I went with May, which was just at ten o'clock, I found only five - on the following morning early, I accompained May to search in the neighbourhood of the field, and saw a sheep-skin and entrails; I did not see it found, but I was in the wood at the time, and saw the skin and entrails in possession of Watling; May was there; Master's sheep were marked with a stroke of ochre right across the loins; they were all marked alike; this was a wether - I examined the skin at the watch-house, but not till I got there, I then found the ochre mark across the loins; I am quite sure it was the skin of my master's sheep - a sheep's head was produced at the watch-house; I saw it fitted to the skin; it appeared to correspond; it fitted quite as if I had taken the knife and done it myself; the end of the skin was cut with a knife, but not cut straight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you said it was cut clean across with a knife? A. I said no such thing; it was not cut slanting, nor zig-zag; it was cut in and out - the wool was on it; where the knife parted it, there the wool was; none of the wool was off; there might be a little, but I did not observe any - this is the skin of my master's sheep; if I saw the skin a hundred miles off, I should swear it was my master's property, if I had seen it the day before; there is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200031"/>mark on the head which I told him to look for; there was no other mark on the skin except the mark across the loins; that mark is very frequently on sheep; many thousands of sheep are so marked; there is no brand-mark.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is the mark on the head? A. On each side there are two faulty teeth, which I told the watchman to look for before I saw it.</p>

               <p>"- I found the mare there - I looked into her mouth and said, "She is not a very old soldier - she is not yet three years old," and said he had given her a rare bucking, he must have come a long way - he said he had come upwards of thirty miles that day- the mare looked very much distressed, as if it had come a long journey - there was a sack and collar there, and a cart bridle - next morning I lent him a broom to clean her with, and saw him in the stable cleaning her - on the Friday night, about half-past twelve o'clock, I heard a noise which induced me to get up - I looked out of the window, and saw Chamberlain and two other men with the mare under my place - they took it under the gas light, to look at her in front of my window - I paid no attention to what passed, but went to bed again - I saw Chamberlain on Saturday morning in the stable, Cherry and a man named Hawkins were with him - the tail of the mare was about an inch shorter than when I first saw her - she had been cleaned, and the tail was tied up with straw, as if going to be sold - Chamberlain and Cherry both said they were going to sell her - I saw them take her out of the stable - Cherry led her out into Harford-street, and then mounted and rode her away - Chamberlain was with him - I was examined before the Justice on the business, and was shown a mare in the stable of Emmet, a cow-keeper, on the 17th of January - it was the same mare as I had seen in possession of Chamberlain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not you seen Chamberlain work the mare for two or three days? A. I saw her in a coke cart one morning - Chamberlain has been in the habit of hawking coke about the streets - I have seen him with several different horses - I saw the mare in the cart on the Friday morning, working in the streets - I only saw her that once.</p>

I live at No. 184, Hoxton Old Town - I am servant to Mr. Perrian, a coal-dealer - I was going out with some coal up the town, on a Tuesday, and saw the two prisoners looking into the coffee-shop window by the side of Mr. Carter's - then I saw Smith cut the putty of Mr. Carter's window - Pickett was standing by the side of him - Smith cut the putty - I did not see what he did it with - I was across the road opposite - I heard the glass crack - they pushed in the glass; and Smith took out a shawl, and put it under Pickett's apron - they then walked away quite fast down Bacchus'-walk - I put down my coals off my back, and went over to Mr. Carter's, and told what I had seen - Carter went after the prisoners with me- we met them running down Bacchus'-walk - they went into a house, the door of which was open - they were secured - I did not see the shawl found.</p>

Yes; I have known Gifford about a month - he had called in at the same time as the prisoner - he called in as he went by, to know what business the prisoner had there - I told him he was about buying a pair of shoes - the policeman did not stay there - we all went out of the shop together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the policeman desire the prisoner to come back with two shillings and ten-pence, and he should have them? A. He said that certainly - that was merely a joke - I told the prisoner I could not take less than three shillings - I should have had very little profit on them - the policeman said he should have them if he brought two shillings and ten-pence - nobody searched the prisoner that night - he was searched on Thursday, the 6th - I did not think he had them.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I was not in Kay's shop on the Saturday evening - I was passing by and stopped at the door - the prisoner was inside the shop - they were agreeing for a pair of boots - I asked Kay if he had a small pair of boots for a boy of mine - he said he had not- Kay asked the prisoner three shillings for the boots - he offered him two shillings and sixpence - I walked away, and heard no more of it till Thursday, the 6th of February, when I went to No. 28, Searle-street, in consequence of information - I saw the prisoner there, and asked him for the boots which he had bought of Kay - he said he had bought no boots of him, but he had bought a pair of shoes - I came back to Plum, who went back with me - the prisoner was still there - I asked him for the shoes, he handed them to me - I put them behind my back, and asked Plum if he had mended the shoes - he said he had - I asked if he had no particular mark on them besides mending them - he said there was a crack inside of the right shoe - he described them, and I took the prisoner into custody - I asked him where he bought the shoes - he said he bought them in Bethnal-green-road, of a man in a fustian jacket, and he did not know who.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Kay long? A. For two or three months - I said he might give him two shillings for the boots - I heard the prisoner say he would bring two shillings and sixpence - I did not desire him to bring two shillings and tenpence - I merely said in a joke, two shillings and sixpence - he had offered two shillings and sixpence, but did not show the money - he said, "I will bring them back in half an hour with the money" - I believe I came out of the shop before Kay and the boy - I was in the road - the prisoner came out - Kay, I believe, was the last that came out - we came out one by one - I told the prisoner if he gave the two shillings and sixpence he could have them - I said nothing about two shillings and tenpence I am sure, to the best of my recollection - I am not in the habit of going to Kay's shop often - I was away from the shop about ten minutes after seeing him with the shoes - he handed me the same shoes, but I mistook the word shoes for boots, and I asked him for boots - and he thought they were boots I wanted.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there anything you saw which could make it proper for the cab to go on that side of the waggon? A. Nothing at all; the two carts were a-head of the waggon - there was nothing between that waggon and me, but the other cab - it was highly improper for the cab to go on that side of the waggon - that is the side on which the driver always walks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it so light that you could distinguish the features of persons? A. I could not - I did not take notice enough of the cabs to see whether persons were inside them - I consider the cabs were not abreast - the cab with the grey horse was before, but I cannot say how much - I should think ten or twelve yards; quite as much as that - I cannot be mistaken - they were going at a galloping rate - the pace they went at was about ten or fourteen miles an hour; but I am no horse jockey.</p>

            . I am a house pupil at the London Hospital - I was called to the man about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock, and found him with a fracture of the ribs on both sides, he had difficulty of breathing, and complained very much of his chest; and he had an effusion of air under the skin, which indicated that one of the ribs had perforated the lungs to cause the effusion of air - he died on Saturday, the 9th of February - I examined the body after death, and found six ribs on each side fractured; and an immense collection of blood on the chest, and on the lungs as well; where air ought to have been there was blood; that injury was quite sufficient to account for his death; any thing going over him would produce such injury; the wheel of a cab going over him would account for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would you not rather conclude something very heavy must have gone over him? A. Yes; heavy, certainly; I will not say very heavy, it depends so much on the circumstances; some ribs break sooner than others - he told me he was sixty-nine years old - a waggonwheel might have done it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might a cab-wheel have done it? A. Yes; I rather think a waggon-wheel would produce a much greater effect than I found - an injury of that kind depends very much on the position of the body at the time it is done.</p>

I am a waggoner - on the morning in question I was driving a waggon to London; there was one cart before me; I was going at my usual walking-pace; and on this side of Bow church I was passed by two cabs, one with a grey horse, and the other a dark one; the one with a grey horse came on the inner side of my waggon, between me and the pathway; it was going the same way as I was, and coming as hard as a horse could gallop; if I had not got behind my waggon, I should have been run over; if I had been walking close to my horse in the usual way, it must have knocked me down, and ran over me; I was close to the stones; there was just room enough for the horse; I never drive on the stones, but keep as close to them as I can - there was plenty of room on the other side for three or four cabs to have gone by - when they passed me, the cabs were as near each other as could be, one on one side, and one on the other - I could not tell what colour the other cab-horse was - it was driving at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200036"/>same pace - after the cab passed me there was a lad before me, and he dropped behind his cart; and my horse shyed, and I cried, whoey; and by my crying, whoey, his horse and mine both stopped - and then I heard a man call out,"The Lord have mercy on me! what shall I do?" I went to him, and found him wallowing in the slough, by the side of the curb in the paved part, and in the track the cab had gone - he was hurt very much, and I called a policeman - I found a lanthorn by him which was beat all to pieces - it appeared to have been crushed by something going over it - I do not know who the man was - I assisted in picking him up - I called my master, who was in the waggon - the man was picked up, and I went on with my waggon, as soon as the policeman came - I saw no more of the cabs - they went on - the man was very close to the curb when I went to him - he had crawled a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there space for any person to be safe who was walking between your waggon and the curb? A. No: the cab must have run over me, if I had not got out of the way - it was not proper for any cab to go on that side - it was driving on the wrong side - when I found the man on the ground, my waggon had not reached him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. We are told it was rather dark; could you say that no carts had gone on? A. I do not know what there was before me - for what I know, some carts might have gone on - I cannot say the man was not on the ground before the cab passed - I asked him whether the cab had run over him, and he said, "Yes."</p>

            . I was accompanying a van that morning; I was immediately before Poulton's waggon, going in the same track; I was close to the stones, by the side of the road; I was coming towards London; I heard a cab rattling on the stones close to me, and I had to fly behind my van, or it would have gone over me; I ran behind my van, and caught hold of the hind ladder; I was almost down; the cab-horse was galloping very fast; if I had not got behind my van I should have been run over; the cab had a grey horse in it; after the cab had passed me, I saw something fall in the road, which I at first thought fell from the cab, but immediately I heard a man groan; I stopped my horse immediately; my van had not got within a rod of him; I found the deceased in the road, near the side, on the spot where I saw something fall, as near as could be; the man said he was hurt very much; he took on a good deal, and said a cab had run over him; I asked him if it was a cab with a grey horse in it; he said "Yes;" he was taken away, and I went on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your van or Poulton's first? A. Mine was; I was just a-head of his horse, not a rod before him; there was one cart behind, and there might be one or two before; it was dull, but I could see by the light of the lamps; there were carts or something going before us; I had not seen the poor man before he was run over; it appeared to me that something fell from the cab; I cannot say who was the driver of the cab, nor whether persons were in the cab.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You thought something fell from the cab? - A. Yes, it appeared like it; I thought my life in danger.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who showed him to you at the hospital? - A. The door was open; it was public for all the Jury to see him; I went in at the time the Jury did; he always went by the name of John Farrell; he used to come along the road regularly every morning with a lanthorn, which I found on the right side of him; I took him home myself.</p>

            . I am a proprietor of a cabriolet - I drive it myself - on this morning I was at Laytonstone - there was a concert there, and a ball; and eight or nine carriages of different descriptions were coming to London - there was a cab with a grey horse there - I never saw the driver before - I could not swear to him - the prisoner is very much like the person - I was in the same public-house with the man who drove the grey horse for some time - I talked with him a little - there was a great impediment in his speech, like a defect in the roof of his mouth - my cab and his were the only two I saw there - I followed him with my cab - we were together at the gate, the first gate from Layton - after I passed Bow Church the grey horse was before me the whole way - I picked up a hat in some part of the road - I cannot say whether it was on this side Bow Church or the other - I did not see where it fell from - I was stopped by a policeman in the road - he told me a hat had fallen - I went back and picked it up - I then followed on the road - I got up to the other cab about Whitechapel Church - I called out to the driver, but do not know whether he heard me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you set out from Laytonstone, was the driver driving, or one of the gentlemen? - A. One of the gentlemen was on the driving-seat - there were four gentlemen came out of the house to get into the cabs - two got into my cab, and I suppose the other two into the other - mine was a very dark small mare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Yours was the only other cab there? A. The only one I saw - I was driving at the rate of about eight or nine miles an hour, I should consider - I do not think it possible that my horse could go at the rate of ten or fourteen miles an hour - Stratford-gate is the first gate from Laytonstone - I overtook the cab at that gate, at least I was close behind it - I saw a gentleman on the driving seat there - I kept behind the cab with the grey horse all the way, after leaving the gate; when I first started, I was a considerable distance behind it, as it got on while we were stopping to pay - I never again got up to it, until I got to Whitechapel church - I could see fifty or sixty yards before me, I should think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cab with the grey horse stop during the passage from Stratford-gate to Whitechapel-church? A. Not that I saw - the gentleman continued on the driving-seat from Stratford-gate - I saw no more of it until near Whitechapel-church; and then the gentleman was not on the driver's seat - that is about four miles from Stratfordgate - I heard nothing of the accident until the day before the inquest - I was not racing with the grey horse cab - it is quite incorrect - I never saw the man before in my life- I remember meeting and passing several carts and waggons on the road - the gentlemen I drove were sober; I have not seen them here to-day; they were at the inquest;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200037"/>but, whether examined, I do not know; I think one was named Betram, he lived at 29, Broad-street; I am sure one of them was at the inquest.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Were you trotting? A. No; my mare goes at a canter; she will not trot; I cannot call it galloping, a sort of canter; I passed several waggons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the grey horse go on one side of the waggon, when you went on the other? A. I never was near enough; I did not see it go inside a waggon that was going the same way as me.</p>

            . I am a merchant's clerk; I was at the ball, at Laytonstone, with my brother; we went in a cab which had a grey horse; we came home in the same cab; my brother took the reins; I believe the prisoner to be the driver; but he was so muffled up that I could not distinguish him; I hired him in Stamford-street, Blackfriars; when we came away, I got inside the cab, my brother got in the driver's seat, and the driver sat inside with me; my brother drove from Laytonstone; I had an impression at the time that the driver was rather tipsy; my brother drove to Bow-church, and, after that, the cab-driver drove; to the best of my belief, he took the reins of his own accord; he drove from within; he did not change his seat; my brother still kept the driver's place; the driver had a very peculiar voice indeed, as if he had lost the palate of his mouth; I saw the prisoner at the inquest, and believe him to be the man, but he was so covered with a cloak, and a handkerchief round his face; I heard him speak at the inquest, and should say distinctly he is the same man; it was not a cold morning; we had been dancing; I had a cloak round me; I do not remember passing a waggon coming in the same way as myself; I was labouring under a severe cold at the time, and had a cloak round me, and a handkerchief round my face; I was muffled up a good deal; as we came along, I felt a shock as if we went over something; I should say the horse went faster when the man took the reins, than it did when my brother had them; the horse took fright, I should think at the shock; after we had gone a distance of fifty or sixty yards, or perhaps more, the man stopped the horse; he did not go back to see what was the matter - I learnt from my brother that he had been nearly thrown off his seat, and he had lost his hat; we did not go back and pick it up; I then told my brother he had better get inside, and he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose it was necessary to stop for him to get inside? A. That was at the time we stopped, forty or fifty yards after the jolt - the cab stopped probably a minute or a minute and a half - the other cab did not overtake us - I should say at the time of the jolt we were very near the right hand side of the road, going to town - that would be the off side - we were near the middle of the road - we had not passed a great many carts and waggons in the road, we passed some - I did not hear a soul call after us, after the jolt - at the time of the jolt the horse was not galloping - I observed the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear a horse capable of going at a very quick pace? A. Quite the contrary - we were two hours and a quarter going from our own house to the place, which was a proof how it could go - the driver did not appear to urge the horse to unbecoming speed on the road - we were quite sober - the horse did not appear to me to be perfectly sound in his paces - I should say he was lame of the off fore leg - I wished to stop and pick up my brother's hat - he replied, that our friends in the cab behind had picked it up - I knew the gentlemen in the cab behind - at the time the jolt took place in the road I saw no waggon near us - it is six miles from Laytonstone to Whitechapel Church, which we were about an hour and a quarter going.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you see any waggon near you, when the jolt was - were you looking out? A. I was admiring the lamps - that would be on the side away from the waggon - the lamps were on the off side - the lamps are only on the off side - I believe they are not on both sides.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you call that only a mile from Whitechapel? A. The post-office is considered six miles from Laytonstone, and it is a mile from my house to the post-office; I speak according to the Directory; I stopped the cab to get into my seat out of the driver's seat - there was no alarm given at any time to the cabman that an accident had happened - I had my hearing perfectly correct, and could hear the better from having lost my hat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). After the evidence which has been given against me by the witnesses who have been examined, I must still feel, that although suspicion may<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200038"/>attach to me for having been the cause of this accident, I am still certain that the horse and cab which I drove on the night in question, did not commit the offence; but you, my Lords and gentlemen of the jury, are most capable of judging of the degree of credit due to the statements of the witnesses, and will be best enabled to consider whether or not my plea of "Not Guilty" has not been justified even by the evidence for the prosecution.(

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have stated all you heard? - A. Yes; after the words, "At the second," the man knocked me down, and then there was a whistle; and several persons assembled from the upper end of Whitecross-street - I believe nobody was in the street except the five composing our party, and the party who assaulted us - only one man assaulted me - I called "Watch" and "Police" - that brought watchmen and policemen round me - I do not think the noise I made caused persons to assemble about me - I will not swear it did or did not call some casual spectators - I am sure I was knocked down - no attempt was made at my pockets; nor any words used that I heard indicating an intention to rob me - I had spent the evening at my brother's, in Bishopsgate-street - it is a tobacconist's, the same trade as myself - six brothers and one stranger formed the party - I went there about nine o'clock, and stayed till past one - I had supped certainly and drank - Mr. Hodge was the other person - I supped at eleven o'clock, after the shop was closed, which was at eleven o'clock - it struck one o'clock as we left - I had taken a glass of gin and water - I think I had half a glass afterwards - I had a glass of porter at supper - I will swear I had not two glasses of gin and water after supper - the second glass was not filled; I had a glass, or glass and half, or two glasses of porter at supper - I cannot tell - I had no other liquor - I went out of the crowd as soon as I got on my legs, and saw nothing more till the prisoners were in custody - being perfectly sober, I was competent to recognise persons - I saw nothing of the prisoners till they were in the custody of the watchmen; that was not more than seven minutes, I should think, after the row in the street - two of us had been walking together, but we were going one and one when this took place; but previously we had been walking two and three; on the pavement of the street we had left two persons could not conveniently walk together - we had left go in this narrow street, and had not rejoined - the street it happened in was wide enough for two to walk together - we might have got fifty yards up the street - I cannot say - we were quite as quiet as I am at the present moment, and as little disposed for larking as you are now - it is my habit to be out as late as that, and sometimes later; very seldom till three or four, but I am so occasionally - this has been my habit for twenty-five years - my shop is open at six o'clock half the year, and seven o'clock the other half; but it is not closed until ten o'clock at night.</p>

            . On the 12th of February I was with Mr. Procter in Chiswell-street about one o'clock, or a quarter after; I was walking eight or ten yards behind Mr. George Procter - a man passed me and touched him by the elbows, then ran across the road and cried out, "Now for it to-night," and immediately afterwards two men ran across from Whitecross-street, and a man in a short jacket struck Mr. Procter, and he fell, (who, I believe, from his height, and being captured immediately afterwards, to be Matthew Tierney;) he struck Mr. Procter; eight or ten more men came up, (I do not know their faces,) and some women, and a general affray took place; a quarrel ensued, and the police and constables got much injured; they wished to rescue the prisoner; nobody in particular quarrelled, but they struck Mr. Procter, and we called the police, who came; we wished to capture the two men who first crossed the road, one of whom, to the best of my belief, was Matthew Tierney; I do not know the other.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Cripplegate Without - on the morning of the 12th of February, I heard a cry of "Police," and "Watch" - I immediately went towards the place, to the end of Chiswell-street, and towards the corner of Beech-street Mr. Procter gave charge of the prisoner Tierney - I immediately took him by the collar - he said, "I have done nothing;" Mr. Procter said, "You have knocked me down once, and my brother has been knocked down twice by the same party, and, no doubt, with intent to rob me" - I immediately took the prisoner along a little further, ten or twenty yards - I turned round, and saw the other three coming up- they said, "Where are you going to take the prisoner?"- I said he was given in charge, and I was going to take him to the watch-house - Adams said, "You b-, if you do not let him go, I will knock your brains out" - I went a few steps further, and took my truncheon out, and said, "You had better keep off, or it will be the worse for you" - he said, "Where are you going to take him?" I said, "To the watch-house" - he again replied, "I will knock your brains out, you b-, you shall not take him any further" - he seized hold of my truncheon - a policeman came up, (G 93,) and I took Tierney along, till I was interrupted by the other three prisoners - I delivered him to the policeman (G 93) - Adams then caught hold of my staff, and dragged me across the street; he got me down by a hard tustle, took my staff out of my hand, and laid it across my head, and broke my head in two places, and then said, "I think I have done the b-'s business for him" - another of them (not taken) said, "George, you have not half done his business, give it to me" - he took it, and he hit me across the ribs five or six times, and jumped upon me; Creamer is the man who jumped upon me - a little after nine o'clock that same night, I had seen Adams, Creamer, and Nowland, just at the end of Chiswell-street, crossing just at the end of my beat, between Whitecross-street and Chiswell-street - here is the handkerchief I had round my neck; it is bloody - I had given no offence to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you preferred an indictment against them for assaulting you? A. Yes; for assaulting me in the execution of my duty in this very transaction.</p>

             (policeman). On the morning of the 12th of February, I was on duty - I was not present when the transaction took place; I came up about five minutes after, as I suppose - I heard a rattle spring, and went up and found Tierney in custody - I saw Adams run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200040"/>away - I saw a gentleman there, but I cannot swear it was the prosecutor - I saw an attempt to rescue Tierney, and heard a gentleman say, "Secure that man in the flannel jacket, for he is the man who attempted to rob me" - that was Creamer - he said, in Creamer's presence, that he had attempted to rob him, and I took Creamer into custody - I saw Tierney there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the gentleman here who said the man in the flannel jacket attempted to rob him? A. I cannot say; the gentleman did not tell me so, but I heard that said in the crowd - I do not know who said so; I only heard a voice say so; I had not an opportunity of calling for the person who made that charge - nobody came to the watch-house and charged him with attempting to rob him in my presence, because we were ordered out - I have since seen a person who charged Creamer with attempting to rob him; his name is Procter - I do not know his Christian name - I was not in the watch-house when the charge was taken - I have not brought the charge book.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any man give Creamer in charge to you at the watch-house, or elsewhere, for attempting to rob him? A. No; I heard the voice when I went up - I did not call for the person who owned the voice - I cannot name anybody who gave Creamer in charge for attempting to rob him - I am not a witness on the common assault bill - I do not know at whose instance this prosecution is instituted - a gentleman named Procter is the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to GEORGE PROCTER. Q. Pray is this prosecution undertaken at your expense? A. No: the City prosecute - I am the prosecutor, but I suppose it is not at my expense - if it is at my expense, I shall have no objection to pay it - I hope it is not - I gave the three men in custody when I got to the watch-house - Creamer was one of them - I did not say he had attempted to rob me - I went into the grand jury-room twice, and was sworn twice - the other indictment is not at my expense.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear anybody speak of a person in a flannel jacket? A. No; I was not the person who used that expression - I gave Tierney, Nowland, and Creamer into custody, as being on the spot when I got on my legs, but I do not swear positively to their knocking me down.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there a lease to Mr. Luard's? A. I have never seen the lease - Mr. Luard is in France - but I believe there is a lease - he had received rent for the house for three years - Mr. Murden was the previous tenant, but he delivered up the key to Mr. Hopkinson, Mr. Luard's then agent - it is now in our office - I believe Mr. Murden had a lease, but I never saw it; I never saw Mr. Murden - the house has been unoccupied since we have been the agents - Mr. Murden has been insolvent - the prisoner called on us six months ago, to look at this house, and we showed it him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at work in my shop, near Clare-market, and a man came and employed me to go to this house, which I did about two o'clock; he told me to take the fixtures down, and he would bring a van to take them - I took the four sashes on my shoulder, and the gentleman came and took me - I did run, but it was very foolish of me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could not the prisoner have washed these potatoes? A. Yes, he sold them in the mould - I never knew potatoes to be covered with pea-haum before - I did not take any from his shop which were not mine; they are not uncommon in our neighbourhood, but they are in the London market, though they are occasionally brought here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. To the best of your belief, are these your potatoes? A. Yes, I can clear my conscience in saying that they are, from the pea-haum which is about them - the horse I saw at the prisoner's was a chestnut one, with a white streak down his face.</p>

            . On that morning, the 1st of February, I was coming to town about half-past twelve o'clock in the morning, from Bexley - I met a horse and cart about one mile from the prosecutor's - the cart was then empty, and was going toward the prosecutor's - there was no one in the cart but a person (who, to my firm belief, was the prisoner) was with the horse, and leading him - it was rather dark - I went round at the back of my horse and cart, and let the cart go by me - there was a chesnut horse in the cart - I came on to the half-way house and baited, and the same cart again passed me loaded, very soon after six o'clock; the man was leading the horse by the head - I have been to the prisoner's house, and saw the horse and cart there, which I have sworn to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you particularly notice the cart on the road? - I noticed it by seeing it twice; I noticed the size and the colour of it; I swore to the magistrate that it was the same to the best of my belief; I swore to the horse, but I did not swear to the man; I said, to the best of my belief it was the prisoner, and the magistrate ordered him to put his round frock on, but I had known him for years; I did not tell the magistrate that; the magistrate asked me if he was the man, and I said, by his height and size, to the best of my belief, he was; I could not see the man's face in the dark, but I was sure in my own mind he was the man; it was not dark at six o'clock, but he was then five or six rods from me; his back was towards me then, but I knew the horse and cart, as I had seen it so often; but I did not tell the magistrate so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt that the horse you saw going and coming, was the same you saw in the prisoner's stable? A. No; it was the same, and so was the cart; and from the size and appearance of the man, I have no doubt it was the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the first thing you heard was a cry of "Stop thief?" A. Yes; I cannot say who it came from, but it was at the corner of Chiswell-street - the crowd might consist of five or six persons - I found the diamond pin in his left hand, and the ring on his finger; and he was trying to get rid of them - his fall was not in consequence of my taking hold of him, it was intentional on his part - I did not see any woman come to the station-house, but I heard of it from the inspector, who is not here to-day.</p>

             (police-constable G 217). I was on duty about a quarter past nine that night - I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner run - I followed him about thirty yards to Lazarus's shop, and just as I was getting hold of him, he fell down across the area; he was then taken to the station-house - the prosecutor said he had lost his watch - I took a lanthorn, and found this watch in the area, under the iron railing, just where the prisoner fell- he had a good opportunity of putting it there, for I noticed as he fell, his hand was on that area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were running after him? A. I saw nobody but Maynard, the butcher, but I cannot swear there were not four or five persons running after him as I was in front of him, and I turned and followed him - when I went to the area, I went down stairs in the house, and found the watch; it was not broken, nor is the glass; there was some dirt in the area, it was about three feet deep - I heard the prisoner say he had touched some woman.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You are not a great judge of flour? A. No - I did not see Mowatt's face, when he had the flour, but I am certain he is the man, by his person and dress, and size - I had a full view of him when he dropped the flour - he returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, his coat was covered with flour - he had a cap on when I saw him, and the same when I saw him again.</p>

             (police-constable K 263). I was on duty, and met the prisoner in Lower Gun-alley, with the flour on his back - I followed him a few paces, and, while speaking to my brother officer, he dropped the flour and ran away - I sprang my rattle, but lost sight of him when he turned - I saw Lemore come from the prosecutors' premises about half past three o'clock, and went to him and said, "Young man, I want you" - he became very much agitated, and said,"For God's sake do not take me, I shall lose my situation, I only came to see the machine, and have been drinking with a friend" - I was taking him to the station-house, and on looking round, I saw my brother officer with Mowatt - I found on Lemore about one pound of biscuits, which he said was given him by Owen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you where he lived? A. Yes; and I went, but found nothing there.</p>


               <p>THOMAS OWEN. I am foreman to Messrs. Fraser - the premises were in my care on the 21st of January - Mowatt used to work on the premises - I ordered him to come at ten o'clock the night before he was taken, to turn over a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200046"/>docker - he came and brought Lemore with him, who is his brother-in law; but the millwright had not got the docker done, and I sat down and went to sleep - there were some sacks of flour in the passage - when I awoke, the two prisoners were gone - we had biscuits like this up stairs - I did not give Lemore any, but he could get at them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are hundreds of such biscuits come from your place, I dare say? A. Yes; I cannot tell where he got these - I had asked Mowatt to come, and he brought Lemore with him - I said he might as well stay, if he was not engaged - I did not give either of them any biscuits - I know Edwards - he was employed to work the docker - I did not tell him to give them any - I did not give him a key to get any - I did not direct him to give the prisoners anything - we had some beer with the millwright - he is not here - he might have given two or three of these to the prisoners, but I do not think he would have done it - the men who work for us have 14lbs. of flour at Christmas.</p>

            . I am an officer - I took Pearl at his masters' on this charge - he said he had had the duplicates, but he had returned them to Wright, and the reason they were pawned was, they could not get their wages; and he told me where to go and find Wright, and get the duplicates of him, but they were sent to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. MARTIN. There was no money due to Pearl - he was an apprentice, and had 16s. a week - I have known Wright from a child, and know no harm of him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Who paid him while you were away? A. Mr. Davies.</p>
               <p>Pearl. My master knew a fortnight before that they had been taken, and he said if they were not produced the next morning, he would have me taken, as I must know something of them - Mr. Davies did not pay me above once in a month, but Mr. Martin knew nothing of that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When did you first say the prisoner was the man who took it? A. I told the landlord I had lost the watch - I made no charge against the prisoner till the policeman came, because I felt myself in danger among so many strangers - I told the landlord I had lost my watch, but said nothing about the prisoner - I did not see him drop the watch, but I felt him drop it down by my feet; and he had snatched it from me - I did not see him snatch it, but felt him, and he was the only person within reach when it was taken from my person - he did not remain near me till the policeman came.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say, "He was still near me?" A. He was not a distance from me - he was not so far from me as he is now - the room may be about sixteen feet long.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was not further from you than he is now? A. No, not so far; I heard the watch fall, when it was first dropped - I was quite sober - it was not the first public-house I had been into that night - I had had one glass of ale - my friend Daniel M'Carthy was there, but he went out before it happened.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you clear that is the man who took the watch? A. I am perfectly certain of it - I swear to him positively - when I charged him with it, he said nothing.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I went into the King's Arms, being sent for by the landlord - I got inside, and the landlord and prosecutor stood at the door of the back parlour - the landlord said, in the prisoner's hearing, that a watch was lost, and he would not let anybody out till it was found - I went inside, and took the candle which one of the party had, and searched under the settle - the prosecutor did not charge anybody at that time - I went to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200050"/>further end of the room, and found the watch lying on the settle, out of the case, which was within three or four inches - I put it into my pocket - I asked the prosecutor who was the person who stole the watch - he pointed immediately to the prisoner, and said he was the man - I told the prisoner he must go with me to the station-house - he refused at first, and denied it - I said, "Come to the station-house with me" - he said, "I shall not go with you," and the whole party in the room got up off their seats, men and women; and I attempted to take him through the door, and the party inside pushed me back to the table - the prisoner slipped from me into the bar, and escaped from me - they rescued him - I should think there were seven or eight characters that I knew - and there were a dozen of them all in a string helping him - I did not see him again till the 15th, at half-past ten o'clock - I had known him before - he was brought to the station-house, and I identified him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were the prosecutor and landlord standing? A. Just outside the door, so that nobody could get out - the prosecutor was in no danger at all from the people in the room - he could have told the landlord then who took it - he did not tell me who took it till after it was found - I did not see that any of them were intoxicated - the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I heard of this, and found the prisoner at the Swan public-house, Bacon-street, Brick-lane, playing at cards, about half-past nine at night - I told him I wished to speak with him outside - he objected at first to come out - I then told him if he would not come out I should tell him before the company what I wanted him for - he then came out - I told him he was my prisoner - I brought him outside the door - my brother constable was there, in case I wanted assistance - we got him outside, and then the party inside came out - he then tried to get away - he struggled and got away, and ran to a court opposite which I knew was no throughfare - I called to my brother constable, we followed, and caught him without his getting out of sight - I told him if he did not go quietly I would handcuff him - he then asked what I wanted him for - I had told him I wanted him for a job in Whitechapel - I secured his hands and took him down Bacon-street - the mob followed us, and we were molested by stones being thrown at us - I brought him down and secured him.</p>

            . I was at work on Thursday, the 23d of January, at the Mint - I am employed in the refinery - there was some silver in the Mint in a pan - I left the silver in a pan on Thursday evening next the door, in the drying room - I left work at six o'clock - I left Beville, the foreman, on the premises, and a Frenchman (Chennell) and I left together - I returned next morning at a quarter past seven - I was the first man that got there - I did not lock the door when I went out at night - I saw Beville, my countryman, lock the door - I opened the door next morning - I got the key from the window next door to the office - I went into the refinery and lighted a candle, and came round with the candle and saw silver on the floor, and there was a plank placed on the steps of the door to wheel up coals - we saw some white on the floor, and felt it, and it was silver - I went to the place where I had seen the pan the night before - I saw a round spoon near the silver - the spoon was not in the place it was in the night before - the spoon had been left the night before in the place we melt in - I saw it left there - there were two spoons - I went out at the gate directly and told Canadice, the porter, that the Mint had been robbed, and desired him to call the head porter, Podio, and I spoke to Podio myself - I had not finished speaking to Podio before Beville came up - he saw the silver in the yard - I afterwards went with Beville to the prisoner's watch-box - I saw silver all the way from the refinery to the watch-box, and under the watch-box- I saw some silver on the straw of the ground of the watch-box - I never saw the prisoner in that box - he used to be in such a box - after Podio came, he put his hand under the watch-box and pulled out a red cap full of silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Do you recollect the Thursday evening? A. Yes; I was in the drying room, about six o'clock - there was a pan there to dry silver - Beville and I left together; there was no spoon in the pan then - I did not fasten the door myself; I saw Beville shut the door, and lock it, and put the key in the window - when I went next morning I was alone - I went into the same place, and got the key, and unlocked the door myself - I found the door in the same state as I had left it the night before - the refinery is another room - I found the particles of silver on the floor of the refinery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been employed there? A. Five years and a half.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200051"/>CHARLES BEVILLE. I am employed at the Mint as foreman to Mr. Mathison, and have been employed there five years - there is a process of drying silver which the French people understand; no Englishman understands it- it is a French process entirely - the silver is reduced to a powder - on the evening of the 23rd of January, we made our operations on three thousand ounces of silver - after it is finished, we make the silver precipitate, and put it into drying pans, with fire under them - at six o'clock we go away, and, on that night, I locked one door, and Chennell another - one is the door of the refinery, and the other to the copper-foundry; both the doors open into the yard - I locked the refinery door, and put the key in my pocket; Chennell put the other key on a window, six feet high, where it is generally put, that the first man who comes may take the key and let himself in - I knew the prisoner as a watchman to the Mint all the time I have been there - on the morning of the 24th, I went to the Mint at a quarter past seven o'clock, and I was told something, I directly went into the refinery room, and saw plenty of silver scattered on the ground of the refinery - that silver was in the same state as I had left it the night before, precipitate - I then went into the drying room, and there saw plenty of silver, and there was an iron ladle which on Thursday night had been left in a melting-pot in the foundry where the silver was melted - I found it in the morning in the drying room, and there was plenty of silver scattered about the floor - when you are in the refinery, there are three steps, and there is a plank to enable them to get the coals up the steps - I saw silver on that plank - there was no silver on the top of the plank, but we turned it round, and there was silver on the under part of it - after that I searched, and traced the silver all the way to the window, which had been shut the night before - it was only shut down, there was no shutter to it, and there was silver on the window and outside the window- in the yard there was silver - I traced the silver all along the yard to the watchman's box - it was for whatever watchman might be on duty - the watch-box was shut, but Podio, the head porter, came and opened it; and in the box was plenty of silver, mixed with the straw - at the bottom of the box, and under the box, we found more silver mixed with the straw and earth, and a night-cap with silver in it - that was under the box - there was a little silver in it; it seemed as if the silver had been put into the cap and turned out again - the cap was made of wool - the silver had stuck to the wool inside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You worked in the refinery on the previous evening? A. Yes; I was in the foundry, and in the drying room - I was in all places - I saw the iron ladle in the foundry - one key was kept in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person, who knew it was there, could get at it? A. I believe not; because we go to work at six o'clock, and the watchmen do not come until nine o'clock, and cannot tell where we put the key, as they are not there- it is customary to leave the key there, to enable the workmen who come at various hours, two and three o'clock in the morning, to find it.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a peculiar process of drying the silver - what do you call it when in that state? A. Silver precipitate, or lime of silver.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Precipitate or not, is it silver? A. It is silver.</p>

            . I am night gate porter at the Mint - on the 23rd January I was on duty - the prisoner came at nine o'clock to go on duty as watchman - his place of duty was in the copper-foundry yard - I was there when he went off duty, at six o'clock in the morning - he came and hung up the key and pistol, and went away - some time afterwards I heard from Podio, and accompanied Mr. Barton to the prisoner's house, No. 10, John-street, Cannon-street-road - I knew that to be his house - I had been there before - Mrs. Riley opened the door - I asked for the prisoner - she said he was not at home - I went into the house - I went down below, accompanied by Mr. Barton - after that I went to the Roebuck public-house, Cannon-street-road - I found him there on going a second time, between ten and eleven o'clock - we went back to the house with him - Mr. Barton and Mrs. Riley were there, and Mrs. Riley went up stairs - I went up stairs after her - she took a key from her pocket, and opened the garret-door, which was a bed-room, and went in; and directly I got into the room, I saw something tied up in a silk handkerchief, on a box under the window - this is the bundle - I brought it down stairs, and said to Mr. Barton, in the prisoner's presence, "This is, I dare say, what we are looking for, Sir" - Riley said, "What is it?" - I replied, "Oh, you know what it is," and said he must put on his coat and go to the Mint - he said if he went to the Mint he should never see his children any more - he said to Mr. Barton, "I hope, Sir, you will forgive me" - Mr. Barton said he must speak to Mr. Mathison about that - I then went with the prisoner to the Mint; but, before that, when he came from the Roebuck, into the passage of his house, and pulled off his hat on seeing Mr. Barton, and his hair was all over white powder, similar to this silver - he had his coat off at the Roebuck - I saw his coat down in the kitchen, at his own house - it appeared to be the same coat as he had on when he left duty at six o'clock in the morning - I went with him to the Mint, and when in the Board-room with me and Podio alone, he said repeatedly that he should either be hanged or transported, and I cautioned him to hold his tongue; but in the presence of Mr. Mathison and some other gentlemen, he said he could not tell what induced him to take it; but he thought it was silver-sand - his duty was in the copper-foundry yard that week - the handkerchief contains silver, weighing eighty-one ounces, the same as was in the night-cap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him in the evening before, in search of his great coat and hat? A. No, I did not see him going to the gas-house - I did not see him from nine to six o'clock - his residence is in the county.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint - it is in the county of Middlesex - I have been in Court during the trial - I made no promise or threat to induce the prisoner to enter into conversation with me, but cautioned him not to say anything to injure himself - I asked if he knew me - he said, "Yes" - I said, "Riley, I am going to take you before a magistrate, and I caution you not to say anything, because if you do, I shall be obliged to use it against you" - he went on his knees to Mr. Mathison, and said, "I am a very bad man, and I hope you will forgive me" - I desired him to get up, and said, "Riley, this is a bad business" - he said, "Oh, Sir, I hope you will forgive me; it is the first time I ever did it; I was very drunk, and did not know what I was doing; I found the door open and went in, and that is all I recollect" - I said, "Riley, you must have gone in at the window" - he said, "Must I, Sir? I do not recollect now" - he was then taken before a magistrate - there is a communication from the copper-foundry to the drying room, by means of doors - the refinery is approached by a door from the outer yard - you descend into it by three steps to the melting room, and from that room you get to the drying room - this silver was deposited immediately under the window - a person unacquainted with the building would be very likely to fall into one of the cisterns, which are charged with acid.</p>

I am a policeman - I was on duty on the 20th of February, and apprehended the prisoner about half-past five in the morning, it was just breaking daylight - there was daylight enough to distinguish persons' countences - the moon was not shining - Donovan was running after him - I searched him, and found on him a flannel and this silk handkerchief - I took the flannel from his trowsers, and the handkerchief out of his trowsers pocket, and he had a knife - I took him to the station-house, and found fourpence in his pocket, and a needlecase, which the prosecutrix owned - when I took the prisoner, I asked where he had been, and he told me into the privy, which is in front of the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. How long had you been up stairs before you came down? A. Five minutes - he had cut three or four pieces of bread and butter, and he had the tea-pot in his hand and poured out the tea - I hardly know whether he had commenced eating - I believe I had made the tea before I left the kitchen - I do not recollect whether he eat several pieces of bread and butter, but he was not there five minutes after I came down - the street door was shut to, not locked - it it always shut - I believe it was shut - I did not take particular notice of it - it might have been open, for what I know - the area gate was shut with a spring lock - a catch which draws back inside - a person could not open it outside - there is no handle outside - a person might get over the area rails - the door leading from the area into the house was fastened, so that nobody could get in - it was fastened by the catch - the area gate was locked, and the key hung up - I asked him to go out and get me some pump water - he had to go down into a street below us, and he told me to leave the gate open, and he could come in; but I did not, I locked it and unlocked it to let him in when he came - I stopped down stairs in my pantry, the whole of the time till he came back - I then went to the gate, and saw him coming up Wellington-street - I have known him four years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The footman and you were both away from the kitchen together at first? A. Yes; I came down and found the prisoner in the pantry - I went into the kitchen, and he followed me, and he when I left him the last time he was getting his breakfast - I might be absent one minute, when I went to send the footman down - a person could not open the doors, because the gate was locked, and the key was inside the house - there is a key-hole outside the door, but the key was in the lock, inside - nobody could have put a key into that key-hole.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday, the 23rd of January, in the North and South American Coffee-house, in the City - I searched him, and among his papers was a bill of Mr. De Lolme's; and underneath it there was written, "Left against a cheque of £10."</p>

               <p>MR. DE LOLME. re-examined. This is the bill I gave him, and this is the cheque the prisoner gave me - I sent my man to Green wood's with it - he brought it back to me- I got no money for it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your department in the house? A. I am in the half-pay department - we have some banking accounts with officers who have sold out, and perhaps have left a balance in account - there are nine clerks in the office I am in - I do not know every body who has authority to draw on the house; but I went round to every clerk who keeps an account in the house, and asked them, and they said "No" - I say we have no such account in our room - I made no mark on the paper presented to me; but it was in the same words as this - I swear it is the same paper.(Cheque read.)</p>

             - I served the prisoner - when they came to our shop on the 8th of February, they were, I should think, about twenty minutes in the shop - Norhtwood asked for dark silks, and looked at them - I wished her to give me an idea of the colour, but she could not - I called the lad to reach some for me, which I showed to her - the silks were placed before Northwood, and clark stood by her side - Clark went away first - Northwood was then engaging me in conversation about the prices of silk handkerchefs, and then about coaks - they were in conversation while I was serving them - Northwood stayed a few minutes after Clark - before Clark left she had three quarters of a yard of blue silk, which she immediately fixed on without asking the price of; but the other silks she was very particular in asking the price of - what she had came to 2s. 1d., which she paid, and put the silk into her small basket - I perceived that Clark had something under her arm, but I was so fearful I might be mistaken, I could not look to ascertain if anything was gone till Northwood had left - I then missed the puce silk, and sent the lad after her.</p>

            , is master of a yawl - this happened on Saturday, the 25th of January, between two and five o'clock - the yawl was fastened to a barge, which was moored to a schooner - the yawl was in the outermost part of the tier - I put my father a-shore; and, when I came back, my cousin said something, and I went to the barge, which was fastened alongside the schooner - and then the mate of the vessel was swearing - I saw the prisoner go to the deceased, and ask him for a pot of hot - the deceased said, he would serve him, and went to pour him some beer out of a cask - he poured him some out, and then fell over it, and spilt it - he was tipsy - while he was pouring it out, the prisoner had left and come back, and asked if he had got it ready - he said he did not know he had ordered anything - the prisoner then said he would have some gin, which he poured out, and the prisoner drank - the deceased asked for the money - the prisoner said he had had nothing, and would not pay him - then the prisoner began to tease the deceased, and knock him on the head, and wanted him to fight - he knocked the deceased's hat off, and pulled his own cap off - the deceased said he would not fight with him, - the prisoner got into the deceased's boat, and got hold of a bottle to take the spirits out which were in it - the deceased took the bottle from him, and told him he had no business to come into his boat, and take his property - then he took the deceased's bell out of the boat, and gave it to another man on the deck; and the man who took it from him, put it into the galley - I saw they had been using him shamefully, and spoke to the watermen about it, and went to fetch my father - when I came back again, the deceased was on the schooner's deck - he got hold of the string which was round a bottle which the deceased had under his arm - he kept turning the bottle out, and pouring the spirits out of it into a glass, which the deceased had in his hand - and the deceased told him he was using him shamefully; the prisoner began to tease him, and took up a tarpawling, and struck him on the face, and knocked him down - the deceased said, "Who is going to take my part?" and the men on the deck laughed at him - the prisoner came to him, and told him he did not mean to hurt him; he only did it as a joke - the deceased got up again, and the prisoner got hold of the bottle again, and got some more spirits out of it - they were scuffling for the bottle, which was thrown down and broken; and the prisoner said he deserved to be kicked for letting all that good spirits be spoiled - the deceased wanted to get into his boat, but the prisoner kept pulling him back from going out of the schooner - the prisoner went away afterwards, to do something on the desk, and the deceased got into his boat - the prisoner followed with a pot in his hand, and told the deceased he would be damned if he should go until he had got his pot filled - the deceased ordered him out of his boat - he went to try to shove it away; and, while he was gone, the prisoner got hold of a bottle, and poured out what was in it - the deceased then pushed the prisoner by the side of the schooner - the prisoner got into a passion - two men got into a boat and said, "Come, do not go quarrelling" - I saw the prisoner was using the deceased as he ought not to do - my father called me away - and, as I went, I saw the deceased fall into the water - I do not know how he came in the water - he was drunk - the prisoner shoved the boat with his foot; and the deceased went to stop it from going, and fell in, and he missed his grasp - he wanted to lay hold of the barge, to stop it, but missed his hold and fell overboard.</p>
               <p>- PATTERSON. I was present at part of the transaction - I saw the deceased go over the boat side - I was down in the cabin, and when I came up there were two men in the boat, the prisoner and another man - the witness was advising the prisoner to go out of the boat, and he was on his hands and knees on the barge - another man took his foot and shoved away the boat, and the deceased tried to get hold of the barge - he overreached himself and fell over.</p>

            . I am a constable of the metropolitan police (G 5) - I received information, and watched Godfrey from Peacock-street, Newington-butts, into the shop of Mr. Child, in Thames-street - he entered the shop, and went to the farther end, and stood behind a recess at the further and of the shop - Mugford put a small bag full of something into Godfrey's basket - Mugford then came to the door, and looked up and down the street - Key then went to Godfrey, and put something out of another bag into his basket - Key then left the shop, and went up Pudding-lane - he returned in about five minutes; then Mugford and Key both went to Godfrey, at the further end of the shop, and remained with him three or four minutes - Godfrey then left the shop, and went up Botolph-lane, into an orange shop - he then left it, and went over London-bridge, into a coffee-shop, near the Borough-market - he came out in a minute, and then went to the Black Horse, High-street, Borough - I passed by the door, and saw him put a bag into his basket - I called my brother officer, and took him into custody - I found in his basket about a gallon of hemp seed - I asked him where he got it from - he said he bought it in Tooley-street that morning - I asked him if he knew anything about any more hemp seed or sacks - he said no, he had seen no more that morning - I asked him what he gave for the hemp seed - he said 2s. - I said I was positive he had never been in Tooley-street that morning - he made no answer - I asked where he lived - he said at Chatham - I said I had watched him from his home that morning - I took him to the station-house; went to his premises, and found two sacks, marked "Child," and a quantity of seeds; this was the lodging I had seen him come from - we had seen the policeman on the beat call him up that morning - he was never in the room with me - when I told him I knew where he lived, he said his wife lived at Chatham, but he lodged in the parlour at No. 20, Peacock-street - that was the room we found the property in - it was nearly six o'clock in the morning that he started from that lodging - he had some oranges at the top of his basket, and nuts at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Q. Did you not meet me at the door of the public-house, as I came with my basket? A. No; I asked whether he had any more seed.</p>
               <p>Godfrey. I told him I had it from Thames-street, instead of Tooley-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did you know Mugford before? A. I never saw him, to my knowledge; I followed Godfrey to the house, sometimes on one side of the way, and sometimes on the other - when I saw him go into Child's house, I stationed myself on the opposite side of the way, looking over a horse's back - the horse was between me and Child, but not the cart - it was about seven o'clock in the morning - it was a very dark wet morning - I saw Godfrey go into a recess at the further end of the shop - it is a long shop, and I saw Mugford put something into his basket - I am positive it was him - I swear he is the man who put the bag into the basket, because he came to the shop-door and looked into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear to the particular acts of any one man? A. By their heights and dress, and everything; I could see their dresses, because there were two candles and a lamp burning in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Had you ever seen Key before? A. Never - he was nearer the door than the recess - I was on the pavement on the other side of the street.</p>

             re-examined. I produce the hemp seed which I took from Godfrey; I cannot identify the other parcels as having been carried by him; he had two baskets on his shoulder, but I saw him take something out of the basket and put it into a bag in the public-house; I looked through the door and saw it; he put them into this bag, I have no doubt - but I lost sight of the bag; it was found on the spot where I saw him shifting them.</p>
               <p>JAMES TILT re-examined. I found no bag in the public-house but this; it was placed on a large gin cask at the bar; I took them from the spot pointed out by a witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Where were you standing at the shop? A. On the opposite side of the way with Baylis - Godfrey did not go into the shop like a customer; he went straight into the recess at once; Mugford first spoke to Godfrey; it was after that that Key put up the seeds.</p>
               <p>MR. CHILD re-examined. Mugford was my head warehouseman, and Key a man under him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there anything irregular in Mugford selling and the other assisting at this time in the morning, if it had been a regular transaction? A. Nothing; he was subject to lose his place if he did not attend to Mugford's directions; he was bound to obey Mugford's orders - the prisoners were both asked before the officers if they had had anybody on the premises, or taken any moeny, or had any customer that morning - they both distinctly said they had not had a soul on the premises, both of them - I deal in split peas - but I can only identify these from the officer seeing them taken off my premises - I am a seedsman - I should say these are very like a sample which I have, but it is impossible to swear to them - we had articles of the same quality and appearance - I have no hesitation in swearing they are my property - they correspond with my articles - I cannot say whether I lost any bag, I have such a quantity - I have hemp seed on my premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Have you any partner? A. No - every seedsman has seeds of this description - Key was a man in my warehouse - we do not consider the porters had authority to sell - the prisoners are in charge of the premises until the man that has more control over the premises comes at eight o'clock - Key might have sold if Mugford had been absent.</p>

Early in December Godfrey met me in the Kent-road, where I was delivering a load of coke - he came up and asked me to buy a sack for 1s. 9d. - I followed them on the morning they were apprehended, and walked with Godfrey, and carried his baskets for him, which were both empty, one being tied round the handle with a red comforter - I went with him to a public-house at Stonesend, where he had something to drink - I came on to London-bridge, and left him there; I turned round, and saw Tilt and Baylis - we then watched them over the water to Child's - the baskets were empty then, and he had no bag - he went into Child's, into a recess - I saw Mugford take something from a bag, and deliver to Godfrey - Mugford came and walked to and fro about the shop - Key then went to Mugford - I cannot recollect what he did - Key then came out and walked up a lane - Mugford was at the same time with Godfrey - when Key returned, he went and fetched a pair of steps, outside, and cleaned the window outside; Mugford doing the same inside - Key went in to Godfrey, and Mugford went to him at the same time - Mugford pulled a bag or something out of his pocket, took something out of it, and gave it to Godfrey - and when he came out, he had a load in the baskets, which were previously empty, and I lost sight of him then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Where do you live? A. In Peacock-street, Newington - I have lived there four months - I have been a green-grocer during that time - before that I was a journeyman coachmaker for nine years - and before that I was a schoolboy - I was apprentice seven years, and two years a journeyman - I am the son of a police-officer - I never assisted my father as a police-officer - I might have gone with him on a warrant - I cannot say I have not - in fact, I recollect going with him; I cannot tell how often - I was never a witness in my life with my father - I was never here in my life, nor in any criminal court - I was a witness once at Worship-street against one Gayton - I had not assisted my father as an officer in that case - I was an apprentice, and the man tempted me to rob my master - I gave information to my father, and he was taken - I did not rob my master - I resisted the temptation, and gave information to my father, and the man was taken and sent to gaol - he was not an intimate friend of mine - I knew nothing of him before.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What became of Gayton? A. He was bound over to keep the peace, and find good bail; and he had nineteen weeks in gaol before he was liberated - since that he has been tried here - I continued in my master's service five years after that, as an apprentice.</p>

            . I am a patrole of Farringdon Within - I was in Wood-street on the 26th of January, and heard a cry of "Stop thief" - I saw the prisoner running down Wood-street, from Cheapside - I was going to stop him, when I saw him take his hat off, and throw the handkerchief away - I am sure of that - I took it up, and he was stopped by an officer in my sight - I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. I was going down Wood-street, from Cheapside, the same way as the prisoner was running - he was five or six yards behind me when I heard the cry - I was not dressed as an officer - I saw nobody else running - there might be a great many people in the stret - I dare say there might be ten persons near - I did not take notice - I saw none of them in the carriage-road - it was rather dark, but a very fine night - the lamps were lighted - I swear I saw him take the handkerchief out of his hat and throw it away - he was stopped in less than two minutes afterwards - I think it was with his left hand that he took his hat off, as he threw the handkerchief as if from the right hand - I do not know whether he saw me, as I was on the opposite side of the way - he did not notice me particularly - I took the handkerchief up in the road, just at the side of the curb - I followed him, and he was taken by another officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the same person you saw in custody was the person that threw away the handkerchief? A. He had exactly the same dress on, and I saw his face sideways as he ran - he had a particular dress on, a blue frockcoat, the same as butchers wear.</p>

            . On the 15th of January, I was working at the house, No. 36, St. John-street - the two Clarkes lived there, and were removing from the premises; and Dorrington was assisting them - I went to work there the next morning, and found three pieces of timber in the backroom, which had not been there the night before - the three prisoners came in about an hour, and carried them away - these are the pieces - they came back again, and abused me - Dorrington said, "You have seen Mr. Butler, and nosed all you know" - James Clarke used the same sort of language, and pulled off his coat to fight me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is it since you was in gaol yourself? It is five years ago - it was for spending half-a-crown of my master's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you a stick? A. Yes; and I used it as well as I could - I knocked a man down two or three times - I did not tell the magistrate I knew the man by a hurt I gave him in the lip in the scuffle- I told him I might do that; by putting the stick in his face I might push the skin off - I did not say that was the sign I knew him by - I gave as a reason, that I pushed the stick in his face - I likewise know him by his face and his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the magistrate that you knew him by his features? A. I told him I knew him perfectly well - I knew him by his dress - I told him that was the coat he had on that very night - he had not a jacket on, but a coat, either blue or dark, and he had a hat - I do not know what handkerchief he had - Mr. Irving has given me one of the pigs as a present - it is worth four guineas - I never had a present of a pig before.</p>

            . I am constable of Ashford - I was called at three or four o'clock that morning - I heard the cry of "Murder" - I ran to the spot - I saw a hat there, and five pigs in the ditch - I did not see the horse and cart there - I drove the pigs to the King's Head, where I found the witness all over blood - the horse and cart were there - I put them into a yard till daylight - there was no name on the cart - I then got in the cart and let the horse go where he liked - he came on from there to Hammersmith, stopped at the toll-bar till the man opened the gate, and then he went on again to a house in Fulham-fields, where he stopped - I did not go in, but I described that house to Trumper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go with Trumper? A. No; I might have gone in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What description did you give of the house? A. I said it was in Fulham-fields, and was rather by itself - it seemed to me to be a square house let in different tenements - it appeared to comprise four separate houses - there were several doors to it - I went round two sides of it - there were other houses within about fifty yards of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Which side of the way were the cot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200064"/>tages? A. On the left - the yard was in front, and the horse wanted to go in there - we had come about fourteen miles.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is the prisoner? A. A carpenter - he never had a horse and cart to my knowledge, nor my husband either - I take in washing, the same as the prisoner's wife - I go to his house perhaps three or four times in a week to play at cards - I did not go to tea - I went about ten o'clock - I supped with him and his wife - we had some cold beef and some porter - we played at cards after supper - Joseph Cleaver, who is here, came to my house, he went to the prisoner's with me, and we all played at cards - I am sure it was on the night of the 16th I went, and on the morning of the 17th I came away - I heard no more till yesterday, when the prisoner's wife asked me to come here - there are four houses and a cottage close together - I have one of them, and pay rent and taxes - there are two yards there which a horse and cart could go down.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are there yards belonging to other houses? A. Yes, there are some cottages about fifty yards off - I never saw the prisoner with a horse and cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the cart without a name on it? A. No, Sir - I had been washing about two hours that day - I left off about four o'clock in the afternoon - we played at All-fours - I did not win any money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was your fall in Cheapside in consequence of your having spent the evening out, or some sudden illness? A. I am subject to giddiness - I think it happened from giddiness - I had not power to save myself - I had been drinking a glass of wine, and some spirits and water - I really believe I was not the worse for liquor - I had been spending the evening in Fleet-street with some friends - I joined them about nine o'clock- I did not feel the worse for liquor - my money was safe just before I joined my friends - I was picked up near the west end of Cheapside, about a stone's throw from St. Paul's Church-yard - I fell about the second turning on the left hand side, in Cheapside, in going from St. Paul's - I do not know the name of the street - I have lived in London ten or eleven years - I know my money was safe when I left my friends, as I knew no one had taken it - I put the sovereign and twenty shillings in the paper just before I met my friends - I counted it, and put it into my left waistcoat pocket - I had accompanied a friend part of the way from Fleet-street; and it was my intention to go over Southwark-bridge to Charlotte-street - I left my friend at the turning leading to the Post-office - that was the place as near as I can recollect - but we do not attach any importance to common-place affairs - my nearest way home would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200068"/>have been over Blackfriars'-bridge; but I frequently go the other way, and when you are very late, it makes no difference - I do not recollect falling down after I parted with my friend, till the time I was picked up by the watchman.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What was your object in crossing, and going along on the left hand side of Cheapside, if you were going over the iron bridge? A. I had parted with my friend on that side, and kept on there - I did not speak to any one.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where had you spent the evening? A. At the Boar's Head, in Fleet-street, on the left hand side as you go up - I crossed the street near St. Bride's avenue - it was about there; I really cannot recollect exactly - I think I crossed near the end of Fleet-street - I was not drunk; to the best of my belief, I had all my senses about me - I might be a little the worse for liquor, very likely I was - my memory was not affected - I have told you as near as I can where I parted with my friend - I am a printer.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Who took your money from you? A. I do not know - I did not object to its being taken - there were three or four persons in the watch-house - it was by a person representing himself as an officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You stated you were no worse for liquor; and now you state, "Very likely I was:" how do you reconcile that? A. I was not drunk - my friend and I came away together - there were five or six other persons at the public-house, but they dispersed - I parted with my friend at the end, near the Post-office, to the best of my belief.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Farringdon Within - I saw the prosecutor brought into the watch-house, when he had been picked up at the corner of Gutter-lane, by a man, named Shield - he was a little in liquor, but he knew what he was about - the prisoner was the night-constable - I went up-stairs to my mother to fetch a wash-hand-basin, as the prosecutor's hands and face were covered with blood - I washed his face and hands, and Laws, who was there, asked him where he lived, but he could not give him any answer - Laws then put his hand into his pocket, to see if he had any direction there; and he took out a paper with two half-crowns in it - Mr. Smith said, "You have got 5s. of mine, where is it?" - Laws said,"On the table" - the prisoner then began to search the prosecutor, and from his left hand waistcoat pocket he took his watch, and broke the guard, which was round his neck- when he had taken that watch, he gave it to a friend he had in the room with him - Laws then said to the prisoner, "If you are not capable of taking care of it, I will"- the prisoner then put his hand into the prosecutor's left-hand trowsers pocket three different times, and put his hand into his own pocket; and the third time he did so, I called to Mr. Laws, and the prisoner seemed confused, and dropped one shilling from his hand - Laws said, "Hutchinson, pull the property you got from the gentleman out of your pocket;" and he then threw 7s., or more, out of his pocket on the table - Laws said, "That is not all, Hutchinson;" and he threw out 11s. more; and he said, "I changed a sovereign over at Mr. Colburn's;" and he then pulled out some other silver out of his right-hand trowsers pocket, which was not the pocket he had put his hand into before - the prisoner then said to me, "You have no business in this room, Mr. Charley;" and he knocked me down, and tried to lift me out of the room, but he could not - he then took hold of my collar - Laws then said, "I will not have this, Hutchinson;" and the prisoner then took Laws by the collar, and Laws sent the prisoner to the Compter by the inspector - I went with him, and he sat down and put his hand into his pocket, and some silver was taken from under him by the inspector - the prisoner tried to put three half-crowns and two shillings on the bed- he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think your name is Charles? A. Yes, and my wife's name is Ann - I have a little boy named Springhall, and his Christian name is John - I am a porter by business, and live in Green Dragon-court - my wife's name is Springhall - my father married two wives, and I did not know my name was Springhall for eighteen years - I always went by the name of Jones - I have been a watchman five years - my beat is in Alderman Kelly's ward - I was married in the name of Springhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever here before? A. Only as a witness, never for anything else - I will swear that - I was tried here for perjury, but I was quite a youth at the time - I did not know what things were.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you mean by saying you were never here but as a witness? A. I came here as a witness, but they cross-questioned me so, that they made me say first one thing and then another, that is seven or eight years ago - I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you in prison? A. Seven weeks - I never was in prison before nor since - I was at that time committed by the order of the court - I was never charged with stealing a box or anything else - I did not put my hand into the prosecutor's pocket - I never said I did.</p>

            . I am inspector of the nightly watch, of Farringdon Within - I was on duty when the prosecutor was brought in - he was very tipsy - I think he was beyond knowing what was going on - he was searched by the prisoner, (who was the night officer,) and myself - the prisoner took a purse, containing £3 odd in silver and gold, from his trousers pocket, and he took his watch from his fob, to the best of my knowledge, and he broke the guard - he was going to hand the watch to a friend he had in the watch-house - I objected to it, and said if he was not capable of taking care of it I would - I insisted upon having it laid on the table, that every one might see it - the prisoner was not sober - I then took a paper, containing two half-crowns, from the prosecutor's pocket, and laid it on the table - Jones then said that the prisoner had taken something from the prosecutor's pocket, three times, and I accused the prisoner of it - he said he had taken it, but it was his intention to put it down - he then put down 9s. 6d. - I told him that was not all, as I felt some more outside his pocket - he then took out 11s. 6d. more - he then told Jones he had no business there, and he knocked Jones down twice - I assisted in getting Jones up, and the prisoner took me by the collar - I then ordered my brother inspector to take him to the Compter.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200069"/>Cross-examined. Q. What did you send him to the Compter for? A. For robbing the prosecutor - I never divided any money which had been taken from a prisoner - I never received any money from Mr. Colburn's, the profits of bringing a man to the watch-house - I got 6s. about a month ago, but it was made me a present of - a young man was walking in St. Paul's Church-yard with a woman - he took an umbrella from her, and was given in charge for it, and brought to the watch-house - the prisoner was the night-officer, and I am the inspector - it was the night-officer's duty to discharge him, but I had nothing to do with it - I left the room - I waited outside in the passage - the young man said to me, "I have no money," and he went to Newgate-street and got a sovereign - I was in the public-house, having a glass of ale - the young man came in, got change for the sovereign, and laid 6s. down on the bar - it was for drink, but whether he said it was for the men to drink, I cannot tell - I took it up from the bar - we had 2s. worth of brandy and water - the prisoner Hutchinson had some of it - I gave the watchman 2s. and I had 2s. myself - it never occurred to me that this was compounding a felony - I have been an officer four years - I have been asked to drink, and now and then a shilling has been given to me - I never took money from a stranger, but I knew that young man, he was a respectable person - I do not know his name, but he lived at Mr. Moules's, a cheesemonger - I never took money from a prisoner to let him go- I do not recollect that the prosecutor said anything to me when I took the 5s. from him, nor in my hearing - I gave my evidence before the magistrate in this case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the prisoner to the Compter for felony, or for knocking down Jones? A. I sent him there for the assault - I do not recollect which I sent him for - I believe it was for felony; to the best of my belief it was- I gave the order to John Smith - I did say before, that I sent him for the assault; but you confused me at the time- I believe the prosecutor did not swear that I was the person who took the purse from him; but I will not be on my oath he did not - I took the two half-crowns, as I saw the paper in his pocket; and I thought his name might be on it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How many times did the prisoner give you money? A. Twice; and he then knocked down Jones - I did not give him in charge till after he knocked him down.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the reason, when you had seen a felony, you did not give him into custody till after he had knocked down Jones, and that then you sent him for the assault? A. I will not be on oath whether I sent him for the felony or the assault - I went to our gentlemen the next day, and they advised me to go and see the prosecutor, which I did; and I told him he had been robbed.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it your duty as an inspector of the watch to see that the watchmen do their duty, and that the prisoners do not escape? A. Yes, certainly - I have been outside while Laws was examined, I did not hear a word of the examination - the prosecutor was brought to the watch-house and he was drunk - he could speak - Laws asked him his name - he said he would not give his name - he did not remain silent, and would not speak while I was there - Hutchinson was the first who began to search the prosecutor to my knowledge: he shoved the money and the watch he found on him to a friend of his who sat there to take care of it - there were two half-crowns in a paper, which I believe Laws took - Laws said, perhaps the paper would tell where the gentleman lived - that was before it was put on the table - Laws said to Hutchinson, "If you cannot take care of it, I will" - Hutchinson was drunk, but not insensible - I saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket - I did not see him take anything out, nor put anything into his own pocket, but I was not looking - Laws had before said that no stranger ought to interfere - Laws then told the prisoner to produce the money - he pulled out 9s. 6d., and said he had got no more; but he afterwards produced 11s 6d. more from one of his pockets, and said he had changed a sovereign at Mr. Colburn's, and he had 18s. 9d. - when I got him to the Compter I found 2s. 6d. and 11/2d. in the seat, and three half-crowns and 2s. on his person - I remember a man being brought to the watch-house charged with stealing an umbrella from a woman - I was there with the prisoner, and the watchman who brought the man in - I do not know whether any one else was there - the woman charged him with stealing the umbrella - I was there before the man went away - I cannot say that he was present when the woman gave the charge - the man was let go - Laws afterwards went to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200070"/>Colburn's - he did not tell me he had got any money there - I did not see any money there; but Laws told me the prisoner who was discharged for stealing the umbrella had left some money, and there was something to drink - I had some brandy and water, and there were other persons drank of it; I cannot say how many - Laws took me over, and told me the gentleman had left some money for brandy and water - he told me he had given the watchman 2s. - Hutchinson was not at the public-house with me - Laws told me he had kept the other 2s. himself.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Were you present when the young man was discharged? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I observed you looked at the paper in the case first? A. Yes; it is not the same paper as was in it - I looked inside it to see if it was the paper - I can read figures - I did not look at the figures, I looked to see if it was the same shape as my own - I never saw another watch so near like it - I did not know the figures inside before - they are 3710 - nobody told me the number of the watch - I do not know it by the figures.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor said I was discharged the day he lost his watch - I was not discharged for nearly two months afterwards - master is unwell at present, but he could prove whether I was or not - I lost my situation in consequence of being brought to justice by him at Hatton-garden, by his swearing I stole a pair of boots, which I was innocent of, and the magistrate discharged it; and I would not stop with master, thinking it would be rather a stain on my character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you certain the prisoner pawned it? A. Yes - I did not know him before - it was about five o'clock in the evening - I do not recollect whether other persons were in the shop; if there had been, I should have recollected - I cannot say positively there were not - we have an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the person pawning it go outside to inquire, apparently, of a person who had sent him, to know if he was to take what you offered him? A. I think he did - I think he said he would ask the owner if he would take so little.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. How long did you have it repaired before you gave it up to the policeman? A. It came home on the Saturday night; and on Monday, about two o'clock, I took it to the station-house, and gave it to the superintendent - when it was left with me, I found it would not play, and tried to pawn it to get my money back, and could not, and thought by having it repaired I should be able to get my money back - it has cost me 22s.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you a watch? A. Yes; I had left it at home - I did not intend to get drunk when I went out - I had been drinking at a wine-vaults the other side of Seven Dials - I went there with a friend named Gower, and parted with him in Smithfield - I suppose I left the wine-vaults about twelve o'clock - I went there between ten and eleven - I swear it was after ten - we had three or four glasses of brandy and water, two pints of ale, and some supper; nothing more - I did not pay for it - my friend paid 3s. 6d. for his share and mine - there was three of us in company - I cannot swear whether we had three or four glasses of brandy and water - it was drank among three, and three pints of ale; nothing else - we had been nowhere else before we went there - I had been to Shoreditch, to Grower's house - he is a weight and scale maker - I drank nothing except three or four glasses of brandy and water, and three pints of ale - not at that house, I do not know about that night - I might have had a pint of ale in the course of the evening, but not before I got there - we had had one pint of ale between me and Grower.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say just now that before you got there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200073"/>you had not? A. Perhaps I might; but I did not exactly call to my recollection at the moment, that we had a pint of ale at the Pitt's Head, going along the road - I was not five minutes in the Pitt's Head - I had been to no other public-house before we went to the wine-vaults - that is nearly two miles from the Pitt's Head - I did not set out intending to go to the wine-vaults - my friend asked me to walk with him to the other side of St. Giles's church.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you will recollect whether you had been talking to a woman - do you recollect the lady you had been talking to?</p>
               <p>A. No; I was talking to a woman of the town in Long-lane - that might be a mile and a half from the wine-vaults - she was standing, and I went and spoke to her - I was not quite sober - I drank nothing more than I have said - what I drank bewildered me - I might have talked to more than one woman, for what I know - as I go along I am free for everybody - I do not think anything of it.</p>

             (policeman). On the morning of Saturday, the 1st of February, about a quarter past six o'clock, I was on duty in the City-road - I walked past this building, and saw the male prisoner come out with a piece of wood from the building - he took it across the road, and threw it down by the curb - the female prisoner was standing there, behind a truck which a boy was holding - she took it up and put it into the truck, and he went back and fetched the second piece - I met him coming with the second piece - I said, "Oh" - he took no notice, and went over and threw that down, came back and fetched a third piece - the woman laid the second piece on the truck, and Brannan put the third piece on the turck himself - he laid hold of the truck, and assisted the boy to drag it to Old-street - I went back to the hoard, and found the door shut, which Brannan had left open - I followed the truck up a street, and met Brannan coming back - I went after the truck and found the woman behind it, and the boy holding the handle - I stopped the woman, and said, "Where are you going with the wood?" - she said, "To No. 20, George-yard, Golden-lane" - I asked who the truck belonged to - she said it was her own - I followed it into Old-street - I there saw two brother officers - I went and told them to take charge of her - I went back to the building, and found the door shut, as if nobody had been there at all - I went back - one of my brother officers took the woman to the station-house, and I took the wood - I returned to the building - my brother officer waited at the building, while I went to the prisoner's house - while I was gone my brother officer took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PAYNE. Q. The woman told you she was going to take it to No. 20, George-yard - did you go and see if that was her residence? A. Yes; and found she lived there - I saw the wood brought out and put on the truck - it was rather dark - the woman could not see me on the other side of the road - I cannot say she did not see me - there were gas-lamps there - she was busy loading the wood - she told me at once where she was going.</p>

               <p>W. PARNELL re-examined. I have seen the wood, it is my master's property, and worth about 30s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it? A. One part of it remained in the party-wall, and it fitted it - Brannan had no business there so early - he used to come rather early - there was no workman there then.</p>
               <p>Brannan's Defence. When we began pulling down the building, there was a deal of old laths and old wood, and it was given us as perquisites, or to buy some beer with - I will tell the truth - we got this on purpose to sell the laths and a few chips of wood - this woman came to me two or three times - I saw some of the laths and chips; on this morning - I could bring witnesses that I was in bed at the time this occurred - I am a man in a poor way of business, and have a motherless family, in the greatest want of me to provide for them.</p>
               <p>Welch's Defence. I am a poor woman - I have got my living by this work these five years - having a helpless sick husband who I buried - he had but 6d. pension - I sold wood and bought it - I was coming from the New North-road, and met Brannan not knowing him - I asked him if there was any old wood to be sold at the building - he said,"Yes" - I asked him who had the selling of it - he said he had - I asked him what time I might call for a few shillings worth - he said, "On Saturday morning, at half-past six o'clock," and I was there at that time - I get my living by it - the man was in the building when I came to him - I gave him the money he demanded of me.</p>

On Saturday, the 4th of January, I missed this skittle-ball, at half-past four o'clock, on my return home - I had seen it safe at nine o'clock that morning - in consequence of information, I went to the station-house, and from thence in company with a policeman to the prisoner's lodgings - I did not see him - I saw some children - I received the skittle-ball that evening from the prisoner's father, after I had been to his lodging and could not find it.</p>

            . I am a silver refiner, in the employ of Mr. Smart, No. 60, Princes-street, Leicester-square - on the 8th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and offered a silver spoon for sale - my employer saw a crest partly rubbed out, and I saw it also - he was asked how the crest came to be rubbed out- he said he did not know there was one - Mr. Smart asked where he got it - he said he bought it of a Jew in Piccadilly - he was asked his name and address - he gave John Harding, No. 19, Berwick-street - we told him we should keep the spoon and make inquiry - I marked the spoon, and afterwards gave it to Stone, the constable, and gave him the name and address the prisoner gave us - on the 18th the prisoner called again - we told him he had given us a wrong name and address, and asked his reason - he said he was so flurried at the time he did not know what he said - I then asked him what his right name was, and where he lived - he said John Foster, No. 19, Edden-street, Regent-street - I asked his landlord's name - he told me, and I knew that was correct - I gave that information to Stone - and at Marlborough-street I saw one of the Duke's spoons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not he merely ask you the value of the spoon? A. No, he did not, I am positive - he came twice afterwards, and demanded the money - I have seen the crest - it is out of an Earl's coronet.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. He told you he was an ornamental painter? A. He did - I am a servant to the London Dock Company - I think it was about four o'clock I was disturbed - the clock struck after I got out of bed - I was in great confusion - my wife went up, and peeped through the key-hole into his bed-room, and saw him get into bed, going from the drawers - she was all in a tremble when she came down-stairs - my wife went up stairs after he was gone, to look into her drawers - she never said it was all right - the public-house I saw him at afterwards was near Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when she came down from looking at the drawer? A. She said she could not tell what was lost till she looked - but we went to bed after that, and I went to work when I got up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she give you to understand he had robbed her drawer? A. She said she had seen him at the drawer, and he jumped into bed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was not there in the day-time? A. No; he only came in once, to speak to my husband - I had seen the lace-net on the Sunday - on Wednesday he came, and on Wednesday-week I caught him at the drawer - I saw it on the Sunday before he came - my husband went down and put his clothes on - I looked to see what was gone, but was so confused - I had put the net at the top of the drawer - the prisoner said when I went up,"You had better look and see whether I have been stealing anything;" and I looked, but could not see then - I just opened the drawer and shut it again - I did not say it was all right - I missed it the very same day that he went - I never said it was a week before I missed it - I never mentioned a week - I have a top room furnished, which I let to a man and his wife - they were in the house, but I always kept the room the prisoner slept in locked - I always locked the door when he went out in the morning, and unlocked it ready for him at night - he never went out till eight o'clock - I was always up before him - I have not seen my black net since - there was a quantity of veils, clothes, and other things in the drawers - the net cost me 30s. - the veils did not lay in the same place - he never called afterwards to pay the shilling - he called on he Saturday following with a man, as my lodger infomed me, but I was not at home, and he knew that - but he did not come into the house.</p>

            . I am a policeman - on Thursday, the 26th of December, I received the prisoner in custody from two Thames police-officers - I went to his lodgings, and received from Mrs. Wilson two skeleton keys and other implements - I apprehended him in Backchurch-lane.</p>

I am an inspector of police - I was on duty at the station-house - Heffer and a boy were brought in custody with the cart and whalebone - I asked Heffer where he got the whalebone - he said from Millwall, that two men employed him, but who they were he did not know - I asked if they had employed him before - he said, "Yes; on several occasions before that" - he was to go to Aldgate church, and from there to Hounsditch - that he did not know the person's name, but he could point out the house - I had the cart unloaded, and told him to drive me to the house - in going by M'Kenzie's house in Hounsditch, he said that it was there he had taken bone to before - M'Kenzie acknowledged, in his presence, that he had seen him before - a dispute arose as to the number of times Heffer had been there - he said it was three or four times - I asked M'Kenzie if he expected bone that night - he said, No: but a Mr. Green had called, and asked if he had some, who said he lived at No. 4, Park-street, Limehouse - I said I thought it was stolen - he said, "To show you I gave a fair price for it, I will show you two receipts;" which he did, and said they were the receipts he had had from Green - I took Heffer back to the station-house - the next day I saw the pit in the prisoner's yard, and took up some of the fibres, which I have here now - there was a considerable quantity more - I have only brought a part of it - I know nothing of Lacabenne - I cannot say whether he ever went by the name of Green.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Heffer took you to a shop where he had been before? A. Yes; the person is an extensive dealer in whalebone.</p>

            . I am a policeman - on the 2d of February I went to a house in Collingwood-street, Dog-row, in consequence of information from my brother, in serch of Lacabenne - I found him there - my brother knocked at the door, and Lacebenne's brother-in-law opened the door - I walked in - the prisoner's wife came to the door - I said,"Well, Mrs. Lacabenne, I want Jem" - he was within hearing - I saw him sitting in the front room, with his jacket and waistcoat off - I said I had come to take him - he said,"Very well, wait till I put my clothes on; I will go with you" - in going down Mile-end-road there was a bill in a public-house window - he said, "Is not that a bill offering a reward for me?" - I made him no answer - I had not told him what I took him for - when we got near the station-house, he said, "I know very well they cannot hurt me; I was not the party that stole the whalebone; Bill Barkworth was my master, and he employed me" - this was on the 2nd of February.</p>

            . I sometimes go by the name of Max, as my mother has married a person of that name - I was employed by Barkworth to look after a little horse and cart of his - he used to go to sales with his uncle - I used to go with him, to mind the cart - I was at Millwall on the night of the 6th of January - I was in at my tea at Barkworth's while the cart was loaded - that was next door to Lacabenne's - I do not know that Lacabenne is Barkworth's servant - Barkworth was out of the house - I do not know whether Heffer or Lacabenne were there - I was going to Limehouse where I live; and, as I knew the carman (Heffer), I asked him to give me a ride - Heffer did not tell me what was in the cart, nor where he was going - when we got over the bridge, the policeman came up and said, "You are my prisoners" - he got up into the cart, and sat between us both, putting his arm round us both - he asked Heffer where he was going - he said to Aldgate church; and I said I was going to Limehouse - the policeman asked Heffer what was in the cart - he said he did not know - he asked who laid the whalebone in the cart - he said he did not know - the policeman would not let me get out at Limehouse church - he took it to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sitting down at tea: who gave you your tea? A. Mrs. Barkworht; and just as I was done tea, Barkworth came in, in a perspiration - I never saw him in a perspriation before - when I came out at the door, Lacabenne was in his shirt-sleeves, as if he had been washing himself - they left Heffer to go to town with the cart, and I was to go home - they did not come with me - I did not hear them give Heffer any directions where to go to - I knew Barkworth and Lacabenne by sight - they lived in two huts, one next door to the other - I never saw the trench in Lacabenne's garden - he is a journeyman baker, I understand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As you passed by, did not you tell Lacabenne you were going to have a ride to town? A. No; Lacabenne said, "You can go up in the cart, as it is going to town" - I live in Gun-lane, Limehouse - the whale<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200081"/>bone was open in the cart for what I could see of it - I could see it very well.</p>

I am an errand-boy - I have known the prisoner since the 2d of September last - I live at No. 60, Batterson-street, Hoxton - my father and he, I believe, had some transactions together some years ago - this bill is my handwriting - I received at the hotel 1l. 11s. 6d., and gave it to the prisoner - the preceding night, he made up a parcel for me to take to the hotel - I took it on the Monday night, and was to wait to get paid for it - I took it, and Mr. Phillips said, Mr. Williams not being there, he could not undertake to pay the bill - the prisoner had made out the bill - I knew his name was Charteris - I knew he went by the name of Williams then - the prisoner had made up the parcel, and I took it - I brought it back to the prisoner after going the first time, and he said, "You had better take it back, and say that you got great anger from Mr. Stanley, your master, for not leaving it:" and I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you knew that it was false, and that you were not Mr. Stanley's servant? A. Yes - there was some soiled linen in the parcel, I believe - I directed the parcel - the prisoner copied a direction for me on a piece of paper - I knew it was all false - I had a suspicion of that - I went to the hotel, left the parcel, and said I would call on Tuesday morning for the payment, which I did - the landlady was not up - the young woman brought down 1l. 11s. 6d., which she paid me - the landlord's daughter handed me a pen, to receipt the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been leaving parcels at hotels, and waiting to get the money? A. I never did anything of the sort until the 8th of December, when I went to the prisoner - it went on till I was taken up - I did not know it was right - I cannot say I knew it was wrong.</p>

            . I am a porter - on passing through Duke-street, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner step to Williams's door, and take the merino from a pile - some of the pieces fell on the pavement - I said to him, "Great is the fall," being in the habit of joking with the prosecutor's men - he made no reply; but picked them up, put them under his arm, and went off- I am quite sure he is the person - the goods were standing in the shop - I followed the prisoner, and stopped him in Seymour-mews - the policeman took him in charge - he said, "Let me go, if you please."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your business? A. I am porter to Mr. Hawkins, of Edward-street - the prisoner was the man I apprehended - I did not find any merino about him - I cannot say how far I took him from the shop - I do not remember two gentlemen attending before the magistrate, and saying he was not the man, but a taller man- I will not swear it did not pass - I am sure he is the man who knocked down the things - I have not said I could not swear to him - I never lost sight of him - I was on the same side of the way - I never said I was on the other, to my knowledge - it was a rainy evening - I have been to the prisoner's mother since he has been in gaol.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far were you from the prisoner? A. When he took the things from the shop, I was as close to him as I am to those goods, and saw him take them from the pile.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you went to the prisoner's mother, did you not say, "Say nothing to the policeman, and I will do it?" A. Not to my knowledge - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200083"/>know a person named Storr - I did not tell Storr that the prisoner was not the man, and I could not swear to him, as it was a very dark night - I never said it, to my knowledge - I do not recollect that I did.</p>

Eveson, the officer, gave me some information, and I saw some lead at Guildhall - I saw the two men in custody - I said to Graly,"How came you to take that lead; what did you do there, it was out of your way?" - he said, "I knew the woman that kept the house, and I went to rest there, as it was a heavy load" - I know Fleet-lane - it is out of the way in going from our premises to London-bridge - I cannot swear to the lead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What quantity of lead was there wanting for the job they had to do? A. I cannot tell - I could, if I had measured the space they had to cover - I am sure it did not require all this lead - I can tell by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200088"/>looking at the place - I cannot tell how much it would require.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Nunnery is the foreman plumber? A. Yes, it is his business to superintend the lead work on the premises I was working on, at the London-bridge end of Cannon-street - this was the completion of a lead flat - I had been there, but I cannot tell how lately before this happened - it was left to Nunnery to judge what lead was wanted - I cannot say whether this was cut from larger sheets on my premises, but they were seen to take them from my premises - I saw the place that remained to be covered since this happened - I cannot tell when I had seen it before - the lead the prisoner had is about 11/2 cwt., not more, I dare say - my premises are more than a mile from the place they were at work at - what they appeared to me to want was not so much as this - they should have carried the lead jointly - Nunnery has been in my service nine or ten years.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You had not been at the building at any time which you can recollect before, but when the prisoners were apprehended you went? A. Yes - I can judge by looking at a flat what is wanted to cover it - I judge this lead is more than was wanted there - neither of these men had any authority to carry it to Fleet-lane.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's - on the 4th of January I was on duty in Fleet-lane, about seven o'clock in the morning - I was about thirty yards from the prisoner Bellamy's house - but I had before that seen the two male prisoners in the Old Bailey - Graly was carrying a roll of lead, and Nunnery was by his side - they separated, and Nunnery went down Fleet-lane, and Graly went down New-court, and came into Fleet-lane - he there passed Nunnery, and went into Bellamy's, which is one door from New-court - I went to the door, and sent to the watch-house for assistance, and Carlon came to me - Nunnery had been standing at the end of New-court, but he was then gone - I then went into Bellamy's house, and saw Graly sitting on a chair by the side of the fire-place; and Bellamy and another female were in the shop - it is a dealer's in marine stores - there is a counter, and Graly was on the right hand side of it - and the two females were on the other side - this roll of lead was on the ground, by the side of Graly - Bellamy said, "What is the matter?" I said I suspected that lead was not right - she turned to Graly and said, "How can you come here, when I have so often told you not?" Carlon then came in, and I told Graly to go with him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Carlon take Bellamy? A. No, another officer took her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How near were you to Graly when he went into the house? - A. About thirty yards - it was at seven o'clock in the morning - it was not light - I had never seen Nunnery before - I saw their backs and their faces, for they passed me - it was not pitch dark - it was day-break - Nunnery was within one door of Bellamy's shop when Graly went in - I did not take him, because he was not carrying anything - I afterwards took Nunnery in West-street, Somers-town - I believe it was his own house - I saw a young woman there - he was at breakfast - I said, "I want you;" and I gave him to a police-officer - I said nothing more to him there, I am sure - there was no woman taking breakfast with him when I went in; but Carlon went in first - I did not ask him if his name was Nunnery; nor did Carlon, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know he was the man? A. By seeing him, and Mr. Webb saying he was the man - I believe I did say, "I believe you are the man I want;" but it was not in the room: it was in the street - I might have said it in the room; but I do not recollect - I do not recollect that I said, "You must come along with me" - Carlon said that - I do not recollect his saying he was very willing - I did not hear him say he would go anywhere - I recollect he asked what was the matter - he came willingly with us - he did not say he was taken ill on his way from his master's to the building, and was obliged to go home; but the men at the building said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to his house in consequence of what the men at the building said? Q. Yes; they told us we should find him there.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. At what time did you find him? A. At half-past ten o'clock - I had previously been to the buildings for him.</p>

               <p>Graly's Defence. I was employed by Nunnery - he told me he wanted a quantity of lead to go to London-bridge - I found him at the shop cutting the lead - I carried it to Smithfield-bars, and then told him I was getting tired - he said I had further to go - he then said he wanted to call by the Old Bailey, and told me to go to No. 21, Fleet-lane, and he would come to me presently - I went to the house, set down my lead, and the officer came in and took me - I told him who I worked for, and to go to my master; Nunnery was at the top of the lane, and saw me taken - whether he had any object in view I do not know.</p>

            . I am clerk in the teller's office in the Bank of England - on the 27th of January, about half-past 9 o'clock, ten £10 notes were brought in - the numbers of them are not entered in this book, which I keep - I only enter the amount and the person's name, and write on one of the notes - they were paid to the name of Jones, and the note marked is No. 19,547 - it was not the prisoner who brought them - about one o'clock the same day, a man named Warner brought several £5 notes, one of which I marked, it is No. 39,281 - he asked for sovereigns for them, and I paid him eighty sovereigns.</p>

I am a porter, and stand at the Saracen's-head, Aldgate - on Monday, the 27th of January, I was there, and the prisoner came up to me; he asked if there was a ticket-porter there - I said there was not, but asked if it was anything I could do - he said he had some notes he wanted changed at the Bank for gold- I told him, if he mistrusted me, he might inquire my character anywhere, as I had been on the ground sixteen years - he said, "Well, come with me, I am going to the East India Arms Chop-house, in Fenchurch-street, to have a mutton-chop" - I went with him, he asked the waiter if he knew anything of me - the waiter said he did not - the prisoner said he had some notes he wanted changed for gold - the waiter said he dare say it was all right, and the prisoner counted sixteen £5 notes, in his presence, but I cannot tell the numbers - I am no scholar - I took the sixteen notes, and got eighty sovereigns for them at the Bank - he gave me this bit of paper with an address on it, which I was to put upon the notes - it is,"Mr. W. Thompson, Ospringe, Kent" - I went to the Bank, and as I could not write, I asked a gentleman there to put my name on one of them, which he did, - I delivered them to the clerk, he gave them back to me, and Mr. Beetson gave me the money - I was going back, and when I got to the East India House, I asked one of the porters what the address on the note the prisoner gave me was; a man tapped me on the shoulder, and he went with me to the East India Chophouse - I do not know who he was - when I got there, the prisoner was not there; and the man who went with me said, "Sit down, he will be here in a minute" - the prisoner came in about two minutes - I gave him the money, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200090"/>counted it, said it was all right, and gave me half-a-crown- I am quite sure it was the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he summoned you? A. No: he had been taken up two days before I had the summons - the hearing on the summons was on the Thursday in the same week - I knew nothing of the summons when I took him up - he summoned me for his wages - I have not paid the wages - he summoned me for 14s. 3d. - I owe him that, but I consider he has robbed me quite enough - I did not make that a debt - if he was sent with any hay, and the people paid him, he should pay me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Do two or three nutmegs form a sample and no more? A. They would form a sample for a man in this line; but a merchant might take a sample of a pound weight, not more - he would not weigh them - he would be helped to them, and not take them himself - they would not be weighed, and might be more or less than a pound - William had served him with the ginger that he bought.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned a bag; was your bag lying on the counter? A. The linen bag the nutmegs were taken from was ours; but he put them into a blue bag, which was his own - he brought it into the warehouse; I saw it in his hand after he came in - he placed the bag down by the side of our goods - when he asked for William, he had the bag in his hand - it was hid when he put the nutmegs into it - he did not conceal it before - he placed it on a bag by the side of a box near the door - it was impossible for anybody, if they had not been very sharp, to have seen him do it - if the door had been open, it would have hid the bag, but the door was shut, I could see the bag.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do merchants take samples when nobody is present? A. They do not help themselves - he had said nothing about nutmegs that morning - I think he had forty-seven nutmegs in his pocket.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors - on the previous evening I had directed the last witness to have his eye on the prisoner; and on the morning in question he came to me - I went to the warehouse and said to the prisoner, "You have been taking some nutmegs" - he denied it - I cannot recollect his exact words - I think it was, "I have done no such thing" - I then felt his blue bag which he had in his hand, and found there were nutmegs in it- I said, "That is sufficient for me," and went out for an officer, leaving Brooke with him - the officer came - he was taken into the counting-house and searched - ninety-eight nutmegs were found in the blue bag, weighing more than a pound, and forty-seven in his pockets, weighing about half a pound - I had given him leave to take no nutmegs - he had not dealt with us for nutmegs - he is what we call a jobber about town, selling spices in small quantities.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long has he dealt with you? A. About two months - he has not bought large quantities of spice at our house - he may have bought of other houses - the nutmegs found in his pocket were a different sort to those in the bag - the precise words he used were, "I have taken no nutmegs" - I will not swear I did not say, "You have been stealing some nutmegs" - when the officer came I had taken the bag from him, and put it into the counting-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suppose you had said, "You have been stealing nutmegs;" did he make for answer, "No, I have not: I have taken a few for a sample?" A. No; he said nothing about a sample till it was discovered he had them in his pocket.</p>

             re-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Do you know of any transactions about the arrow-root? A. Yes; he had bought, I believe, two or three qualities of arrow-root, and desired our warehouseman to mix them together, as he had sold them at one price - he sold them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200092"/>to a customer of his, and I suppose had them returned on his hands - he brought the box back to us, and wanted us to exchange it, which we refused to do - he said he had not the opportunity of selling it - it was spoiled for us, because it was mixed - he had selected the qualities himself - it is not customary to take goods back - the value is about 30s., the nutmegs are worth 15s.; but he has had a portion of the arrow-root back since he left it at the warehouse - he could have the rest at any time.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the arrow-root his, though in your warehouse? A. Certainly - he did not ask me for leave to take nutmegs to make amends for the bad arrow-root - Mr. Mayor's partner's name is

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The direction Green took could not be seen by the prisoner? A. No; in going from our door you must go the same way, whether you are going to Holborn or Liquorpond-street - you could turn right into Holborn from Castle-street.</p>

            . I am one of the City-police, No. 45 - I was in Cheapside on the 17th of February, in the afternoon, between four and five - I saw the two prisoners within a few doors of <placeName id="t18340220-156-crimeloc906">Milk-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where was the handkerchief found? A. The handkerchief and the prisoner Turner were given into my hand at the same time by a young man, who stopped him - I did not know the prisoners before, but I never lost sight of them - I saw Turner stopped - I was about fifteen yards off - I raised a cry - I was first in the pursuit - two or three who joined in the pursuit, were between me and Turner, before he was stopped - I saw the handkerchief during the whole time in Turner's hand - the street was not crowded - it was rather clear - I have not known them before - I had not been watching them.</p>
               <p>Turner. He did not find it on me - he says it was between four and five o'clock, and it was about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>P. H. PARISH. I do not exactly know whether it was in the afternoon or no - I have had several cases of the sort, and not putting the time down in my book, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Will you swear it was not later than four in the afternoon? A. I will not swear to the time - I have been seven years in the police - I think I have only had one such case as this - there is a hole in this handkerchief - I called after the gentleman, but he might not have heard me - I was hoarse at the time - my voice was more like a woman's - I swear I saw the handkerchief in Turner's hand, but not that I saw him drop it.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper of Coleman-street Ward - about nine o'clock in the evening of the 9th of January, I called at Mr. Phillips's house - I saw the prisoner there - she answered the door - I knew her to be Mr. Phillip's <rs id="t18340220-157-deflabel912" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You went with the beadle and constable to Mr. Phillips about nine o'clock in the evening? A. Yes; I went with the parish authorities - she said she had been poorly, and she looked worse than ever I had seen her before - she said she was better - I had seen Mrs. Cox some months before that time, but never had any communication with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend with a surgeon and have the prisoner examined? A. It was done at my house by her own request - she had the offer to go to the infirmary and the Compter, or to my house, and wished to go to my house to be examined - I sent for Mr. Culverwell, and he came - he is not here - I went there with a view of bringing Mr. Phillips before the Lord Mayor, but she answered the door herself, and I questioned her - Mr. Phillips has been indicted, and the grand jury threw out the bill - I do not know what was the charge against him - I went to her the night I heard of it - I saw the box, but did not see a cap on the child's head then - I cannot say what was on it when it was found.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many children have you had? A. Nine - I never attended any friend in her lying-in - I never suspected in the least that the prisoner was with child before that time; but where I lived all the people in the neighbourhood suspected she was - I believe none of them knew it - it was talked about the neighbourhood; it was suspected by many people - I had not the slightest reason to believe that she was with child before I performed this office for her in the privy, because I always took her part, and said it was not so - I went to Blue Hart-court with her for a bricklayer, where she was sent by Mr. Phillips, the same day before she was taken ill - nothing happened on the road there or back; but she said to me as she went along, that she was not willing for me to go with her; but I said I should; she made a stop in the alley, and seemed as if she was poorly - she said she felt herself very poorly, and she had been so for many days - I accompanied her to the bricklayer's, that was, going to the bricklayer's - she said, "Shall I go so and so, and order something to drink" - I said "No; I shall go with you" - she told me to stop and not go with her - I said, "I shall go with you" - I did not like to leave her in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you expect her to be confined in the street? A. No; I did not - I went with her, came back again, and we had the drink - I did not wish to go into a wine-vaults by myself, she did not make any objection to my going; but she said, "You do so and so;" but I said,"I shall go with you" - I did not go with her to help her in case she was taken ill in the street - I have been in custody myself - I am not aware of anything particular happening to her in the court; she stopped and looked round, but said nothing, and I said nothing - I never suspected her to be in the family way, for she said, it was quite a different thing that was the matter with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have asked her about it then? A. No; I said to her, "If you are an innocent woman stand your ground;" but I never suspected her - when she made the stand in the court, I saw no water - I did not look - she said she was ill - I did not know what was the matter with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200095"/>her - I was taken into custody as an accessary to the concealment of the child in the box, and remained in gaol from the Wednesday afternoon until the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the kitchen, was there any blood there? A. Yes; I washed it up, then went up stairs - there was blood all the way up stairs - I washed that up - I found the substance in the pail, and had heard the conversation with the neighbours, that they thought she was with child, but I never suspected she was with child - I did not poke the substance down the privy with a stick - I pulled the handle up - the water filled the pail up the first time - there was nothing in the pail the last time, and the first time there was water in it - I cannot say whether there was blood in it - I washed up the blood on the floor and stairs - the pail leaked water only - I cannot swear there was not blood with it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was not blood and water running down the stairs from the pail, to the spot where Mr. Phillips called you? A. I cannot say - it did not look like blood at all - I have said there was blood on the stairs, in the bed-room, and in the kitchen; and the after-birth was in the pail - but, I declare, I did not suspect she was with child.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Not when you saw the contents of the pail? A. Yes; then I did, but not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take away the box? A. No; I never saw the box or the child in my life - I was before two different coroners on the inquest on the child - I did not give a different account before one of the coroners to what I gave before the other - as near as possible, I stated everything to my knowledge - I was not asked as to the date on which she said she had had a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on this day, when she did not want you to go with her, and she was taken ill in the alley, did she tell you she was so ill, and she hoped you would come in the evening? A. No; I did not tell her I would come in the evening - Mr. Phillips came for me - I had not promised to go - she never put the question to me.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Had not the prisoner stated to you that she was not in the family-way? A. Yes; it was in reference to that statement, that I said to her, "If you are an innocent woman, stand your ground" - she had said so to her mother - I was kept in custody for the purpose of giving evidence.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Chiswell-street - I saw the body of the child in the box, in the house where the box was found, in Tilt's presence - the child appeared to have been born alive - I applied the hydrostatic test to the lungs - and saw a bruise in the front surface of the chest - there was a fractured rib, an opening made between the sixth and seventh rib; and the air had escaped from the lungs - this circumstance induces me to believe it was born alive - if vitality had not existed, an injury applied to the body could not produce any mark - the trying of the lungs is an infallible test, except in some circumstances - I infer that it was born alive - the body was not compressed in the box; but the limbs were bent to fit in the box.</p>

            . I am matron of the Compter - on Sunday morning, the 12th of January, in consequence of my hearing the prisoner wished to see me, I had her called into my room - she said she wished to relieve her mind respecting the charge she was brought in for - I neither threatened nor made her any promise - she said that during the time she was in service she was pregnant; and on Friday, the 3d of January, she was taken very ill, and could not do her domestic work - her master seeing she was ill, asked what was the matter with her - she said she had violent pains in her limbs from cold - he recommended a warm bath, which she declined, and wished to have a woman to do her work, and named Mrs. Cox, being an honest woman; that he went to fetch Mrs. Cox, and directly after he was gone the child was born - she heard a slight noise, but not a cry - she found it attached to her by something, which she pulled from herself - she was flurried, and took it in her apron, and laid it on the bed - she found her pains as bad as ever; and the afterbirth came from her - she put that into the slop-pail - Mrs. Cox came soon after, took the slop-pail, and emptied it down the water-closet - that she had no opportunity of doing anything to the child till the Sunday following, when she washed it, and put it in the box, which was too short for it; and she turned its legs up - that she then told Mrs. Cox she was very uneasy, and wished the child to be interred - she saw some men at work in the church-yard opposite, who, she thought, would bury it for her, which she named to Mrs. Cox, who took it away, and got it buried for her - she did not say where the child had been placed, until she desired Mrs. Cox to bury it - she gave no further account of the child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she state that the child was dead when she took it up from the floor? A. Yes; there was a letter intercepted from her at the Compter - it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200096"/>not addressed to Mr. Phillips, her master, but to another Mr. Phillips (relating that the father of the child's name was Franks) - when she heard Mr. Phillips was in custody, she was very much agitated to think he was in custody, as he knew no more than the babe itself, and she wrote to his brother - she said she told Mrs. Cox the child was in the room, and Mrs. Cox told her for God's sake not to say the child was in the room.(Mr. CLARKSON addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of the prisoner.)</p>

             (City policeman No. 53). I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody - I used no threat to her- she said to her master in my presence, in the way to the Compter, that she hoped he would be as lenient as he possibly could towards her, and she would tell where the beads were; and, as she went up the steps of the Compter, she said they were in the bed between the ticking and flock - I found them there - she said the bed was in the room where the children slept, where her boxes were - I got a key from her at the station-house, with which I opened her box, and found these things in it, which I produce.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. The accounts were made up weekly, were they not? A. No; every night the money taken in the day-time was given to me - this is the daily account - the milk business is only a trifling concern, and I settled that account every night, and the carman's business was settled every morning - there was an account settled on the 6th of January, between me and the prisoner - that was not a weekly account, but a day's account - nothing was said about settling accounts on Tuesday, the 14th - he had accounted to me every night until the 14th, according to the book - there was no weekly account independent of the nightly account, settled up to the 14th - there was no weekly account at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on Wednesday, the 15th of January, the prisoner asking you for the book the accounts were made up in? A. Yes; I had left it at home, and given him another book instead - I have that here - the book he asked for was the book I have produced - and here is the one I gave him, when he asked for the other - both of them are in his handwriting - the book was given up to me every evening, and I took it home to enter the settlement - I had left it at home, and bought him a new one to go on with, and gave it him on the 15th - he never said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200098"/>would pay me the balance - we had no quarrel as to the mode the entries were made - he did not offer that anybody should make up the books, and say he would pay me - I did not take the key out of his desk - I was not at home when he called on the 17th.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I see, by the book, the sums received are in small amounts of 2s. and 3s. each? A. Yes, here is what was paid for, and what was on credit - I never heard of any claim from him until I was before the Lord Mayor.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's nephew - I am employed in my uncle's business - it was usual for the prisoner to make up the accounts every week for the milk business, either on Monday or Tuesday - to the best of my knowledge that account was made up weekly - I remember the prisoner coming to me on the 17th - I was at the desk at which he was usually seated - he said, "John, I know your orders, will you deliver the key to me?" - I said, "I will not" - he immediately took a piece of paper, and wrote his direction down, "George Thompson, No. 1, Portland-street, Stepney," and said, "Tell your uncle, if he wants me, that is where I am to be found" - I did not go to look for him there - I believe he has stated to me, that he was ready to settle his accounts with my uncle, but never to my uncle.</p>

               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is this the book in which he kept his accounts? A. Yes; these are daily accounts - when the man comes back, from taking out the milk, he settles with him - there are two columns, one for paid and the other for unpaid - Mr. Punter took it home to Clapham with him every night.</p>

             brought some things to me to sell the day before new year's day - I was at the Bell public-house, opposite Whitechapel church - I was still employed in the same trade - I had seen Lazarus before - while I was employed at the prosecutor's, I acquired a knowledge of their manufacture - he employed me to sell coffin handles, and a variety of ornaments for coffins - I could tell them directly to be Mr. Gardner's manufacture - I did not buy them - I detained them, and gave information to Mr. Davis, the prosecutor's clerk, and gave him the articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long were you in the prosecutor's employ? A. Nearly thirteen years - I was discharged - I had had a little trouble concerning family affairs - I was rather given up to drink - I have served several undertakers with coffins - have attended funerals, but have not been regularly employed since - I am not now employed by the prosecutor - I do not know where Lazarus is - persons come to the coffin plate shops, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200099"/>buy the tin cuttings - I was acquainted with Lazarus by his coming to the shop for this sort of cuttings and things - he lived somewhere in Spitalfields, within two or three hundred yards of the Bell - he came to sell them to me to sell again - I was to pay the money for them - the prisoner was not in the prosecutor's employ when I was - he came afterwards - I have not expressed any determination to get into my old place at all events - nothing like it- it has been said so, but there is no truth in it - I have not been at their warehouse since July.</p>

             - on Thursday, the 9th of January, I was sent by my master with half-a-dozen hats to Mr. Myers, Hounsditch - and in Fenchurch-street I saw Clarke - he began talking to me, asked where I was going, and where I lived, and I told him - he then said he was going down Mark-lane, and turned into Mincing-lane - he came over in about five minutes, and said, "Have not you got farther?" - I said, "No" - he said, "I am going down a court opposite the East India House, and will walk with you" - then Smith came up and said, "Are not you going from Mr. Brown's to Mr. Myers'?"- I said, "Yes" - he said, "I have just come from Mr. Brown's, who said, if I made haste I should overtake you; you are to give me the hats, and to return home" - I said,"I have got to get the bill signed" - he said, "Mr. Brown said that was of no consequence" - I gave him the hats - he asked me to go down a court with him, which I did - and then he said the person was not at home - he was going away, and then said, "I am going down Cornhill, go on, and I will overtake you," and I saw no more of him - I went home and told master - Clarke had got out of me where I was going - and then Smith came up and seemed to know all about it - on the 15th I saw them together in Long-alley, and gave them into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Is your master here? A. Yes - I had never seen Smith before - he was with me a very short time - when he said he had come from Mr. Brown's, I gave up the written direction - I am sure they are the two men - they each had got a brown coat on, and an umbrella - I am sure of Smith by the umbrella and coat, and by his face - I knew him again directly I saw him- I saw him again six days afterwards, and was quite sure of him - master had directed me to leave the hats at Mr. Myers's, and get the book signed - Clarke first came up to me in Fenchurch-street, about five minutes' walk from Cornhill.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Alderman Birch at times, and have been so ten or eleven years - on Saturday, 1st of February, I was in Holborn, coming from Donovan's the Poulterer's, at near three o'clock - I met the prisoner near Thompson's with another man, coming out - they asked me to take something to drink, and I went back with them to Thompson's - we all came out together, and walked up Snow-hill, towards Smithfield - the other man said, that he was going to St. Albans by the coach - he asked the prisoner to walk so far with him, for he had bought a greatcoat at a pawnbroker's close by - they walked on together about four or five yards - the man who was with the prisoner left us by the pawnbroker's, up the hill near Smithfield - I don't know the pawnbroker's name - we two walked on about five or six yards - I knew the prisoner before, when he kept the Devonshire Arms, Golden-lane - we were joined by the other man - he had a great-coat with him - he gave it to the prisoner, whether it was for inspection or not, I cannot say; for I said I could not stop a moment longer - I was going over the water to my master, who keeps the Surrey-gate Tavern - the coat was a dark brown great-coat- I was at work at Mr. Alderman Birch's on the Lord Mayor's-day as cook, at Merchant

Towards Smithfield - the pawnbroker's shop is in the narrow part as you go to Smithfield, on the left hand side - it is up a hill - I do not know whether it is Snow-hill - I was going to the Surrey and Kent Tavern - it was formerly called Blizard's Hotel - this happened five or six yards from the pawnbroker's - I did not see the prisoner after I wished them good day - I do not know the name of the person - he was a tall man, about my own height - I never saw him before or since.</p>

            . Q. Was the prisoner running or walking when you first saw him? A. A sort of a trot, running as it were, going fast, not walking - he had nobody with him - the coat was dark brown - I did not run after him at all - I saw him at the door - I missed the coat from the door, and saw him going up the hill with it - he was not out of my sight until he was taken, from the time he took the coat, which was, as near as I can recollect, half-past three o'clock - it was not half a minute from the time I missed it till I saw it on his shoulder - I was not behind the counter when the coat was taken - I was near the door when I missed it - the same person I saw running with the coat was brought back with it by the foreman - I did not lose sight of him a moment - he was taken eight yards from the shop, at most - it was at Mr. Jones's door, the cook-shop, about six yards from master's door - the prisoner struck at the foreman, and began to show fight - when he was taken he said a man gave it him to carry - the foreman darted out of the shop and seized him in a moment with it.</p>
               <p>W. BARROW re-examined. I saw the prisoner stopped - there was no man at all near him to give him the coat - the man that was with him went down the hill before the prisoner took the coat - the prisoner turned to the right into the shop - I never saw Blizard before to-night - there was no man there at all except the prisoner when he took the coat - the prisoner was taken within seven yards of the door - the other man walked sharp down the hill - I had my two children, one in each hand, and did not run after him.</p>
               <p>COURT to H. HALL. Q. Describe the situation of the shop where you were? A. I almost that moment come down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200101"/>from dinner - I came to the door and missed the coat - the prisoner could hardly have got out of the shop when I missed it - the foreman was at the end of the counter near the door, just inside it - the door opens just where you go behind the counter - there is no door to the counter - the foreman stood about a yard and a half from the door - there is no flap to lift up to the counter - there is a flap, but it is always open.</p>
               <p>W. BARROW re-examined. I saw the prisoner take the coat - I did not call "Stop thief" - I did not know he was stealing - I saw him pursued - I could not tell but what he was the pawnbroker.</p>

            . I am a foreman of the engineers to Mr. John Seaward and Co. - on Saturday, the 4th of January, I ordered two quarters and eight pounds of copper bolts to be sent to the smiths' forge were Millard worked, to be cut up for melting, and to be returned to the brass shop - I was engaged in my vice shop, turning - about an hour afterwards I saw Millard near the brass shop, with a piece of copper bolt in his hand, which he appeared to be playing with - I followed him to the edge of the wharf, and saw him endeavouring to put something under his apron - I went to the brass shop and weighed the metal - I missed six pounds of copper bolt - I saw Millard leave the premises at one o'clock to go to dinner - I followed him to Salmon-lane, and went into a new beer-shop, opposite Hopson's premises - I saw Millard pass his premises, and then return back - Hopson has two shops, one is a harness shop, and one an iron shop - Hopson was standing at the door of the harness shop - Millard passed him and went into the iron shop - I afterwards went into Hopson's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon did you go? A. I should think in about five minutes - the policeman went in before me, and afterwards beckoned me over - I saw some copper bolt, which the policeman said Hopson took from the scale - when Hopson was told he must go to the station-house he said, "Let us go out at the back door, at all events."</p>

             (police-constable). On the 4th of January, I was directed to watch Millard - when he left his master's, he went home, to a street I do not know the name of - he came out in about ten minutes, and went to Hopson's shop - he went in at the iron shop-door - I did not see Hopson then - there is a kitchen at the back of the harness shop, and you go through the iron shop, and turn to the left hand to go to it - I went in in about a minute and a half after Millard; I saw him standing on one side of the table, and Hopson on the other - the cloth was laid for dinner, and, on the cloth, stood a small weighing machine, and this copper was in the scale - as soon as I got to the door, Hopson grabbed the copper off the scale with his right hand - there was a four-pound weight and a small weight in the other scale, and he took the small weight in his left hand, and put both his hands behind him - he went back a few paces, and stood against the wall - there was no other person in the room but the housekeeper - I asked Hopson, two or three times, what he had in his hands - he said, "Nothing" - I pulled his hands forward, and found these three pieces of copper in his right hand, and this two-pound weight in his left - the copper weighed about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200102"/>six pounds - I said he must go with me - he asked if I was an officer, as I was not in uniform - I said I was - he did not say anything to Millard or to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray recollect yourself - did he say anything to you? A. Yes; he said was there no way of settling it; was there no way of making it up? - I said so to the magistrate - I do not remember his saying anything more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything to you on the road to the station-house? A. In going to Lambeth-street, he said it was in my power to make it as easy as I liked, and he was very sorry I was not a moment later - I asked him, why? - he said he was going to throw it into the street - I went back to his house, after he was in the station, and found this chisel and drill - Millard was taken to the station, and a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence, were found on him - there is a board up at Hopson's shop with the prices he gives for different things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is on the board? A."Copper, 6d., brass, 5d." - I think every one can see it - I have stated the same here as I did at the police-office - my words were taken down and read over to me, and I was desired to sign it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure you told the magistrate that he said he was about to throw the copper into the street, that he said, "Is there no way of settling it?" and that he said it was in your power to make it as easy as you liked? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been in the police? A. Four years - there were two examinations, and the depositions were taken on the second examination - on the first time they were taken in a book.</p>

            . I am a plasterer, and live in Shouldham-street - I saw the man who dropped the hat-case- it was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you been? A. To May-fair; I was coming across Curzon-street, and saw a man running across the road, and another ran to meet him - they met in the road, the tall one struck the other, and the hat-case was dropped, and it rolled towards the gutter - I really think the prisoner is not the tall one, and I do not think the other one was Wilson - they both ran off - the tall one had a long great-coat, but whether it was black, blue, or brown, I cannot tell, as the night was so foggy - I could not see two yards from me - I ran towards Park-lane, to near where the prisoner was caught - I lost sight of both the men - when I first saw the two men in the scuffle, my two sons were with me, and could see the men, but they could not run fast enough to keep up with me - to the best of my belief, neither the prisoner nor Wilson are the men- I saw the prisoner in the custody of Wise, within two or three minutes after I saw him run away - he ran down Audley-street, and then Stanhope-street - a man, who appeared like a groom, picked up the hat-case, he was not like Wilson - I was about twenty yards behind the short man, when he ran after the tall man - when the prisoner was taken the tall man was gone.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How old are you? A. Fourteen - I have heard the prisoner's name since then - I never saw him at my father's house - I saw a man run away, he was not so tall as the prisoner - he had a long coat on - Wilson is the man who ran after him - when I first saw him there was a bit of a bustle in the middle of the road - I saw the man drop the hat-case, it did not roll that I saw - Wilson took it up and ran down a mews - my father went on, and we went on after him - I lost sight of the tall man when he turned the corner.</p>

            . Q. Are you the person who had scuffle with some person in Curzon-street? A. Yes; he dropped the hat-case, then ran, and I pursued him - I did not lose sight of him for a moment - as he was going to turn round Stanhope-street, there was a family coming out of a house, and he turned across the road, and ran towards Stanhope-gate, and the policeman caught him - the prisoner is the man - there was no other tall man present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you undertake to say there were no other men in the street? A. Not that I saw, except the servants - I will not say there were not.</p>
               <p>COURT to SAML. WISE. Q. When you took the prisoner, was he running? A. Yes, as fast as possible - I heard the cry of "Stop thief" two or three times - the moment I turned the prisoner round, Wilson came up - I saw no other men running, but some footmen who came up afterwards - Cliffen identified the prisoner as the man Wilson had scuffled with.</p>

I took these pots from the prisoner Hume, one was in each pocket, under her gown - I found her going to her own apartments, in Flower and Deane-street - I asked her what she had got - she said, "Nothing" - I felt the pots, and she begged me not to expose her in the street.</p>

            . On the 29th of January, I was at the Castle public-house, Goodman's-stile - I saw Shepley there - he took a quart-pot, and put it into his hat - I told the publican of it - Shepley stopped about five minutes longer - he then went away - I followed him with Mr. Crutch, the publican - we stopped him at the corner of Chichester-street - Mr. Crutch took his hat off, and found the pot in it - he was liberated - on the 6th of February, I was going down Crutched-friars, and saw Hume standing at the corner of Savage-gardens - I knew her by her coming to the office to give Shepley a character - I then went into the Cheshire Cheese, and saw Shepley sitting with four or five pots round him - I came out - he came out, and crossed over to Hume, they went on, and stopped at a corner were he gave her something.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What time was it? A. A quarter before nine in the evening - I am quite sure I saw him take it - I was close, following him with my toes to his heels - I know him perfectly well before, by having followed him in the street - when I first saw him I was on the opposite side of the way, and I directly ran across and followed him - the handkerchief was not out of the pocket when I crossed over - several persons came up and said,"Let him go;" and he screamed and brought several people, and caught hold of a post - there might be other persons passing at the time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LEWIS. I am the brother of Benjamin Lewis- I was walking with him in Fleet-street - he is too ill to attend here - our attention was called by Sparks - my brother returned with me - he immediately saw his handkerchief in the witness's hands, and claimed it as his property - I did not lose mine - the prisoner was near enough to hear him claim it - he attended before the magistrate next morning - he lives with me, and I know he had such a handkerchief as that.(John Blankly, hair-dresser, No. 5, Ritchbell-place, Lambs-conduit-street; and

            , JUN. I am the son of James Lynn, who is a shell-fish-monger, in Fleet-street - I knew the defendant in Mr. Lovegrove's employ, previous to the 13th of January, for about two years - he came to my father's shop during those two years frequently for brawn, herrings, potted shrimps, and lobsters, for Samuel Lovegrove, his master, who keeps the London Coffee House and Tavern, Ludgate-hill - he has said, on former occasions, that he came from Mr. Lovegrove's, but not always - while he was in Mr. Lovegrove's service, he used to come for these articles on his account, and received them for him, and carried them away himself. - he received them from our shopman and servants on different occasions - they were sold and delivered to him by my father, myself, and the servants - my father has no partner - on the 10th of January, I was not present, but in consequence of a communication made to me by Collis, four slices of brawn were booked to Mr. Lovegrove - on the morning of the 13th of January the defendant came and said to me, "I want three slices of brawn" - I said, "Collis, cut that brawn" - he did so - I said to the defendant, "How many sons has your master in the business?" - he said, "Two," - I said, "Both in the business?" - he said, "Yes; both of them" - I did not mention Mr. Lovegrove's name - I went down the street, and fetched a policeman - I told him to wait outside, and he was taken into custody by the policeman - I gave him the goods, let him go out, and put him in the policeman's hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you did not believe the pretence he made? A. No; not on that day, because I was aware of it on the Saturday night - he did not obtain these goods in consequence of the pretence - I delivered them to complete the case against him - Mr. Lovegrove paid for the goods as long as the prisoner was in his service.</p>

It is all the same thing, he drew his arm from his pocket - I am a paper hanger - I went to the sale on purpose to buy- the prisoner pressed against me - there was no one between me and him - there were twenty-five or thirty people in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure that the person who pressed against you was the prisoner? A. Yes; his right arm pressed against me, and he pressed against the prosecutor, and when he was taking something from him I felt his elbow rub against my side, and I saw him pass the contents of his hand to a person; he appeared to have something in his hand, but I did not see any thing in his hand - I saw the motion of his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying he appeared to pass the contents of his hand to his neighbour? A. I saw him draw his arm up from the prosecutor's right side, and pass it over to another person, but there was something in his hand, or the other would not have left immediately.</p>

Seven or eight months - I live next door to him - I do not remember the prisoner living there - Flynn's son has lived there - my husband is dead - it is about three months since I saw a man named Maquire - he is in Hertford gaol - he is no relation of mine - he has called at my house - he never passed as my husband - I never lived with him as his wife - he did say when he came out of the country he would marry me, if I wished it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to TIMOTHY FLYNN. Q. Were you ever in custody for an assault? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find the breeches? A. No: Flynn got up, and was a good while opening the door for me - I saw a woman there - she asked what I wanted of her son - they were both awake when I went down - Flynn went with me, and shut the door - the prisoner was there - she went out with me; and he said, "Ah, Carroty Kit, is it you?" I did not stop to hear the door shut.(The prisoner put in a written defence, protesting her innocence; and stating that she had induced the policeman to go to the prosecutor's house, suspecting his son who had deserted her was to be found there.)</p>

             (police-constable). I found at Clark's a large leather travelling trunk, and some property in it - I took Rowland at No. 4, Denmark-court, Golden-lane - I found on him a key, which opened a tin box, but I only found some copper money in that - I found some soles and a pair of leather boot fronts, in a hat-box in his room - he directed me to the house, and said he lived in the front room, one pair - I there found a woman who answered to the name of Mrs. Rowland.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner was not there? A. No; he was at the station .</p>
