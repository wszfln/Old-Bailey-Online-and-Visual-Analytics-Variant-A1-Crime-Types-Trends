                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Cambridge-place, Cambridge-terrace, Camden-town. On Saturday, the 25th of March, I was called in to see the deceased—I found a fractured wound at the back of his neck, close to the base of the skull—I examined that wound with a groove director, which I found penetrate an inch and one-eighth, and from that wound there oozed a quantity of serum—the wound was half an inch long externally—the boy was labouring under symptoms of inflammation of the membranes of the brain, for which I used the ordinary remedies, leeches, cold lotions, and purgatives—in spite of all those remedies, the symptoms continued gradually to in<lb/>crease, and he died on the fourth day, the 28th of March—I attribute his death to the wound at the back of the neck—he had no other malady or complaint about him that I observed, that would have occasioned or contri<lb/>buted to his death—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I observed in the spinal canal, which is the cavity containing the spinal marrow, a punctured wound, which corresponded with the one externally, it was an eighth of an inch long, and penetrating the membranes covering the spinal marrow—there was extensive inflammation of the membranes around the wound, and at the base of the brain was effusion of a large quantity of serum, the result of that inflammation, which was sufficient to account for his death.</p>

On Friday, the 24th of March, I was in company with the deceased under a wal<lb/>nut-tree in a field opposite Mansfield-place, Kentish-town, with Roberts and Walter—the prisoner came over the fence with some cow parsley in his lap, and a knife in his hand—he said to the deceased, "Did I sell a halfpenny worth of milk on the bridge?"—I did not know what that meant—the deceased said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "You are a liar"—the deceased replied, "You are a liar"—the prisoner said, "You are a b----liar; because you are a thief yourself, you think every body else is"—the deceased jumped up and struck the prisoner with his fist—the prisoner struck him with his fist—the deceased struck him again on the head—the prisoner grated his teeth, held the knife up, and said he did not care a b----if he stuck him—the deceased stood facing him—he put his hands up, turned round to save the blow, and the knife caught him in the back of the neck—he did not throw the knife—it did not go out of his hand—the deceased said, "I am stuck"—the prisoner dropped the cow parsley out of his lap, and ran home directly—the deceased was so weak he could not get over the fence—I helped him over, and took him to several surgeons, but could not get assistance—I at last left him at Mr. Birmingham's, a surgeon—I afterwards saw him again at the station, when the prisoner was taken—they then appeared on very good terms—I think their meeting in the field was merely accidental—the two boys were not a fair match—the deceased was the more powerful of the two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Jewry-street, Aldgate. On the day in question I was sent for—the woman was dead when I came—I after<lb/>wards examined her head, to ascertain the cause of death—I found a bruise on the left temple, and another underneath the left eye—I could see no other external marks of violence—on the following day I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found the membranes of the brain very much congested, with blood in the ventricles—I also found effusion of blood—at the base of the brain I saw a very great quantity of blood, effused from rupture of a blood vessel—I attribute her death to the rupture of a blood vessel—that might be produced either by a blow, or falling against a hard substance—I think it much more likely to be by the fall against the rum puncheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the head indicate a healthy state of body or otherwise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw no appearances but what were healthy, with the exception of great effusion, and the membranes being in a high state of con<lb/>gestion—congestion might be produced without a blow—I think congestion might follow in ten minutes from a blow—I have known a blood vessel broken without any violence—I do not believe the blow on the temple was the occasion of the rupture, nor the blow on the eye, because they had been done previously—I did not discover any bruise that had been produced that morning—I cannot tell whether she was addicted to drinking—I did not observe any smell of liquor about her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if she had fallen against a rum puncheon there was no external mark of violence left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not, but that may be ac<lb/>counted for by the quantity of hair behind—a rupture of the vessel from natural causes would account for all the appearances I observed in the brain—passion would produce the effects I saw—the woman being in a passion from the excited state of the vessels of the brain, blood would be thrown to them, and they would be predisposed towards rupture—a slight blow at that time might produce rupture—I think it might be produced by the fall against the puncheon—I cannot positively say whether it was occasioned by external violence or natural causes, but from there having been a fall I think it more probable that that had something to do with it.</p>

On the morning of the 22nd of Feb. a man came into the shop for an ounce of salts—the prisoner resembles the man—I cannot say positively that he is the person—I served him—about half an hour after, somebody else came in for the same quantity of salts, I think about half-past eight or a quarter to nine—I went to breakfast, previous to the second person coming in—when I went to breakfast I secured the shop door—I breakfast in the house—in conse<lb/>quence of some information, about half an hour after I went into the shop—the door was then closed, but the papers on the counter were in confusion, and two trays were removed from a glass case on the counter, containing eighty, ninety, or a hundred scent bottles, worth 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or rather more—this bottle, produced by the officer, exactly resembles one of those we missed, in pattern, size, and make—these four, produced by Kibble, I have no doubt formed a portion of them, and two of them have our private mark on them—we generally put a small card into the bottles—we do not take them out when we sell them—these five, produced by Ward, I have no doubt formed a portion of those stolen—we missed some exactly like them, in colour, pattern, make, and size—there are no marks upon them, but they are precisely the sort of bottles, this one had a ring and chain to it which have been removed—I believe these three, produced by Belcher, also to be a portion of those which were stolen.</p>

I know the pri<lb/>soner—he is a coach-trimmer—he has been in the habit of frequenting my house for nearly three years past—I believe he was steward to a Trade's Be<lb/>nefit Society—it was not held at my house—I remember the day he was taken into custody—he slept at my house the night before, and did not leave till past eleven next morning—several people about the same stature as the prisoner came to my house—I know a man named Smith, who very much resembles him—he may be a little taller—I have not seen Smith since the prisoner was in custody—I saw him on the Monday as the prisoner was take on Wednesday—the prisoner was in bed at my house from eight till nine that morning—he got up just before eleven, for he made an observation on getting up, that he was late—he went to bed at half-past twelve—I got up between seven and eight—he could not have got out of the house without my seeing him after I was up—I see every person that comes in and goes out of my house—the bar is so situated, and there is no back way—I do not think it likely that he could have come into the house after I got up, and be<lb/>fore eleven, without my seeing him—I saw him in bed between nine and ten that morning—I do not think I saw him before nine—I went into his bed-room about half-past nine—I had my breakfast at nine—he was then waking—he could not have gone out or come in after I came down without my see<lb/>ing him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lock and whitesmith, and live in Charles-place, Kensington-square. On the 12th of January I went to the house of Mary Leary, at No. 36, George-street, Bloomsbury—when I got there the prisoner was sitting down partaking of food with Mrs. Leary and her children—Mrs. Leary asked me to partake of it, and I sat down for that purpose at a different table to the prisoner—I sat sideways to him, and his back was to me—I think within two minutes after I sat down the prisoner got up from his seat and took the plate which had been provided for me and was before me, but I had not began to eat—it slipped from his fingers, and fell into my lap—at the same time he took the plate from Mrs. Leary's mother, who was at my table, and that fell on the floor—he had taken the two plates one in each hand—he then, to the best of my knowledge, took up the fork which had been given to me, and plunged it into my eye—I cannot swear that I saw him take the fork up—I was sitting down at the time—I jumped up, and Mrs. Leary asked me to fetch a policeman, which I did, and he was given into custody—I have been under medical care—the sight of my eye is quite gone—I had not said a word to him after entering the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Temple-bar. On the night of the 5th of March I was out with Reuben Albiston—I was at the Three Elms, St. Ann-street, Westminster, about half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner Wright came in directly after me, drank with us for half an hour, and then asked me to pay for some liquor—I said I had no money with me—we staid there till past twelve—she was in and out, and after twelve we three and Emma Smith went out together—we were invited to go to Emma smith's room, in St. Ann-street—Wright and Smith asked Albiston to go—we all four went up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184304030032"/>
               <p>into Smith's room, and stopped a short time—I went down to go to Wright's room with her—that is in a house down the same court—I went out down stairs into the entry, staid there a minute or so, and Wright passed two or three words at the bottom of the stairs, in the entry—there was no light there—two or three or more females came down from the top of the entry and jostled me about—I felt them at my waistcoat-pocket and my watch pocket—I slipped my hand to my waistcoat-pocket, where, I am sure, I had a sovereign and shilling, and they were gone—I felt my watch-pocket and missed my watch—I had left that up-stairs with Albiston, but forgotten it at that time—I accused Wright of taking my watch and money—she ran away down the court—I followed her up into her own room—I accused her again of taking my watch and money—she denied it—I went out to fetch a policeman, and met some one in the entry of the court—I do not know whether it was a man or woman, but they came out of the door-way that leads up to Smith's room, and jumped on my back—I threw myself against the wall—I went to the top of St. Ann-street, and told a policeman I had lost my watch and money, and I expected they were then robbing my companion—he told me to go on, and he would follow me—I made the best of my way back into Emma Smith's room, and found Albiston, Emma Smith, and Wright there—I told Albiston I had lost my watch, a sovereign, and a shilling—he said I had not lost my watch, and gave it to me—before I could well get it into my pocket, two men came up stairs—I did not notice them sufficiently to know them—one of them struck me a blow in the eye with his fist, and on my mouth, which was cut in two places, he then turned round to Albiston, who hit him with his fist, or pushed him—I saw him fall—the two men escaped out of the room—I ran and shut the door, and heard them going down stairs—I went to look for my hat, which they had knocked off when they struck me, and before I could find it I heard them coming up stairs again, beating their bludgeons and weapons on the stairs as they came up—I ran to the door, put my foot to the bottom and my hand to the top—they tried to force their way in, but could not—they knocked a pannel, or part of one, in with their weapons—I then loosened the door and it came wide open—I saw the prisoner Little with a poker in his hand—he came just inside the door, and struck me on the forehead with the poker—I noticed him sufficient to be sure of him—he stood to the left, and the other man to the right—I rushed in among them on the landing, where there were three besides Little—I believe Rose to be the one who stood to my right, but cannot swear to either of the three—I made my way down to the first landing—(this was on the second floor)—I met the policeman, and before I could turn round Albiston came tumbling down stairs, bleeding, with his head cut open—I then gave Little in charge, and Albiston gave Rose in charge on the stairs—the policeman took them both to the station—we went to Westminster Hospital to have our heads dressed—I had several bruises, and was much hurt—I remained at the hospital eight or nine days—I believe Wright was taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a whip-thong maker, and was in company with Gilbert at the Three Elms on the night of the 5th of March. We fell in with Wright and Smith there, and left the house together at nearly half-past twelve o'clock in the morning of the 6th—we all four went to Smith's room, which, I believe, is in a court out of St. Ann-street—we got there about twenty minutes to one, and had not been there long before Gilbert and Wright left the room together, leaving me and Smith there—I believe Wright's room is in the same court—it might be five or ten minutes when Gilbert came back and said he had been robbed of a sovereign, a shilling, and his watch, but he had given me his watch previous to going away, as I had told him I was going home—the two male prisoners came up stairs directly after, and struck him a severe blow on the eye—I cannot say which struck him, but am sure they are the two who first came into the room, and one of them struck him in the eye, and, another in the mouth—I cannot say whether the same man struck both blows—neither of them said a word before that, nor was anything said to them—they came in an abrupt manner, and immediately struck him, and directly came to make an attack on me—I believe it was Little that I knocked down—they both went down stairs, and in two or three minutes I heard footsteps coming up stairs, and making a great noise—I and Gilbert went to the door, and held it, to keep them from coming in—they fumbled at the door with the instruments they had got, and forced out a piece of the pannel—I then saw there was more than two on the stairs armed with weapons, one with an iron weapon—the others had pieces of timber—I found it useless to attempt to keep the door shut, and gave way—the two prisoners forced their way into the room—Gilbert was the first they met—they struck him a severe blow on the forehead, and laid his head open—I only saw the two prisoners come into the room, and it was one of them struck him—Gilbert got down stairs—the two prisoners then</p>

               <p>attacked me, and one of them, I cannot say which, gave me a blow, I believe it was with an iron instrument, for it cut the back of my hat quite through, and cut my head open—I made my escape—the blow caused me to tumble part of the way down stairs, being bewildered a little—I found a policeman on the landing, down stairs, (two or three, I believe)—the two male prisoners were taken to the station, and we were taken to the hospital—I only went there to have my head dressed, but was under the surgeon's care nearly a fort<lb/>night—it was a severe blow, and produced erysipelas in my face.</p>

In 1834 I was a constable in the police—I know the prisoner—while I was a constable I apprehended him in Finsbury-square for highway robbery—I took him to the station in Bunhill-row—he was committed on a charge then made—I am sure he is the person.</p>

I was sent for by Inspector Pearce, of the A division—I should think the prisoner is about forty years of age now—he has not the same outward appearance—he has a greater pro<lb/>fusion of hair and beard than when I apprehended him—with that exception I should say he is the same, when I make allowance for the difference that nine years would make in the appearance of his face—I do not know who described him as being thirty—I see no alteration in him except his hair and the work of age—he is altered in that way—there was a peculiarity which I observed then, and which I observe now, he stammered very much—there is nothing peculiar about him except the stammering—I was in the police up to two years and a half back, and was about all parts of the town—if he had been about his business in London for six or seven years last past I might possibly have seen him, and not have known him.</p>

In the year 1836, I was in the police-force—I believe it is about nine years ago—I left between seven and eight years ago—I remember Seal then being an officer of the police—I recollect hearing a cry of "Stop thief" one night in Chiswell-street, Finsbury—I came up on that cry, and found Seal in contest with a man—I saw the prisoner first alone, and then I came in contact with him and Seal together—as far as I can recollect we all met together—he was following him, and I turned back on him, so that we all seemed to come on him together—I did not see Seal grapple with him—we both took charge of him together, went to the station with him, and the charge was booked—I never saw the prisoner from that time till very lately at Bow-street—there is a great deal of difference in the man now—I can say that he resembles the man—I can say I believe him to be the man—I can<lb/>not go further—I would not undertake to swear positively to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Pritchard and Co., tobacco manu<lb/>facturers, in London-wall. About nine years ago, one winter's evening, I heard a cry of "Stop thief" in Windmill-street, Finsbury-square—I came up on that cry, and followed a man from Windmill-street to Chiswell-street—he was running—the police-officers took him into custody—he fell down at Lazarus's, the linen-draper's shop—I came in contact with him, and fell also—the fall was the cause of his being taken—two policemen, Seal and Collins, closed on the prisoner as well as myself, and took him—I afterwards attended at the Police-court—I made sufficient observation of the person to think I should know him again—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I am a police-constable, and am specially employed in the Post-office—about eight or nine years ago I was at the police station in Bunhill-row, when Seal, Collins, and Maynard brought a man in custody—I recollect that man—he was charged with felony—I saw him fumbling something about in his left hand, and took a diamond pin out of it—I noticed his person particularly—I am quite satisfied the prisoner is the party from my observation of him then, and looking at him now, and seeing him so often since.</p>

On Saturday, the 11th of March, I left my counting-house about six o'clock in the evening, leaving my cash-box in one of the drawers of an iron chest in the counting-house—there were several bills which were over due, and seven that were not due, two cheques, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—the iron chest was not locked when I left, but the two drawers in it were locked—I saw it again next day, and both drawers had then been forced—the cash-box, documents, and money, were all gone.</p>

I went to the counting-house, and saw that three desks had been broken open, which were locked at the time I left the counting-house the preceding evening—there had been 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in one of those desks, which was mine, and that money was gone—I found the safe locked—I went into the parlour for the key, and it was gone—in the coal-cellar I found this cash-box, which had been in the safe—I also found there several papers in a table-cloth, which I believe was the kitchen table-cloth—the cash-box was broken at one end and empty—I also found these two screw-drivers, hammer, and a pair of pincers—the pincers are my own—I had bought them the preceding evening, and had placed them on the parlour-table—I gave information to Taylor, the wharf constable, and he and sergeant Brannan came to the house—I then searched the house, and missed three silver table-spoons and three silver tea-spoons—I had used two of the spoons for breakfast—I missed a carpet bag which I had not seen for three or four weeks before—Mr. Barrett came to the counting-house about five o'clock that afternoon—he opened the safe with a duplicate key, and I saw that the drawers had been broken open—on the ground near the safe I saw Mr. Barrett find the tool part of this screw-driver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a purchaser of miscellaneous property, and live close by St. Mark's-place, Kennington. On Saturday, the 11th of Feb., I was out between one and two in the morning—I had not been drinking very much—I was in the neighbourhood of Westminster, and entered the King's Head public-house in Orchard-street—I was alone at first, but was afterwards in company with Eliza Spillard—I am not aware whether she went in with me—she might have followed me into the house—I do not recollect being in her company, only from her statement—I saw all the four prisoners at that public-house, and they asked me to treat them—I think it was Bassett first asked me—I treated them, after much solicitation—they said, "Will you not pay even for a pint of beer?"—I said, "I do not mind a pot, as you have been out of work many weeks—I am sorry to see you so distressed"—I threw down some money—I do not know whether it was sixpence or a shilling, and they had some beer—the weather was exceedingly bad that night—I waited at the King's Head probably three quarters of an hour, during which time I sat down, I am told, in the tap-room—I do not know whether it was the parlour or tap-room—I recollect sitting down—I remember leaving the house by myself—after I left the house I was molested by four or five persons, two men and two or three women, and it is very probable that Spillard may have been among them—I was laid hold of on each side of the arm by some man on each side, and I was pushed down Union-court, and into No. 9, I believe it is—I made some great resistance—the door was open, and I was forced in—there was no light in the passage—after I was forced in I was laid hold of by the clothes, and dragged, or rather forced up stairs into the front room, first floor—the first person I had any communication with was Mary Bassett—they were all of a gang together at the time I was forced up stairs—it was in the dark, and I could not observe Bassett then, but she afterwards brought a candle, and I think offered me some liquor—I forget whether I partook of it; I am not certain—I perfectly recollect Bassett—I identified her in the morning—I remained there perhaps till eleven or twelve o'clock in the day; I cannot say the exact time—I found I was in a very low bad place—I said to Bassett, "Let me out of this house; what shall I give you?"—I gave her some silver, something of little consequence, for her to let me out of the house, which she said she would do—I heard a noise below—she said it was lodgers quarrelling—I heard some screaming—she had pre<lb/>viously prevailed on me, as much as possible, to lie on a bedstead, which I refused to do—she went down stairs, saying, "I will go and see all clear"—she returned almost immediately and closed the door after her—I heard some<lb/>body outside walking up stairs at a very quick step, and Fitzgerald rushed into the room, and said, "What does this man want here?—you have done me an injury"—I said, "For what reason?"—he asserted something similar to certify that I had been connected with his wife—he said to Baesett, "Has he got any money?"—she told him it was in my pocket—he then laid his hand on me—I said, "I can give, but I will not be robbed"—I dashed</p>

               <p>myself from him, and a struggle ensued—I told him I could not fight much, but I would try what I could do—I was making a rush at him, but I was struck violently on the head with some instrument—I cannot swear that he struck me—I was so close within his grasp, and it was done so suddenly, that I was thunderstruck, almost stunned—another scuffle ensued to get me out at the door—there were two other men at least at the door—they tried to get me out at the door, and I was pitched on my head down stairs, which caused concussion of the brain, and great bleeding happened afterwards—the cut is not closed yet—the bone of the head was fractured by some instru<lb/>ment—a jerk of the neck caused the vessels to break, and I lost a great deal of blood—I bled the greater part of the morning on the stairs—I recollect M'Grath hitting me several times, down stairs as well as up stairs—he is the man that stood at the door—I am not positive whether it was M'Grath or Fitsgerald struck me with some instrument—M'Grath was standing at the bed-room door—the door had then been opened with the intention of getting me out, or throwing me down stairs—Fitzgerald is the man who fought me first, and took my purse—my clothes were taken afterwards—I no doubt had my clothes on when I went into the room. I did not go to bed at all—after losing a great quantity of blood I recovered from the sort of faintness in which I had been from the stunning blow I had received, and found I was lying on a flight of steps, very wet and dirty—I raised myself step by step till I came to the first floor door; I tapped at it, but could get no answer—I said if they would fetch a doctor, I would forgive them—however, I received no answer—I pushed the door, went in, and asked them for God's sake to let me only sit or lie down, and I laid till it was near day-light—Fitzgerald then got out of the bed—he was lying with a woman, and on the other side was a woman who is now in the hospital, who had the typhus fever—a more horrid sight could not be—the. woman he was in bed with is not here—after I was robbed he weet out of the house, and returned with some woman, and on that bedstead I asked to lie down till it was light—when I recovered myself on the stairs, on getting up, I found my boots were gone, also my stock, great coat, and hat—I had my trowsers and waistcoat on—I had no under coat—I had but one coat on, and that was taken—it was a tight coat—about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver was also taken, a purse, keys, some little odds and ends, and a silk pocket handkerchief, which was afterwards found—Fitzgerald got up between the lights, after he had been passing the greater part of the night with this woman—he said to me, two or three times over, "You b----why don't you get up?"—I said, "Let me lay, I don't do you any harm;" and I said to the woman, "What is he getting up for?"—the, woman said, "He is only getting up to go to his work at Pimlico; he works at Pimlico basin"—she got up herself about five minutes after he got up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any more of M'Grath in the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He made a most fiendish countenance at me in the outset—I was hit several times on the stair-case—they were in and out all night, but I cannot recollect who the parties were—at last they all left the room except the poor woman ill in bed—some woman came into the room, and I said, "Here is a woman dying; for God's sake, go to the hospital, and get her in"—Bassett was in the room the first part of the night—she did not sleep in the room—I did not see her—I do not think she did—there could have been no place for her to sleep, unless it was on the floor—Bassett was in the room at the time I was beaten and received the blow on my head—she stood back behind the door—Fitzgerald came in as she stood, and she said, "Here he comes"—she knew that he was coming, no doubt—Iam sure she was in the room when I received the blow—I saw a light-haired woman, I cannot positively swear it was Nolan—I cannot say whether that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184304030056"/>
               <p>light-haired woman was in the room at the time I received the blow—she may have slipped out—I was too much agitated in a scene of that kind to pay par<lb/>ticular attention—I remained in the house, I think it must have been till eleven or twelve o'clock—several persons came in in the course of the morning—Bassett sat at the fire, with a child on her knee, with a diseased head—I asked if I could get my great-coat—a dark woman, who is not in custody, told me, if I said a word, they could prove I had broken into the house—after several people coming in, from curiosity, to see if I was still there and still alive, a little boy peeped in—I asked him to fetch me a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which he did immediately—I was covered all over with blood—I had then ventured down stairs, seeing that the house was deserted—everybody had gone out of it—when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came, I walked into the street, across the yard, throught the wet, in my stockings and shirt sleeves—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man came round to me, and gave me a piece of carpet or a horse-cloth to put under my feet, but I put it over my shoulders and head—I was extremely cold, and in a sort of <hi rend="italic">treme</hi>—he drove me home—for two days I was extremely delirious and foolish—I do not believe I was in my proper senses—I went to Mr. Barker, a surgeon, to have my head examined—I could feel that I had a serious wound on my head—I was under medical treatment about three weeks—I was confined to my bed nearly seven weeks—I did not find my handkerchief myself—I have been asked since if a handkerchief corresponded with mine, and I have five or six like it—I compared it with them—I cannot say it is mine except by com<lb/>parison and the pattern—there may be many thousands of the same—it has no mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett.</hi> I never saw the gentleman in my life till next morning; he never gave me any money; I came down next morning with a baby, hearing a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> in the house, and said, "You look very bad, are you the man that fell down the stairs?"—he said, "Yes, but I was very tipsy;" I asked him if I should wash his head. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She had a child on her knee at the fire, but she never spoke one word to me, and she very shortly retired—I have no re<lb/>collection of her offering to wash my head—I do not think she did, but I would not swear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett. Q.</hi> Did I ill-treat you, or take anything belonging to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You instructed Fitzgerald to take the money from my pocket, and said, "Take it all," and he took it all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Grath. Q.</hi> Can you swear positively that I struck you with some weapon outside the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not swear that you did, but one or the other did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald. Q.</hi> What time did the boy peep into the room, as you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say the hour—I think he was the last one that came in to look, just to see if I was there—I have seen him since—he said he lived in the house—it was about half-past eleven o'clock when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man took me away—the boy was not gone for him five minutes, and he took me away directly—I think there were not more than two men <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me up stairs—there was atleast two or three women—there were other men in the house—somebody pushed me behind—whether they were men or women I cannot tell—I presume it was four or five o'clock when you got up—it was nearly getting daylight—the woman you slept with was a young woman—I have seen her since at Queen-square—she got up about five minutes after you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a girl of the town. I live at No. 18, New Tothill-street, Westminster. On the night, between Friday the 10th and Saturday the 11th of Feb. last, I met the prosecutor opposite the Horse Guards about ten o'clock—I never knew him before—I went with him up the Strand to an oyster shop, and then to the Pine Apple, in Hungerford-market—we had</p>

               <p>drink there—we afterwards went to the King's Head, in Orchard-street—we got there about half-past one, or it might be twenty minutes to two in the morning—I saw the two female prisoners there—I did not see the men—I knew the females by sight, by seeing them about Westminster—they were there when I went in with Mr. Prebble, and they joined us—they asked Mr. Prebble to treat them—he said they were a different party, he did not know them—Bassett said if he did not treat them they would <hi rend="italic">muzzle</hi> him, and his <hi rend="italic">Moll</hi> too, and with many words he treated them—when he had treated me with glass of something to drink he came out of the Ring's Head, to the bottom of the steps—Bassett and Nolan followed him out, and asked him if he wanted a room—the gentleman said he would have no objection to going and staying an hour or two with me if I would like to come, and they came down Union-court—that is right opposite Tothill-street—the gentleman and me, and the two women turned down Union-court, one on each side of us—the gentleman was tipsy—I went to turn round to go back again as the gentle<lb/>man refused going into the house, and saw the two male prisoners behind following us down—that was the first time I recollect seeing them that night—I did not see them in the public-house—when I turned round the two men dragged the gentleman into the house, and the two girls dragged me in—Nolan shut and fastened the door—the two men then went up stairs, and Bassett took the gentleman, and helped him up stairs—the two men went up stairs before the gentleman—the gentleman did not appear to be willing to go up stairs—he called out to bring up the young person that was with him, to bring up his lady—Nolan held me in the passage, and told me the room was not convenient for me to go into it—Bassett came down stairs again in about three minutes with a wine glass of something for me to drink—I was still in the passage—she told me to drink that or else I should be sick—I refused it once, but she put it to my mouth, and I drank it—Nolan was in the passage by the side of me holding me up by one arm—I had been drinking a little, but was not tipsy—I drank it because they told me to drink it, or else I should be sick—I was frightened—about two minutes after I had drunk it I found myself quite insensible, and very sleepy—I was not able to support myself—Bassett and Nolan then began to take my clothes off—they untied my cloak first—I was in a helpless state—I was standing with my back against the wall in the passage—no one had hold of me after they gave me the drink—I remained on my feet all the time, but felt very sleepy—Bassett took my cloak off—they took all my clothes from me except my shift—in the morning I found myself lying in the passage in a great pool of water, very wet and only my shift on—my gown was by my side—I had on my shoes and stockings when I went into the house—also a petticoat, bon<lb/>net, and cloak—Bassett said when she took them off, "You little cow, you don't keep these fine clothes"—it was about half-past seven when I awoke—I was very stiff from the bruises, and the ill usage that I had had—I did not hear any disturbance up stairs—I was overpowered by what I had taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what time of night did you see Bassett there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were there the most part of the night, till, I should say, about two o'clock, but I cannot swear positively to the exact time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett. Q.</hi> Did you see me accost any one to ask for anything to drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember your asking to be treated, but I recollect Mr. Prebble treating you with some gin and water—I did not see you with Spillard that I recollect—I do not remember Spillard being there—I heard that she was, but I do not remember seeing her myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Grath. Q.</hi> Did you see me in Mr. Prebble's company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, but you wanted to take two glasses of gin and water into the tap-room with you, and I would not allow you to do so unless you brought the money first, as is our usual custom—I afterwards took the gin and water to Mr. Prebble in the tap-room, and he paid me for it—I cannot say whether you wore a cont that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Grath.</hi> I was drinking there with my sister, and she sent me for the glasses—did not my sister pay for two glasses of gin and water at the bar <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not know his sister—she might have come there, but I did not know her to be his sister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald. Q.</hi> How was I dressed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief, you had a fustian jacket on—whether you had a hat or cap I cannot recollect—I have known you ever since I have been in the house, which is two years next June—you were there about one or two o'clock—you were there before Mr. Prebble came in—I cannot say exactly how long—it might be an hour or so—you were out and in during the time you were there—you did not stops in all the time—I cannot remember when you went away for the last time—it must have been later than between one and two, or about that time—I believe you came and fetched two glasses of gin and water to take in to Mr. Prebble—I did not see you take them to him, but he was the only party drinking gin and water in the tap-room—I did not see where you took it to—Mr. Prebble was in the tap-room, in company with two other men—I thought they were his friends—I went in to advise him to come out, and those parties told me they would take care and see that he was all right—they were strangers to me—you paid for the two glasses of gin and water before you took them away.</p>

               <p>No. 10, Union-court, Orchard-street—Bassett and Nolan lived there at that time—I slept in the second floor back-room—early on the Saturday morning I heard a noise in the house—I was in bed at the time—I had known Bassett for about three weeks, and was able to distinguish her voice—she came down to us in the room, and told us they had a <hi rend="italic">swell</hi> and another young woman in the house, and asked George if he would come up-stairs—two other boys, named George and Robert Cuttle, were in the room—George is about sixteen years old—he put on his clothes and went up-stairs—there is another floor above us—she did not say in what part of the honse the parties were—I know M'Grath—he had been in the house that night, very late, after I had been in bed, but before I heard Bassett's voice, he came to the room where I was in bed, and asked George what business he had with the gentleman's coat, and he took it away from him—that was after the noise, and after Bassett had been to my room—George went up-stairs when Bassett called him, and when he came down he had a coat, a pair of boots, and a hat—he brought them into the room where I and the other boys were sleeping—it was after that that M'Grath came into the room, and asked George what business he had with the gentleman's coat—George did not make any answer, and M'Grath took the coat from him, and took it away—about ten minutes afterwards he came in for the boots, and said the house was going to be searched—I cannot tell the time at all accurately—I saw Nolan in the room that night—I do not know the hour—she brought in a mantle, a bonnet, and a boa, laid them on our bed, and said, "George, will you let these be here till the morning?"—George afterwards took those things away in the morning, and took them up to her—she used to sleep up-stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">M'Grath.

The prisoners know I never saw the woman in my life till I was taken into custody. On the 18th of February two policemen came into my room; they never said what they came about, but began to search my room. I did not know they were policemen. Jane Ingram and Lloyd swore to me and Mary Cain, a young woman who was washing in my room, and said we were the two women that beat the young woman; she directly contradicted him, and told the policeman that belongs to the Westminster division, that she had only been out of prison on the Tuesday; he said he did not think she had been out long; when they took us to the station, Lloyd went over to the fireplace to Ingram, and said, "Swear to the tail one." I asked what they had to swear to me for; they made no answer. Bradley, Mary Cain, and the young man went away all together. The inspector asked me if I knew what I was taken for; he dare say I did—I said I did not; he said, "For robbing that young woman." I said, "Where was she robbed?" he said, "In your place"—I said I knew nothing of it; I heard of John Fitz robbing a young woman at No. 7, Union-court, but I knew nothing of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald's Defence.</hi> Mr. Prebble states, that when he first entered the public-house in Orchard-street, he saw me, M'Grath, the two female prisoners, and Spillard, there all together; that he entered the public-house by himself. I hope you will bear that in mind, and that we applied to him for something to drink, saying we were poor, and out of work, and that he gave us 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get a pot of beer with; that he stopped there about three quarters of an hour, and went out; and as he went out, he was accosted by three women and three men; me, the prisoners, another woman, and another man. He says that Spillard was one of the women, that they enticed him down the court, and we followed him; that he did not like to go into the house; and that Bassett laid hold of the collar of his coat, and dragged him in; that M'Grath and another man shoved him up the stairs into the first floor; he states that he was in the dark till Bassett fetched a light to him, and he said, "I will give you some money to let me go out." The next witness, Spillard, swears that she met him at the Horse Guards at ten o'clock in the evening; it was at one o'clock, he says, that he came to the public-house, in Orchard-street, by himself; she says she accompanied him to an oyster room in the Strand, then to the Pine Apple, in Hungerford-market, and then to the King's Head, in Orchard-street; they called for something to drink there; she states that the two female prisoners induced him to treat them, which he did; but as for me and M'Grath she says she never saw us there; she never saw us till she was at the bottom of the court, when she was about to turn back again from the door of No. 10; she says she met us there, just by the door, and we would not let her go away; she then said the female prisoners came and forced her into the passage, and the gentleman was in the passage all the while; that we went up stairs before the gentleman, and Bassett helped the gentleman up stairs, while Nolan held her in the passage by the arm, with the door shut. The third witness, the gentleman that had the twelve months' imprisonment, then states, that he was coming home at half-past one, and saw the two female prisoners take the gentleman down the court, and then come out and take the female in, and then heard us say, "Make haste, and take him up stairs, and we will be up directly." I hope you will bear in mind that there are three different statements: the boy states nothing at all concerning me; he never saw me; and Jane Ingram states that she saw me and M'Grath come out of the house, one after the other; the gentleman states that he was in the first floor; and two other witnesses state he was in the second pair; when the prosecutor was so much in liquor when he came out of the public-house, why did he go down this court? why not refuse at first? He was intoxicated when he came out of the public-house, and after he got down to the bottom of the court, as he states, he was sober. I do not think a man can be sober when he is out drinking all the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 19, Anchor-street, Bethnal-green, and am a silk-manufacturer. I have known the prisoner about twelve months—he called on me in July last—I cannot recollect the day of the month—he came and said to me, "You are a manufacturer, are not you, Adams?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "And you sell on commission, don't you?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have a piece of black satin, will you take it out, and sell it on commission for me?"—I said, "It is no use taking any goods out, I cannot sell my own; I am obliged to pledge them"—he then said "I shall be very much obliged if you will take and pledge a piece for me"—I said, "I do not like to do such a thing, but if it is your own, I don't mind doing it, where I pledge my own"—I then went with him to his house, in Thomas-street, and he showed me a piece of black satin, on the foot of a bed, wrapped in dressers' paper—the weaver puts silk in thin picking-paper, when his work is finished—it is sent to his employer, and afterwards to the dresser, who puts it into thick paper like parchment—the paper was very much torn—he said he had got some money to make up, to send into the country, and should be much obliged if I would pledge it for him—he carried it down stairs, and walked with me as far as Cottens's, in</p>

I am in partnership with Alexander Duff, and live in Spital-square, in the liberty of Norton-Folgate—we are silk-manufacturers, and have an establishment at Sudbury, Suffolk, as well as in town. I have known the prisoner many years—he was in the habit of weaving silk for us, off and on, during that time, both in the country and London—in July last he was living in London, and came frequently to our warehouse—we were not in need of pawning or selling on commission—the prisoner was a weaver employed by us—last July he worked at his own house, in Thomas-street—he used to have the material in a dyed state, unmanufactured, to weave at home—it was then his duty to bring it home to our warehouse, but he never had the piece in question to manufacture at all—we should send it to the dresser after the waver returned it to us, and the weaver would not have anything more to do with it—the pieces he made never wanted dressing at all—one was velvet and the other serge—I have my book here, which shows that the prisoner was at our warehouse in London on the 7th, 8th, 13th, 15th, and 29th of July—I saw a piece of black satin on the 8th of March at Mr. Cotten's, in Shoreditch, and know it to be our property, by my private mark on it, and the number—it measured eighty-one yards—I am positive it has never been sold—I had missed this very piece, but my stock being very large, I thought it might have been put away with others—I have gone through my book and stock to ascertain this had never been sold—the entries in the book are my son Alexander's—Kendall saw the same piece of satin—he is a dresser—I employ his master—this piece of satin is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was in picking paper at the pawnbroker's—that is a thin paper, used by weavers, not by dressers—it was to cartridge paper, which is called dresser's paper, at our warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Carrington. On the morning of the 10th of March Cranfield and Dare came and asked me to lend them something to break up an old truck they had had given to them—I said I had nothing—they asked me if I would buy it when they had broken it up—I said I could not tell till I saw it—I sell soup, and burn a great deal of wood—I bought the wood in the evening for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I understood they were out of work, and bought it out of charity—they had come to my place two or three times, and said they were out of work—I never bought anything of them before.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Smithfield on Friday afternoon, and met the prisoners—from information, I went to that part of the market where donkeys are generally sold, and saw a pair of wheels lying there, and Jones standing by them—I asked whose wheels they were—nobody would give an answer—I said, "If I don't find an owner, I shall take them to the station, and to the Green-yard"—Jones said, "Why, they were left in my care"—I said, "Who by?"—he said, "By a man"—I said, "Where is he?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "If you had sold them, where should you have found him?"—he said, "Over at that public-house," pointing to it—I said, "Well, you take one wheel, and I will take the other, and we will find the man"—we went into the public-house—he said the party was not there—as we came out, he turned to a party in the bar, and said, "It is all up"—there was a public-house next door—I said, "Perhaps you have made a mistake in the house; perhaps they are here"—we went in, but he could not point any<lb/>body out.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a baker, and lives at Highbury—I was before an alderman last month on a case of my own, respecting some goods which were left me by will—while I was there I saw the prisoners there—I asked a person, who I believe was a friend of the prisoner's mother, what they were brought up to answer for, and I ascertained it was for stealing a parcel from a carrier's cart in Guildhall—I think on Wednesday, the 22nd of March, I was coining through Great Bell-alley, Moorgate-street, at seven o'clock in the evening, and a man about forty ran past me with a parcel, and a boy was after him, crying "Stop thief"—he turned and said, "You won't have me"—I went on, and saw an old woman with a bundle; she was making a remark, that the man had run down Bell-alley, and he had struck her on the cheek—my curiosity led me to follow her, as there was a crowd—I saw her go over to a door and get the parcel, and go with it to a public-house by Guildhall—she said she saw three men, one got in the cart and took the parcel, and gave it to another one—she came out of the public-house in about five minutes without the parcel—she went over to her stall, and I left her there—she had not hold of Smart nor any one then; and Smart was not the one that I saw with the parcel, nor the person that she said struck her, for I described the man to her.</p>

On Monday, the 13th of March, this small gold watch was offered to me by the prisoner about half-past five o'clock in the afterooon—she asked me to lend her 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I asked if it belonged to her—she said no, to her master, Mr. Williams, No. 30, Charterhouse-square—I asked if he gave it her to pledge—she said yes—I asked if he was at home—she said yes—I asked her to come round to the counting-house, and I would go and see him—I went to open the door for her to go in, but she had run away in a different direction—I went after her, and saw her at the bottom of a street turning out of Chiswell-street—she was coining up the street, and on seeing me she turned and ran away—I caught her, brought her back, and gave her in charge—she then said a man had given it her outside, and asked her to pledge it.</p>

I received information, and took the prisoner about two hours afterwards—I told him I wanted him to go with me—he said, "What for?"—I said, "I will tell you presently"—I took him to the prosecutor, and he immediately said he was the man—I then told the prisoner he was charged with stealing a bag of coffee—he said, "What time?"—I said, "About a quarter before eight"—he said he did not come out of his own lodging till past eight—this is the bag and coffee.</p>

On the evening of the 17th of March I wound up some silver wire, and put it on a board where the prisoner and several other hands worked—I saw the prisoner cut a few links off the wire, and he put the rest into his skin, which is used to catch the waste in—some of the girls then asked for some links, and as the prisoner did not bring the wire out I wound up some more, and gave it them—I then sent the prisoner out on an errand; I looked into his skin, and there were the links of wire—when he came back he sat down to his work till ten minutes before eight o'clock—he was then going away—I went to his skin, and the wire was gone—I ran up stairs, and caught him at the street-door—I said, "You have something belonging to me"—I caught hold of his collar—he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out this wire, and dropped it—I called Mrs. Moore, got a light, and found it—this is the wire he dropped on the floor—it is worth about half-a-crown.</p>

About three o'clock, on the 13th of March, I re<lb/>ceived a letter, in consequence of which I watched—I usually sit in my counting-house in the evening, which looks on the workmen's shop—between five and six I saw Barrett look out of the workshop twice—he then came up my yard, walked back again, and then, in a short time, he and Allen came out past my counting-house—I followed them, and asked what they had got in their baskets—they each said, "This is the first time, pray let me off"—they each had a quantity of coal in their baskets—I examined and compared them with my coals—they are exactly similar coals—there is no other coal in London of that sort—it comes from Wakefield.</p>

At this time the prosecutor's daughter was in want of shoes; she applied to one of her father's fellow-sevants for money to buy them, but was refused; I then pledged the silver spoons that her father told me to pledge, and with part of the money I bought her a pair of shoes, and applied the remainder to my own use. When my prosecutor returned from Brighton I told him; he said I had done quite right, that he was very much obliged to me, and I might pay him when I was able, what I had made use of for myself. I went to see him at Guy's-hospital; on one occasion he gave me the keys of his chest and box, and said that I might take anything I wanted and pledge until I got into work; at this time he was indebted to me for the making of two suits of clothes for his son, and always when I went to see him at the hospital I took him money, tea, sugar, butter, &amp;c, besides paying washing, out of the money I got by pledging his property. I asked him for the loan of a suit of clothes and other articles; he said I might take anything I wanted; this suit of clothes, &amp;c, I had on when taken, and what I pledged was not with the least intention to rob or defraud him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a livery-stable keeper, in Red Lion-street, White-chapel. The prisoner was in my employ for five or six weeks before the 14th of March—I sent him to the roof of the stable to clear the snow off—he did not say anything when he came down, but when the snow was gone the wet came in, which it had not before—I then sent him up a second time, and said he must have removed something—I afterwards went up myself, and found the lead was off from under the sky-lights—I came down and told him it was not surprising that the wet came in, when some one had been stripping the lead from the sky-lights—it appeared to be gone from ten or eleven sky-lights—the policeman afterwards stopped the prisoner with some lead—I have not examined it—I am a tenant at will of those premises under Mrs. Margaret Craven and others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. A little before nine o'clock that evening I was in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove—I saw the prisoner with something bulky under his coat—I stopped him and said, "Harper, what have you got here?"—he said, "Nothing but clothes, belonging to my sister"—I pulled this print from under his coat, and said, "You must come with me"—he said, "Let me go; I will walk along with you"—I did not let him go—he walked a few yards and then struck me in the face, kicked me violently, called for assistance, and got from me—I sprung my rattle—it was a very foggy evening, and he got away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 124.) On Sunday evening, the 19th of March, my attention was attracted to a house, No. 2, Bedfordbury, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-fields—some bricks had fallen from the cornice-work—on the following Monday I went and examined the state of the lead, it was coiled up when I first saw it, but would require cutting before it could be taken away, and the place where the lead had been was vacant—I saw the prisoner at the window—he was within reach of this lead—I went round my beat, and returned about twenty minutes past six o'clock—I then noticed that the lead was beaten out, and flattened down to its place—I came again at half-past seven o'clock—I saw a truck, and the prisoner brought a barrel out of the house, put it into the truck, and pushed the truck round to King William-street, from the front of the house, and left it there—I looked at it, and found the barrel contained some lead—it was much heavier lead than that which I had noticed before—I then saw the prisoner at the barrel—I asked him what he had there—he said "Nothing, it is my own pro<lb/>perty"—I was not satisfied, and took him to the station—I went back to the house, went on the roof, and found the dormer had been stripped of lead—the cornice was left as it was—there were four nail-holes in the lead.</p>

At four o'clock in the morning of this day, I saw the prosecutor with sergeant Brook, who could not understand him—in consequence of what he told me in his own language, I went to his house—he gave a description of two women—I knew them—I found Sweeny at Skipper's public-house about six in the morning—the pro-secutor recognized her directly as one who had robbed him—I told her he accused her of stealing his snuff-box and shirts—she said she knew nothing about it—she said she had been in the room and supped there, and he made them drunk—I took her to No. 6, Blue Anchor-yard to see after M'Carthy—I stood at the door with Sweeny while the other officer and the prosecutor went in—he found the shirts and snuff-box—the prosecutor said, "They are my shirts," and on unfolding one of them, the snuff-box was in it—I went to the watch-house with Sweeny and the property—I went back to look for the other prisoner, between seven and eight o'clock—Murray knocked at the door, and M'Carthy came out of the back part of the house, partly undressed—I took her as she was going into an opposite house—she said she was drunk, and had no recollection of any thing of the kind.</p>

On the 2nd of Feb. the prisoner came to me for a lodging, as I had a bill in my window—in a few minutes the person came in who lives in my first floor, and it was agreed that the prisoner should lodge with her, and pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for board and lodg<lb/>ing—she then asked me to recommend a man to fetch her boxes from the Commercial Club-house at the back of the Bank—I called a man—she agreed to give him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he was to fetch them at six o'clock in the even<lb/>ing—he came, and asked if she was ready—she said, "Yes," and she asked me to let my little niece go with her—I said she might, and she did—her name is Mary Matilda Ebdon—she had a cloak, a pinafore, and a handker<lb/>chief on, which were her own property—I bought them and gave them to her—her father is dead, and her mother is 160 miles off—I gave her these things for herself—the man came back at eight o'clock and said he could not find them—the child could not find her way back to Bride-lane—she got to her aunt's at Clerkenwell at one o'clock in the morning, and had not these things then.</p>

The prisoner lives next door to me—last Thursday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw him in the barrack yard fronting his father's house, with a lightish-coloured cap on his head—I looked at it—it appeared to me to be the cap now produced—it was similar to it—when he saw me he took the cap off, and put it under his arm.</p>

On the 4th of March I received information, and went after the prisoners—I overtook Fillmore and another girl at Rochester—I told Fillmore she was charged with robbing a captain of a considerable sum of money—they both began to cry—Fillmore said she should not have robbed the captain, if it had not been for somebody else, that she held the candle while the other person robbed the man, and she had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money—I found in her hand a purse and six sovereigns—I went back, and found Wilmot had absconded from Woolwich—I afterwards apprehended her at Greenwich—I told her she was charged with being concerned with robbing the captain at Woolwich—she said, "Oh, my G—d."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Lord Duncan, Broadway, Deptford. About seven o'clock in the evening, on the 17th of March, I heard a scuffle in my tap room—I saw the prisoner and another man putting the prosecutor on the bench in the tap room—I do not know whether the other man was Wilson—I asked the prisoner why he brought the drunken sailor into my house—he said he had been directed by him to do it, he had been paid off at Chatham, he was directed to leave him there, and he could not take him any further—I said I should not allow him to leave him, unless he gave me a satis<lb/>factory account about him—I asked the prisoner if he was paid—he said he was, and he knew the prosecutor very well—he said, in the course of conversa<lb/>tion, that he belonged to Blackwall, and he was going there, but he was directed to put the prosecutor down there—I said that unless he gave me a satisfac<lb/>tory account of his employer and himself I should not let him leave him, and he did so very willingly—I then asked him to hold the prosecutor up while</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184304030198"/>
               <p>I searched his pockets—he said he believed the prosecutor had got money, and he hoped I would take care of it—he said he thought it was in his bosom; that he heard it rattle—he then held him up, and I noticed that the bosom of the prosecutor's shirt was open; and I made an observation that I was sure he had been wrongly dealt with, from the appearance of his shirt being rumpled—I then saw a string, and found a small leather bag round the pro<lb/>secutor's neck, and the bag had been torn down—a sovereign was hanging out of it, and one sovereign was at the bottom of it—I said, "Here is further proof that the man has been robbed"—I said it seemed unreasonable for him to put his cash in such a purse as that, and I was sure he had been wrongly dealt with—the prisoner said it was impossible, for there had been no one in the fly but himself, or "ourselves"—I found a half-crown in the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers in his jacket pocket—he was in a very helpless state; he could not sit on his seat—I saw the key of a watch hang<lb/>ing at the back of his trowsers, and found the watch attached to it—the pri<lb/>soner was then gone—he went away after he gave me the address, and said he should be there the next day with some more sailors, as there was another ship to be paid off—after I had searched the prosecutor the prisoner said, "Now you have searched the sailor, I should rather you searched me"—I said, "No, there is no occasion for that"—he showed me a shilling, a penny or three halfpence, and said that was all the money he had about him—he asked me particularly to take care of him, as he knew him very well, and had known him for years—he gave me his own name and address, and his em<lb/>ployer's, and the sailor's, and where the sailor would be going when he got sober—about midnight the prosecutor came to—I had kept him by himself entirely—I took his bag, and after he got sober he directed me to look in it, and I found six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in it—on the Sunday following the prisoner called in with another one, who I understood was his driver, who drove the van and drove Miller up—he asked me if I had seen any thing of the sailor—I said I had, and he was still with us—I told him the sailor had been robbed, and his complaint was that he had been robbed in the van—he said it was impossible—he did not stay—he said he was in a hurry to go, as his horse wanted to go back—he said he would call the next day and hear further about it—I told him we had found the watch which we had searched for before he left.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 18th of March, I got up about half-past five o'clock—there is a gate before my father's premises—as I stand there I can see Mr. Arnold's premises—I live adjoining them—about half-past five o'clock I was at my father's gate, and saw Cruttenden there with a van and the prisoners—I knew Isaacs before, and have often seen him—Lewis was helping him up at the top crane—Isaacs remained inside the warehouse while Lewis lowered the rags down on the crane into the van—I saw Isaacs helping Lewis with the crane—it winds inside, and wants steering outside to drop the goods into the van—Isaacs did not come out at all—he remained inside, but I had a clear view of him, and am certain it was him—the van went away about half-past six o'clock full of rags—after it was loaded Lewis jumped into the van, and it went up the Maze—I saw nothing more of Isaacs—I cannot tell how he got out—I directly told my mother what I had seen, and that I knew the persons—before I left I tried the premises—I pushed the half-batch door on the ground-floor, and found it was open, it was closed but not fastened—it gave when I pushed it—it was not fast within—there was none of Mr. Arnold's men there.</p>

I know Isaacs well—on Friday, the 17th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I left my employer's premises—I met the prisoners and another party—the two went on before, and I got into conversation with Isaacs—he was talking about the badness of his business, the depression of trade, and several other matters, which I cannot exactly re<lb/>collect—he did not mention the name of Arnold—he mentioned the name of <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>—he said, "I should" or "would you like to have a load of <hi rend="italic">Teddy's</hi> fines"—I did not know what he meant at first—I took it to be equivalent to what he had done before with Arnold, getting some of his goods, and not paying for them—I did not know what he meant till I heard of the robbery—there are certain rags called <hi rend="italic">fines</hi>—I have been in the rag line, and was brought up to it from my boyhood—I did not make any answer—there was nothing tran<lb/>spired, except I said, "You will be getting yourself transported for life"—I think I said so afterwards.</p>

               <p>1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day according to her bill—on the 22nd of June he received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Goss, and that was inserted in the book after it was made up can tell so by the addition—after the shilling was inserted the addition was incorrect—the books were generally kept by a clerk—on the 22nd of June there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Goss, which was not accounted for—the amount was 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the book including that was 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—on the 2nd of Nov. there was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. short from Mrs. Moore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did the prisoner come into your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the end of 1839—he came on trial first, and then he became my ap<lb/>prentice—I had a partner named Thomas Hutchinson—we have dissolved partnership—he is alive and well, I believe—we ceased to be partners on the 19th of last April—I have understood that would be an end of the prisoner's apprenticeship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner talk of leaving you after he was free? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I first gave him warning about a fortnight prior to his giving me warning to leave, which was in Feb.—I did not induce him to stay by offering to raise his wages—I will not swear I did not—he may have made two journies in a week, and sometimes one, after these customers—the number of distinct per<lb/>sons he would have to call on would depend on the number we have—he would have to call on forty, fifty, or sixty in a day—he might probably on a Monday have to call on two hundred, to collect these sums of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has it not happened sometimes that the prisoner has paid an excess of money from what he has received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not on these days—it is very pro<lb/>bable that sometimes he might have paid more than he received—such a thing might happen as that, out of these two or three hundred items—he has omitted to put down the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in one column, but has put it to another person, and that would account for the excess—the columns in this book represent customers—this book lasts six months—here are different columns, in which the entries ought to be made—such a thing might have happened that the entries have been made the next day, but it was unknown to me—I do not recollect your putting to me at the office an enormous number that had got under the wrong head—I had not time to examine this book every night—it has been left to my clerk—the prisoner might have paid me sixpence on the 26th of May—I will not venture to swear ha did not pay me the sixpence—I generally received the money at night; if not, the first thing in the morning—I have an account of the money I received—I do not enter every night myself what money I receive from each; but if not, I do it in the morn<lb/>ing—sometimes it is done by the clerk—there were three examinations of this case before Mr. Trail, the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he tell you his opinion, when you had gone throngh the whole case the last time, that it was a matter of mistake? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No sir, I do not re<lb/>collect his expressing that as his opinion—I do not recollect that he gave me his opinion—he took a great deal of trouble to look over the book with me—I think I gave the prisoner warning about Feb., 1843—he left me about the middle of the month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you detain his boxes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, sir—boxes he had none, sir—I never saw his boxes—I detained some things of his, I cannot tell what they were in or what the things were—I considered I had reason to detain them—when I came home at night from collecting, there were some parcels for him to take out, and he said he would not take them out for me or any other person—he had given me warning to leave, and wanted to leave directly—he at the same time asked for his wages—I said I should go through his books</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184304030209"/>
               <p>and examine his accounts—that was my reason for detaining his goods—he made application to me afterwards for them, and I was summoned to Union-hall—he made application to me again, in presence of his father—the first time I saw him, after he insisted on leaving me—I met him in Blackman-street—I met the prisoner at the Bull's Head, Camberwell, a month ago, last Thursday—he was in company with his father—Mr. and Mrs. Pounsford were there—the prisoner then again applied to me for his wages—that was the time I spoke of, and I said he had been receiving monies, and not accounting for them—I might probably say, "You have been robbing me"—he said, "Why don't you take me up, and prefer a charge against me, if you have any?"—I know he was at that time living at Messrs. Milson and Coats', who are in my line of business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever got in any trouble yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never shut my<lb/>self up from the gaze of this world for a short time, that I know of—I know Mr. Martin very well—I was in his service once, along with a person named Piper—Mr. Martin and I had a fall out—I never fell into a cellar, nor shut myself up—I never knew that there was a charge, and the police were after me—I never shut myself up—I know a person named Flight—I was never locked up in his house, nor in Bosier's house—I lived with Mr. Martin eight years—an old man came into his service, we had a quarrel, and I left—I never stopped in Bosier's house—I never lived in his house for three weeks, nor for three hours—I lived with Mr. Martin eight years, and left him—he sent for me to come back, with an advance of salary—I went back, and stopped some time after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now from the 9th of March, when you charged the prisoner at the Bull's Head with his accounts being wrong, did you do anything to take proceedings against him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—on the 14th I received a letter from a solicitor, that legal proceedings would be taken against me, unless I paid the prisoner's wages on or before the 16th, but I did not take notice of the letter—I think it was not on the 16th that I had the prisoner taken into custody on this charge, but I will not swear it was not.</p>

WYLDE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My friend took a deal of trouble to convince the Ma<lb/>gistrate of his view of the case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I and Mr. Martin had a quarrel—I left him, and he induced me to go back at a larger salary—I returned, and had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week additional—and more than that, I am doing business for him now—a mistake might happen in the columns—I never heard from the prisoner that he had made a mistake—I had to look over a great number of accounts before I found out these defalcations.</p>
