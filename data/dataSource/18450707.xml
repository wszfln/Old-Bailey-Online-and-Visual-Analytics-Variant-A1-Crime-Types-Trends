On Thursday, the 29th of May, the day on which the dressing-case was lost, Mrs. Tiggell was at work during that day—she came about twelve o'clock and went about ten—Bridget Richardson came to the house twice that day—the first time I saw her was about two or three o'clock, and Mrs. Tiggell sent down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a key to her—she had no opportunity of going into the room where the dressing-case was at that time—the second time I saw her was about ten o'clock, a few minutes before Mrs. Tiggell left—I am quite certain that she came that evening—I do not think she came further than the commencement of the passage on the second occasion—I do not know whether she went up into the bed-room, for I left her—I did not leave her in company with Tiggell—Tiggell was in the kitchen—I went down to her to tell her her sister was there, and she went up immediately.</p>

I am the grandfather of the deceased George Chalk, and the father of the prisoner—I was in the brick-field on Wednesday, the 6th of June, between twelve and one o'clock—the prisoner and the deceased were there—I was standing at work and heard the boy cry oat—I turned round and saw him on the ground—the prisoner stood over him with his hand up, but he never struck a blow while I saw him—I had seen the boy not two minutes before, standing behind me, and asked him to go and fetch a bottle of water—he said he would not—his sister asked him to fetch a barrow of sand—he made no answer, and would not—his father stood pretty close to him, and when I turned round he was on the ground, and the prisoner over him with his hand up as if going to strike him—it was his open hand, not his fist—I did not see him strike—the boy immediately flew away ten or twelve yards, and said, "I will have no more of it, I am off for good now"—I taw him again next morning—he came to his work at nine o'clock—he was very well in health, and went to his work directly—he remained at work all day in the field till between till and seven o'clock at night—about six or seven on Saturday evening he complained of the belly-ache—he said, "I very often hare it, I will go and stand on my head, that cures me"—he went and stood on hit head, but it did not cure him—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get some gin and peppermint—he had it, and after a time he turned very sick—he went to the hospital on the Wednesday following the 11th—he had been very bad till then, and complained of his bowels—he died on the Sunday weak following, at five o'clock in the evening.</p>

On the 18th of June Mrs. Warren was brought there with a wound in her throat, such as might be inflicted with a knife like this—it was not very deep—it slightly wounded the left trachea—it might have been about two inches and a half long, and about three quarters of an inch deep—I saw the pri<lb/>soner—he was wounded in about eight or nine places in the throat, only through the integuments.</p>

It so happens that I have no money in Mrs. Rogers's hands. We have managed to make up 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least we will do so, and I have sent to ask you if you will stand our friend once more by sending up a sovereign by return of post, and I will repay you again by post in the course of next week. If you send it to me do it by return of post, as I have a man in possession, which runs up 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, expenses. Excuse us saying any more, as I am almost too late for the post. We send our love, &amp;c. Please direct the letter to Mr. E. Cooper, at Mr. Jackson's, 82, Friar-street, Blackfriars-road, London"—dated 4th June, post-mark 5th June)—in con<lb/>sequence of receiving this letter I went to the post-office at Hadleigh and procured a post-office order for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it—I enclosed it in a letter addressed as requested in the letter—I sealed it, paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put it in the post-office myself—I never heard from my son, acknowledging the receipt, I wrote again to another place, where he had lived, and this was dis<lb/>covered.</p>

I am a widow, and keep the Black Horse public-home, in Petticoat-lane, Aldgate—the prisoner, Twohy, was in the habit of coming to my house almost every day from the 17th of March up to the 31st of May—he never lodged in my house—he offered me marriage, and said he would not go out without I gave him an answer—I said, "You go away to-night, and I will inquire after your character," and next day I told him I refused his offer—he said he would have my life if I would not marry him—he frequently said that I had robbed him of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I had slept with him, and kept him in my arms day and night for six weeks—that was not true—the last time I gave him his answer he said he would give me a worse death than Jane Shore's—in consequence of those threats I went before the Lord Mayor on the 30th of May, and bound him to keep the peace towards me—he got bail on that day—I heard that O'Brien was one of his bail, but I was not there—on Saturday, the 31st of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, Leonard and O'Brien came into my house accompa<lb/>nied by a tall female—Leonard and O'Brien went into the parlour, and the female went iuto the yard—the parlour is to the right, the tap-room to the left, and the bar in the centre—from the bar I can command a view of both the rooms by leaving the doors open—O'Brien came out of the parlour again before he could hardly have sat down, and asked me to light the gas—I said, "Mr. O'Brien, I do not allow females in the parlour"—the female</p>

On the evening of the 31st of May I remember Mrs. Reeng complaining of a smell of gas—I went towards the parlour to assist her to stop it—when I got to the parlour door it exploded, threw me down, and scorched me—I saw Mrs. Reeng standing at the table putting a cork in the broken part of the pipe—I could not see any fire—it came so suddenly—I had seen O'Brien and Leonard in the house that evening standing by the parloar ddor—I did not see them go into the parlour.</p>

I produced these five handkerchiefs—I have not produced-the whole twenty-two, because there was nothing said about the others-they were all pawned at our house together, on the 18th of Feb., by the prisoner, in the name of Thomas Jones, No. 10, Wardour-street, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I purchased some silk handkerchiefs of a seafaring man, in a blue jacket and trowsers—I asked him if he wanted to buy clothes—he gave no answer at first—I then said, "Have you any thing to sell or exchange?"—he came into the shop, and said, "I want a suit of clothes; will you take handker<lb/>chiefs in exchange?"—I said I would take anything in exchange that I could get anything by—he then showed me twenty-two handker-chiefs, and selected a suit of clothes, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-piece for the handkerchiefs—they came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, which I got from Mrs. Barnett—Mr. Barnett was not at home then—when he came home I gave him the handkerchiefs, and gave him the tickets which came off the clothes that I had sold to the sailor—I do not know whether there was a distress put into Mr. Barnett's house that day—I cannot say whether these handkerchiefs produced were amongst those I bought—there were some of this pattern, and some different patterns—I counted them—they were of this description and appearance, and some were of this pattern—I gave them to Mr. Barnett directly.</p>

I know the prisoner—I always understood he was a parasol maker—he has a place in, I think, Camomile-street—I have dealt with him two or three times this season, and have dealt with him before for years—I went to his house on Saturday, the 7th of June, and bargained for three dozen parasols, for which I was to pay 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per dozen—I brought away one dozen, and the others were to be brought to me on the following Monday—he brought them with him on Monday-*—we disagreed about them—it is usual to pay at the end of the month—I nave always done so with him—I did not pay for them—he wished to be paid directly—I paid him for the dozen I had had, and he took the other two dozen away—an officer came to my shop soon after (about five o'clock that day)—I gave him, I think, eight of the parasols I had bought of the prisoner—four were sold—I had been in the habit of buying parasols of Mr. Hargreaves, of Wood-street—I saw Mr. Hargreaves in the course of that Monday, and showed him the parasols—he made some observation about them, and kept one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Evans and Colley, of Cripple gate-buildings, and am the brother of William Evans—he has one partner—they are parasol and umbrella-makers, and have been established about three years. On Monday, the 9th of June, I saw Mr. Hargreaves—he showed me a parasol, which I recognised as one belonging to our firm—in consequence of what he said I got a policeman, and then went to Mr. Rotherham's, some time that afternoon—Blundell and another officer were with me—I took possession of eight parasols, which were given to me, and which I recognised as belonging to Evans and Co.—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—this is the one I received from Mr. Hargreaves, and these eight I received from Mr. Rotherhara—I afterwards went to Stagg and Mantle's, and received twenty-one parasols there, which are our make, and have our private mark on them—I can swear they have never been sold by us, because this is a class of goods that we never fit up in this sort of way—they are fitted up in a more common way than such parasols of our make are, both the tops and bottoms are—these fittings were never done in our house—that enables me to state they were never sold from our place—the whole of them are given out to women to cover, which is putting the silk on the frames—Mrs. Butler was not employed to cut them out—they were cut out, and sent in dozens for her to give them out—they are cut from large pieces of silk of 100 yards length or more, and tied up in dozens to be given out—an account is kept of them in the books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a dozen to be partly cut out, and you get to the end of one piece of silk, do you finish the dozen by beginning another piece? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is not at all probable that there can be more than two patterns in one dozen parasols—it is not likely—there are eight patterns in these thirty parasols—after receiving them, in consequence of what I learnt, we went into the prisoner's neighbourhood, and ascertained that he was not at home—we waited outside, but did not see him that day—we were there next morning, about eight o'clock, and about ten in the morning I stood at the corner of Camomile-street, and saw him and his son coming across Bishopsgate-street—they saw me, and came up to me—his son-in-law addressed me, and said, "Mr. Evans, I want to see you, if you will come with me to Mr. Barnard's house we will explain this matter to your satis<lb/>faction"—I went in, and the officer followed me—Mr. Barnard then entered, and explained that Palmer worked for him and for us, and that two dozen of work that she received about three weeks before from us, she had brought to him by mistake, and that the two dozen which she had received from him she had brought to us, and they had been received by us in mistake—I then asked him if she had ever made such a mistake before—he said, "Never before, never, but in this instance of the two dozen," and then, after some hesitation, he said, "She might have done so"—he said he told her of it at the time, and she said, "If this is not your work, I must have taken your work in to the other shop"—I proposed that Palmer should be sent for, and proposed to go with Milligan, the son-in-law, to her, to which he disputed, saying, "I will send for her," or "fetch her," and he left the room—I staid a few minutes, and left in about five minutes after—Milligan</p>

               <p>had previously said, "I hope this explanation is to your satis<lb/>faction"—I said it was not to mine, and I supposed it was not to the offi<lb/>cers'—one of them said "No, I shall take Mr. Barnard into custody"—I did not go to the station—I went in search of Palmer, but could not find her—I went to the station, and found her in custody there—she gave the same account that Barnard and Milligan had, that all she had got to say was that she had brought the wrong work in—when the work comes into our warehouse, every dozen passes through my hands after it goes from the woman who takes the work in from the other women—I never detected any other goods than our own coming into our stock, nor is it pos<lb/>sible that a dozen of other goods could come into our stock, or I should bare been sure to have detected it—here are two qualities of goods—the average price would be about 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—they would cost us that to make.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness. I know the prisoner—I saw him at my lodging, at Finsbury, where I lived when this matter happened—my daughter Charlotte lived there with me, no other daughter—I have another daughter—I remember the Tuesday my daughter was taken to the station—the prisoner had been at our lodging, I think, about a month or three weeks before that—that was the last time before the Tuesday—he did not take anything from the lodging that day; but a month previous, when he called at my Charlotte's, and said there had been an exchange of work.</p>

               <p>been brought there by my daughter Charlotte—I told him, before he took them away, that Mrs. Butler had sent a dozen of work out, and there they stood in the corner, if he thought proper to buy them—I had seen Mrs. Butler on the Friday before, and had some conversation with her about parasols—I told the prisoner what passed—I told him Mrs. Butler had sent a dozen of work, and there they were in the corner, if he liked to buy them—he pulled one out, and said, "I will give you 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the dozen"—I said, "You can do as you think proper"—the money was put down on my table—I put it on the mantelpiece, and it was given to Mrs. Butler—those parasols were unmade—I had not any conversation with him before that about parasols from Evans and Co.—he has not been at my lodging more than twice since Whitsuntide, for me to see him, but he has been there several times, as I have heard—he took one dozen of parasols from my place afterwards—they had been brought by Charlotte—I told him then there was a dozen, if he liked to buy them—he gave 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, I cannot exactly say which.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were any of those he took away at any time sent to your place tobe made up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—two dozen, he fetched them avray one day, I can<lb/>not tell when—it was since Whitsuntide certainly—I cannot say whether they were the same kind as those now produced—they were brown silk like these, and finished in all respects, except the top and bottom knobs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. On the afternoon of the 15th of June I left an omnibus at Westminster-bridge—I took out my purse, paid my fare, and then put my purse into my outside coat pocket—I then went to the pier on the Westminster side, where there were a great many people waiting for the steam-boat—when the steam-boat came I went on board—there was great pushing and crowd<lb/>ing both on the steam-boat and on the pier—I observed the prisoner stand<lb/>ing close by my right side—he was pushing very violently—I turned to expostulate witri him, and saw my purse in his hand—I accused him of having taken it—he replied he had not done so, and if he had it must be on his person—I watched him—we went as far as Chelsea, and there I gave him into custody—I know it was my purse I saw in his hand, because it was covered with steel beads, and it glistened in the sun—it was made of brown silk—there were four sovereigns in it, one half sovereign, and five or six shillings in silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Uppingdale; we live at No. 16, South-place, Lower-road—it is our dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. On the 28th of March I sent for the prisoner, whom I did not know before, but she was recommended to me, as I was without a servant—she was to stop with me two or three weeki, till I was suited, or she was called away—she came about eleven o'clock—she complained of the toothache in the course of the day, and at a quarter before seven she said she would go and have her tooth drawn—she left, and as she was going out at the door she said she would not be any longer than she could help—she did not return, and about twelve o'clock that night I observed my keys lying on the drawers in my bed-room—I usually kept them in my pocket, but I had not put on the same dress that morning which I had worn the day before—I had left them by mistake in the pocket of that dress upstairs—I had thought of them in the morning, and had sent my little girl up stairs for them whilst the prisoner was there, but she could not find them—I kept my drawers locked, and there was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse in the drawer—I had seen it safe a few hours before—I unlocked the drawer where the money had been—I found it locked as I had left it, but the purse and money were gone—to the best of my know<lb/>ledge there had been five sovereigns, thirty half-crowns, and one or two shillings in it—I misled it directly I opened the drawer—next morning I missed a shawl, a small pair of trowsers, and a brooch—I think the trow<lb/>ers had been in the bed-room—the brooch was in a looking-glass drawer in the same room where the drawers were, and the shawl in a large chest in the same room—they were all my husband's—the shawl was worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the brooch 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the money was in a steel purse lined with blue silk—the prisoner had asked me what she should do, and I said, "You had better go up stairs and clean the bed-room," and I saw her there.</p>

I have a house which is unoccupied, at No. 28, in that row—I heard a noise in it between twelve and one o'clock on the 16th of June—I went in—the prisoner came down stairs into the passage, and asked me the rent of the house—I told him it was more than he could pay, and that he had been taking the locks off the doors—he said I had better go up stairs and see—he wanted to go away, but I made him go up stairs with me, and saw that two locks had been taken off two of the doors on the first floor—he instantly ran up into the attic, and when he got there I heard a noise as if he was throwing things down as quick as he cauld—I ran down and got a person to assist me—when we went up the prisoner came down to the bed-room floor—his pockets were hanging out, and he said, "I have got nothing about me"—I said we would see—I pushed him into the bed-room, and was about to leave him there, when he jumped out of the window, a height of about twenty feet—I found these locks, which be<lb/>longed to the bed-room floor, in the attic from whence the prisoner came.</p>

I am in partnership with my brother, John—tfe live at No. 135, Aldersgate-street, and are ink raanufacturert—both the prisoners have been in our employment—Harding was so till about three weeks ago, as under warehouseman and packer—it is neatly fivt years since Cooke left our employ as out-door porter—we have missed various articles for a length of time—we missed ink-powders about the 24th of Feb.—we did not miss any oxyde of iron or labels—we do not keep the oxyde of iron in very large quantities, two or three hundred weight—we keep the labels in the warehouse, wrapped up in paper and marked at the end in large quantities, from fifty to a hundred thousand—we could not possibly miss them—in consequence of information I applied for a warrant to search Cooke's premises—I was present when they were searched, on Tuesday, the 16th or 17th of Feb.—Harding was still in our employ—I sent for him from the warehouse to the counting-house—I said, "I am very sorry, John, to see you in such a situation, we have a very serious charge against you, it is not an affair of yesterday; I am afraid you have been robbing us for years,"and in order that I might be correct I would read from this paper that was then lying before me.</p>

Look at the paper and read from it what you said to him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said, "On the 15th of Jan. you took from our ware-house three quart bottles of red ink, and deposited them at Cooke's; on the 24th of Feb. you took from our ware-house 10lbs. of oxyde of copperas or iron, and you also got Bud gin, who is in our employment, to assist Cooke in making ink-powders; and the worst of all is, that not content with</p>

               <p>taking these articles from our warehouse, you also took labels, and took them to Cooke's, and he has put out a spurious article and labelled them with our labels, and six dozen of this ink was sold to Mr. Levy"—these que<lb/>ries were brought to our warehouse in the paper drawn up by Mr. Wontner—I said, "What have you now, John, to say to this statement?"—he said, "I am very sorry for what I have done, I wish I could undo what I have done; I have been the dupe of a designing man"—I said, "You knew Cooke well, you ought to have avoided his company; but is this statement true or false? you must know whether it is true or not"—he waited a little while, and I again said, "Is it true?"—he then looked at the paper again and said, "Well, sir, it is nearly all true, it may not be quite."—I had not held out any expectation that it would be better for him to tell me—I then said, "How could all this happen?"—he said, "Cooke first led me into it, and then he said if I did not bring him what he wanted he would tell my master of it"—I then gave him into custody—I had been to Cooke's house before this, and was there when Wardle, the officer, searched it—there were some packets of ink-powder found there, a bag containing oxyde of iron, and some marking-ink—I saw some ink-powders found there in large pound packets, and I said to Cooke, "Where did you get the mould to make these ink-powders? you know they could not be made without a mould"—he said, "You may search where you please"—we searched, but no mould was found—there was a bag found with about ten or twelve pounds of copperas—it is exactly similar to the copperas that we are in the habit of using to make ink-powders and ink.</p>

                  </hi>. I came to London on the 19th of last August—I came to Cooke's house, and went to work for him on the morrow—he had asked me to come—he came from Kings Stanley, in Gloucestershire, where I came from, and I knew him there—before I came to London I had fol<lb/>lowed the business of a painter for the last four years—when I came from the country I went straight to Cooke's house to live—I and my wife had the top of his house—he told me I was to assist him generally—he carried on the trade of an ink-manufacturer at No. 22, New-street, Cloth-fair—that is very near Aldersgate-street—after I had been there some time I observed Harding frequently came to Cooke's premises—I did not at first know where he came from, but I found out at last that he came from Mr. Arnold's—I cannot say whether I heard it from himself or from Cooke—I was sent by Cooke to stay at the bottom of the gateway, in Al<lb/>dersgate-street, till I saw the young man that I frequently saw come to Cooke's house, and to tell him that Cooke wanted him—there is a court leads out of New-street into Aldersgate-strect, and that was where I was to go—Cooke gave me directions where to go and stand by the corner of the</p>

               <p>gateway—I was not to go any further than where he desired me to go—Mr. Arnold lived about 100 yards from where I was told to stand—Cooke said Harding generally passed that way to his meals—he told me not to go near to Mr. Arnold's, but to stand where he told me—I do not recol<lb/>lect whether that direction was given me the first time or not, nor whether I saw Harding the first time I went or not—I sometimes saw him on those occasions—I was sent to stand there ten or twelve times—I went to Cooke's in Aug.—I saw Harding come there several times before Christ<lb/>mas—I saw him many times before the 24th of Feb.—he frequently came—I recollect on one occasion, before Christmas, he brought two half-gross of ink-powders—they were not such as have been since found at Cooke's—they were black ink-powders, but were small ones—he brought them in the evening under his right arm—he had a latch-key, and let himself in, as he frequently did at other times—Cooke was out when Harding brought the ink-powders—they were put into the counting-house—I do not recol<lb/>lect Cooke coming home, but next morning I saw the ink-powders on the same board in the counting-house—they were taken out of the papers and labels that they were in, and were then lying loose—they had been packed' up when I saw them come—they were in labels that had Mr. Arnold's address on when I first saw them—I am sure of that, and they were taken out of the labels when I saw them the next morning—Cooke had been at home, and had been into the counting-house—in Jan. three quart bottles of red ink were brought by Harding—they had Mr. Arnold's name and seal on them—I very well recollect the 24th of Feb.—we had an order for ink-powders—Harding came at dinner-time, and brought in something in his leathern apron, which is used in the ink-powders; oxyde of copperas, I believe it was—Cooke asked him to-get a young man to come and show me how to make ink-powders—Harding said he did not think he could get him to come—Cooke said, "Try; tell him I will give him plenty of beer"—Harding took what he had brought into the counting-house, and put it on the floor—I afterwards saw it was oxyde of copperas—it was whitish brown colour, similar to this that is produced—it ii sometimes called oxyde of iron, and I have heard it called white copperas—there was about ten pounds of it, as far as my judgment goes—there was no mark on that, but it was brought by Harding in his apron—whether there was anything else in his apron I cannot tell—I did not see whether there was or not—his apron was tied on, and he had the bottom part of it held up—some time after that Paddock told me to come tip stain—he said he had been finding some of Mr. Arnold's labels—he had them on the table in the first floor—I saw them—I should say there was about two gross of them—I took one sheet which bad four labels on it, and gave it to Mr. John Arnold—I saw it produced again at the police-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames-police. On the night of the 8th of July, about half-past eleven o'clock, in conse<lb/>quence of information, I went on board the barque John Laird, which was lying in the London Dock—I saw Oxburgh in the Captain's state room—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "I belong to the vessel, and am going to sleep here"—I said, "You are not going to sleep here, for there is no bed; do you know anything of any brandy being stolen from the vessel?"—he said there were two lads on board the vessel when became on board at eight o'clock, with a bottle; that they said it was water, and they had merely stepped on board to look at the ship, being an iron ship; that abont nine o'clock Mr. Somes, one of the Dock constables, came on hoard, and brought one of the lads with him, and a bottle, and asked him if he knew anything of any brandy being stolen from the vessel; he said no, he did not; that Somes said, "You must go with me to the guard-house;" that he went on shore to go with him, and on the way the lad ran away; that he ran after him, and overtook him, but the lad knocked him down and got away; that he then came on board the ship again, and found the cabin had been broken into—he said it must have been broken into, for he saw the mate lock it before he left; I then went✗the hold, and found ten casks of brandy there, three of them had been</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother John—we live at No. 135, Aldersgate-street, and are ink-manufacturers. Both the prisoners have been in our employ—Harding was so till he was apprehended—Cooke had left us about five years—at the beginning of this year we missed a great deal of property, and, in consequence of some com<lb/>munication from Deane, I applied for a warrant to search Cooke's premises—they were searched about the 12th or 14th of June, or it might be the 16th—it was on a Tuesday—there was marking-ink and other property of ours found there—I returned with the officer from Cooke's to our own pre<lb/>mises, and I sent for Harding down from the warehouse to the counting-House—I said to him, "I am sorry, John, to see you in such a situation; we have a very serious charge against you; it is not an affair of yesterday; I believe you have been robbing us some years, and, in order that I may be correct in the charge laid against you, I will read from a paper now before me"—this is the paper—I said, "On the 11th of March you took from our warehouse half a pint of marking-ink, and deposited that at Cooke's"—I</p>

               <p>read the whole of the paper—he heard the whole of it—I had read the detail to him—I said, "Is this true?"—he said, "I wish I could undo what I have done; I have been made the dupe of a designing man"—I said "You know a certain person (naming him) very well; you ought to have avoided his company"—"But," I said again, "is it true? you must know if it is true or not"—he hesitated a minute, looked at the paper, and said, "Well, then, sir, it is nearly all true, it may not be quite"—I said then, "How could all this happen?"—he said, "I was led into it by a person; and when he had got me into it, he then told me, if I did not bring him what he wanted, he would tell my masters of me"—I said, "How did you contrive to take away so much marking-ink?"—he said, "I put it into bottles, and took it away at different times"—he said he hoped I would be merciful to him—I have seen the marking-ink found at Cooke's—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I have examined the quality of this in this quart bottle, and com<lb/>pared it with what we make—it corresponds in all respects with the ink we make, which is entirely made from a secret of our own—nobody but my brother and myself make this ink—we do not trust an individual with the secret—I can say that this is a part of that manufactured on our premises—it is never sent out in larger bottles than these small ones—we once sent out half a pint to a person—that must be seven or eight years ago—with that exception, it is invariably sent out in these small bottles—Cooke must have known that—he was with us four years.</p>

I entered Cooke's employ on the 20th of August last, and I left on the 10th of June—I saw Harding at Cooke's frequently during my service there—Cooke's premises are about 200 yards from Mr. Arnold's—I felt it my duty to make a communication to Messrs.

               <p>half a pint of marking-ink, on the 11th of March—he gave it to Cooke in the counting-house, and Cooke put it down on the desk—I afterwards looked, and it was marking-ink—it was not in this bottle, but in a smaller bottle, about a half-pint—it was not a regular marking-ink bottle—I should say it was a bottle used for other purposes—Cooke sold marking-ink at that time, but I never knew him make any—I afterwards saw the bottle containing the marking-ink, up stairs, and a bottle similar to this one, was under it, and it was draining into it—I had frequently seen Harding at Cooke's before the 11th of March—I had seen him bring ink-powder, and red ink before that, and oxide of iron, I believe it is called—he came sometimes two or three times a week, and sometimes he did not come for a week—he had a latch-key, and generally let himself in—there is a gate<lb/>way near Cooke's, to which Cooke used to send me—he told me to wait till I saw the young man, Harding, and then I was to say to him that Mr. Cooke wanted him—I heard Harding say to Cooke on one occasion, "Don't send them close to our premises, for if our old man were to see them, or to know it, he would have some suspicion," or, "it might excite, out old man's suspicion," or words to that effect—I am sure I heard him say that—I do not recollect that Cooke made any answer—I am not certain whether that was before or after the marking-ink was brought—while 1 was at Cooke's I never knew any marking-ink to be made or to be bought by him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer; I live in Gray-street, Webber-street. I was at the skittle-ground, at the Angel, on the night of the 28th of May—I saw a coat lying on the seat at the left side of the door—I saw Smith take it away and give it up to <hi rend="italic">Lew</hi> Hart, who went out of the skittle-ground, but where he went I cannot tell—I saw Mr. Tubbs playing at skittles when I went in—I went out as soon as I saw the coat go away—I did not stop five minutes in the place altogether—I heard a noise about a coat being lost—I did not know Mr. Tubbs before—I told Mr. Barnes about the coat, and afterwards I told Mr. Tubbs—I said, "That is the man that took the coat"—Smith never left the ground at all—I pointed him out to Mr. Barnes—I did not tell Mr. Tubbs who took his coat—I was not along with Mr. Tubbs at all—Mr. Barnes came out<lb/>side the door—I called him, and said, "That is the man that took the coat"—I told Tubbs when he came outside the door—I pointed out to him the man to whom the coat had been given—Smith was inside the ground—I pointed him out to Barnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at the time you told Mr. Tubbs about the coat see Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Smith was outside the door, and I pointed him out to Mr. Tubbs, as the man that took the coat up—we went to several places to look after Smith, but we could not find him at all—he had left the skittle ground when we went to look after him—I saw the officer take Hart—I did not see Smith then, nor till two o'clock next morning—I pointed out Hart to Mr. Tubbs, and a policeman was sent for, who took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see Smith after they sent for the policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—out<lb/>side the door for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after they took <hi rend="italic">lew</hi> Hart—Smith was there in the ground when they sent for the police<lb/>man—he came out and went away a quarter of an hour after the coat was gone—I did not see any person sent for a policeman—I saw Hart taken by the policeman—Smith was then in the ground—he came out soon after—I saw him at the time Hart was taken, outside the Angel door—I did not</p>

               <p>see the policeman then—at the time the policeman took Hart, Smith was inside—I saw Smith at the time Hart was taken, he was outside—I did not point out Smith to the policeman, because he (Smith) was not there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was inside, I believe—I saw him in<lb/>side—I did not say a word about it, when I heard an outcry about the coat—I did not point out Smith, because he went away—soon after we went to look after him to several places, and then the policeman called me up in the morning, to see if he was the same man, and he was—I saw him at nine or ten o'clock at night—I did not see him afterwards till one o'clock in the morning—the last place I saw Smith at after he gave the coat to Hart was in the Angel—it might be a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before he came out.</p>
