Howse, carman," on it, in gilt letters on a red ground—the man who took the parcels away signed this receipt for them in the name of Smith—the goods were worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I was manager of the Upper Assam Tea Company at the time in question—I have since left the employment—on 21st July, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, Monk drew my attention to the man driving up for these parcels—I went out to examine the van and the man—I examined the van and horse very carefully and took down the name, and copied it in a book, "J. Howse, carman"—it was written on a red ground in yellow letters—the horse was a very peculiar one—it had a white face—the prisoner is the man I saw in the van—I noticed him specially, and am quite confident he is the man—I saw the van drive away, it turned round towards King William's statue, the road was blocked up, and he stood up for a minute or two in the van—I saw him again next day in Old 'Change—I was with Hawkes the detective—I said then I would not swear to him because he was differently dressed—he had not a coat on, his sleeves were tucked up and his waistcoat unbuttoned, and he had a different appearance—I said I should like to see him with his coat on before I could swear to him—I did see him with his coat on at the Mansion House, and I was then convinced he was the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective.</hi>) On 22nd July last I saw the prisoner in Old 'Change—I asked him if his name was Howse, and if he was a car<lb/>man, he said, "Yes"—I pointed to a van and asked if it belonged to him, he said it did—I asked him if he had any other van besides that, he said, "No"—I then asked him if he had gone to 69, King William Street, to the Upper Assam Tea Company's Offices to receive any parcels of tea the night previous, about 5 o'clock, he said, "No"—I said, "This van was seen standing there"—he said, "That can't be so, for I had charge of the van, and took five parcels of goods from Messrs. Morgan's to the Docks"—Mr. Cook, who was present, said it was the horse and van he had seen the night before at 5 o'clock—the prisoner then said, the van was in his stables at 5, Sidney Street, Mile End, at 5 o'clock—I asked if he had any objection to my going to Morgan's respecting the statement he had made—he said, no he wished me to do so—I went there and saw the warehouseman, Wills—the prisoner said he had started from Cannon Street with the packages at 3.30, and had taken one package to the London Docks, and four to the East India Docks</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200005"/>
               <p>—I reminded him that half-an-hour was a short time to go to both those places, and he said, "I took one to the London Books, and went part of the way to the East India Docks, but found it was too late; finding I was late, I brought them back and left them in my stable to take the following morn<lb/>ing"—I asked the prisoner's carman whether he had been employed by his master to take any goods to the London Docks the day before, from Morgan's—he hesitated for a moment, and he said, "To tell you the truth I did; five cases were brought out of Morgan's, they were placed in the cart, I took one to the London Docks, and the others I took home to the stables"—I stated that to the prisoner, and he said, "You can believe me or not, I have told you the truth—I asked the prisoner what time be got home with his van, he said, "Shortly after 5 o'clock"—I asked him if he had let the van to anybody else for any purpose—he said, "No, I was out with the van myself in the morning, and never left the charge of it till I got home to the stables at night, and you can inquire at my place and you will find that is true"—he said he was quite willing to assist me in any way, and I went to his residence in Henry Street, Mile End, and saw his wife—the prisoner was taken to Bishopsgate Police Station—I afterwards saw him there and asked him if he had anything further to say to me—he said, "I may as well tell you the truth, my man took one case to the docks, and I lent the van to a man named Swabey, who applied for it in the afternoon, stating that he wanted it to fetch two pads of mackerel, which he could get a crown out of"—the prisoner then said to his man, who was present, "Did not I meet you at 4.30 in Throgmorton Street, at the Gladstone Wine Company"—the man said, "Yes, you did, you were there some short time, and sent me to St. John's Wood"—the carman said be left the van in Cannon Street, at 3.30 when he received the five cases, and he returned at 4.30, and he then saw his employer, and the van was then empty; he saw no more of the van after that till he saw it in the stables, after he had got back from St. John's Wood, at 8 o'clock.</p>

I found the prisoner fifty yards from the house, and said, "You are the woman who has just been into my shop and bought some bacon, and paid me a bad shilling."—she said that she was not aware of it, she was a pretty good judge of money—she went back with me to the shop, where Mary Moore was—she said, "You passed a bad shilling at our shop"—the prisoner said, "Give me the shil<lb/>lings, and I will give you good ones for them"—I said, "No; keep the shillings till the policeman comes—the prisoner took a shilling out of Mary Moore's hand, and put it into her mouth, taking out another shilling and giving it to Mary Moore—I saw it afterwards, and it was good—the prisoner made a motion with her mouth, and swallowed it.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 210) From information and a description received, I met Carter in Grays' Inn Road, on 17th August, at 5 p. m.—Itold her I should take her on suspicion of robbing an old gentleman in Bell Court, that morning—she said, "He say that I robbed him"—I said, "yes"—she said, "An old b——, I wish I had robbed him"—afterwards she said that she met him in Fleet Street, and took him home with her and that he gave her four shillings and a sovereign to undress before him—I took her to the station and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a key were found on her.</p>

I should have thought people would have taken his purse and not have stopped to empty it in a public thoroughfare. He was that the woman ran into the front room; how does he know that, if he was not there to see—I never saw the woman in my life; I went to bed at 1 o'clock and did not awake till the policeman came. I am innocent. I was never locked up in my life, and I have been in this neighbourhood fourteen years. I have witnesses to call, who saw the assault take place, but not by me.</p>

I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Indian Empire</hi>—on the night of the 30th April, I was one of the starboard watch, with Peter-son, and I heard the prisoner order him to furl the main trysail—the man went aloft, but then he could not furl the sail, owing to his bad finger—he asked for a boatswain's chair, and the third mate fetched him one—Peter-son then attempted to furl the sail, when the captain ordered him down on the poop—I was lying on a spar alongside the quarter-hatch, about 15 from the captain, and saw him with one band on Peterson's throat and the other on his left hand—then I saw the prisoner, who was with them, strike Peterson four blows on his bead with something in the shape of a belaying pin—Peterson sung out that the captain was choking him, and after the blows he fell on the deck insensible—his face and clothes ware covered with blood—the captain told the crew he would look after the man, and he observed, "It only happens once a twelvemonth"—I did not see what became of Peterson, as the captain sent me and others forward two minutes after the blows were struck; the prisoner went to toe stern of the vessel and threw the weapon overboard—I saw Peterson the next day lying in the saloon cabin—he was ill, and there were plasters on his head—he remained in the cabin for twenty—one days—I saw him almost every day, at noon—he had fits occasionally, when three or four of us had to hold him down—his mind was affected at times—he appeared to be suffering from the wounds on his head—he was not able at the expiration of twenty-one days to go on duty—the plasters had been removed then—a good hand would not require a boatswain's chair in order to furl the sails, but it was easier for the prosecutor to do so, as he had a bad finger—I do not know whether he refused to obey orders after 6 o'clock on 9th March, during the hot weather at Calcutta—he never drew his knife in my presence—he was a man qualified for his work and not habit of making disturb<lb/>ancess board—I have been sixteen years at sea.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> I was an able seaman on board, and, on the night of the 30th April, was at the wheel, and near to the captain when he stood on the poop—when Peterson came aft he said to him, "My man, will you not do as you are told?—Peterson replied, "I do, sir!"—then the captain said, "Why don't you furl the main trysail?"—Peterson said, "I was, sir," and the captain added, "Yes; with a boatswain's chair"—Peterson then told him that his fingers were sore, and that he could not hold on—and the captain said, "You shall go down here until your fingers are properly well, and then you shall do it"—the captain and the prisoner then seized the man, and called to the third mate to take off the hatch of the lazarette—Peterson said that it was not a fit place for him to go into, that he had done nothing to go down for, and he resisted, and stepped back as far as the rail—the captain then seized Peterson with his left hand, by the throat, and forced his head backwards over the rail, singing out at the same time for the mate and blacksmith—Peterson said, "Captain, captain, what are you doing? you are choking me!" and then he tried to release himself from the grasp—the second mate then struck him four blows on the head and face—the crew jumped on the poop, and took the man away from the officers, and stood him up by the wheel-house—some one of the crew shone a light, and I saw that his face, neck, and breast were bloody—the captain said to us, "I have been a seaman myself; come aft in the morning, and we will settle it—Peterson then fell on the deck insensible—the crew wanted to take the man forward and wash his wounds, but the captain observed, "We have injured the man, and we will cure him—he was then taken below—at 11.30 I went into the cabin, and saw that Peterson's head was much swollen, and plastered up—the next morning, about 4 o'clock, I saw him again, when he complained of an awful throbbing in his head, and afterwards said that he saw all kinds of strange things—he was out of his mind once or twice—some of the crew were sent into the cabin to take care of him—he was not in his senses at the time—he ran about the deck, fancying he saw all kinds of strange objects, and once or twice he tried to jump overboard—these symptoms continued for a fortnight or three weeks—he was unable to do duty, owing to pains in his head, and could not go aloft—the weapon used by the prisoner was something like a belaying pin, and was 16 or 18 inches in length—I do not think it was a piece of wood, because of the sound it made on the man's head—I believe that the prisoner he had one or two quarrels with the prosecutor before this, but they did not amount to much.</p>

BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who are the owners of the ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. George Duncan, of No. 2, East India Avenue, Leadenhall Street—I have been in his service for fourteen years—I am a Scotchman, and the prisoner, I believe, is from the county of Norfolk—twelve or fourteen of the crew were foreigners—there were thirty-nine hands, all told, myself included—all the officers are certificated men—I was charged at the Thames Police Court with the same offence, and from time to time was remanded—I was charged with aiding and assisting the prisoner to commit the offence—Mr. George Duncan came forward of his own accord, and spoke to my character—I was discharged, and bound over in my own recognizances—I do not know whether the Board of Trade take any notice of summary convictions—did not see any weapon in the prisoner's hand—the crew jumped as the poop, and became boisterous, but I persuaded them to let me take the man below—one of the crew might have shone a light in his face, but I cannot say—it was a very dark night—he shammed insensibility—he never was insensible, in my opinion—the crew said a good many things—I saw five scratches, not cuts, everyone of which was bleeding—I had them washed and plastered—the prisoner told me the next morning that he had picked up Peterson's knife on the deck—the men who have given evidence did not see the occurrence at all—they jumped up after it was done—the man at the wheel could not see me—ho was 4 feet under the poop-deck at the time and the great glare of the light below would prevent his seeing anything above him—I was thunderstruck at seeing the prisoner strike the man—the next morning twenty-five of the crew came aft and seized me and the second and third mates—I sang out for my revolvers, but did not get them—the men called out for arms, and told the others to get belaying pins—they had me on my back—the watch did not work at all that afternoon, and the ship was left to herself—they said, that unless I secured the prisoner in irons, to prevent his violence, they would not do their duty—I did not con<lb/>sider him violent—he protected me—I never told him to knock the man down, or the third mate to knock his d—d head off—I did not see any<lb/>thing the matter with Peterson's finger—there was some talk about a boat-swain's chair that night—seamen never use such a thing—the man would not have been asked to go aloft if he had a bad finger—the stewards, and</p>

               <p>some others of the crew, by my directions, stayed with the man all that night—I was not afraid ho would die, but I did not know to what extent he was injured—I did not see that he was delirious—he was only eleven day in the cabin—almost directly after we had arrived in England he made a complaint to the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>, I was the third mate of the <hi rend="italic">Indian Empire</hi>—I hold a certificate as second mate—I was ten months on board—I have been at see ever since I was five years old<lb/>—Peterson on several occasions refused duty—on the morning of 30th April I was serving out water, and be made a disturbance about it, as he always did—he told me that he would have satisfaction out of me, and when in Calcutta he said he would put a knife through me—I reported this to the other officers—Grant and others of the craw no several occasions also refused to do duty—on the night in question the second mate told Peterson to furl the main trysail, and he replied that he would not do it unless he had a boatswain's chair—I got one, and he went half way up when he said that he would not do it for may d—d man on board the ship—the second mate told the captain, and the man was ordered aft—the captain asked him if he would do it or not, when he complained of a sore Anger, which nobody had ever heard of or seen before—then the captain said that if he would not do as he was told he Must go into the lazarette, which is a kind of goal for such men—Peterson said that he would not go there, and the captain then took hold of him—he then lifted his hand to strike the captain, and the second mate stepped forward and gave him several blows—I was 3 ft. or 4 ft. off, and could not tell what the second mate had in his hand—I believe he hid something, but I never saw what it was—I do not think the mate could have gone to the stern and thrown a weapon into the sea without being seen—when the captain sent me to call the chief mate the whole of the watch were stand<lb/>ing on the fore part of the poop—Barcon and others told me they would break my head—this was whilst Peterson was struggling to get away, and before the blows were struck—I told them they had no business on the poop, when they retorted that if I did not look out they would break my head—I passed on, however, and called the mate—the men were below the poop<lb/>deck, considerably, and I do not think they could sec what was going on—I do not think the prisoner struck Peterson with any intention of doing him bodily injury—I am not certain whether Peterson at the time was about to strike the captain, but I think there was reason for the mates interfering to protect the captain.</p>

                  </hi>. I was chief officer on board the <hi rend="italic">Indian Empire,</hi> and hold a certificate as a master—I very often had trouble with Peterson before the 30th April—on the 8th March, in Calcutta, he refused to do duty, and went on shore, as he said, to see a Magistrate—he did no work after his return that day, and, during the next week, he repeatedly refused to obey orders, and would only do just what he pleased—when the third officer asked him to do anything, he threatened him with a knife, and said he would not work for him or any other d—officer in the ship—we left Calcutta on the 2nd April, and got on shore in the <hi rend="italic">James and Maria,</hi> and from that time the crew wanted to leave the ship, and they were in a state of mutiny throughout the voyage home—on the night of the 27th April, I had occasion to go to the forecastle, to order the watch to turn out, for the purpose of hauling the yards round—they told me they would come when they pleased, and asked me what I was making a noise about—Grant told me I should get my head broken, and there would be something for me to go away with—the ship was in danger at the time, as she was caught aback—the watch were half au hour before they came out of the forecastle—I saw Peterson shortly after the occurrence—I did not consider that he was bad; he always ate his meat—he went to the forecastle the next day, and the sixth day he was cured—on the seventh all the plasters were off him, and I saw the man washing himself, and afterwards mending shoes—on the 11th of the next month, he was away from the cabin altogether—the prisoner bears a very good character, as far as I know; he is a temperate, quiet man—the next day the crew wanted to give me the command of the vessel—the captain was in danger at the time, because he was thrown on his back, and held whilst some of the crew went to look for the irons—the second officer was held by four men, and I, also, by the same number—I was told at the time that they did not intend to hurt me; they only wished me to navigate the ship for them, and to take them where they liked—if they had done so, none of us would have been seen again, and the ship and cargo would have been destroyed—the cargo consisted of jute, cotton, wool, sugar, linseed, rape seed, and other things, worth some 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

D. Jones."—I asked him if he had an order, and he produced this, "High Street, Camden Town. Please send by bearer, two pieces Irish linen. Gall &amp; Anderson. To Messrs. Boyd &amp; Co., Friday Street"—I asked him whose writing it was, and he said, "Mr. Anderson's"—I asked him how long he had been there, and he said "Seven months"—I asked him to go up stairs with me, and took him into the private counting-house—before that he said they wanted the goods particularly, and had sent him down instead of the porter—I shut the door of the counting-house and went down stairs—he came out and said we could send the goods up; he did not care about waiting—I said, "That differs from what you said down stain" he then said he would go to Messrs. Leafs and come back again—Itold him he could not go—he said "Why not?"—I told him I did not believe the order was in Mr. Anderson's writing—he snatched the order from me, and tore it in half—I sent for a policeman, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

I am a pianoforte maker, of Baker Street—I was present at the reading on 9th March—I first saw Mr. Myers outside, before he got into the hall; but had no conversation with him—I afterward, saw him on the platform, before Dr. Halshall took the chair—the prisoner came about 8.15—he was not there when the chair should have been taken by Mr. Goldsmith—when he came, Mr. Myers was on the platform, and there were great cries for the conductor—the prisoner said to Mr. Myers,"Who are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200062"/>
               <p>you?"—he said, "I ara Mr. Myers, the editor of the 'Bayswater Chronicle I am here at your invitation"—the prisoner said, "I insist on your leaving the platform; you have no right on the platform"—Mr. Myers stayed there several minutes after that—I saw Dr. Halshall go on the platform—he asked Mr. Myers to sit down, which he did, and Dr. Halshall read some piece, and afterwards made a statement in reference to the absence of the artiste—I understood him to say that they had been prevented from appearing by accident, which was not the case—upon that Mr. Myers, who sat in a front seat, got up and made a statement to the meeting—he was perfectly sober, in my opinion—I was present till after Mr. Myers left, and I think I was there the whole time—I saw nothing abominable or disgusting in his conduct—he was not kicked or <hi rend="italic">bounded</hi>—I saw him leave the room—it is utterly false.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at Westmoreland Road, Bayswater, last March—on 9th March, I joined Mr. Myers, about 2 o'clock, in the City, and had lunch with him—I went with him to the hall, and was present during a considerable part of the reading, not all—I was there till Mr. Myers left, he was not drunk, nor was his conduct such as in my opinion would in<lb/>duce people to suppose he was drunk—he was not guilty of abominable or disgusting conduct—I did not see him the whole time he was there—I came out in front of him—I did not see him kicked or <hi rend="italic">bonneted</hi> while I was there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The pamphlet contained the following,</hi> "It may not be out of place to state that the editor of the "Bayswater Chronicle," a Mr. Myers, came to our meeting one evening in a state of intoxication, having, as his friend' in<lb/>formed us, been tasting wine at the Docks. After vainly endeavouring to disturb the meeting, the gentleman (?) conducted himself in a most abomin<lb/>able and disgusting manner, so much so that appeals were made to me from all parts of the hall to expel him, but being unwilling to do to I allowed him to remain; however, the audience violently expelled him, by sundry kicks and a good bonneting. This may be sufficient to account for the bitter spirit in which Mr. Editor discharges that which he has the audacity to term a public duty."</p>

I am now carrying on the business of an auctioneer and house agent, in the same premises as those formerly occupied by Edgington—I have known him for nearly three years; and about a year before his bankruptcy I was in his service as clerk—he kept an account at the Birkbeck Deposit Bank—I have seen him fill up the body of the cheques—he ceased to keep an account there when Mrs. Cox began to do so—after this time I have seen him send up blank cheques to Mrs. Cox for her signature, and then they were sent down to him again—I was present in November, 1867, in Cannon Street Road; when the business of the coffee-house was transferred—the price was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which Edgington received in notes—he took out of his pocket a roll of notes, and placed the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with them—he gave gold to the seller instead of notes—I saw amongst the roll of notes two or three for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and several others were of various amounts—I was present at the Bankruptcy Court, on 17th December, the month afterwards, when the sale of the Barley Mow took place—Edgington acknowledged that he had made over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said to him, "You have made a good day's work; how much have you made; I suppose about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he replied, "I have made over 200 <hi rend="italic">quid'</hi>—on 24th December, 1867, I went to 138, Cannon Street Road, to a tobacconist's shop, occupied by Mrs. Cox, and which had been transferred to her by Edgington—I saw there the cheffonier, which had been in Edgington's office three weeks or a month before—he had an iron safe about the same time as the cheffonier—I agree with the last witness as to his statement with regard to our visit to Edgington's premises—I remember Edgington having a number of papers relating to changes of public and other houses, each paper showing the</p>

I am in partnership with the last witness—we occupy the premises formerly used by Edgington, and took possession of them in July, 1869—there was no good-will, the business not being worth anything, we only paid for the fixtures—I used to be employed by him as a sort of out-door clerk and canvasser, and received about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum on an average—I did not receive as much as 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the last year I was there—I have known Edgington pay 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week for advertisements—there was no advertisement-book kept during the latter part of my time—there was a small memorandum-book, in which he entered the cash payments.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, and have known Edgington since 1864—I knew him on the occasion of his first bankruptcy, when, to the best of my belief, he carried on the same business—I remember some proceedings taking place in the Court of Queen's Bench, before Master Unthank, shortly before the prisoner's second bankruptcy—I met him afterwards in the Mitre luncheon room—he then had some money in his Possession; bank notes, and probably a little gold—it was after his return from the Court, when he offered some remarks of a braggadocia character—he said, "I don't care, I have got plenty of money; I can defy them, and can be a bankrupt"—I do not pledge myself exactly to the words he used—I was informed that he had money previously to his being searched, and when the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was found upon him, I confess I thought he had a great deal more than was taken from him—I heard, from a certain party, that he had money, and I gave information according to my belief—I had seen money in his possession since we met at the luncheon bar—I have seen bank notes to possession within six luncheon of the present time—I believe at his</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POWELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give us the month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot—I think it was before Edgington's bankruptcy—I bought it at the latter end of 1867, before Christmas—I believe I had it at Christmas, 1867, in my home—I knew Mrs. Cox perhaps twelve months before that—I did not tell her she had better get rid of it—she came to me to try and sell her tobacconist's business in Canon Street Road—she sent to me by a gentleman she knew, Mr. Burn, and said that she wanted to sell a cheffonier, and I went and saw it, and bought it, because I liked it—I had spoken to Edgington about it, and he to me—I knew it had been his, because I happened to be at the sale where he bought it—he bought it in at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was a considerable time before I bought it at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I had seen it at Edgington's a great many times—I was not present when Cox bought the things of Edgington—she had a receipt for it, which I saw, to show that she had purchased it of Edgington—Edgington recommended me to buy it; he knew I liked it—he was present when I bought it of her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Edgington. Q.</hi> Were you present at the sale when I bought it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—your partner, Mr. Durrant, was present—it was not worth more then 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was run up purposely—I will take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">FRANCIS</hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 7, Old Bailey—I am acquainted with Mr. Law, and acted for him in on carrying on negociations for a part<lb/>nership</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200069"/>
               <p>with Edgington—the sale of the partnership from Edgington to Law was completed on 18th May, 1867, and there was an agreement made—I think 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount paid on behalf of Law, to Edgington, for taking him in—50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the cash actually paid over by Law—the remainder was in bills—I understood that Mr. Durrant, Edgington's partner, was to retire—I paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by two cheques, of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, on behalf Mr. Law—one of those cheques was drawn by George Baker, and was dishonoured—I then drew a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with Durrant's name upon it, that he might endorse it—the first cheque was dated 18th May, and the second the 26th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Why was the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. divided into two cheques? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made a loan to Mr. Law of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a friend of his, named Baker, lent him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a cheque—the two were put together on the afternoon of the same day—Mr. Baker's cheque was dishonoured, and I substituted my own for it—I handed the two cheques to Edgington—I presume the receipt is on the agreement which was handed to the purchaser—I treated both with Durrant and Edgington.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Edginton. Q.</hi> Was not the amount I paid you 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I am sure of that—I paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to you, not to Mr. Durrant, but I think he was present—the transaction, was very confused; I could not say whether he was selling his share of the business, or you were selling yours; but afterwards I found out that Mr. Durrant never seceded from the busi<lb/>ness during Law's partnership—he was in partnership with you at the time—I could not tell whether he was selling his share to Mr. Law—I drew up an agreement between Mr. Durrant and Mr. Law.</p>

Wolff and Farish and Mr. Johnson—he was also directed to give the address of Mr. Johnson and specify from whom various goods had been received, and particular of the bills and invoices—he has not filed such amended account—he applied again on 13th August to pass his last examination, but as the accounts were not produced, the meeting was adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die,</hi> with, liberty for him to apply again.</p>

Q.</hi> When were you called in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 5th April—the first meeting was held by the creditors themselves—the prisoner was not it that meeting—I saw him on the 16th—he was not represented by a solicitor on that occasion—I advised him to see his solicitor before the meeting—the composition was offered at the meeting—I did not tell him I would do everything to assist him—he intimated to me that he was going to see his father, to see what could be done in the matter—I have been told that the loan of the London and County Bank has been paid by his father—the creditors hold no security except bills of exchange—there were two policies of insurance—the prisoner delivered up the invoices to me—he gave me all the information he could, as far as I could see—it was from the invoices he gave me that I prepared the balance sheet—he left the meeting on the 16th, for some purpose—I don't know whether he went to his father then—I had nothing to do with filing the petition.</p>

I live at Chapel Street, Forest Gate—on 1st September I went with the last witness to the church—I saw a light there first—I went and fetched a weapon and came back—I saw Smith standing outside the church, behind a pillar—we secured him, and took him into the church with us—I was looking in a different part of the church to Craddock;—I saw Johnson in the church afterwards—when I found Smith I stood over him with a spade in my hand, and told him if he moved I would knock him down—he said, "Don't hit me, I will stand quite still"</p>

She said, "Come along with me;" I thought she was going to take me to her home. I said, "It was done in all fun," and asked her not to take me into a police-office.

                  </hi>. I am the acting staff paymaster at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich—the cuttings from the cartridge papers are sold at the arsenal—when cuttings are ready, I give notice to the contractor to remove them, upon the report of McCubrey being sent to the office that there is an accumulation to take away—I knew Jones as acting for Mr. Phipps the contractor, of 176, Upper Thames Street, and I believe he was in the habit of coming to remove the cuttings, in every case, since last December—the course of business was this: upon McCubrey's report that there was a certain quantity for Mr. Phipps, ready for delivery, I wrote a letter to Mr. Phipps, stating generally what quantity there was to remove, and within a few days Jones came, and paid me for the paper cuttings reported; he brought no document; he paid me for the quantity mentioned in my letter—I then handed to him a memorandum receipt to take to the head of the issue department, speci<lb/>fying the amount paid, and the quantity to be delivered—from that he would get an order on the store-holder, to deliver the paper paid for—McCubrey was the store-holder—Jones would take the order to McCubrey and get the goods—McCubrey would load the goods in the railway vans—they should have been weighed, generally by Wright, as McCubrey's assis<lb/>tant; he was there for that purpose—the cuttings are packed in bags, and loaded into the railway trucks—McCubrey would send a memorandum of the quantity of goods loaded in the vans, to the issuing branch of the Military Store Office, and get a police pass to pass the goods through the gate—it was then McCubrey's, or Wright's, duty to accompany them to the gate, and to see the trucks leave the arsenal, and countersign the pass before the police, in proof that the proper quantity has been delivered—the pass would be given up to the police at the gate—that is the authority to pass the goods.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Mr. Sparrow, Mr. Phipps has paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. this day for 30 cwt of paper, J.D.

Pass the under mentioned for service to Mr. Phipps London, 30 cwt paper cutting signature of the person accompanying the stores to the gate of the arsenal, W. McCubrey, R. Reardon.")—Mr. Reardon is an officer, he signs the pass before the goods leave the arsenal and before McCubrey signs, he merely countersigns it; it it filled up by one of the clerks in the office—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the delivery order for those goods—it is signed by Mr. Sparrow of the issuing department, and it has McCubrey's initials; it is an order to the principle foreman, and it is delivered to him—I had nothing to do with any trans<lb/>action on 24th February—the next which I had anything to do with was on 28th April—I believe Jones came to me on that day, as the agent for Mr. Phipps, and paid me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave the person who paid the for acknowledgment order; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that would go to the issue department in the way I have explained—this is the police pass—I don't know Wright's writing, I never saw him write. [<hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY CHARLES</hi>. I know Wright's handwriting; this is his.] (<hi rend="italic">This was a pass, dated 28th April for</hi> 40 <hi rend="italic">cwt. of paper cuttings, signed Thomas Wright</hi>)—This (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in the kind of report which McCubrey would make to the office of the gone ready to be delivered; it bears his signature; you must understand I do not speak positively to this document—I never saw it before, but it is the kind of report that he should give—it would go in on the 21st (the 28th is a mistake), and I should communicate with Mr. Phipps immediately—this is the delivery order—it has McCubrey's initials—the next transaction was on 3rd June—here are two reports relating to that—one on 20th May and one on 25th—here are also two orders of 3rd June, one for 32 cwt, and the other for 25 cwt.—I received a payment in respect of those on 3rd June from Mr. Phipps' agent—I could not swear that it was Jones, but I do not recollect any other person paying me from the commencement of this contract—Jones must have paid me; don't recollect any other, one I have so many persons pay me in the course of a day that I can't recollect every one—to the best of my belief Jones payed me—the sum of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for 56 cwt.—this is the acknowledgment of it, the memorandum of pay<lb/>ment—this is the pass—it has McCubrey's signature—this delivery order is signed by Challis—the next transaction was on 11th June—here is the report signed by McCubrey, dated 8th June, stating 35 cwt. to be ready</p>

               <p>—the agent paid me 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 11th, and I gave him this memo<lb/>randum, and this is the delivery order relating to the transaction, signed by McCubrey—the next transaction was on 30th July—here are two reports relating to that, one of the 2nd for 30 cwt., and one of the 21st for 40 cwt.—I received 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th July—this is my acknowledgment—this is the delivery order, initialed by McCubrey, and this is the police pass for the 70 cwt.—the next was on 12th August—here are two reports refering to it, one of the 4th for 40 cwt, and one of the 7th for 20 cwt.—this is McCubrey's signature—on 12th August Jones attended—I received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave him this memorandum—I speak positively to Jones as paying me on that day—these are McCubrey's initials to both these delivery orders, and to this pass for the 60 cwt.—I speak expressly to Jones on that occasion—I believe I cannot speak to him on any other occasion, but I believe he paid me in every case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe McCubrey is the store-holder in what is called the sale yard for unserviceable stores? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is—he has occupied that post for eight or ten years—it was partly upon my recommendation that he was appointed to it—the sale yard is the receptacle for all broken up stores that come from all the various departments in the world, with the exception of broken up shot and shells—such things would come there as mattresses, soldiers belts and buckles, gun carriages, blankets, and various articles—when gun carriages come in they have to be broken up, for the wood and metal—the blankets and sheets are torn up into strip and go under the head of old rags—it would be McCubrey's duty to see to the breaking up of these various things—if gun carriages came from Malta a delivery note should come with them—a receipt for them would be given to the captain of the vessel who brought them to England—many months would sometimes be occupied in breaking up those gun carriages—when the wood and iron has been separated it would be McCubrey's duty to report the quantity of each, and they would then be brought on charge—he would bring on the carriages first, and then weigh it off and bring it back in material—with respect to soldiers' belts, he might sell the buckles as buckles, not as brass; but if broken he would sell them as brass, and they would have to be brought on charge under the head of brass—McCubrey superintends the whole of the breaking up and division of these returned stores—the breaking up ground extends over more than three or four acres, I should think—he had Wright under him, and I think twenty labourers; when lie was extremely busy we should give him a good many more—the business has been, I should say, more than doubled by the giving up of the store-keeping at the Tower, the Herbert Hospital, and the clothing establishment—it has all come into McCubrey's department, and lately his work was been doubled—we have no contracts for the sale of leather—we have sales of various things by public auction—we have no other contract for unserviceable stores besides that with Mr. Phipps, that I am aware of, except metal, which I do not call unserviceable—we have had sales by auction, of unserviceable stores every three weeks since the Tower amalgamation—we have all w goods properly catalogued—McCubrey would assort the goods, and get them ready for sale; the labourers assist him in making up the lots—I take the produce of the sales—our sales formerly used to run about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sale—since the amalgamation it would be considerably more; I should say 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a sale—a value is put upon the goods, an upshot price at which they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200085"/>
               <p>are to go—McCubrey assists, with the auctioneer, in valuing the goods—it is not exactly a reserved price, but we endeavour to get the lots as high as we can, of course—McCubrey always attends those periodical sales—he is not there to regulate the price at which the goods stall be sold—he is not allowed to speak at the sale—he goes round with the auc<lb/>tioneer a few days before, and they value the lots—McCubrey does not receive the deposits paid by the vendees; he would hand them to my clerk, or myself—it takes weeks, sometimes, to prepare the goods for these sales—there are many articles in detail—there was formerly a military storekeeper; he is now the comptroller—there is a storekeeper's office—it would be McCubrey's duty to attend there once a day, and he would, as a rule, attend me once a day—to do that, he would have to go a circuit of about three-quarters of a mile from his office—it would be his duty to prepare the vouchers for bringing on charge the result of the breaking up of the old materials, and enter them on his ledger—he would prepare the rough documents for the clerk to enter; he would do all, except the mechanical work—it would be his duty occasionally to meet the store-holders of other departments; stores come to him through them—he never receives anything direct from the stations; he has to receive it through some other store-bolder, and nothing should come into his department, except by being brought on charge, charged to him—we look to him as the responsible party for sending in the documents to which reference has been made, for the purpose of passing goods out at the gate—properly speaking, nothing ought to leave without his signature, unless he is absent, then Wright would do it, and after him, Challis—by reason of the change which has taken place in the rifle, an enormous quantity of cartridges have been brought home from the various depart<lb/>ments to be broken up, many millions—Mr. Phipps' contract is for paper cuttings from the laboratory—the paper resulting from the breaking up of the cartridges would puss to Mr. Phipps under that contract—there is only one description for paper in the accounts of this department, that is, "Condemned paper;" that is the title under which all paper would appear—we should not describe it as "white," or "brown," it would be all described as "paper, old"—nothing but what is condemned and unservice<lb/>able would be in McCubrey's department, unless he had stores sent to him for what is called "expense"—he might have paper sent to him to use up for packing purposes—a great portion of the stores would consist of things that had never been used, but had become obsolete, and were not required at the stations where they were—we might have as much as four or five millions of cartridges come by one vessel under one voucher—the result of the breaking up of that consignment would not come on charge until the whole was broken up—a large parcel of cartridges would sometimes take months to break up—when they are in the shape of cart<lb/>ridges they are not under McCubrey's control; they are in the hands of the laboratory, in the manufacturing department, until they are broken up—cartridges are not broken up in his yard; carriages are—the paper does not come into the store-yard until the cartridges are broken up—cartridges are exceptional, because of the danger—McCubrey is obliged to balance his books at the end of each quarter—there are quarterly ledgers returned to the War Office—he might have a large quantity of paper in his yard, at the end of a quarter, not charged to him—he would bring it on charge when the voucher comes down from the laboratory—having sent out some of the produce, he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200086"/>
               <p>would balance his book by anticipating it, by certificate—that would be simply for the purpose of balancing his book at the quarter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, he can send paper out that is not charged to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but he must keep a memorandum of the quantity issued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It might happen when he makes up his book at the end of the quarter; it would not represent the paper he had in store; he might have a large quantity in store, although he had not on charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he had sold some of this paper not charged to him, before the end of the quarter, would he put that sale into that quarter's ledger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he would put at iu the new ledger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he would bring it on simply to balance the quar<lb/>ter, irrespective of what he had in store? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the rule—I have known McCubrey ever since he has been in the service, twenty seven or twenty-eight years—he entered the yard as a labourer, and was gradually pre<lb/>moted to his present position—there is no man in the service that I had more confidence in.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the paper in question here, come from these cartridges mainly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A good deal of it—some are cuttings—in making the forms of paper for cartridges, there ia a remnant; that is in manufacturing them in the first instance; before they are sent out to the military stations—the millions of cartridges that come back to us to be broken up, are cartridge that have been sent out from this county, and not used; they have become obsolete in the service, or else they have been abroad too long, and they come back and are sold as waste paper—that pro<lb/>ceeding is going on every day—Wright was foreman under McCubrey—he was given to him to assist him in his duties; not in all; in the inferior portion, the weighing up such things as paper, or refuse kind of things—he was under McCubrey's directions—he would weigh other things besides paper—he would not be weighing all day—that would not be his principal duty—he had other duties; he had to attend to the men breaking up—some of the bags of paper weigh 1 1/4 cwt.—I don't believe you would find two bags alike—by being packed tight they would contain 1 1/2 cwt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose he had to deliver out sixty bags, might he, as a matter of fact (I don't ask what his duty was), weigh six or seven bags, and than take it for granted that the weight of the others were about the same? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am afraid there has been a good deal of that done—it would not be right; he would have been dismissed years ago, if it was known—I was not aware that an allow<lb/>ance of fourteen pounds was made for the weight of each bag—that is too much—that would be very improper indeed—I should say it was double the weight that ought to have been allowed; if he had appealed to me, I should have told him so—I should allow seven pounds, I think that is a fair average—I have only known Wright seven or eight years, but he has been there longer than that, under McCubrey—I believe he has been there; ten or twelve years—he has always borne a good character—we choose what are considered the best men to put in that place, because there are many tempta<lb/>tions—he must have borne a good character, or he would not have been kept in the employ, particularly there—I understand there are two descriptions of bag, but as an average, as I said before, I would not allow more than seven pounds—I should allow some more than others, but I would give the average of seven pounds all round—some are heavier than others, very trifling, not a pound's difference, I should think.</p>

Phipps—I send to them when I receive notice of accumulated stores—I always do that myself—I have not been present when the paper has been weighed, but I was In the stores branch twenty-five years—formerly, a police-officer attended the auctions, to see the stores delivered, but not to weigh them—I believe they do not at present—the police-officer to whom the pass is given takes the weight for granted; he has no opportunity of weighing it—the pass is a mere matter of form, that no stores shall leave the arsenal without a pass.</p>

That was signed by Jones, in the name of his employer's firm—upon that the forty-two bags were sent to Dover—we do not know at the arsenal station the weight of the bogs; we have no means of weighing there, the truck is weighed at Dover—we sent a memorandum instructing Dover to weigh, and advise us of the weight—I have here the way-bill that was sent with those forty-two bags—we afterwards received back the weight—Jones does not give us any weight, he only gives us the number of the bags—he also gave instructions that same day to send twelve bags to Wildman—this is the</p>

I am a labourer, in the military store department, at the arsenal—I have been under Wright two years—on 12th August I assisted in putting the paper into the bags—I fetched some brown paper—I got it out of the new store in the paper shed—McCubrey told me to get it out of the new store—it is a new building, which has been built about nine months, not a store for new goods—he told us to fetch this brown paper out of the store, and put it into the paper shed, on the other side of the road—I fetched some of it, and some of the other labourers assisted—I have seen some of it here—I could not say how much there was—we took it into the paper store—that is where the paper cuttings were—I saw the railway trucks there—I did not see the paper weighed; I put it on to the weigh-bridge—I did not see the weights—Wright was present—I did not see anybody taking down the weights—Wright stood near the bridge; he was standing taking the weight of the paper, I suppose—I could not say exactly how long I saw him there—I helped put the bags on the weigh-bridge—I think I saw about five or six bags put on the weigh-bridge that morning—I helped put the brown paper into the bags, with the cuttings, not into separate bags—I could not say how many bags the brown paper went into; either four or six, or five or six—I could not say exactly how many there were—the bags containing the brown paper were all put into the last truck we loaded—I saw Jones there that day, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the trucks were loaded—I saw him standing behind the truck when I looked out of the store—when the trucks go away they are always covered up—I have been present on former occasions, when the trucks have been loaded with these paper cuttings, most 'every time they loaded, the last two years—sometimes Mr. Wright superintended the loading, and sometimes I have seen McCubrey there; not very often—it was Wright generally—I could not see whether or not the bags of paper were all weighed before they went away, on the former occasions—I have seen some of them weighed; at least, I have put them on the bridge to be weighed—I have seen the process of weighing.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where are the bags put when they are weighed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Outside of the store—fresh bags came down from the laboratory, from day today, that have not been weighed—I could not tell whether they have been mixed with bags that have been weighed, and so be delivered without being weighed at all—they might, because they have been lying alongside of the other bags that have bean weighed—when the contractor takes them away, those that have been weighed are not re<lb/>weighed at the time of delivery—in the hurry, unweighed bags might be delivered with the weighed ones—the laboratory is a, different department to ours—I don't think they weigh them there—after bags have been weighed, and put outside the store, they have remained some weeks before they have been delivered to the contractor—during that time other bags may have come from the laboratory, and been put alongside of them—this was going on day by day—sometimes bags may be weighed and remain for as much as three weeks before they are delivered, because we have not enough paper to fill all the bags at once—we have to wait till papers come down again after we have filled a few—I know nothing of the habit of reporting the quantity of paper—about seven men are employed in the store—they all help to load.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You assisted at almost all the sendings away of this paper I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it has been in different stores, not the brown, the other paper—it comes from different places—when it comas down into our yard, it is put into an old store which we have for the purpose, before it is put into bags—sometimes the store is full of paper before it is sent away—it won't hold much—we fill it into bags, and then it is weighed on the weigh-bridge—Wright was generally present to see them weighed, and then he took do down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200096"/>
               <p>the weights; then they were put on one side, and covered over with a tar<lb/>paulin, till we got another lot—no mark was put on the bags that were weighed—the laboratory people, from time to time, brought down paper in bags—those bags were generally put alongside of the others—they were not weighed at the time they were brought down—they were weighed before they went away, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, when you say they might send some of these bags away with-out being weighed, it would be an accident, would it.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—because we never see the paper put down there, it comes from the laboratory, we are always that busy doing something else—Wright was generally there when the bags were loaded into the railway trucks—he had not the paper of weights with him upon which he had token the weights—all the bags that had been weighed usually went off in the trucks for one job—McCubrey was not often present at the weighing, that was left to Wright.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your opinion, could a man of experience, if he saw thirty bags, tell at all about what weight they would be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I don't think he could—he could tell within half—if there were sixty bags, it would be as much as he could tell within a third—I did not see anyone weigh but Wright—the paper on which the weights were taken down was generally torn up—some-times it was put in with the bags when they were sent away—I have seen it lying about the store a good many days as waste paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Peake, and live at 82, Tra<lb/>fulgar Road, Old Kent Road—on the afternoon of 9th August, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I went into my son's bed-room to lie down, and whilst I was there, two men came into the room—I said, "What is it you want?" and finding no answer, I got off the bed at once, and said, "Are you come to rob the house?"—no answer was given, and I repeated the question, when the prisoner sprang towards me, with what I supposed was a hammer, and struck me a blow on the right side of the forehead—I put my hands before my face, and said, "Don't murder me! don't murder me!"—the prisoner then jumped at me like a madman, opened his mouth, groaned with passion, and gave me a second blow—I knew nothing more, and did not hear the man go down stairs—I became insensible—the other man was of fair complexion—my daughter came down stairs, the doctor was sent for and information was given to the police—since then I have been unable to leave the house, and am still very weak—on the 27th August, I went to the Lambeth police-station, and picked out the prisoner from amongst a number of other men.</p>

I am a servant, in the employ of Mr. George Cooper, of 78, Trafalgar Road, some few doors from where Mrs. Peake's lives—a little Before 3 o'clock, on the afternoon of 9th August, I was cleaning the first-floor front window, and had a clear view of Mrs. Peake's house—I saw the prisoner descend the area, remain below for a few minutes, and then return into the street—then he beckoned to a man who was standing about four doors off, and both went down the area steps together—I should think they were in the house for about ten minutes—then I saw the prisoner</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hodson, of 14, Lyndhurst Road, Peckham—Annie 'Bedford is my servant—on Thursday afternoon, 13th July, about 3 o'clock, she went out for a walk, with my children—I was in my room the whole time she was absent—my bedroom window is over the portico—my watch and chain, two brooches, and three rings, worth between 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were then safe; also two purses, containing 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my desk was safely fastened—I went down and opened the door for my nurse, when she returned, and, after going down to the nursery, and speak<lb/>ing to my little girl, returned to my room, not having been absent ten minutes, for I had looked at my watch before leaving my room—when I re<lb/>turned, I heard a rustle, and saw something like an elbow passing out at the window—my desk was wrenched open, on the bed, my papers were scattered about, my watch case and ring case were empty—two purses had been emptied of the money, and were left behind—one ring was left behind—the gate bell had been broken some time; I remember the prisoner coming and asking to mend it—I recognized him directly, at the station—I do not recol<lb/>lect having any talk with him, but he stood some time at the gate, and would not take "No" for an answer—it was broad daylight—I think he must have been more than once, as I recognised him so soon—I only said "No" to him from the window—I did not see anything of him on 30th July—I afterwards saw him in the dock, and recognized him directly—to the best of my belief, he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am Mr. Hodson's servant—on 30th July, I went out with the children in the afternoon—I returned about 4 o'clock, and' saw a pony and cart standing still in the square, about fifty yards from the home, and saw a man sitting in the cart—when I passed into the house, I saw the prisoner in the next garden, standing against the fence, and looking up at our portico and the windows—I passed about three yards from him—saw me, because when I looked at him, he walked away towards the gate, but he did not go out in my presence; he looked down at the ground—it was bright weather, and broad daylight—my mistress came down to let me in, and the prisoner was still in the garden, walking very slowly, and looking down at the ground—he wore dark clothes, and a very thick gold Albert chain—I did not see him again till he was in custody, on 8th August, when I was taken to Carter Street police-station, and saw seven or eight persons with hats on—I recognized him the moment I entered the door, but I was too frightened to speak, and did not say anything—he was wearing a hat too—Sergeant Ham said, "Is there anyone you know here"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Is this the man?" and went close up by the prisoner's side—I said, "Yes"—I had not said or done anything, or pointed to anyone, to let him know which it was.</p>

On Sunday morning, 8th August, about 7 o'clock, I went with Ranger to 8, West Place, West Square, St. George's Road, Southwark; that is about a mile and a half from Lyndhurst Road, Pcokham—we rushed up stairs, and in the second floor back room, we found the prisoner, lying in bed—I said, "Now, <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> get up, we want you for being concerned with another man in breaking into a house in the Lyndhurst Road, on 30th of last month, by means of climbing the portico, and stealing a quantity of jewellery"—he said, "I do not know what you mean"—I then saw Ranger find this bag hanging by the side of the bed, containing these housebreaking implements and skeleton keys—I said, "And there was another job done at Lewisham last night, but I cannot tell you the particulars of it now"—when Ranger found the bag, he said, "What is this, <hi rend="italic">Billy?</hi>—he said, "Oh, that is nothing"—in the bag were these two <hi rend="italic">jemmies</hi> and other housebreaking implements—this centre bit was found in a box in the front room up stairs, a large quantity of large skeleton keys, the keyhole saw, which is to saw the holes larger after the centre bit has made them—I took the prisoner to the station—the inspector placed him among a number of others, and Radford was sent for—I told the prisoner that he could place himself where he liked, and then left the room—one man was a milkman, another was a man who works about the</p>

               <p>yard, and the rest were policemen out of uniform—Radford Went in, looked them down, and at once east her eyes on the prisoner, and said, "That is the man there, but I do not think that is the hat he had on then"—I gave him another hat, and she said, "Now I am positive it is the man"—I had brought the hat from his house—it is not here—I forgot to bring it—I took this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> to Mr. Hodson's—he fitted it to the marks on the desk, and it corresponded—that was on Sunday, two or three hours after I took the prisoner, and nine days after the robbery—on 31st July, the day after the robbery, I looked at the spot where the servant said that she saw a man standing—it was an empty house, and I saw footmarks of one person, and another print where a person had got over to Mr. Hodson's side—it appeared to be the same footmark on each side, as if the same person had stepped over—I examined the portico, and found that some person had climbed up and made marks—Radford had given me a de<lb/>scription of the person, and also of a horse and cart—and Mrs. Hodson described a man who had come to ask if he might mend the bell—that description, and other circumstances, induced me to apprehend the prisoner—I have seen him a great many times with a man with a horse and cart, and have followed them—the horse is a fast trotter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Russell Street, Rotherhithe, and am a clothier—about five minutes to 12 o'clock on 17th August—I came home with a friend—I wished him good night at my shop door, and he went away—a man came in and inquired the price of a pair of trowsers—he said he did not want to purchase them then—the two prisoners came in while he was speaking, and they then began to talk politics—I told them I was no politi<lb/>cian, and then they began talking about Gladstone making rules and regula<lb/>tions that foreigners are able to take possession of English ground—I told them I was no law maker or breaker, and asked them to be kind enough to leave, as I wanted to go to rest—with that they all throe began making use of very bad language—I said, "I don't want such bad language here"—they then began making use of worse expressions, and I told them if they did not go out, I should shove them out—Henderson was sitting on a chair—I took hold of Hasluck and the other, and shoved them out—Henderson said he would not go—I got him by the collar and shoved him out, and shut the door—he sang out, "My finger is in the door"—I opened it again, about an inch, and shut it again—they then began kicking and knocking at the door, until they burst it open—I went out to see if I could see a policeman, and give them in charge—I went about five or six yards down the street—they "to away when I opened the door—I saw thorn coming back towards me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200116"/>
               <p>and Henderson said, "Take this, <hi rend="italic">Joe,</hi> and put it into his b—head; he has squeezed my finger"—I got to the front of the shop, and Hasluck was from the other side of the road, with a knife, and stabbed me in the head over the left eye, and on the side of the eye—I put up my hand to defend myself, and got a stab in the wrist—there are several cuts on my coat sleeve, which I received in defending my head—I found I was bleeding, and ran across the road to a chemist's shop—Haaluck and the others all ran away, I knocked at the door of the chemist's shop, and the landlord from the public-house next door came on and took me in—he dressed my wounds; and from that I was insensible and remember no more until I found myself at home, next morning—when I went out, after the prisoners had burst the door open, there was no one else in the street—it was dark, and the shops in the street were shut—I did not use any violence to the prisoner, beyond shoring them out of the shop.</p>

I reside at 4, Park Place, Rotherhithe, and am a Custom House officer—on the morning of 18th August I was on duty at the gate of the tidal basin of the Commercial Docks—I saw Henderson with a boy—he came up to the gate and asked the watchman on duty something—the gate was not opened—my attention was called to his hand, by his calling out—he seemed to be suffering pain—Hasluck and the mate of another ship came up, and Henderson and the boy walked from the gate on to the pier head, and sat on the capstan bar, about twenty yards from the gate—281 <hi rend="italic">R</hi> came running up to the gate, out of breath, and said to the watch-man, "Hare you let anyone in?"—he said, "No"—I fetched Henderson from the pier head, and gave him into custody—I said, "This man has had his finger cut"—he gave the other man into my custody, and we took the two prisoners down to Mr. Lemon's—204 <hi rend="italic">R</hi> came in after we had been in the shop about ten minutes—I did not know that Henderson was mate of the <hi rend="italic">Havelock</hi>—I can't swear that there was a ship of that name in the docks—when I went to him he said he had been hit on the back and arm, and if there was any stabbing it was done after he left—the policeman had said that Lemon was stabbed—I said to Henderson, "There is a Mr. Lemon down Russell Street has been stabbed, how did you get your finger hurt!—he said, "I will come along with you, I am innocent of it"—and so he said when I gave him into custody.</p>

I was on duty in Trinity Street, on 17th August—between 12 and 1 o'clock, I received information, and went to Bolton's public-house, and found Lemon there, wounded—I went to his wife, received some information from her, and went towards the docks—I saw Henderson sitting on the pier-head, and he was brought to me by the last witness—I asked him to assist me, and we went towards Lemon's—as we were going I saw Hasluck under the bridge, and we took him with us—I saw the two knives given up—they were taken from Henderson—Mrs. Lemon was in the shop, and she pointed to Hasluck and said, "That is the man who stabbed Lemon"—I did not see a boy with Henderson at the dock-head—he was with another man—he did not say anything to me.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 221, New Kent Road—on the morning of 22nd August, I was called to Eliza Raven—her arm appeared to be burnt with gunpowder, from the elbow to the back of the hand—I should say that the marks were done by coarse gunpowder—I do not think it could have been caused by anything else—at first, it appeared that there might have been shot, but afterwards it appeared to be only coarse gunpowder—I examined the sister; she was injured just under her chin, and there were a few spots on her face, not burnt, but having the appearance of shot—I think it is possible that coarse gunpowder would inflict the injury—the girls were not seriously injured.</p>
