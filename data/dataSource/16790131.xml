            </rs>, to which they pleaded Not Guilty; but the Evidence against him was very clear and apparent, for it was prov'd that Mr. Foulks was left Guardian to the Gentlewoman Arraign'd with him, and making use of some Authority might be challenged from that trust, he with that, and urgent intreaties, gaind so far on her, as at last to debauch her to his bed, and had used that familiarity so often that at last she prov'd with Child, which not willing his neighbours should be acquainted with, he brought her (under pretence of preferring her) to London, and took Lodgings for her in York Buildings in the Strand, resolving to stay with her till the pains of Delivery should be over, at length the fatal hour of her dreaded Travel approacht, and she by her lowd shrieks began to call for the welcome assistance of her own Sex, which is both decent and necessary in cases of that nature, but that it seems was utterly denied her by Mr. Foulks, who sternly oblig'd her to silence, protesting no body should perform that Office but himself. What pangs the poor woman endured by so painful a Delivery is best judg'd by those who have been experienced in those labours; but the wicked intent of this barbarous usage, could referr to nothing but the designed destruction of the unfortunate babe, whom he no sooner receiv'd into the world; but he cruelly cram'd it down a house of Office; this was absolutely prov'd against him by several witnesses, nor was it deny'd by the miserable Gentlewoman, who was altogether ignorant of what he had done, till he himself had inform'd her what he had done with the murdered infant; the next morning when as he thought he had done his business very securely, he went down into Shropshire, but had not been long there, before the indisposition of the green woman, gave her attendant sufficient evidence she had been Delivered of a Child, which at last she confest; and it being thus positively prov'd against him, he was <rs id="t16790131-2-verdict10" type="verdictDescription">

            </rs> officiously attended with the terrible Ritinue of pain and ignomie, did not half so much affright him as the suddenness of it; that it was Judgement and not death that dejected him; however, he was not so discouraged but that he presently set himself about disposing his Soul onto a fit posture to take her everlasting flight, which he concluded would have been with the Other Offenders on the next Wednesday after the Friday on which he received Sentence, so short a time of preparation therefore made him swift in it, that he would hardly afford himself time either to eat, drink or sleep, but thought every Minute ill spent wherein he did not exercise that Pennitence, Sorrow, and contrition of spirit which was becomming so great an Offender, so that like holy David, he could truly say that Tears were his meat and drink day and night. He was often heard to bemoan next to his guilt, that disgrace and ignomy his bad example might draw on the worthy Members of the Church; but he hoped that to the wise and Learned, his single failing would bring no scandal or reproach, on those wholesome Principles which utterly forbid all such wild extravagancies: and that these hopes be more comfortably persisted in, as well because of his unfeigned sorrow, and Repentance for his horrid crime, as that the Doctrine Discipline, the Orders and Canons of the Church of England do in themselves appear to all men so exactly fit for the promotion and incouragement of Holiness Sobriety, Chastity, and all kind of Christian Virtues which contribute to a good Life; that she would be able to vindicate her self against all Scandals and Reproaches which might be thrown on her either by his or any other particular members misdemeanour.</p>
               <p>By this decent behaviour, and exceeding others in Piety and Repentance, he became generally pitted by all that came near him, or heard of him, but amongst the rest, many Eminent Divines in London came to visit him, and being incouraged by those unusual signs of remorse and penitency which they beheld in him, they agreed on a private Fast to be kept in Newgate for him, which was accordingly performed, he joining with them in a more fervent manner that ever was observed in any in his condition.</p>
               <p>When the succeeding Wednesday, on which he thought he should have dy'd, was come, instead of the sad news of Execution, he had <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16790131006"/>brought him a Reprieve, which suspended him for about Nine dayes longer, at which he was very much rejoyced, not that he had any hopes or desire to live, but that he might be the more prepared to dy, and as if he had no other thoughts indeed, he grew still more earnest and laborious to make his Cutting and Election sure than ever, imploying on himself long and voluntary Fasts, both from sleep and sustenance, that he might not lose any of that welcome time, indulgent Authority had so graciously afforded him.</p>
               <p>And that he himself might proclaim his Repentance as low'd as the world had his crime, when he had spent great part of the day in Prayer and Ejaculations he imploy'd the other part of it and most of the night in writing down his Meditations, and what ever else he thought might be powerful to perswade all men, in time from committing his sins, lest when it is too late, they share with him in his guilt and sufferings, to which end he sent pious Letters to his Wife, Children and Parishoners, meerly for that purpose.</p>
               <p>But still zealous that all himself could perform for the expiation of this publick, as well as other his private sins, he was careful to prepare an excellent Prayer fitted for his occasion, which he transcribed with his own hand, and caused to be sent to most Churches in London, on the 30th of January, that being a Fast day strictly kept for the Murder of King Charles the First, so that by this means he was earnestly pray'd for, through the whole City; To conclude, there was nothing of Piety omitted by him which could possibly have been performed by or expected from him, either as he was a Christian, a Minister, or one so near his end.</p>
               <p>To Conclude, When the fatal and appointed day of Execution came, he was brought out of the Press-Find about ten of the Clock in the Morning; and in a Coach conveyed to Tyburn, accompanied thither with several Eminent Divines, who were mightily satisfied to see him cheerfully undergoe that great Work, with that constant Piety and Resolution which he had Exercised in Newgate. When he was got on the Ladder, he made a very excellent Speech to the People, to disswade them from those wicked courses which had brought him to that ignominious End. The perticulars cannot be expected here, but the sum of it was this.</p>

               <p>I Am deservedly brought hither this day to suffer Death for a crime which deserves that Punishment by the Law, and I thank my great God I am too conscious of my own guilt in the least to deny but that both by the Laws of God and man, I have thereby forfeited that Life which I am now going to lay down; the horrid sin that I was sentenced for, was its true very great in it self, but yet is much aggravated being done by one of my Function or Calling, and it is one of the greatest fears I have now left me in the world, least my Example should contract any contempt on the Renowned Clergy-men of England. Ah Sirs, it was not the Church, but one of her unworthy members that committed this heynous offence; and therefore whatever you think me, for God sake let her remain pure and unblemisht, as indeed she is, in your hearts and minds: Had I followed the wholesome Principles she enjoyes, both me and all men too, I had not been in this place upon this occasion; but here are several Learned and pious Ministers that can in part manifest my cordial and unfeigned sorrow, for having thus shamefully offended both God and her; and I hope the great God, whose face I trust I shall in a few minutes behold, doth both see my contrition, and will through the benefits of the blood of Jesus accept me for it, Oh therefore I beseech you, if my ill Example has disrepresented her, let my last Penitence and dying hatred and abhorrency of so black a sin recommend her again to your practise and obedience, without which you must never expect to be happy.</p>
               <p>His Speech was much longer, but the greatness of the crowd hindred us from hearing all, but the substance we have here Related. After he had thus done he pray'd very earnestly, and then <rs id="t16790131-2-punish13" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>Thus ended this unfortunate Gentleman, who by the temptations of Satan was thus brought like Holy David into the horrid sin a Adultery, but as his sin resembled his so did his Repentance, and we hope they are both now singing Hallelujahs in the glorious Region of Eternal joy.</p>
