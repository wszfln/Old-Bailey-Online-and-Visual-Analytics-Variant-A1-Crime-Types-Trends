The prisoner was in my employ as laundress, since last March, at a salary of fifteen guineas a year—when I went the circuit in the summer, I left her in possession of the key of my plate-chest—I returned in about a month, then went abroad, and did not come back till last November term—on my return, having some friends to dinner, I observed some imitation silver forks on the table, which I thought very odd, as I had not used any for some time—next morning I looked at my plate-chest, and found a great portion of my forks and spoons missing, in consequence of which I asked the prisoner what had become of the silver—she said she had taken it home to clean—I thought nothing more about it till next day, when I looked at the plate-chest again, and the plate seemed all right, except two forks—when the prisoner came, I asked her where those two forks were—she said she supposed she had left them at home—I told her to go and fetch them—she went out and returned—I asked if she had brought them—she said, "No," she would go and fetch them—but before she went she asked if I would advance 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of her wages, which I hesitated to do—she went out, and returned with what I thought to be two silver forks, which she put into the chest—I looked at the chest, and the plate seemed all right then—as I was going to lock the chest, I saw one of the forks sticking up, I looked at it and said, "This is not silver"—she said, "Is it not?"—I examined them, and found they were all imitation forks, substituted for the silver ones—I asked her what had become of the silver forks—she said, "It is better to</p>

               <p>confess the truth"—(I did not ask her to confess)—I said, "You have pawned them"—she said nothing to that, except, "Don't do any thing to me"—I said "Go and fetch the plate, or I will go to the police"—I went away, to consult a friend what I should do, and then came back—the prisoner returned soon after, and gave me a bundle of duplicates, re<lb/>lating to my plate—I lost a great deal—I think there were twenty-four silver forks, but I forget the exact number—she left very few remaining—I missed the articles stated, in fact half the plate was taken away.</p>

On the 10th of December I was working between Hampstead and Camden Tows—I had a shovel—I put it into a heap of sand, to hide it, on Friday night, the 10th of December—it was gone in the morning—this now produced is it—I had cut these holes in it myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Norand Arms public-house, Kensington. The prisoner was my pot-boy about six months ago—on the 21st of December I found my wine-cellar door forced open from the inside—I found the rum cask tapped, which I had left full—I dipped it, and found two or three gallons gone—I missed a basket, with twelve bottles of champaigne, and a few bottles of port and sherry—I sent to the station—this wine and basket of rum is mine—I have no doubt of it—the basket is certainly mine—I did not go down to the cellar on Tuesday—on the Wednesday morning I went down, and found it as I have stated—nobody but those acquainted with the place could have known how to get down—they got in from a back area, covered with boards and stones.</p>

Busby and Jennings—among other articles there were ladies' boas, capes and shawls, all far, two short lengths of velvet, and some collars—they were to be forwarded by Ward's wagon, from the Rose inn, Smithfield—here is a ticket which came to me with the goods to be packed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at three boas</hi>)—among the goods I packed there were boas of this description—here are two light squirrel boas, and one mock sable—I believe the value of the goods in the box to be about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On the 1st of November last I was wagoner of the Gloucester wagon as far as Loud water, and had been so about four months—I succeeded Steptoe, but not for a month or six weeks after—about three weeks before the 1st of November, Steptoe and I were in the Rose yard—he said he could put me in a way of getting out of my trouble, and putting a bit of money in my pocket—I was in trouble at that time—I had not long lost my wife—he did not then say how it was to be done—I understood what be meant—I knew what he intended to do by what he said—he said he could put me in a way of helping me out of my trouble, and putting a little money in my pocket by taking something out of the wagon—I refused it then—he repeated that to me on three different occasions, and I refused—before the 1st of November I saw all the prisoners on the same subject—there was no appointment to meet anywhere on Monday the 1st of November—we did all meet at Mr. Rudd's public-house, in Newgate-street, adjoining the market, near to where we unload the wagon—nothing passed about the wagon or goods at Rudd's—we separated there—I went to the Rose inn with the wagon—I had been to Newgate street with it—we always draw it there to be unloaded of the meat which comes up from the country—after I had taken the wagon home I went to a public-house in Warwick-lane—Sharmancame to me there and said, "We have got a bale <hi rend="italic">as</hi> will just suit us"—I said, "Very well"—I agreed to it—I had been acquainted with Sharman, and knew he was a porter at the King's Arms' public-house—I then went to the Rose—I saw nothing more of Sharman till the wagon was loaded and started—when I got to the Rose I saw Griffin, and after the wagon was loaded he told me that he had loaded the bale of silk and the box in the wagon just right behind—the box had not been mentioned in the morning—Griffin first mentioned the box to me in the Rose-yard—he said he had put them right, behind, and they would be handy to take out when we got to the Gloucester—some straw was put in the tail of the wagon for the guard—I did not myself see the box and bale put in—we started about half-past five, and went to the Green Man and Still, in Oxford-street—I then sent the guard on to the Gloucester ware-house—it was not usual to send him there from the Green Man—I sent him because we were going to take these things out of the wagon—I thought it would be convenient to get rid of him—he was to go from the Gloucester to Williams's, Andover-house, in the Bayswater-road—he went on before, and I followed with the wagon—after he was gone I saw Shar-man</p>

               <p>at the Green Man alone—it was then about twenty minutes to seven—I did not speak to him—I went on to the Gloucester, and saw him again there, with a man and a horse and cart—I did not know that man—I did not stop at the Gloucester—I drove the wagon just by—I saw Sharman get into the wagon, and put out the bale of silk and the box, which he gave to the other man, who was in the cart—we then all went into a public-house opposite the Gloucester-hotel, and bad something to drink—the Gloucester-warehouse adjoins the Gloucester-hotel—after we had—the drink they went away with the bale and the box, and I went on with the wagon to Williams's—I there found the guard—he said he thought there was something taken out of the wagon—I said, "Nonsense, what makes you think that?"—we went on to Loud water—I did not go farther than Loudwater—I lodge at Mrs. Turner's there, at the back of the White Blackbird public-house—on the 4th of November I was ill, and remained so for a fortnight—I saw Griffin there, during that fortnight, at the White Blackbird—we had something to drink, and Griffin said they had sold the box for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the bale of silk; that they had been bid 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, which they refused, and had taken it down into—Kent, and <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—he told me Mr. Ward had been writing up some letters about these things being missing, and he told me that the silk was not found out then—he asked me whether I wanted any money—I said no, not then, I had got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—I received a sovereign from him a week after, and before that I had received two sovereigns from the wa goner, John Maynard—when he brought me the first sovereign he said, "I have brought a sovereign from your brother William, which Henry Griffin gave me;" and he told me the same when he brought me the other—On the day the things were stolen I saw Steptoe against the Rose gateway, and he said he would make it all right with me, for he would go and cut the ropes on the other man's ground—he said he should go down by the rail-road and meet the wagon at Wheatley, which is beyond Loud-water—when I got well I came up to London—I had before that received a message from Mr. Ward, by Smith, to know whether I knew any thing about it, and I denied any knowledge of it—when I came to town, after my illness, I saw Mr. Ward—he taxed me with it, and after some time I told him what I have now stated—I remember seeing Griffin inside the White Blackbird when Smith was there—I cannot tell what passed, for I was standing up against the fire, and they were in the passage—Smith did not speak to me then—he had no conversation with me—I did not hear what he said to Griffin, because I was as far as ten yards off—Griffin afterwards told me that Smith had told him the ropes were cut—he said no more about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are quite sure of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was all I heard about it—I had no conversation with Smith at the White Blackbird then about the robbery, nor in Griffin's presence at any lime—I several times had conversation with Smith about the ropes being cut, but never in Griffin's presence—I did not learn about the ropes being cut till a week after the robbery—there were no passengers in the wagon when the cart drove up—that I swear—we had some passengers after we went away from there, but there were no passengers in the wagon when the box and the bale were taken—I swear that—we took up four passengers at the Andover-house—we did not take up any more on the road—I swear that—there was one woman, not two—the guard saw me take up the</p>

               <p>passengers at Andover-house—after the robbery was committed, Shaman, I, and the other man went into a public-house opposite the Gloucester, and had something to drink—we were served by a waiter or barman, who had an opportunity of seeing us together—none of them are here to-day that I know of.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you tell me this instant that you said nothing at all in the conversation, but was ten yards off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in Griffin's presence—I can swear I did not—I did not hear what passed between Smith and Griffin—I was conversing with another man, an engineer at a paper-mill—I cannot say what answer Griffin made to Smith when Smith spoke to him about the ropes being cut—that was all I heard about it—Griffin made some answer, but I did not hear him, because I went away up to the fire-place—Smith asked me if I knew anything about the robbery, and I denied it—I denied it all through, till I was afraid Mr. Ward would have me taken up and tried for it—my mind was not at rest—I could not rest—I never committed any such deed in my life before, and my mind was very uneasy, I could not rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What, out of a religious feeling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I do not know about religious feeling—it was for fear of my personal safety—I cannot say whether I shall be prosecuted if the prisoners are acquitted—I should say not—I do not know why—I have told every thing that Steptoe and Griffin said to me on the subject of this robbery—I have kept nothing back.</p>

I look Steptoe into custody on Monday, the 29th of November, at his lodging, in Griffin's house, No. 28, Sharp's-alley—I found this dark boa there, not in the room in which Steptoe lodges, but in Griffin's sleeping-room, it was in a box under a table on the right-hand side of the room, going in at the door—I took Griffin the same day, at the Rose-inn in Smithfield, about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening—I took Sharman at the King's Arms public-house on Holborn-bridge—I searched his lodging at No. 6, Turn-again-lane, Farringdon-street, and there found these other two boas—I did not tell the prisoners what they were charged with when I took them—they said they did not know what they were taken into custody for—they said nothing more—I believe Steptoe has not a wife—Griffin has, and she told me it was their sleeping-room—it had the appearance of a room occupied by a female as well as a man, by the clothes about the room.</p>

On the morning of the 24th of December, Mr. Reynolds gave me a letter, which, in consequence of his directions, I placed among the prisoner's letters on his seat—I made an entry in a book, which I have here, of the address, and where it came from—I believe this to be the letter—I noticed that the r was left out in the word" Somers-town," and it appeared to me to contain coin—that coin was safe in it when I put it among his delivery letters—there was no appearance of any breaking of the seal, or displacement of the coin—I afterwards made inquiry at Brewer-street, to see if the letter had arrived there; and in consequence of what I heard there, I went to the prisoner's lodging, No. 6, Berkeley-street, Clerkenwell—I saw him there, and told him he must go with me to the Office respecting a letter that had been misdirected—he went with me—on the arrival of the officer, we were directed to go to Mr. Peacock's, the solicitor—Mr. Peacock asked the prisoner if Brewer-street, Somers-town was in his delivery—he said it was—Mr. Peacock then asked him if he had any letters that morning for Mr. Alden, of No. 27, in that street—he said he had not, that be knew the name in the street, but he had no letters for him—Mr. Peacock then said that an inquiry had been made for a letter supposed to contain coin, and directed to Mr. Alden, No. 27, Brewer-street—the prisoner said he had not seen it; if he had, it would have been delivered in the usual way—be gave no further account respecting the letter at that time.</p>

On Friday morning, the 24th of December, I was called into the solicitor's office, the prisoner's was there—I saw Mr. Cook going out as I came in—Mr. Pea<lb/>cock stated, that a money—letter had been addressed to a house in the prisoner's walk, and had not been delivered, in consequence of that, his person and house must be searched—the prisoner said, "Very well"—I took him into another room, searched him, and found several letters on him, and in his breast coat pocket a memorandum-book, also a gold sovereign, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—the sovereign was in his trowsers' pocket—I opened the memorandum-book, shook it, and a letter tumbled out—I have kept it ever since, and produce it—it has my name on it—when the letter fell out, I said, "What letter is this?"—he said, "That is the letter which has been inquired about with the sovereign"—he was then cautioned, that whatever he might say would be used either for or against him, and he said no more—the letter was just in the same state as it is now, open—here is a hole, where it appears something has been sewn round, just like a great O—the needle and thread have only gone through the inner leaf of the letter.</p>

It was my full intention on returning to my duty at half-past five o'clock, to have taken it to the President, whoever was on duty, and have stated to him, that just before my delivery I discovered the seal broken, and the sovereign visible, to know what I was to do with it, whether I should detain it until my morning delivery, or what I should do with it. I was so agitated when I went before the gentleman, that I hardly knew what I said, or I should have immediately taken it out of my pocket, and asked the gentleman what I should do with it. In coming from my lodging with Mr. Cook, I asked him if he knew what Mr. Kelly wanted with me; he said he thought it was respecting a money order I had the day before, which was directed to the receiving-house, No. 1, Pleasant-row, Bloomsbury. The morning previous he had told me that I might try it at No. 1, Pleasant-row, Battle-bridge; it was opened by Mr. Steed at the receiving-house; he did not know any thing about it; I took it to Mr. Playle, the inspector, on Friday morning; he wrote on it, 'Not for Mr. Steed,' and told me to take it to the Bloomsbury man. I put my signature to it, and I gave it to the Bloomsbury man; it was thinking of that when I was before the gentleman that caused me to be so agitated, or I should have brought out the other letter, to have asked what I was to do with it. I saw Mrs. Alden, as she as has stated; as I passed her, I said it was a mild morning, and I repassed her.'—R. <hi rend="smallCaps">HORTON."</hi>

On Thursday, the 23rd of December, about two o'clock, I was sitting in my dining-room at work—I saw a boy in the front court—I got up to see who it was, and saw another boy (the prisoner) get out of the area—I asked what he did there—he said be had dropped his cap, and bad got down to pick it up—I knew very well he had no right to be so near the window, and asked what he wanted—be said, "Indeed, Ma'am, I have dropped my cap, and I wished to pick it up"—my servant boy came in at the gate at the time—the prisoner ran away, and I beckoned to my servant to follow him, which he did—the area is not very large—there is only one window in it—it is not railed in—it is within a court-yard, about ten yards from the road—I had seen the area window shut shortly before—it opens into the kitchen—I went into the front court, looked down the area, and found the window open about a quarter of a yard, and missed two tea-spoons—I saw the prisoner about twenty minutes after at the station, and one spoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the prosecutor. I was called by my mistress and followed the prisoner about half a mile—he ran, and tried to get away, but I saw him caught just past the printing-office leading on to Shackle well Downs—as he was running I saw him put his hand to his pocket, take out two spoons, and try to throw them over a wall—one went over and one fell back—I did not pick it up, and do not know what became of it—I continued following the prisoner, calling "Stop thief"—I did not see him taken—after he threw the spoons away I caught hold of him—he said he had done nothing, and I let him go—the policeman came up, I told him, and he pursued him—I afterwards went into the garden where I saw the prisoner throw the spoon, and found it there—I took it to the stat ion, and it was shown to my mistress.</p>

On the 18th of December I was on duty in Charles-street, Drury-lane, and saw a cart standing near some buildings which were being pulled down—the name of John Donovan was on the cart—I saw the prisoners putting old flooring-boards into the cart, and some square pieces—they were parts of the buildings which were being pulled down—I stood in an alley opposite and watched them—they brought the wood out of a dark doorway in an alley, and then it was thrown into the cart by the three prisoners—I then went and asked who authorized them to take the wood away—Liddiard and Pink said Mr. Smith, their mas<lb/>ter—I asked what they were going to do with it—they said they were going to sell it for some beer—I told them I should take them into cus<lb/>tody—Pink and Liddiard said "Do not, for we shall get discharged"—I asked Donovan whether the cart belonged to him—he said it did—I got the assistance of another constable, and took them.</p>

I had a person named Welsh in custody on Sunday night, the 19th of December, and as I was taking him to prison I was surrounded by the prisoner and nine<lb/>teen or twenty men, in Brackley-street, Golden-lane—the prisoner was the first that came to rescue Welsh from me—he, had got a jacket on, and the prisoner came and cut the jacket, or tore it, and got him loose—I had a staff in my hand, with the string round my hand—I think the prisoner cut it from my hand, and took it from me, and ran away, which caused Welsh to escape—I was not much hurt, but I sprained my ankle—the staff was the property of the Mayor and Commonalty of London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with my brother Thomas; we are cabinet-makers, and live in Gray's Inn-road. On Wednesday evening, the 15th of December, I was going to my stable—as I opened the door the prisoner was at work behind it—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "There is an escape of gas, I work for the gas company"—I said, "Take care, do it properly"—I went away, and when I returned the po<lb/>liceman had him in charge for stealing the pipe—he said, "Do you know this man?"—I said, "I only know him by his saying he worked for the company"—this is the pipe that was fixed to my building, and the brass cock attached to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> As I was going by, one of his men said, "Are you a gas<lb/>man?" I said, "Yes." He said, "We have an escape of gas." This gentleman said, "Take the pipe up, it is worn out." I said, "Yes, it is." I expected he would give me that for my trouble. I said I worked for the company, which I do, but I do not belong to them. <hi rend="italic">Witness,</hi> I said, "That pipe is not going up again, it had better be taken away."</p>

About half-past two o'clock on the 15th of December, I met the prisoner with this pipe on his shoulder, and having lost so many pipes out of Southampton-street I stopped him—I offered him half-a-crown if he would go with me before my commissioners, who were then sitting, to pay him for his trouble, if he was innocent—he went very quietly, and when he came near the place he showed me where he took this pipe down—he said a gentleman told him to do so—I said "What gentleman?"—he pointed towards Mr. Seddons, but I saw no one.</p>

On Friday, the 17th of December, about a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, I was at the top of Wentworth-street, White-chapel, walking down the street, towards my home—two young men met me, and one of them put his hand into my pocket—I asked what they wanted—they said my money—I said they should not have it—they threatened to kill me if they did not have it—they ill-used me, and knocked me about dreadfully, got me down, kicked me, ill-used me very much, and left me in the road—they took from my pocket a knife, three sixpences, and one or two halfpence—I saw the prisoner on Saturday at Worship-street—I could not swear to his being one of the persons who robbed me, for I was smothered with mud and blood at the time—I believe he is one of the persons, but I was so ill-used I could not say—I was not sober, but I knew what I was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-binder, and live at No. 1, Old Nicol-street. On Friday night, the 17th of December, I was coming home rather late, and passing by Wentworth-street, I heard a great scuffle down the street—I turned down to see what it was, and saw two men shaking the prosecutor several times—after they shook him, they knocked him down three times—he got up, and asked them what they wanted—they said, "Your money, or your life"—he said he should not give it to them—they then knocked him down again, dragged him across the road, and told him, if he offered to halloo, they would have his life—I saw a policeman at the top of the street, and told him there was a man knocked down, and went with him to see—the two men were then gone—the prosecutor was standing on the edge of the curb—I had not known either of the two men before—the policeman went to two houses to look for them, he came back again, and, a few yards from the top of the street, I saw the prisoner and another man striking another man, near to where they were before—I showed them to the policeman—I am quite sure the prisoner is one of the men that had been striking the prosecutor—I told the policemen so, and they took him to the station—I was on the other side of the way when the two men were ill using the prosecutor, right opposite to them—it is not a very narrow street—a woman was standing at a door, with a candle in her hand, at the time they knocked him down—I saw the faces of the men, and am quite sure of the prisoner.</p>

About the middle of November the prisoner, Ann Gifford, (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 390,) came to me for a situation—we agreed on the wages—she gave me a reference to a lady, at No. 45, North<lb/>ampton-square, Clerkenwell—it was at eleven o'clock precisely when she left my house, and I appointed to see her again at the lady's house, where I was going for her reference—she was to was there till I went and received her answer, on my ascertaining the truth of the reference—I went, but found no such place in Northampton-square, as she referred me to—there are but thirty-six houses in the square—I found no such person as the lady she referred me to—I returned home about half-past four, and missed my husband's silver watch from the drawing-room mantel-piece, and nice spoons, out of the plate-basket in the kitchen—they were safe when I left the house—I had given the spoons to the servant to clean, and they were placed on the kitchen dresser—I saw the watch safe on the drawing-room mantelpiece.</p>

               <p>my mistress had gone out—I went to the door and said my mistress was not at home—she said she had seen my mistress in the court, and she had told her she was to come and wait till she came back, and that she was to go into the same room as she was in in the morning—believing what she said, I showed her into the drawing-room, which was the room she had been in before—in about a quarter of an hour she came down into the kitchen to me, and said she could not wait any longer, for she should be too late for the train, and if she was too late for the train she would call again in the evening—I did not miss the spoons till after my mistress missed the watch—I had seen them safe when I was in the kitchen.</p>

The prisoner came to our shop last Friday—I did not know him before—I was at dinner—a note was brought in to me by my boy from the shop—immediately on opening it I saw it was a forgery—I sent him into the shop, and immediately followed him, with the note in my hand—I saw the prisoner—I said, "Have you brought this note from Place and Carberry?" (from whom it purported to come)—he said "Yes"—I asked him who gave him the order—he said a man at Charing-cross had given it to him—I said it was rather odd a man at Charing-cross should give him the order to come to me, and asked where he was to take the goods when he got them—he said, "To Place and Carberry"—I said it was a forgery, sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—(<hi rend="italic">note read</hi>)—"16, Charing-cross, 31st December, 1841.

It appears from the note, it does not express that I was positively to receive the goods, they are to be sent or delivered to the bearer.

On the 27th of December I went to dine a friend, and got drunk—I left my friend's house about seven o'clock—I had one friend with me part of the way, intending to go to the theatre—I lost my friend, and went to a place which I understood was the Lowther-rooms—there was dancing and music going on—I sat with the musicians—I was so drunk I did not know what I was about—I was put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from the Lowther-rooms, and the <hi rend="italic">cab-man</hi> put me down a short distance from Bow-street, as I bad no money to pay him, he put me into the hands of a policeman—I was not quite senseless drunk—the jumbling about awoke me—I went to the station, and told them the situation I was in, and if they went to the George Inn, in the Borough, they might have the money for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had lost a ring, a watch, some money, a pocket-book, pencil-case, and knife—I recollect pulling my watch out in the street after leaving my friend, and I pulled out my purse in the Lowther-rooms, to pay for some stout and gin—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the pocket-book, and another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my pocket—I had them in the Lowther-rooms—the gin and stout <hi rend="italic">finished me</hi> completely—I missed them all when I went to the station at Bow-street—that was about four o'clock in the morning—I then went to a friend's in Lower Thames-street, and he advised me to go to the station, and to the Lowther-rooms also—we got some little information, and he begged of me to endeavour to find the man—I did not go before the Justice till the 4th of January—I was sober then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On the Thursday the officer came to me, and said, "There was a man with one eye in the Lowther-rooms, were you there?" I said "Yes." "Then," said he, "you must come with me for a robbery;" they got talking to the prosecutor. The purse he swore to is my own. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was only one ring on the purse—I found the other broken in my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I went after Cook—I then went to George-yard, and found one sack in the stable and one in the loft, but neither of those was the sack that Taylor was indicted for stealing—there are two sacks here that Taylor was indicted for, but the bill was thrown out for the two that were found in the stable—this is the sack that was found in the loft—this I can swear to—there was corn in it then—Mr. White said he had every reason to believe it was his corn—the sack he was satisfied was his—I did not see the prisoner till last night.</p>

On the morning of the 4th of January I was on duty in Regent-square, St. Pancras; about a quarter before eight o'clock, the prisoner Iron came with an empty basket past No. 46, Regent-square, he looked down the area, went further on, returned, and passed several times—he went down a court in Sidmouth-street, returned again about twenty-five minutes after eight, and went to the area gate, he again looked down, and stepped back—he went to the gate again—it appeared to be opened by somebody—he went down the area, and came up in about seven minutes, with the basket full of coals—I went up to him, and told him he must go to the station—he asked what for—I said, "On suspicion of stealing the coals"—on the way to the station, he said if I would let him go he would never do it again—I took the female prisoner into custody at Mr. Knight's house, No. 46.</p>

On Christmas-day the prisoner came, at the time of delivering the baking—he did not ask for any particular dish, but stood there—the man asked him what he had brought—he said, "I brought it, that is it," pointing to a round dish of flank of beef and potatoes—it was put on the board, and he took it—I am sure he had not brought any thing—I had not seen him—I knew him before about the neighbourhood—Mrs. Killduff afterwards came, and her meat was not to be found—I did not lose any other joint that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place; I have been living at Camden Town for two months, and left my place last Thursday; I now live in Tottenham-place, Tottenham-court-road. On Sunday evening I bad been into the City to see a few friends, who I lodged with when I came up to London, and was returning home at eleven o'clock in the evening—I saw a man in Tottenham-court-road, and asked him what the time was—he told me—while I was talking to him, a man came up with some tarts for sale—I bought one of him for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I took from my pocket—I did not take more money out—I had five shillings and two sixpences loose in my pocket—I felt it when I took out the penny-piece—I had more half-pence there—I asked the man who told me the time if he would take a little of my tart—I had began to eat it—he refused, and offered to treat me to something to drink for my kindness—he was a respectable looking nan—I refused to have any thing to drink, and in the meantime the pri<lb/>soner came up—she was dressed as she is now, only with a bonnet on—she shook hands with the man—he asked her to go and have something to drink, and told her he had been asking me, and I had refused—she said, "Come along, my dear, I will see you are righted"—I did not understand what that meant—I went with her to a public-house in Tottenham-court-road—I do not know the name of it—we had a quartern of rum there, a glass each—we then came out, and I found the rum took an effect on me—it rather overcame me, not being used to it—I had not drank any thing more in the course of the day—I was turning to go home, which was not far from there, and the prisoner called me—I was very cold at the time, and asked if I could go any where to warm myself—I did not know whether there would be a fire at my lodging—I lodge with another female—the prisoner called me and said she would take me to warm myself—I went with her and the man into another public-house—I do not know the name of the street—they took me down two or three streets—there was a fire there, but we did not go to warm ourselves—they had a quartern of rum, and asked me to take some, but I did not—they drank it—I drank nothing there—we came out, and I asked the prisoner to direct me to Tottenham-court-road—she said, "Yes, come with me, I will take you there"—the man said he was going to a friend's house, and we were to go together—we all three went together—they took me down a street, knocked at a door, and a widow came to the door—the prisoner said, "I shan't go in, you shall go in, you will get op better than me, I will wait"—I did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030112"/>
               <p>what she meant—I and the man went into the passage, and the man was talking to the woman—she wanted 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him, and he would only give a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they talked about a room, and when I heard that I thought it was a disreputable house, and I returned out—the man followed me out, and immediately I got out I met the prisoner, but I never saw the man again—I told the prisoner I was very cold, and asked her if she could take me somewhere to warm myself, or tell me my right road—she said, "Come with me and I will," and in the meantime I searched my pocket—my money was quite safe—we were walking down the street, and I felt her hand in my pocket—I am a stranger in London—I have only been here two months—I came from Gloucester—I am twenty-two years old—I lived with Madame Niblet, at Gloucester, two years and a half.</p>

The prosecutrix and I were both tipsy—I left her talking to the man: she proposed going into the house with him, and said, "If I get half-a-sovereign, I will give you half of it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is very wrong—the prisoner did not appear tipsy when I met her, nor afterwards—I was not locked out of my lodging—I had the key to get into the house—I never saw the prisoner before—I never said any thing about half-a-sovereign to her—she said, "You ought to have got</p>

               <p>half-a-sovereign out of him"—I understood what that meant, and I told her I did not know but it was a respectable house—the man had not said any thing to me before I went in; but, speaking to the woman as he did, I thought it was a disreputable house, and turned out—I thought I was going to warm myself, I did not know he wanted any thing improper—I did Dot suspect any thing of the sort till then—I am not often out at late as that, and was never spoken to so before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and carry on business in Great James-street, Bedford-row.

               <p>is his varnish, and only his—I know his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this is his writing—it begins, "Mr. Price Humphreys bought of Field and Montgomery."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you, then, mean to represent that this is Mr. William Montgo<lb/>mery's property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; not Field and Montgomery's—Field was a former partner of Mr. Montgomery's—this purports to be a bill of parcels of 197 gallons of varnish, making Price Humphreys debtor, and Field and Montgomery creditors—that is not the price of the goods I have men<lb/>tioned—this is 114lbs. at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the amount here is 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have seen this paper before—these are my figures on it—I saw this for the first time on the morning of the 7th—I saw Mr. William Montgomery on this subject about ten days or a fortnight before the 7th—I saw him in my own office—I believe Mr. Field was in London at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray, in case you should not recover the value of these goods, do you hold yourself personally liable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not consider myself liable, from any act of mine, for the value of these goods, or any part of them—I do not consider that Mr. William Montgomery would have a claim on me for parting with the goods without his authority—I under<lb/>stand Mr. Scott Montgomery is a distant relation of Mr. William Mont<lb/>gomery's—I did not, on the prisoner's promise to pay the cash that night, draw out an order and deliver it to Mr. Scott Montgomery—I drew up a list, but not an order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. I am using your own words. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Then this is the way to take it, for this is the fact; I gave Mr. Scott Montgomery the list of the goods, and at the same time directed him to deliver those goods, and I suppose that is what is called making up the order, or draw<lb/>ing it—if they have put it down too short I am very sorry for it—when the prisoner came to me on the 7th, he produced the bill endorsed by Mr. Gabriel—Mr. William Montgomery told me that the prisoner had given references to three persons before this transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner offer to give you his bill for 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as well as the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill endorsed by Gabriel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If that makes up the 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he did offer me that, and that I declined—I offered, on that occasion, to take his promissory-note for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and to deliver him 125 gallons of varnish out of the 197—I sent him to Mr. Scott Montgomery to get it—Mr. William Montgomery was a starch manufacturer at Belfast before he came to London, and entered into partnership with Mr. Field, who was a varnish manufacturer—that partnership terminated on the 28th of October—this varnish had been partnership property—it became otherwise by Mr. William Montgomery's appropriating it to his own use, under what he considered the terms of the old partnership deed—legally it must be consi<lb/>dered partnership property up to the day of the severance—I cannot point out any particular portion of the deed which entitled Mr. William Mont<lb/>gomery to appropriate it to himself—all the deed must be taken, and a legal construction put upon it—I should say it was almost an intricate question—when the partnership terminated, the accounts were to be made up in a certain way; and Mr. Montgomery, who supplied all the capital, was to take his capital out first, and therefore he took this—I think it may be called a question of construction of some nicety, because there is no par<lb/>ticularity in the deed—in no construction could it be said to belong to Mr. Field—this varnish was kept in the loft of an unused stable in Mr. Em<lb/>merson Tennent's mews—Mr. William Montgomery is a voter of Belfast;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030123"/>
               <p>and I believe it is very commonly the case for all Members of Parliament to grant any favours their constituents ask—I took the prisoner's promis<lb/>sory-note to Mr. William Montgomery, for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and have got it now—it is not due yet—I also took the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill endorsed by Gabriel, and have got that—that is not yet due—I took no other instrument from him—I have produced the cheque for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the whole of the security I held or have held—on his giving me the bill for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I sent him to Mr. Scott Montgomery to get the goods—he returned with Mr. Scott Montgomery, who said that Mr. Emmerson Tennent would not be teased with it, and he would not let part go without the whole—I had no direc<lb/>tions from Mr. William Montgomery to deliver the goods to him on receiv<lb/>ing his promissory-note for 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—not at any time—on his leaving town he told me to act as I thought best—when the pri<lb/>soner came on the second occasion he left roe the 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill till the morning—I kept it for the purpose of his getting the goods—I did not keep it ex<lb/>actly on finding that he could not get the goods, it made part of the con<lb/>tinued bargain—when he came the second time I negociated for the whole, when I found Mr. Tennent would not part with part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner at any time agree to take the whole of you, and pay it by giving the difference in money, or a cheque post-dated two or three days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He offered me a cheque, not post-dated two or three days, I think—I never agreed to such terms—he offered me a cheque, which I re<lb/>fused—I forget whether he proposed that it should be dated two or three days in advance—I cannot undertake to swear he did not—he did not pro<lb/>mise me a cheque dated two or three days in advance, nor did I on that endorse another order, on the order I had given him to Mr. Scott Mont<lb/>gomery for the 125 gallons—I gave Scott Montgomery the list because he asked me for it, for the purpose of attending with Mr. Humphreys next morning to deliver to him the things according to the list—he would not have got it just the same without receiving the list from me, because there was no one to deliver it to him—Mr. Tennent would not give the key to anybody but Scott Montgomery—he asked me for the list—I do not know why he wanted it</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the good of copying out a list of the different articles, if he was to have the whole? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot tell what the good was—I suppose he wanted to be particular to deliver the goods that were to be delivered—I did not send word to Mr. Scott Montgomery not to deliver the goods, upon finding I did not receive the money over-night, because I did not expect he would deliver them till I sent him word that I had received the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why give him authority to deliver them next morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was already a cavil about it—the prisoner promised me solemnly that he would send me the money, and, to save the time of running back<lb/>wards and forwards such a distance, I thought it would be as well to give Mr. Scott Montgomery authority to deliver the goods—he ought not to have delivered them till he knew I had received the money—I did not tell him so, but he heard the conversation that took place, which was quite sufficient for him to understand that he was not to deliver the goods unless he knew I had received the money—I did not give him any directions, but the conversation he heard between the prisoner and myself amounted to the whole of that, and very much more—it was, that the goods were not to be passed into the prisoner's possession unless he paid to me, that night</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030124"/>
               <p>36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—the prisoner obtained the goods on the 8th of December, and I applied for a warrant against him, I think on the 14th—not for felony—it was rather curious; I attended at Queen-square for the purpose of get<lb/>ting a warrant against him for having got these things by false pretences; after urging the charge for some time with the Magistrate, the clerk said to me, "Sir, you need not wait; all the witnesses have given evidence, and I will give you the warrant"—and, to my great surprise, I found it was a warrant for larceny; and on speaking to the clerk about it, he said, "It is my opinion that it is a larceny, and not a false pretence"—I never had the warrant for larceny in my possession—I did not know that it was a warrant for larceny till I saw it un the Magistrate's table after the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, after you had applied for the warrant, take any steps of any kind to compromise the matter with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not, but I took steps apparently of a compromise for the purpose of catching the prisoner, by writing a letter that I thought would bring him to my office, or bring him into my power somehow, so as to catch him in some way or other—I had previously had an interview with Mr. Scott Montgomery about a proposition made by him to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief-constable of Newbury, in Berkshire. In consequence of information I took Warner there on the 18th of December, at the house of her father and mother, about the middle of the day—the was ill in bed—I told her she was charged with having robbed a corporal major of the Life Guards on the night of the 6th—she said she was in company with a corporal-major in the Brompton-road that night, and she had something to drink with him, but she had not robbed him—I looked under her pillow for her pocket, and in her pocket I found eight sove<lb/>reigns, a sixpence, and a penny-piece—there was a clothes-box in the room, and in it I found a considerable quantity of new female wearing apparel, this muff and cape, new gown and new cloak—she said a man of the name of Byron had given her the money, and purchased the clothes for her to go home and see her friends.</p>

On the 27th of November, I was at Mrs. Griffiths's, in Sharp's-alley—the prisoner, who lodged there, laid me a gallon of beer that he had the most money of any body in the house—I said I could not lay a gallon, I would not mind laying a pot, but I would not till I saw what he had got, and he showed me three sovereigns—I said I had not so much as that—I paid for a pot of beer, and then for a pint—I then had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left—I had that safe between five and six o'clock on Saturday evening—the prisoner came home, and Mrs. Griffiths asked me to catch hold of him, and help her to throw him down on the bed—we threw him down, and she threw me across him—he then went away, and in about an hour after he was gone I missed my money—I was not down upon him for a minute—he had an opportunity of taking my money out of my pocket—I did not take notice of his doing it—I should know my sovereign again, because it is marked—here arc four sovereigns produced by the officer—this is mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one.</hi>)</p>

On the 11th of December I told him I had reason to suspect he was robbing me, and asked if he had any objection to be searched—he said "No"—I asked if he had any objection to have his box looked into—he said "No"—he then went up stairs with me and the policeman—I saw him give the policeman the key—the policeman opened his box, and found in it this tobacco, these cigars, and this pencil<lb/>case—I know they are mine, as I had taken the precaution that morning to sprinkle a little green tea in my tobacco, and this tobacco has the tea in it.</p>

Spillman, at Mr. Wade's, draper, Deptford, Kent"—when I went to Spragg's, on the 12th, I asked him</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before he was pushed against the shutters did he do anything with the stick to either of the prisoners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Roach went and pushed him down a second time and struck him on the temple and cheek-bone with the stick—Mr. Hartshorn cried out, they went away, and the police came—he was then lying down senseless, bleeding from the eye and nose—the policeman came and picked him up—I described the parties to him, and saw Roach in custody in about ten minutes.</p>

               <p>as if they had been drinking when they pushed against the old gentleman, but before that they did not appear to stagger at all—I had seen them come out of the King's Head public-house—I have seen them passing in the street before, but never spoke to them—I had been with Beale that evening—she had not spoken to the prisoners—I am a woman of the town.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an architect, and live at No. 74, Old Broad-street. A little after one o'clock, on the morning of the 1st of January, I took a four-wheeled <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on Ludgate-hill—it drove to Church<lb/>row, Newington—I was with two gentlemen—we did not all three come back—we left one gentleman at Church-row, and I was taking the other home—I rode to Church-row outside—the gentleman who went with the other, went inside—as we came back from Church-row, I was inside with my friend Mr. Cutler—I told the cab-man if he would stop at the first public-house that was open, I would give him something to drink for his civility and attention—he stopped at the Princess of Wales, at the corner of Princess-street, London-road—Mr. Cutler and me both got out of the cab, and went into the house—it was a gin-shop—there were, I should say, twenty people standing in front of the bar—I called for two glasses of stout, and a glass of rum for the cab-man—after paying for the articles, as I did not wish to take any change,—I asked for some tobacco—I gave 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the stout and rum, and then was asked for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—I then gave 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the glasses of stout, I expect, were 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and the glass of rum made 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but having asked for the tobacco, I paid it extra—I asked for it to avoid getting change from my inside pocket—I miscalculated the amount of the whole order, and to avoid taking change</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030160"/>
               <p>out of my pocket I asked for some tobacco, with the hopes of relieving the affair altogether, because I did not wish to pay any more but the coppen I had in my pocket—I thought 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would cover the whole—I did not wish to take any change—I believe I asked for a screw of tobacco: that is enough to fill a pipe with—I had not been smoking—I was going to smoke—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the screw—I paid my money at the bar—I asked whether it was correct—the boy behind the bar said it was—I then turned round to go out, and was immediately seized by one man who pot his arm across my face, and I was hustled by the mob—my coat was lifted up—one of them made a snatch at my pin—I caught him, and gave him a turn, and held him for some time—I saw a man at the door with an apron on, and a leather strap, and I sung out to him, "For G—sake shut the door, this man has stolen my pin"—I was hustled here and there—the door was open, and they were gone—I was not pushed out—the person did not shut the door as I desired—he let the men go instead of stopping them—the door was on the swing when we went in—the prisoner Hardy was there—he was the man that took my pin, and the one that I caught—the prisoner Gibbs was the man that put his hand or arm before my face, and I saw Bennett in the place—I certainly did not regard him is the scuffle more than seeing him at the very moment it took place, whether he took part in it I cannot say—I believe two sovereigns to be the value of my pin—I seized Hardy, and he was rescued by the mob.</p>
