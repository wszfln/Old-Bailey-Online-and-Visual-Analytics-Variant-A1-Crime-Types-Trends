               <p>Ambler. On Sunday the 29th of June, as I was coming from Hamstead, between Nine and Ten o'Clock at Night. I was set upon by seven Men. in the second Close on this Side <placeName id="t17460903-1-crimeloc3">Figg-Lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. When they had got you into the Ditch, what did they take from you?</p>
               <p>Ambler. My Cloth Coat, a Cambrick Stock, a Silver Buckle, &amp;c. They robb'd Mr. Dunn at the same Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in your Sight?</p>
               <p>Ambler. Yes. They robb'd Mr. Dunn of his Watch; then they turn'd to me again and took my Breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they?</p>
               <p>Ambler. Black Leather Breeches. They took my shoes and also Mr. Dunn's Shoes; then they went away; but soon return'd again and took my Shirt from my Back; they had taken my Stock the first Time. On Friday the 4th of July I saw, in the Advertiser, the Advertisement of a Watch; that was stopp'd by Justice Dennis's Clarke; by the Description I knew it was Mr. Dunn's Watch; the Watch was found upon Parkison, a Soldier, who was then committed to Prison. I went to New-Prison to this Soldier, and I charg'd him with the Robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the Watch then?</p>
               <p>Ambler. No.</p>

               <p>Ambler. With robbing me the Sunday before; but he said he was not in the Robbery; I ask'd him then how he came by the Watch; he said he had it from

               <p>Court. Then he positively declar'd that one of the Men would have murder'd you and he prevented it.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any Thing to lay to the Prisoner's Charge with respect to the Robbery committed on Sunday the 29th of June?</p>
               <p>Dunn. I was robb'd then with Mr. Ambler.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Night?</p>
               <p>Dunn. Between the Hours of Nine and Ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it?</p>
               <p>Dunn. In the Foot-Path between Mother Red-Cap's and Southampton-Row.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that robb'd you?</p>
               <p>Dunn. I think there were nine in Company: Mr. Ambler was attack'd first; I might be about ten Yards behind; I hasten'd up to Mr. Ambler and found a Party of them attacking him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they in their Hands?</p>
               <p>Dunn. They had Scymeters and Sticks; I heard one of them call it a Scymeter. I hasten'd up to him, then another Party of them enclos'd me: Ambler defended himself as long as he could; he had a Cane in his Hand, and they had a great deal of Difficulty to get it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them rob him of any Thing?</p>
               <p>Dunn. I saw them take off his Coat; nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go away then?</p>
               <p>Dunn. No, Sir. After they had rifled him they went about ten Yards distant, then they came back again and took his Breeches and Shoes from him.</p>

               <p>Dunn. None at all, he offer'd himself voluntarily; he said he gave me Water out of the Ditch in his Hat.</p>

               <p>Did he confess that he was one of the Persons?</p>
               <p>Dunn. He said he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you the Person that had Water given you?</p>
               <p>Dunn. Both of us had Water. I lost a Snuff-Box and Tweezer-Cafe; I ask'd him if he knew where they were, if they had pawn'd them I would redeem them; he told me they buried them in the Ground, and the next Morning a Party of them went to fetch them, and he knew nothing more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Dunn, what Robbery did he own he committed?</p>
               <p>Dunn. He said he was one that robb'd us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Thing said before Sir Thomas about Mr. Ambler's Coat?</p>
               <p>Dunn. He said that one Ryly had it.</p>

               <p>Dunn. I don't say you did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Those two Gentlemen gave me Liquor, and made me to drunk that I don't know what I said; Mr. Ambler, did not you give me Sixpence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ambler. I did; I went on Sunday Morning and gave him Sixpence; I said if he made good his Confession he should not want a Sunday's Dinner while he was in Prison.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that broke open your House?</p>
               <p>Chatto. I did not know at that Time; but I took a Ride into Kent in pursuit of the Prisoner, who was my Journeyman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been your Journeyman?</p>
               <p>Chatto. He work'd with me only a Fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discharge him ?</p>
               <p>Chatto. The Thursday before. I took Horse and pursu'd him into Kent; I stopp'd at a Place call'd Walling, and ask'd there if they had heard of any such Man; ( because I had an Information that he was going to set up at a Place call'd Dartford) one said, as you describe the Man, there was such a Person pass'd by here about Eleven o'Clock an Sunday, with a Large Bundle on his Back, and I think I saw Skins: I had not been above 100 Yards in the Town when I pass'd a little Shop, a sort of a Taylor's, and something of Leather likewise, and saw a Man skulk behind the Shop-board; whereupon I alighted from my Horse, and perceiving it to be the Prisoner, I said to him, John, when came you hither; he answer'd, on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What Day was this?</p>
               <p>Chatto. On Tuesday. I said to him, will you go and drink? He scarce would speak to me; but we went into a Room and I lock'd the Door; then I tax'd him with the Affair and he deny'd it; I sent for a Constable, and told him it signify'd nothing talking, for that he had robb'd me; he then heartily begg'd my Pardon. I ask'd him what he did it with, he said he did it with a knife and Chisel: Then I ask'd him where the Goods were, and he told me they were at Dartford, at his Mother's; I bid him send for them; he said he could not write; but I said I would write for him, and ask'd him where they were; he said in a Bag in the Closer. I got a Man to go, and he brought the Goods to the Constable, where the Prisoner then was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the Goods here?</p>
               <p>Chatto. They are at the Baptist's Head; I will send for them.</p>
               <p>[The Goods were produced in Court, and the Prisoner confess'd that with a Knife and Chisel he cut some part of the Grove, then wrench'd it off, took down the Shutter and thrust up the Sash, and took out the Goods about Two o'Clock in the Morning.]</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with him when you took him?</p>
               <p>Chatto. We took him before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What material pass'd before the Justice?</p>

               <p>Brend. I lost them the 7th Day of July, between Twelve and One o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing to say to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brend. I was asleep when I lost them: Two other Persons lay in the Room with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner lie in the Room?</p>
               <p>Brend. No, my Lord, he lay a Pair of Stairs higher; the Men that lay in that Room heard something chink, and said one to the other, I believe the Marine is robb'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found the Things again?</p>
               <p>Brend. The Shoe-Buckles we found upon the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What House was this where you lodg'd?</p>
               <p>Brend. At the Horse and Drum in King's-Street, Westminer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you lost them was it before you found them upon the Prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. Did the Prosecutor, Brend, lodge at your House in July last.</p>
               <p>Terry. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any Things that were taken from him?</p>
               <p>Terry. Yes, my Lord; I know of Half a Guinea, twelve Shillings and Two-pence, a Pair of Silver Shoe-Buckles, a Pair of Knee-Buckles, and I think a Pair of Garters; it was of a Sabbath-Day Night, the 6th of July; my Wife and I were gone to Bed, not thinking any thing of being robb'd, or of the Prisoner, for I took him to be a very honest Man. After I was in Bed the Prosecutor came down and knock'd at my Door: I said to my Wife, pray don't let any Body have any more Beer to Night, for 'tis late; the Man spoke to me through the Key-Hole; my Wife said to me, get up, this poor young Fellow is robb'd by somebody, I can't tell who; so I got up and went down to the Watchman to light a Candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the Man complain'd of his being robb'd.</p>
               <p>Terry. Yes, he came down very softly for fear of being discover'd: As I had two Soldiers lodg'd upon me, I charg'd them with the Robbery; I told them this Man had been robb'd, and I must know who it is that had robb'd him. The Soldiers got up at once, but I did not examine their Pockets. I took a Candle, and went into the Room where this Man was a-bed; there was another Man, a Corporal; he said, he had heard some Money chink; so I said to this

            , You must get up too, to be examin'd; for I had no more Suspicion of one than the other: Accordingly he rises up, and said he wanted, to speak to me; I ask'd him what he wanted, and went into a little Closet, and he down'd upon his Knees to me; God bless you, said he, don't tell my Serjeant, and I will tell you where the Money is: I told him I would not tell his Serjeant, because I wanted to bring the Thing out; so he confess'd the Fact. I said to him, What did you do this Thing for? He said, he had got the Foul Distemper, and he got that Money on purpose to get him cur'd. He went back to the Bed where he lay, and he took the twelve Shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030006"/> and two Pence, and Half a Guinea; he took it from between the Bed and the Sacking. I said to him, Have you got a Pair of Buckles, young Man? he said, Aye, I'll find them out; at last he brings out two Pair of Buckles.</p>

               <p>Q. What were these Buckles ?</p>
               <p>Terry. The Shoe-buckles were Silver, the other common Metal.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Ask him how honest I behav'd in his House when the Serjeant got drunk, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Terry. He always behav'd honest, as I thought; I had a good Opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q.(to the Prisoner) What have you to say for yourself, by way of Defence; or have you any Witness to your Character?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I lodg'd in this Mr. Terry's House; and, as I was going to Bed, I had a Candle in my Hand, and found these Things in my Way. I did not put the Money into my Pocket, but laid it on the Bed 'till I should hear some Body enquire for it. I heard them make a Noise, examining the Soldiers; and I was getting up at the Time Mr. Terry came into the Room; I told him I had the Money and the Buckles; I call'd to him, and gave them to him; I did not steal, non-break or pick a Lock. If I had a Mind to commit a Robbery, I had had a greater Opportunity, which I did not.</p>

               <p>King. At my own Door; we had two or three Words there; she stood at the Door and call'd me Names. It was on Tuesday Night, the 22d of July last, that we had those Words. She went to Sir Thomas to get a Warrant for me; she went late, and he was at Supper, and would not grant it to her. I follow'd her to vindicate my own Cause.

               <p>Curtane. My Lord, I am a Watchman. I was call'd to the Sign of the Castle, where I saw Mr. King, the Prosecutor, and this Woman, the Prisoner. She said if she had any Guinea in her Pocket, it was his, for he had charg'd her with robbing him of Forty-eight Shillings and a Guinea in Gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Any Thing else besides Money? any mention of a Tobacco Box?</p>
               <p>Curtane. No, my Lord, not then; it was the Wife that mention'd he had been robb'd; she call'd out Watch, Watch, my Husband is robb'd: I said where is the Person that robb'd him. The Prisoner said, that if she had a Guinea in Gold, it was his; with that she put her Hand in her Pocket; pull'd out a Handful of Silver, and said if she had a Guinea in Gold, it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any Thing how she came by it?</p>
               <p>Curtane. No, but Mr. King said that she had robb'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prosecutor sober ?</p>
               <p>Curtane. He was not sober, nor was he drunk; he was between drunk and sober, but I think his Wife was sober.</p>

               <p>Cousins. Between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock I heard a Noise at the Casile, so I went to hear what was the Matter. When I came I saw the Man of the House, Bartles, holding of the Prisoner, who said, you B - h you have robb'd this Man. Mr. King said he was robb'd of 48 s. in Silver, and a Guinea in Gold. The Prisoner said if she had a Guinea in Gold in her Pocket, it belong'd to that Man, so she pull'd it out herself.</p>
               <p>Q. (to the Prisoner) Will you ask him any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, to ask him if the Prosecutor's Wife was there, and what Condition she was in?</p>
               <p>Cousins. The Woman was fuddled, but the Prosecutor was neither fuddled nor sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, Mrs. King and I had some Words; as I stood at the Door she clapp'd her Hands up my Coats: I said I was never used so by a Woman, I don't know what you mean by it; so King and his great Brother-in-law, an Irishman, was about to strike me.</p>

               <p>Beckerly. Last Saturday se'nnight I heard somebody go up Stairs very softly, and I was willing to know who it was; when they came down again, I saw a Woman with something in her Apron, and I ask'd her who she wanted; she said, what I want, or this I want, I have; (I can't tell which) she said she was sent by the old Man: I said, what old Man? she said the old Man at the Bull; with that I follow'd her down; when I came down Stairs I was in a great Surprise. I look'd at her till she was a few Doors of; then she look'd back, I fancy to see whether we observed where she was going to. I said to Mrs. Bell, the Woman is gone to the Bull Head.</p>
               <p>Court. So then you follow'd her.</p>
               <p>Beckerly. No, I did not; I call'd to Mrs. Bell to come up, for there was a Woman had got a Bundle out of her Room in her Apron; so Mrs. Dyer and Mrs. Bell follow'd her.</p>

               <p>Dyer. My Daughter call'd to me, and said, Mother, there is a strange Woman gone out of the House with a Bundle in her Hand; I immediately run out and follow'd her, and she went to the Bull-Head. I went immediately to the Landlord, and ask'd him if a Woman in a Blue Gown had not come in; so she (the Prisoner) was standing by, and said, here I am; but I said, where's the Bundle you had in your Lap; so Mrs. Bell was at my Shoulder, and said, what Business had you in my Room? The Prisoner said, I'll go and shew you. I ask'd the Maid at the Publick-House what she left there; so we look'd, and found the Gown, Hat, and Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say?</p>
               <p>Dyer. She own'd it before the Justice. The Excuse she made was, that there was an old Man that own'd her 16 s. and desired her to go up three Pair of Stairs, and turn in upon the Left-hand, and take these Things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, one Robert Anderson, a Shoemaker, own'd me a little Money; I told him, my Husband would be uneasy for the Money; he said, keep yourself easy. About Five o'Clock at Night he took me to Petty-France to this House, and desir'd me to go up three Pair of Stairs, and that he would go to the Bull-Head. I went up Stairs, and staid almost a Quarter of an Hour. As I was coming down, a Woman spoke to me, and I told her that I had been up at the old Man's Room, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. (to the Prisoner.) Have you any Witnesses?</p>

            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. The Prisoner at the Bar took from me two Half Crowns, a Shilling, and a Six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. I think on the 30th of August; last Saturday Night, between Eleven and Twelve, coming thro' Drury-Lane, a Woman of the Town pick'd me up.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. No, my Lord, the Woman of the Town is now in Bridewell. We went to the House and went up Stairs, and went to Bed. There were two Rooms on a Floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to lie together?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. In Holford's-Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else lie in the Room with you?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. I undress'd myself, my Lord, so did the Girl too; we were in Bed about Half an Hour; I did not close my Eyes; the Girl got up and went down Stairs; whether she went down to the Necessary-House, or something I can't tell what: When the Girl went down Stairs the Candle was burning; the Prisoner took the Breeches from under my Head, and two Half Crowns In my Sight. My Lord, there was a Candle burning in the Room all the while. I would not have suffer'd her to rob me, but I was in Danger of my Life, for there was another Man that lay with her; I knew I was in a disorderly House. After the Girl that went down Stairs came up again, I said that Woman in the next Room has robb'd me; I got up, and saw a Man in Bed with her; she was only in her Smock when she came into the Room to my Bed-side, With that the Girl that lay with me slipt down again, and said that she would not lie under Danger for no such Whores, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she there; did you charge both these Women?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. She that lay with me was charged as a disorderly Woman, no other Offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the disorderly Man?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. The disorderly Man was along with the disorderly Woman; but he hopes he shall do so no more.</p>

               <p>Q. So you did not struggle?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. No, my Lord, I knew what Sort of Gang they were; I have heard it commonly said when I have been in Company with Parish Officers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to such Places ?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. My Lord, I was to blame.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we believe he has been there before now.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. She took my Breeches from under my Head, and took out two Half Crowns, a Shilling and a Six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what Clothes had she on when she came in to take the Money?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030010"/>Wilkins. She came in her Smock, my Lord, into the Room; had nothing but her Smock and her Cap upon her Head.</p>

I told her (my Credit was at Stake as well as her's) and I desired she would be free and open, and let me know the whole; she told me, she had pawn'd the Shirts in Eagle-Street; she begg'd that I would let her have Money, and she would fetch them again; so we sent to the Pawnbroker's, and she had pawn'd them in the Name of Clark; she said her Husband used to pawn Things in the Name of Clark, and he had learn'd her the Way.</p>

He told me he had a large Quantity of these Hairs to dispose of, 5 or 600 Weight. I follow'd him the whole Day, but would not seize this small Parcel, in Hopes of finding the biggest. It was on the 25th of July; I was a whole Day with him, and spent my Money upon him. I went again the 26th, on Saturday Morning; when I came there he was a Bed. I order'd the Landlord to call him down; I ask'd him to drink; I said Mr. March, as you have such a large Quantity of Bristles to sell, I would have you let me see them; he said he had no more at that Time, but if I would take them in Part, he would make them up a Quarter of a Hundred, and that he had them for a Debt of a Gentleman that was then in Ludgate, which was false, for he had them of Mr. Yeoman's Maid in St. Thomas Apostles; She put the Bristles in this same Bag, and he (Original March) took them of her, in order to pay a Debt of

I consulted proper Means to find it out; I suspected the Man more than the Maid. We contriv'd that her Mistress should send her down to get some Water, and in the mean Time she should examine her Pocket: Her Mistress follow'd her to the Kitchen Door, and ask'd her for her Pocket; upon which I found the Thirty-Six Shilling Piece and Guinea, which I had mark'd.

I had not been there but a very little while, but my Son Marshall knock'd at the Chamber Door, and said, that he had found the Thief. When I went down to his Room, there was he and his Wife and Maid, together; he said he could forever it; with that the Maid cry'd, and said, she acknowledg'd she did take it, and if we would forgive her she would never do so any more; and she frankly did acknowledge that she did take Money from the first fortnight of her coming into the House, and that she had taken in all near thirty or forty Pounds.</p>

I sent the Prisoner out the next Morning and then tax'd the Maid with it, as they were pretty great; and then I call'd all three before me, and said, One of you must be the Aggressor; come, Thomas, let me look in your Trunk; he said, with all his Heart; and there I found the Piece of Scarlet Cloth mention'd in the Indictment; upon which he confess'd the other Things.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say then ?</p>
               <p>Finch. That he took the other Things: I ask'd him for what Use he took them; and he said, to wear. Then I said, it is not agreeable to your Character in Life, it would but expose you.</p>
               <p>Q. What were those Things between the Board and the Ceiling ?</p>
               <p>Finch. There was five Yards of Genoa Velvet, and two Yards and Half of Black Silk. After that I question'd him about the Watch he had bought; and he then confess'd he had taken a Guinea and a Half in Gold out of my Tiln, and in all about five Pounds.</p>

This Day five Weeks one Ward came to me and ask'd me if I had lost any Glasses, he said he had four brought to him; he ask'd me if I could swear to them; I said not, but my Man could: These four Glasses were brought to him by the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know these were your Glasses? I ask you whether you know, from your own Knowledge, that you can swear to these Glasses?</p>
               <p>Tayler. I can swear to one of the four, because I bought it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in Frames, or out of Frames?</p>
               <p>Tayler. They are for Coaches or Chariots.</p>
               <p>Q. Why are you sure to that one?</p>
               <p>Tayler. Because I had a Mark upon it that I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lose that Glass from?</p>
               <p>Tayler. Out of my Shop, my Lord, the Prisoner work'd for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose them?</p>
               <p>Tayler. The 1st of August I believe I took the Man up.</p>

            .) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar? What is it you have to say against him, with respect to the Crime laid to his Charge?</p>
               <p>Ward. He brought these four Glasses to me and offer'd them to Sale; he brought some before, which I bought; he brought them the 30th Day of July; they are Glasses for Coach Doors.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your Business?</p>
               <p>Ward. Mine is Glass Business, and Gilding besides.</p>
               <p>Q. When he brought them to you what did he bring them for?</p>
               <p>Ward. He brought them to sell to me; he had brought some to me before, which I had bought; the first of his coming to me was the 26th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy any of them?</p>
               <p>Ward. Yes, my Lord, I bought six of them, three on the 26th of July, and three more on the 28th or 29th, I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer any on the 30th of July?</p>
               <p>Ward. On the 30th he brought three more; then I saw that those Glasses had never been in the Glew of the Coach; those I bought before were old, so that I could not suspect them; but who I saw these to be new Glasses I agreed with him for a Price for them, and said, call again, Mr. Harrison, about Two o'Clock in the Afternoon and I shall be ready for you; I then went about to the Trade: I took a Receipt in the Name of

            , because I had a Suspicion of their being stolen; then I went about the Trade to enquire whether they knew of any such Man; I went first to Clerkenwell, and from thence to Mr. Tayler's, who said Harrison was his Journeyman; then he asked me whether I had read an Advertisement he had put out the Day before; I said that I never saw any News till about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon; Mr. Tayler had offer'd ten Guineas Reward for the Glasses: I told him I had three Pieces for Glass that I suspected were stolen, whereupon he desir'd to see them, and after he had so done, requested that his Journeyman might look at them, I told him he might and welcome, that I never secrered any Goods. One Mr. Hall came along with him to see them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Ward. The Day the Rebels were hang'd; I think the 30th of July. I shew'd them the four Glasses which were produced in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you all those four Glasses from the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Ward. Yes. When Mr. Tayler saw them he could not be positive they were his; but desir'd his Journeyman might see them, who came down accordingly; but neither of them would swear to the particular Marks of the Glasses, except one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which of the four it was?</p>
               <p>Ward. I cannot say my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What follow'd after that?</p>
               <p>Ward. Mr. Tayler sent down his Man to know whether the Prisoner had been with me; if not, he desir'd I would stop him when he came; but he had been with me, and I said to him, Mr. Harrison, I have a great Suspicion that you have not come honestly by these Goods; I'll stop them; he said very well, I will bring you Proof I have come by them honestly: Then Mr. Tayler sent for me to the Sun-Tavern in Holbourn, to know whether I had stopp'd him; I told him he had been there before he sent down to me, that I had not stopp'd him, but the Goods. I told him they might belong to other People as well as to him, and that I would advertise them, which I accordingly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030015"/> did, and the Advertisement was read in Court, viz.

The next Day I went to Mr. Tayler's and Mr. Ward came in at the same Time; he said he had stopp'd four Glasses that he believed to belong to Mr. Tayler: Mr. Tayler was very cautious, he would not swear to them, and I persuaded him to send his Servant. Some Time after this I went along with him and Mr. Ward and he pull'd out a Receipt of John Harrison's of 3 l. 15 s. I saw one Glass that I could swear I sold to Mr. Tayler for 2 l. 6 s. one was a Looking-Glass.</p>

            (to Eleanor Hall.) Do you know the Prisoner and Mr. Brown? Tell us what you heard pass.</p>
               <p>Hall. I went to see Mrs. Harrison the Day after St. James's Day, the 26th of July; she was very ill, and desir'd me to stay and drink a Dish of Tea: While I sat there Mr. Brown came up with three Glasses under his Arm, and ask'd if Mr. Harrison was within; he said, lay these Glasses by, Mr. Harrison don't go out, I shall call by and by. In about an Hour after he brought four more of a larger Size, and desir'd they might be laid by. The Tuesday following I went to see Mrs. Harrison, as she was so ill. Mr. Brown came up the same Morning, and said to Mr. Harrison, go do down to Mr. Ward's in Holbourn with these three Glasses, and get what Money you can for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the three Glasses?</p>
               <p>Hall. Yes, he took them and went down with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more?</p>
               <p>Hall. Mr. Harrison return'd again in about an Hour; I saw no more of Mr. Brown till about Three o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see Brown?</p>
               <p>Hall. I staid with Mrs. Harrison all the Time; about Three o'Clock Mr. Brown came again, and he ask'd him what Money he got for them. Harrison said, what I have you shall have, and put his Hand in his Pocket and took out three Guineas in Gold, four Half-Crowns and two Shillings, and said he had given a Receipt to Alard; then Brown said he must go with the other Glasses To-morrow Mornin g.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say to the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Morris. She ask'd if her and her Husband might have a Lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she come?</p>
               <p>Morris. The 13th of July last.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your Answer?</p>
               <p>Morris. I told her I had; immediately they order'd a Candle and went to Bed; they did not stay a Quarter of an Hour; they hired one Pair of Stairs backwards; they hired it for no time but that Night. He that she call'd her Husband was along with her; so that I went to Bed, and made all fast.</p>
               <p>Q. What then ?</p>
               <p>Morris. After they had been in Bed and put out the Candle, I goes to Bed about Twelve o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they go to Bed ?</p>
               <p>Morris. About Eight or Nine.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Morris. So about Break of Day the Man knocks at my Room Door, where I lay; then I got out of Bed, and he told me he had lost his Waistcoat, his Watch and Money. How can that be, said I; why, there is none could come in there? I ask'd him how he lost it? He said, the Woman was gone that came along with him as his Wife.</p>
               <p>Court. So he lodg'd in your House that Night.</p>
               <p>Morris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the Lodgings?</p>
               <p>Morris. She took the Lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he by; did he say any thing at all to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Morris. No, he said nothing at all to the contrary. When he told me that he was robb'd, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030018"/> said, how can that be, I had made every Place of the House secure. So I immediately got up. He said, the Woman is gone from me; I said, I thought she told me last Night that she was your Wife. So I gets up, thinking I should find her in some of the Rooms of the House. When I went down Stairs, I found the Shop secure, and the Back-Door secure, every Place secure, except the Yard-Door; that I left bolted when I went to Bed; so when I went down, I found the Door half shut and half open; then I went into the Yard, and I found the Track of Dirt from her Shoes on my Water-Tub; so I went into the Yard of an empty House, and some of the Threads of her Stockings stuck upon the Pales, and I found that Yard-Door broke open; that Yard-Door went into an Alley. About Ten o'Clock she was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon her ?</p>
               <p>Morris. Yes, we found something that belong'd to the Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you find her from you?</p>
               <p>Morris. She had made her Escape from me; she was brought before Sir Thomas, and there I saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Thing that you found upon her that belong'd to the Watch.</p>
               <p>Morris. An Ear-drop, it was found in her Bosom. Whilst I was hunting after her, my Maid-servant, going up to make the Bed, found the Waistcoat, ripp'd at the Top, where Davis had put his Watch and Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sensible this is the Man that came in with that Woman as his Wife?</p>

             ?</p>
               <p>Davis. What I have to say, please you, my Lord, I was going home from the House of Call; at the End of Long-Acre I met this Woman, the Prisoner; she ask'd me to treat her; I said, Woman, if I go to bed with you I will give you something: She said, Will you go to a Publick-House by, or to my own Lodgings? I said, I will go to your Lodgings, if you lodge by here; and went to Mr. Morris's, (here present) and had something to drink, and I paid for it; then we went up one Pair of Stairs, and she went down again for a Pint of Small-Beer; in the mean Time I pull'd my Cloaths off my Back, and put my Money and Watch, and other Materials belonging to it, in the Lining of my Waistcoat, and I went to bed with her. When I awak'd in the Morning, my Waistcoat, and all that I put in it, was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your Waistcoat?</p>
               <p>Davis. Damask.</p>
               <p>Q. What your Watch?</p>
               <p>Davis. A Silver Watch, with a Silver Chain, and nineteen Shillings in Money: Also, I put a Pair of Silver Buckles, and an Ear-drop that was hanging to the Chain of my Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with your Waistcoat?</p>
               <p>Davis. The Waistcoat was in my Coat, left on the Chair at-the Bedside.</p>
               <p>Court. Then she went to-bed with you.</p>
               <p>Davis. I went to-bed, and she came to-bed to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you awak'd in the Morning, what then?</p>
               <p>Davis. I miss'd the Woman, the Waistcoat, and all that I put in it. I went down Stairs, seeking for a Place to get out, but found none; I then knock'd on the Floor, and found a Man and Woman lying together; I apply'd to the Landlord to let me have my Things, for God's Sake, and said I was ruin'd, and must not shew my Face any more; said he, I will do my Endeavour to get your Waistcoat again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your Watch or Money again?</p>
               <p>Davis (answering very mournfully) No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to indict her for stealing your Waistcoat, when she left that, and it was produced before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Davis. I don't know how that came.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more against her?</p>
               <p>Davis. She was the only Person that carried me into the House. The Door was fasten'd when we went to bed, by setting a big Chair against it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then that was the only Fastening the Door had, the Chair put against it.</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the Tankard after they were gone?</p>
               <p>Burk. When I came to my Wife, I ask'd her if she had taken the Tankard; she said, No: She said Yes, at first.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner at your House when the Tankard was miss'd.</p>
               <p>Burk. I know he took it away with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find your Tankard again?</p>
               <p>Burk. I found it under his Head in the Bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the Prisoner lodge?</p>
               <p>Burk. He lodg'd in Robin Hood's Court in the Strand.</p>
               <p>[The Prisoner was a Foreigner, therefore answer'd by an Interpreter.]</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Interpreter, tell the Prisoner at the Bar, what this Witness has sworn, that he was at his House the 18th of July; that he took away a Tankard from thence; that they went to his Lodgings and found him in Bed with the Tankard under his Head: Now ask him what Questions he would ask Mr. Burk ?</p>

My Mistress said follow her; accordingly I did, but instead of going over to the Upholsterer's Shop, she went up Shoe Lane; she cross'd up a narrow dark Entry: I follow'd her, and ask'd her if she had not got a Pair of Stockings; she said I should search her. Whilst she was fumbling she dropt a Pair of Stockings, so I happen'd to see them. I said here are the Stockings which you took from our Shop; she said they stuck to her Apron, for she did not know how they came there. She was ask'd by my Lord Mayor, what Money she had in her Pocket? She answer'd she had none but a few Half-pence.</p>

               <p>Fryer. She has been at the Shop two or three Times; we have two or three Memorandums that we can prove she stole Stockings before.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Morral. Last Sunday was a Month, my Lord; I saw him take the Watch; he gave him a Punch, and then took the Watch; the Child cry'd out, and said, Daddy; and I said, here's your Daddy.</p>

               <p>Lyon. I have seen him before; the 19th of June, about four o'Clock in the Morning, I thought I saw him unlocking 'Squire Barber's Door; he was down upon his Knees and looking thro' the Key-Hole; when I saw him I directly ran down Stairs and stepp'd to him; he had got the Escutcheon off the Door; I took the Chisel in his Hand; and he own'd to me that he took an Escutcheon off a Door the Moment before, at the Corner of James-Street: I carried him from thence to the Crown, then we acquainted Mr. Barber's Folks of it before we went before the Justice; we examin'd him before the Constable, and he had 13 of these Brass Escutcheons; we also found a Pick-Lock in his Pocket.</p>

            .) Mr. Lewis, look at the Prisoners at the Bar; do you know either of them?</p>
               <p>Lewis. There were five of them when they robb'd me; I believe them to be two of the Men.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against them?</p>
               <p>Lewis. The 22d of July, as I was going home.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence?</p>
               <p>Lewis. From London to Hendon, In <placeName id="t17460903-31-crimeloc119">Hall-Lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17460903-31-crimeloc119" type="placeName" value="Hall-Lane"/>

               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I turn'd back, and said, what do you want; before I turn'd myself again, there were four of them that struck me; I believe they gave me four or five Strokes before they beat me off the Horse; they took hold of me, and tore my Shirt; one took hold of my Legs, another of my Head, two held my Arms, and carried me into the Field, and there they rifled me; they took from me a Thirty-six Shilling Piece, one Guinea, Half a Guinea, twenty-Shillings in Silver, an Handkerchief, five Pounds of Sugar, two Ounces of Green Tea, a Steel Breeches-Buckle, a Pair of Knee-Buckles of White Metal, and a Pair of Buttons out of my Sleeves. After they had done this, they lifted me about three Poles farther, and with that I begg'd of them my Hat and Wig; I begg'd of them my Wig to cover my Wounds: One of them clapt his Hands to my Throat, and almost strangled me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they mean by carrying you further in the Field?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I believe they heard somebody coming along the Highway. When they had almost throttled me, I ask'd them of what Service it would be to them to kill me? and one of them tied my Hands, and the other my Legs, and bid me hush: They tied my Hands behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Lewis. After they had done that they said, Your Horse is in next Field, and away they went.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Lewis. The 22d of July.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the Prisoners at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I was some Time before I could get myself from being bound, and then I had four Hedges<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030029"/> to go through; I made Leaps, I did not care to go the Road. I went home on Foot, and rais'd all my Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. What Reason have you to say the Prisoners at the Bar committed this Robbery?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Sir Thomas De Veil sent to me, to let me know he had got the Sugar and Tea that they had of me. [The Sugar and Tea was produced in Court.]</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you, Is that the Sugar and Tea you lost that Night?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It was in a Handkerchief; I believe this to be the Sugar; it was all in one Piece, or there might be a Bit laid at the Top to make up Weight; also the Hat is in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the Hat?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any Difficulty made about going into the City ?</p>
               <p>England. The Coachman refus'd to go; upon that a Hackney Coach was call'd, and we were set down in Rathbone Place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the Prisoners the Driver of the Hackney Coach?</p>
               <p>England. Yes, that Man in blue.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Things were put out of the Coach that you came to Town in, into a Hackney-Coach.</p>
               <p>England. Yes; there was a Coach Seat that came out of the Country put into the Boot of the Hackney Coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Things were in that Coach Seat?</p>
               <p>England. I don't know all of them; there were a great many Things.</p>
               <p>Q. What, Things that belong'd to you.</p>
               <p>England. Yes; a red Rugg Cloak and a Velvet Bonnet, that belong'd to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your Lady any Things in it?</p>
               <p>England. Yes, Sir, there were a great many Things, I can't particularly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in the Hackney Coach to St. Paul's Church-Yard to Mr. Thornhill's ?</p>
               <p>England. Yes. And when I came there I miss'd the Coach Seat, and enquir'd for it after the rest of the Things were out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the eat sent again.</p>
               <p>England. No, Sir,</p>
               <p>Q. Did any Thing happen to you between Rathbone-Place and St. Paul's Church-Yard?</p>
               <p>England. Yes, Sir, it happen'd to rain, so the Coachman got off his Seat and said he would go for his Great-Coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he stop the Coach?</p>
               <p>England. I can't tell Sir; I am almost a Stranger in London.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went for his great Coat, was any Body left there to take Care of his Horses?</p>
               <p>England. He said he would leave one to take Care of his Horses.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he away.</p>
               <p>England. I think about a Quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing more to say?</p>
               <p>England. When I ask'd him about the Seat he said there was no such Thing; I said it was committed to his Care.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other Man?</p>
               <p>England. He was the Man that was with him upon the Box; he own'd that he was there himself, I can't swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Then Thomas Barrow own'd that he was with the Coachman; but you don't know it upon your own Knowledge?</p>
               <p>England. I saw the Coachman take up some Body, but I could not tell who.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you ask'd for the Coach Seat ?</p>
               <p>England. He said there was no such Thing; I said he had such a Thing.</p>

               <p>Thornhill. It was dark when they came to us; it might be between Eight and Nine o'Clock at Night when the Maid came; there was, I believe, six Boxes taken out of the Coach; she came into my Shop, and said, Where is the Coach Seat. The Boy,

               <p>Thornhill. The Maid herself said, that she saw it put into the Boot; upon which he then said, it was lost at my Door; that somebody had stole it after he had been charg'd with it: He said my Servants had robb'd him. I said they were my Servants, and I would be answerable for them.</p>

               <p>Herd. Upon the 6th of July, early in the Morning, I receiv'd a Note from Dr. Harding, to go to Mr. Edger; which I did, and told him that I wanted to enquire of the Man that drove the Coach last Night: So we went into Tyburn Road, and call'd him up, and I desir'd him to go with me to find out the Man that drove the Hackney Coach last Night, No. 190. So he ask'd another Man if he knew the Prisoner at the Bar, calling him by a Nick-Name; he said, Yes, and that he had burnt almost a whole Candle that Night, and he did not come home; another Man made Answer, he believ'd he was asleep in the Haylost: The Man went down, and came up again, and said he was there. So I spoke to him, and ask'd him if he knew any thing of a Coach Seat that was lost last Night; the Coachman said to him, Did not you and I put it into the Coach? then he said he did carry it to St. Paul's Church-Yard, and that he set his Feet upon it; but at first he said nothing of it, which made Mr. Budby give him some rash Words, and lay to him, Did not I help you to put it in myself? Then he answer'd, he had carried it to Mr. Thornhill's in St. Paul's Church-Yard. The Man that brought me the Note for my Master told me, that there was another Man came along with him. I ask'd Smith whether somebody did not get upon the Coach at Rathborne-Place, when he drank a Dram with him; he said, Yes, but he went no further; but afterwards confess'd that he went along with him all the Way.</p>

             gives Mecum a Hand up with thus Yarn, in order to carry it home to Mecum's House.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do the mean time ?</p>
               <p>Archer. Stamford and I stood to look if any body saw us. After we had brought the Yarn pretty near to his House, he run to get his House open, which he did: We Went into the Entry, and threw it down the Cellar. As soon as he carried it as far as he had a Mind, Mr. Swift carried it; then James Stamford; when he was tired, I carried it upon my Shoulder: Mecum carried it as far as Goswell-Street, then he ran home to get his Door open to put it down his Cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it?</p>
               <p>Archer. It was sold to Gordon for 20 s. but I never had but 3 s. and Mr. Smith owes me now 18 d. of the Money.</p>

               <p>Kent. The 20th of April I got up and found my House robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave all your Doors fast?</p>
               <p>Kent. The last Thing I did I went and boked the Window and Doors, and every Thing myself: I thought I heard something in the Night, but I thought it was one of my Children.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time did you get up in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Kent. Between Five and Six o'Clock my Wife and I got up; my Wife came down first, and as she was coming down, says she our Windows are open; I said it might be my Boy that is gone to School, but says she here is your Chest gone; then I said I am ruin'd for ever, for there were 29 Pair of Hose, that were none of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any other Things?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030037"/>Kent. Yes, six Pewter Plates, a large Pewter Dish: There were in the Chest two Silk Handkercheif; there was my Pocket Book, but it was not put into the Indictment, nor a Quarter of the Things; there were three Dozen of Worsted Stockings, four Pair of Cotton, and four Pair of Thread, all these were in the Chest locked up; there was a five Pant Copper Sauce-Pan, and a very particular Pair of Hose, Sky-colour'd blue.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find your House broke open?</p>
               <p>Kent. In the Window; there was a Plate of Iron a with seven Nails. This Plate of Iron was wrenched of; they endeavoured to take down the whole Frame of the Window; the next Day after I advertised, I found one of the particular Sky-coloured Stockings that were in my Chest.</p>
               <p>Q. What Clocks had they ?</p>

               <p>Q. (to Abraham) What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Abraham. I was going from London to Brentford on the 5th of August; I met the Prisoner about a Quarter of a Mile from Brentford; he had two more in Company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any Body stop you?</p>
               <p>Abraham. The Prisoner begins with me, what have you got there? I told him nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you had got nothing, and you had the Box under your Arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030038"/>Abraham. I keep my Box fast, he strived to get my Box from me and he did break open the Cover under my Arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he take out?</p>
               <p>Abraham. A Clasp Knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what Value ?</p>
               <p>Abraham. About 6 d. or 7 d. after this he began to strike me, he pull'd me down to the Ground; my Partner bid me run to the Publick-House, which is the Green-Dragon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you so near to him that you could hear him tell you to go into the Publick-House ?</p>
               <p>Abraham. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the three Men did not meddle with him.</p>
               <p>Abraham. No. So we got away from all the three Men and they follow'd us into the Green-Dragon, and began to strike me again, and quarrel'd also with the Person of the House; When the Landlady said she would not draw them any Beer, they said they would kill her and break all the Things to Pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for the Constable.</p>
               <p>Abraham. No; you shall hear the Story out.</p>
               <p>Court. We have heard it from you; and the strangest Story that ever was heard.</p>
               <p>Abraham. So after this he says to me, let me have your Box; in the House he bid me give him what I had about me.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you give it to him?</p>
               <p>Abraham. I said I had none.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a Robbery in the House; not upon the Highway.</p>
               <p>Abraham. My Lord, on the Highway he robb'd me of a Knife, and in the House he wanted my whole Box.</p>

               <p>Levy. I was going to Brentford with him on Tuesday the 5th; I went with him because he could not speak English: A Quarter of a Mile from Brentford three Fellows took hold of him, and ask'd what he had got there; he said nothing; you lye, you Son of a B - h, says one of them; then they knock'd him down, broke the Cover of his Box, and took out a Knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all three assist?</p>
               <p>Levy. They knock'd him down.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do all that Time?</p>
               <p>Levy. I was at a Distance; and I spoke in our Language to get to the House.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Person that robb'd you follow you to the House?</p>
               <p>Levy. Yes; the Landlady ask'd what they wanted, and they bid her draw them some Beer; but she said she would not; then they gave him one Knock here and another there: They took Six-pence from me, and ask'd me if I had any more.</p>

               <p>Grimson. I am one of the Constables of Brentford; when I was inform'd of this Matter I went to the House, and said to these Jews, Pray which is the Man that robb'd you, not considering that they were all in Conjunction? and he shew'd me that the Prisoner was the Man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they pretend they were robb'd of?</p>
               <p>Grimson. One of them was robb'd of a Knife and the other of Six-pence. I went up to the Man and collar'd him; and said, Friend, I am Constable and you are my Prisoner: He made some Resistance, and there was a good deal of Fighting and Quarrelling. The Prisoner acknowledg'd that he took the Knife and Six-pence; then we went to two or three Justices, but found none of them at home. The next Morning we brought him before Justice De Veil. We could not take the other two as we were not provided.</p>

               <p>Harvey. I saw these Jews crying about the Streets, they were enquiring for the Constable, and the People sending them about from one Place to another. They said they had been robb'd by three Men near the Green Dragon, one of a Knife and the other of Six-pence; I said, if you go to such a Place you will find the Constable making himself merry among some of his Friends: However I follow'd them to the Constable, who did not care for going; but I insisted upon it, and told him I would go with him; then he said he would go. We went down to the Red Lion, and says the young Jew, this is the Man; with that we seiz'd him. Then the other Fellows said, d - n you he shall not go with you; with that one of them knock'd Grimson down, and had like to have serv'd me in the same Manner; but by the Assistance of a third Person we did make shift to secure this Gentleman at the Bar.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose these Things?</p>
               <p>Youthouse. About the 1st of June.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you before Sir Thomas?</p>
               <p>Youthouse. I believe in July three Times. I saw the Prisoner brought up; he said he gave them to the Woman to pawn; I beg Pardon, he gave the Woman the Chints to mend, she was his Laundress, or something; but Sir Thomas said they liv'd together. She was to give him 40 s. for the Curtains to make her a Gown. Sir Thomas ask'd him how he came by them; he said he was at Pepper-Alley Stairs, and there met with a Woman that ow'd him 25 s. who gave him the Goods abovemention'd.</p>
