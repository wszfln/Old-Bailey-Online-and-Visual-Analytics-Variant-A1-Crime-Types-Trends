                  </hi>. I am the wife of the defendant, William Story; he is a tailor and outfitter in Fleet-street. I have been for some time living at Notting-hill—I have been living away from my husband for some years—there was a decree in the Ecclesiastical Court, about three years since, at my application, for the restitution of conjugal rights, and after that a mutual separation took place between my husband and myself before Mr. Ald. Moon—there was an agreement to separate, and he agreed to allow me a guinea a week—in consideration of that I agreed not to go to my hus<lb/>band's house during the time he continued to pay me the guinea, and not to contract any debts, and I never contracted any during that period—after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185701050002"/>
               <p>that arrangement was made the guinea a week was paid to me for some<lb/>thing like a year and nine months—during that time I did not go to my husband's house at all, nor did I contract any debts during the time the guinea was paid—Mr. Story then reduced it to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I was then paying just 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my board at a school—that 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. continued for something like six or seven months, or it might have been rather more—he then reduced it to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he thought of reducing it still further—in conse<lb/>quence of his reducing it, I consulted my attorney, and about eight or nine months after that I went back to my husband's house—I was placed in a desti<lb/>tute situation—I repeatedly wrote <hi rend="italic">sympathizing</hi> letters to Mr. Story, but I could not induce him to pay me any more, and on 2nd Dec. I went back to the house in Fleet-street—I went through the shop, and up stairs into a room on the first floor, that formerly used to be my sitting room, and there I saw my daughter, who is now in Court—I advanced towards her to embrace her, she looked frightened at me, and said, "Oh! don't touch me," she saw her father come into the room; he dragged me by the arm, and dragged me towards the door, calling to his shopman, Batchelor, and he said to Batchelor, "That woman is not my wife; knock her down"—the room opens into the hall—he dragged me towards the hall, and his friend Batchelor came and pushed me in the back, and pushed me out into the hall—I went to sit down on a chair, and he said to Batchelor, "Drag the chair from under that woman"—he did so—I then took another, and another, and a third, and they were all dragged from under me by the instruction of my husband—he was standing and looking on, and talking; I cannot tell what he said, he talked so very fast, and was in such a rage—he said to Batchelor, "That woman is not my wife, knock her down stairs"—he did so, but I, to save myself, clung hold of the hand rail, and held it with my left hand while Batchelor was knocking my other hand off, and at last he accomplished his purpose, and knocked me down; but before that a policeman came—I cried "Murder!" to save myself from being knocked down stairs in that way, and Mr. Story sent the shopman out to call a policeman, and he was at the bottom of the stairs, and saw me coming down, but he walked down stairs—I was knocked down stairs by Batchelor, I did not tumble down—I clung to the hand rail to save myself from falling—they got me down in that way, I was very thankful that my back was not broken—my husband was calling to Batchelor all the time to knock me down—they ultimately knocked me down stairs, and I was forced out at the side door by Batchelor—a police sergeant was outside, and he advised me to go to Guildhall.</p>

Moon, and you yourself settled it—he never summoned me for assault<lb/>ing him except that once, and I did not assault him then; I went home as I went home now; I was as innocent as I am at this very moment, and you know it, because you hushed up the case, and settled it by his allowing me a guinea a week—he does not allow me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week now—there was a proposition between Mr. Lewis, jun., and Mr. Story to pay me a guinea a week during this investigation, instead of which, when I went to Guild<lb/>hall, only 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was left for me, and I would not take it—I cannot live on</p>

On 2nd Dec., I was called in to Mr. Story's house, on to the first floor, I there saw Mr. and Mrs. Story, and their daughter, and Batchelor, standing at the top of the landing—Mrs. Story said she had been struck by some one behind; I did not hear her say by whom—Mr. Story asked me to put her out—I asked him who she was—he said, "Never mind who she is, put her out"—I said, "I believe it is Mrs. Story"—she said, "Yes, I am, I am his wife;" and I said, "Stop here"—I told him I could not put her out, I could not interfere if she was his wife—she then sat down in a chair—he asked Batchelor to put her out—Batchelor took hold of the back of the chair to lift it up, and Mrs. Story got up and sat down in another chair—he took that up in the same way, and took hold of Mrs. Story behind to put her towards the landing—she then caught hold of the banister, and clung to it; and while he was pulling her away I passed to the bottom of the stairs, and left him to put her down stairs—I saw the m come down stairs—I believe he had hold of her behind, pushing her in front of him—when they got to the bottom of the stairs, Mr. Story asked her to go out—she refused—he then opened the door, and told Batchelor to put her out; and he then put her out at the door—I believe she slipped down two or three steps towards the bottom of the stairs—I did not see her down on the ground—I believe Batchelor had hold of her behind, he was behind her; I was then standing at the bottom of the stairs—Batchelor was forcing her down the stairs—she did not come on her back at the bottom of the stairs; she did not tumble at all, nothing more than slipping down; she came on her backside, two or three steps from the bottom—she clung to the banisters at the top of the stairs—I believe Batchelor pulled her hands away; but I passed to the bottom of the stairs before he got them away—I did not see him strike her hands, I can<lb/>not tell whether he did or not—I heard a female scream when I entered the shop first, but not after I got on to the stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Emanuel Aguilar; we live in Albany-street, Regent's-park. On Wednesday, 10th Dec, I was walking with my aunt, in Wilson-street, Finsbury, about 2 o'clock—I had my purse in my hand—the prisoner Maude rushed at me; he struck me, and tried to get my purse—I grasped it more tightly—he gave me another blow, and got the purse—he struck me so hard a blow on my arm, that I could not use my hand for three days—when he got my purse, I instantly called, "Thief!"—he went down a court, and my aunt ran after him—I ran straight on; I do not know why; it was fright, I suppose—in about two minutes Maude was brought back by a gentleman—I had in my purse a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the purse was found in Langham's pocket—I did not see him till he was brought to me by a gentleman.</p>

I was walking, with the last witness in Wilson-street, on Wednesday, 10th Dec.—I saw the prisoner Maude come up; he struck the last witness's arm—he gave her a second blow, and called out something—he ran down a court—I saw he had taken something, and I ran after him—after he had gone some way, a gentleman stopped him—I went up, and he asked if he had robbed me—I said, "No," but I begged the gentleman to hold him fast—another gentleman took Langham—I saw the purse taken out of Langham's pocket by the policeman.</p>

On the night of 30th Nov., at half past 10 o'clock at night, I fastened the house safe—next morning I discovered this robbery—a pane of glass had been taken out of the skylight, and some things were missing—I sent word to the station house directly—a person could not get into house, he could only get his arm in, the iron bars are only about four inches apart—my house is not more than 300 yards from the Curtain-road—when I went to the top of my house I detected the robbery—I found the wrappers in which the goods had been; they had untied the wrappers in the house, and taken the articles out separately, and the wrappers were left outside on the roof—I have looked at the property that was in the bundle—the articles were mine in trust, they were pawned with me—they were all in the warehouse—one blanket is marked, and the person to whom it belongs identifies it—I am sure the things were all safe at half past 10 o'clock at night—I know this table cloth, or d'oyley cover, that was round the prisoner's neck; it had been round one blanket—here are ten blankets, and other articles—I am certain they are all such as I missed—they must have been three or four hours in doing what they did—it would take them a long time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fisherman, and live at Stanlake, Oxfordshire. About 8th or 9th Dec. I came up to town to receive 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received it on Friday, the 12th, at Groves's, and different places, and returned with it to Mr. Barwell's, of the Marlborough Arms—I left it with him, and went into New Oxford-street, and met the prisoner there—he asked me whether I had been to the cattle show—I told him I had—he then asked me if I knew where Wadley was, and Latchford, and Farringdon, which is near where I was living—I said that I did, and he asked me if I knew Mr. Goodluck, the squire—I said, "Yes"—he said that he had been living there the best part of his time, and since then at Reading—he asked me where I was going—I said, "To Mr. Barwell's, to have a glass of beer"—he said that he would go with me; he pointed to a house, and we went in—there were several people eating, and he said that we would not stop there—we went to a second, a third, and a fourth public house; the fourth was empty, and he said, "This will do, we can have a pipe here"—it was near Mr. Bar<lb/>well's, close to Oxford-market—he called for a pint of porter, and paid for it; we had another pint, and I paid for that—a man then came in, and said that he had been kept out of a certain sum of money for the last six years, and had now got it; that it was 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and twenty houses, and that there was a certain sum to be given to the poor in different parishes—(he did not appear to know the prisoner)—the prisoner said that he should like to have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to distribute where he was living, Reading, and said, "I dare say my friend," meaning me, "would like to do so also?"—I said, "No, it would be only a nuisance to me"—he said, "You may as well have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—the other man said that we must have a little capital of our own, and the prisoner pulled out a sovereign and a shilling, and said that that was all the money he had got, and asked me what money I had—I said that I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had left at Mr. Barwell's—the prisoner said that I might as well go and fetch it, to show that I had some, and he would go with me; so we went to the Blenheim-steps, and I went and fetched it, and came back, and the other man was standing outside the door—he said that if we would go down Tottenham-court-road, to his clerk's office, he would pay us—we went round the back way, and went to a public house, I forget the name; the other man said, "We will have a pint of beer"—the prisoner said, "We can drink a quart," so we had a quart—the other man paid for it, and said, "I will go to my clerk's office, and then I will pay you"—the prisoner heard that—the other man only drank a little drop out of one of the glasses, and was going out to his office when the pri<lb/>soner said, "How do we know that you will come back?"—he said, "I will leave my capital in your hands," and he did so, and the prisoner put his handkerchief over it—it was a pocket book, with some notes he said they were—he showed me some papers, which he said were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, but they were not very near to me—he came back in a little time, and said that his clerk would be there, and if we would go and get two stamped receipts he would give us the money, but said, "How do I know you will come back?"—the prisoner said, "I will leave my capital in your hands, and I dare say my friend will"—the prisoner then put his purse into the other man's hat—he had showed me a sovereign in it, as he said, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I said, "I shall not put my capital into his hat"—he went and fetched two stamped receipts, and wanted me to go outside with him, but I would not—he showed me two bits of paper, but I did not have them in my hands—he</p>

               <p>sat down, and the other man got up and went out, and said that he had been to his clerk again, and he could not come yet—he brought two purses back, which he said he had given a shilling for in the street—the prisoner said that he should very much like to have one of them—the other man said, "You shall have one, give me your money, and I will put it in for you"—he handed him his money, and he put it in—the prisoner then said, "No doubt my friend would like to have the other purse?"—I said, "It is of no use to me, as I have got one;" but he over persuaded me to have it, and so did the other—he said, "You give me your money, and I will put it in"—I said, "No, if you like to make me a present of the purse, I will put it in"—he said, "You hold the purse, and I will put the money in "—the purse remained in my hands all the time—the prisoner said that it did not appear that his clerk was coming very quickly, and he should much like to have a sovereign for his trouble—the other man put a sovereign in, and gave him the purse back—he then said, "My friend would like to have a sovereign, no doubt," meaning me—he said, "You give me your purse, and I will put it in for you"—I said, "No, if you like to make me a present of a sovereign well and good, I can put it in"—he held out his hand for me to take the sovereign, and as I was looking, the other man snatched the purse out of my hand, and pretended to drop a sovereign into it, and then gave it to me back—I was then between them; one was on one side, and one on the other—he said that he was just going across the road to a shop, and would send the shopman across to me, and make me a present of something—they both went out, and I was almost certain that I had been cheated; that was the first time that that dawned upon me—I did not look at the purse, but went out at the door, and saw them both running very fast—I ran after them more than 100 yards, and then caught the pri<lb/>soner, and said, "You have got my money"—he said, "I have not, you go and catch the other man"—I said, "No, I shall take you"—he tried to get away, but I said that it was of no use, as I intended to hold him; he struggled, but I held him, and gave him into custody—I found in the purse 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, and seven counterfeit sovereigns—I gave the purse to the policeman, in the same state as I received it from the third man—it was a net purse, put on the outside of the other which I had got; mine was a sort of bag—the fellow purse was not found, but I saw it when the prisoner received it from the third person; it was exactly like this—I was perfectly sober—I had only had one glass of beer before I went in, but the part of the three pints of porter which I took had a wonderful effect upon me—some of the last pint was left when they ran away—when I left the second public house I was in no wise drunk, but I found the ill effects of the two pints of porter, I was quite as well as I was when I left the first public house.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, F</hi> 17). On 19th Dec., I went to a house in Porter-street, Soho, about 9 o'clock in the evening—I was in plain clothes—before I got there, I saw Phillips come out of the shop, and go across the street—I was then six or seven yards from the shop—I went into the shop immediately—no one had gone into the shop from the time Phillips came out till I went in—there was no one in the shop—there is a counter running the length of the shop, and there is a parlour behind the shop—it is necessary to go through the counter to get to the parlour—I and Radford, another officer, went into the parlour; I found Wallis sitting down at needle work near the fire—there was a table in the room, and on the table was this small box—I said to Wallis, "What have you here?" taking up the box at the time—she made no answer—I looked in the box, and it contained counterfeit money—I took my handkerchief out of my pocket and covered the box round, and placed it on the chair where Wallis had been sitting—after leaving her in the custody of Radford—I then went to the shop door, and Phillips came to the door at the same time—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, I want you for the unlawful possession of counterfeit coin"—he made no answer—I took him into the shop, and into the back par<lb/>lour, where Wallis was standing in custody of Radford—Phillips looked at Wallis, and he said, "Who brought that box here?" pointing to the table—the</p>

I saw the two prisoners together in Bishopsgate-street, loitering about—I saw them both go and look into the window of Mr. M'Donald's shop—Mail then went into the shop, and Nicholls walked backwards and forwards outside—Mail came out in about two minutes, and I went into the shop—Mrs. M'Donald showed me a crown piece—it was marked in my presence, and I left it with her—it was given me again last Tuesday, and I can recognize it as the same—when Mail came out of the shop, Nicholls crossed over to her, and they went away together—I lost sight of them—on Tuesday, 30th Dec., I saw the prisoners again, in Bishopsgate-street—I saw Mail alone, and I followed her, and Nicholls met her in the street in about two minutes—I at once took them into custody—I gave Mail to another officer, and Nicholls ran off—I am certain he is the same man I had seen with Mail before—I had seen them three times previously together—I ran after Nicholls, he was stopped by a gentleman, and I took him to the station—I found on him a knife, but no money—Mail was searched by the female searcher, who gave me this crown piece the next day at the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers at the General Post-office. The prisoner was a letter carrier there, and had been so for about fourteen months—his general employment was that of a letter carrier, and in the evening he was engaged in the general business of the office at St. Martin's-le-Grand—on the evening of 18th Dec. he was employed in the office, stamping with the obliterating stamp, till 7 o'clock, in the newspaper office; after that, finishing at the Norwich-road at the Newspaper-office; and then going to the Inland-office, and carrying out the bags to the mails in the yard—about 20 minutes to 8 o'clock he went to the Inland-office, and finished there, ultimately carrying out the bags—some short time before 8 o'clock that evening, I sent for the prisoner into an inner office—Mr. Delany, another inspector, accompanied the prisoner into my office—I said to the prisoner, "A packet is missing from the facing table; do you know anything of it?"—after a little time, he said, "Yes, I do"—I then said, "Where is it?"—he put his hand into his left hand trowsers pocket, took out a packet, and gave it me—the facing table is a large table, upon which newspapers are put previous to their being put before the sorters—the prisoner was occasionally engaged at that table on that evening—it some<lb/>times happens, in the course of the business, that packets come to the office among the newspapers—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the packet the prisoner gave me—it is directed to Mr. Titchener, High-street, Chelmsford—I then said to him, "Have you got any more?"—he said, "No"—I then sent for Bingham, the officer, and desired him to search the prisoner—he proceeded to do so, and the prisoner produced another packet from his right hand pocket—this is it—it is directed to Mr. Wilcoxson, druggist, Nottingham—I saw Bingham then take a packet from his coat tail pocket, addressed to Mr. Birch, superintendent of police, Lodden, near Norwich—if packages of that kind had been posted at Upper Berkeley-street or Bishopsgate-street at half past 5 o'clock in the evening, they would arrive at the General Post-office in time to be dispatched by that night's mail into the country—the prisoner was given into custody—his wages were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he had been absent on leave for two weeks, and had returned on the Monday previous—if any wages were due to him, he would have received them upon going to the proper officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the deputy comptrollers of the Post-office. A Mr. Braden keeps the Post-office receiving house at Smithfield-bars—on 12th Dec. in consequence of something that had trans<lb/>pired in that district, I made up a test letter—I placed in it a half sovereign and a sixpence, which I marked, and three postage stamps, which I also marked—I placed them in an envelope, with a medallion head upon it—I also put a marked postage stamp on the letter, and directed it to a fictitious address, "Thomas Cadman, mate on board H. M. S. <hi rend="italic">Lightning</hi>, Portsmouth; if sailed, to be sent to Rio Janeiro"—I fastened the letter with adhesive gum, and gave it to Mr. Cole, with directions what to do with it—if that letter had been posted at half past 11 o'clock on the following day, it ought to have arrived at the General Post-office at half past 12—I was at the Post-office on the 13th, when the half past 12 o'clock collection came from Smithfield-bars; they are accompanied by a letter bill, stating the number of letters—this is the bill that came; thirty-two letters are mentioned—the letter I had given to Cole was not among them; thirty-two letters did arrive—I afterwards proceeded to Mr. Braden's with Cole and Smee—the prisoner was not there, he had gone to his dinner—I sent Cole for him, and he shortly returned with him—Cole said to me, in the prisoner's presence, "I have found your stamps, Sir, in his plate"—he produced these four stamps, which are the same that I had put in and on the letter on the previous day—I said to the prisoner, "These are my stamps, where did you get them from?"—he said, "I found them on the floor when I was sweep<lb/>ing the shop"—I asked him at what time—he said, "At 8 o'clock this morning "—I told him the letter was not posted till half past 11 o'clock, and desired the officer to search him—Mr. Cole had previously produced twenty-six sovereigns—I saw Smee take some money from him—I cannot say how much, but there was some silver and gold, and I identified amongst it the half sovereign and the sixpence that I had placed in the letter.</p>

On Friday, 5th Dec., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the bar, and ordered a bottle of rum and a bottle of gin—he had an apron on, and no coat—I served him with a bottle of gin, and got a man who was stopping with us, to fill a bottle of rum—after I had filled a bottle with the ordinary gin, I said, "We have a better quality, sir, if you prefer it," giving him a drop in a glass—he said, "That is very good; I prefer the best, and don't mind the price"—I filled a second bottle of the best, and laid both bottles on the counter—they came to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would refund 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the two bottles when they were returned—he laid what appeared to me to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of Eng<lb/>land note on the counter—I took it up and looked at it, and being a dusky day I thought it a very good one—I asked him where he brought it from—he said, from Mr. Gordon, Cecil-court—I said, "Are you Mr. Gordon?"—he said, "No, but I will put Mr. Gordon's name on with pleasure"—I fetched pen and ink, and he wrote on it, "C. Gordon, Cecil-court"—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Cecil-court is quite convenient to our house—I took the note, and put it in my pocket, gave the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and thanked him, and he left—I paid the note away, I think, on the 10th, to our brewer's collector; it came back on the following Tuesday, as a forgery—I knew that there was a Mr. Gordon living in Cecil-court; I did not know him, but I had heard customers speak of him—On 17th Dec., the prisoner came again, and asked for a bottle of the best gin—I took an empty bottle in my hand, and went into the parlour and spoke to nay husband—he is an invalid—the prisoner could not hear what I said to my husband—I came back to the bar, put the bottle of gin in paper, and laid it on the counter—the prisoner laid down a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, apparently, to me—I took it up, and looked at it, and said, "Is this your own note?"—he said, "No, the gentleman's name and address is on it"—I said, "Yes, but it does not look to me nice"—I took it into the parlour, and spoke to my husband, and brought it back, and said to the prisoner, "They won't give me change for it, they don't think it a right one"—he said, "Give it to me, if it is a bad one I will take it back to the person"—I said, "No, I shall detain the note until you fetch the gentleman from Princes-street, who owns it"—my hus<lb/>band went round and came in at the front door, and left the house with the prisoner—I said to him, "Go with this gentleman to Princes-street, and fetch the gentleman that owns this note;" and I said privately to my hus<lb/>band, "Give him into custody, that is the person that brought the other note"—the prisoner looked very pale, but said nothing; he went quietly with my husband—I kept the note in my hand—I marked it afterwards at the station—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave it to Ryan the constable when he came back with my husband and the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge at No. 8, Well-street, Whitechapel. On Friday afternoon, 26th Dec., I was in the Globe public house with Lynch, a companion of mine—when we came out we saw some musicians playing, and, as far as I saw, one of the musicians had some artificial flowers in his hat—there was a crowd, and the prisoner was one in the crowd—very shortly afterwards I observed that Lynch had some artificial flowers in his hand—they appeared to me to be like the flowers in the hat—I did not see how he got them; I suppose he took them from the hat—some words took place between the musicians and Lynch about those flowers, and some blows were exchanged between them—the police came and separated Lynch and the musicians—after that, I was going away with Lynch, my companion—we walked right down a street and turned a corner, and about ten yards from the corner I heard a noise behind me—I turned, and saw about a dozen Germans running after us—they were the musicians—about half a dozen of them came to me—the prisoner was one of those that came up—I saw one of them, I cannot say which, with a knife in his hand, and I received a stab in the left side of the neck—I had turned round and exchanged some blows with about half a dozen who came up—before</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, United-buildings, Lisson-street, Marylebone. On 8th Nov.

I am the wife of the last witness, and was with him in the public house in Manning-street—he went up stairs to get his money, I remained down stairs—he came down and got something to drink at the bar, and took out half a sovereign—at that time the prisoner was sitting on a side form—I am sure of that, and that man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to a person</hi>) was with him—my husband put the change into his pocket, I believe, and we all went towards home—I was walking behind my husband in Bell-street, as I was carrying some loaves home—the prisoner was behind me, and this man with him, and as my husband got to the corner of Bell-street, the prisoner lifted up his hand and struck him; he fell down, and the other man said, "It is no <hi rend="italic">go</hi>, now, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>"—they ran away, while I called "Murder! police!"—assistance was procured, and my husband was</p>

About half past 2 o'clock on Thursday morning, 18th Dec, I saw the female prisoner and the prosecutor come out of the Bed Lion and Spread Eagle public house, Whitechapel, and walk together towards Whitechapel Church—Scully came out of the same public house and looked after them, he then went in again, and in a minute or a minute and a half came out and walked in the same direction as they had—in five minutes I heard a noise, went and saw Scully on the pavement, holding Goggin down, with his knees upon his chest, and, as well as I could see, his hands in his pockets—Smith was</p>

"—being the worse for liquor, we detained him at the station for the night—Goggin appeared to be suffering very much, and for a week afterwards, when he was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, carrying on business with my partners, in Wigmore street. Our premises are part in Wigmore-street, and part in Welbeck-street—I reside on the premises—about the beginning of Dec., we were making alterations in the premises, so as to throw in the house, No. 65, Welbeck-street, and labourers were engaged there, and had been that day—there is a large shop door which enters from Wigmore-street into the shop, and communicates with the house part of the premises in Wigmore-street—there is also a door at the house, No. 65, Welbeck-street—on 10th Dec., the party wall had been thrown down, so as to communicate from No. 64, Welbeck-street, into the premises in Wigmore-street—at the back of the premises in Wigmore-street, are leads which cover the rooms on the ground floor—on 10th Dec., I retired to rest at 11 o'clock; my ser<lb/>vants retired at the same time—the shop had been fastened up previously; the door in Wigmore-street was fastened also, but it only fastens with a patent latch, there is no bolt to it—on the morning of the 11th, I was awoke by the ringing of the bell in Wigmore-street—my bedroom is on the second floor, at the corner of Welbeck-street—I looked out at the window, and saw a policeman in Welbeck-street—I went down to the door of No. 64, Wel<lb/>beck-street, and found the door standing open, and the prisoner at the door in his policeman's uniform; another policeman was there also—as I came down I heard the prisoner say to the other policeman, "Do not you leave, if you do, I will report you"—I spoke to the prisoner first—there is a large well hole, which leads down to the basement of No. 65, without any railing; and I said, "Last night I saw a candle left burning there, by the basket of one of the builders; we will go down here and see whose basket it was by which the candle stood; it may lead to some discovery"—I then went down the ladder of the well hole, to the basement floor, and found the basket and candle, and said, "We will take away this basket; I will take it into my private room, and I will find in the morning whose basket it is"—the pri<lb/>soner went down with me (I had sent a person to put the candle out when I discovered it)—I afterwards discovered that the basket belonged to one of the gas fitters, one of my own workmen—you can easily get from the base<lb/>ment to the street by coming up the ladder—the prisoner said, "I will carry the basket"—he went forward, and did not go up the ladder that we had come down by, to my surprise, but went up a new staircase which was in an unfinished state; there are about four steps, and then the frame of a landing, but nothing to step on—that staircase brings you up into No. 65, Welbeck-street, to the ground floor; it is the intended communication from the ground floor to the basement—the house looks east at the corner of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185701050044"/>
               <p>Wigmore-street and Welbeck-street—the well hole is inside the house (<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out the different positions on a plan</hi>)—I came up the staircase which brought me up to the ground floor of No. 65, Welbeck-street again—I then went over the show room on the ground floor, which extends over the premises in Wigmore-street, and also to the back, but we went merely over the premises in Wigmore-street—a party wall had been taken down, and in the partition an aperture was made by which we go through at the west end of the other house; we went through, and then went eastward the whole length to the lamp room—nothing appeared to have been dis<lb/>turbed—I said to the prisoner, "Here is nothing disturbed, everything is precisely as it was"—he made no observation upon that, and we returned; I intending to take him out into the street again, to let him out—in doing so he came to a little enclosure in which there was a desk belonging to one of my sons, and he said, "Let us look in here"—it is a little recess between the shop and No. 65; it forms an aperture in the party wall—it is visible from the shop, and there is a railing, a little gallery—I looked at my son's desk, it had been apparently disturbed, the papers inside had been moved; it was shut, but not locked—I said, "Well, here is nothing gone;" for I had no suspicion of money whatever—he said, "Look here;" referring to a drawer which was standing open on the left hand, under the desk; the bolt was shot up, and it evidently had been forced open by some means—I had no suspicion that money had been kept in that drawer—I said, "It has evidently been broken open"—we then went into an adjoining office belong<lb/>ing to my eldest son; it leads towards Welbeck-street; the prisoner went in first—I did not cause him to go in there; I think I said, "We will go to the next desk," but I do not remember—I lifted up the desk, and saw the papers in great confusion, but said, "They have taken nothing however"—he then said, "Look here," pointing his light down to a drawer below the desk which had been forced open; he said also, "Here are two porte-monnaies lying open on a chair, and empty"—I did not know to whom they belonged, but I suspected to my son—we then went into the shop where the clerk's desks are, and he directed his light to another little drawer under the first desk which we came to—he went first, of necessity, to the clerks' desks, for on entering my second son's counting house, it is so narrow, that whoever went first must continue first—I did not direct him which way to go; he went forward into the shop first—there was another small drawer which had been forced also—he then went forward, I am not sure who went first, to another office, where the writing clerks are, and there he pointed my atten<lb/>tion to a cash box which had been broken open—an erasing knife was lying by the side of the cash box, it had been broken evidently in the attempt to open the cash box—I was not still under the impression that nothing had been taken when I saw that the drawers had been forced; but my impres<lb/>sion was, that they were very trifling sums—we kept money in that cash box, we generally give out 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. among the clerks for change, and that I imagined would be the extent of the loss—I conducted the prisoner to the door by which he had entered, and the other policeman was still there—just before he went out we had been up stairs, into the drawing room of No. 65, and found the window open—the glass had been taken out of that window for the convenience of the workmen going backwards and forwards—the window opens on to the leads of the premises in Wigmore-street—the leads are bounded on one side by Easly-news—on 10th Dec., the builders were employed in going out of the room in Wigmore-street, over those leads to the mews; but the builders who ascend that ladder were not employed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185701050045"/>
               <p>there, but in a different show room; it was not the builders employed in Welbeck-street, but others—the prisoner went through the window by means of two planks that were there; he walked up the planks, looked about and came back, and said, "One of your windows is open"—I said, "We will find that out, I can see none;" and I went into the house again, and asked the servants if one of the windows was open—I found that it was not one of my windows, but one at No. 20, Wigmore-street—my drawing room window was open—we examined the street door, but there were no marks of violence whatever—the other doors were quite secure—the inspector came to me about 9 o'clock next morning.</p>

On the night of this robbery I went round the premises, and can speak to all the external doors being secure, except the one at No. 65, Welbeck-street, which I did not examine—about 6 o'clock next morning my attention was called to my desk; both it and the little drawer under it were locked the night before, and about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was there—there was a paper envelope with two sovereigns, a <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie</hi> with ten half sovereigns, and a brown holland bag with twelve half crowns, twenty shillings, one five-shilling piece, a two-frane piece, and the rest in shillings and sixpences—on the following morning they were all gone, and the <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie</hi> lying empty on a chair at the side; the bag was taken away—my desk adjoins the temporary partition, and is near the opening which had been made in that partition, adjoining my brother's office—there are six other drawers there, but they are without locks; this drawer had a Bramah lock, but the others had only knobs—nothing was taken from the desk, but it was turned upside down—there had been no money in it.</p>

On 10th Dec. last I was working at Mr. Benham's premises, in Welbeck-street, as a carpenter's labourer—about 4 o'clock, that day, I went out on to the leads, and told Michael Wallis to shut the drawing room window when he came down at night—the sashes of that window were taken out at the time we were working there—it was the shutters I told him to shut; they were there still—Wallis was there after me—I left at half past 6 o'clock—I went out by the door in Welbeck-street, and closed it after me.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 288). On the night of the robbery my beat was on the right hand side of Welbeck-street—that is adjoining the prisoner's beat, he took one side of Welbeck-street, and I the other—I know the prisoner's beat, I believe it describes the figure 8—he starts from the corner of Wigmore-street and Marylebone-lane, goes down Marylebone-lane, then up Bentinck-street, and up one side of Welbeck-street, he then goes down Wigmore-street as far as Wimpole-street, he then turns down Wimpole-street till he comes to Little Welbeck-street, goes along Little Welbeck-street, and then up on the other side of Welbeck-street—I sup<lb/>pose he then goes into Eastley's-mews—in going back he would go through Eastley's-mews—that is the whole of his beat—I should think it would take him about twenty or twenty-five minutes, walking at a usual pace—I</p>

               <p>saw the prisoner that night a few minutes after 12 o'clock—his duty commenced at 12 o'clock—I saw him about a quarter, or rather better past 12 o'clock, at the corner of Little Welbeck-street in Welbeck-street—there is a shutter-box there, where we put away our capes if we do not want them—he and I did so that night—we then walked a short way together through Little Welbeck-street towards Wimpole-street—we had some little common conversation together—he said that he had spent 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of his week's money, and had given the rest to his wife, and that she had laid it out in domestic purposes, grocery, and things for the house—the wages were paid the day before—he was merely saying that he had spent 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his money, that his wife rather objected to it, and he had given her the rest, and he said he had no money—when he said he had given his wife the money, and she had spent it, I merely said that I did not lay out the money myself, but I knew pretty well what things cost, and that was the whole of the conversation, and I went on round my beat—I saw him again that night at 1 o'clock, as near as I can say, as I came round my beat—I met him in Little Welbeck-street—as I went one way he was passing another—I saw him again at a few minutes before 3 o'clock, just upon the same place, just as he was going down—each time that I had met him I met him there, passing round—he went one way and I the other—I did not see him between 1 o'clock and a few minutes to 3—I had been round my beat, and through Little Welbeck-street as usual, and I had not seen him—I saw him at 4 o'clock at the corner of Welbeck-street, at Mr. Benham's house—that was the time for me to go off my beat—I came down on the left hand side of Welbeck-street, and passed over there—he was at the corner of Welbeck-street and Wigmore-street, with his lamp turned on—he called my attention, and said there was a street door open—I saw that the street door was wide open, standing back—he was standing close by the door—it was the first door from Wigmore-street—he rang the bell—Mr. Benham came down, and the prisoner went into the house—I went in afterwards—I did not go over the place with him, I stood in the unoccupied part of the house, that is, the house that is being taken into the premises—I stood so as to have a view of the street door—we went in at that door—no person could have left the premises by that door after the prisoner went in, without my seeing them.</p>

I was on duty as sergeant to visit the different police<lb/>men on their beats—the prisoner was on duty that night on the beat that has been described—I first saw him on his beat between half past 12 and 1 o'clock; he was then working his beat all right—I had no conversation with him, I only called out, "All right?" and he answered me "All right"—I saw him again at a few minutes before 3 o'clock at the corner of Welbeck-street and Wigmore-street, Mr. Benham's corner—I asked him if it was all right—he said it was, and I told him there was a penny to pay for the widow of a late constable—it is a custom to collect a penny from all the officers in the force for the widows—he said, "I do not think I have got one"—I said, "Give me a shilling, I have plenty of <hi rend="italic">coppers</hi>"—he then pulled a penny from his great coat pocket, and gave me, at the same time he said, "I am not short of a shilling either," and he pulled out his pocket book, and opened it, and it was full of large silver—I did not form any opinion as to how much there was—I said to him, "You have plenty of money, Compton"—he said, "Yes, will you have half a crown to drink my health?"—I said, "No, I do not want your money," and left him to go from him, and he slipped a half crown into my great coat pocket—my wrapper was in it, and my pocket was a little way open, and he dropped the half crown into it—he told me it was there, or else I should not have known it—he said, "It is in your pocket"—I took it out, and threw it on the pavement, and asked him the reason why he took such a liberty as that, that I did not want his money, and I ought to report him for it—he had never offered me any money before—I told him to leave his beat at 4 o'clock, and go in reserve to the station to look after the prisoners—I then proceeded on my rounds—it was my turn to go off at 4 o'clock, and go to the station—I saw the prisoner again, a little after 4 o'clock, at Mr. Benham's door, with a lamp turned on—I was not close to him—I called to him, and told him not to forget to go in as a reserve man—he was not going off till 6 o'clock, but the reserve men</p>

I have done nothing"—I said, "I did not find the gold that several persons say they saw in your possession this morning"—he said, "I had no gold, and I do not care if 100 people swear that I had"—I made no reply—the charge was read to him shortly after by the inspector on duty, and the prisoner in my hearing said that he was innocent—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the money I got from Carruthers'—one crown piece, twenty half crowns, four florins, thirty-four shillings, and six sixpences—I then returned Mr. Carruthers his 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I went to the</p>

               <p>coming very fast—I pulled close to the pavement, and as soon as I had done that, I saw a Hansom <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming, and in a moment I saw it was without a driver—I could see one lady sitting on the off side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—on the other side I saw nobody—the horse was coming at a very furious rate—I was on my right side, close into the pavement—the horse of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was in the middle of the road, about twenty or twenty-five yards before he came to me, but he shied off, and I thought he was coming in a direction upon my horse, but just before he came to me his near side wheel took the end of my pole and broke it, and took the harness away from the near side horse, and left the off side horse, which <hi rend="italic">jumped</hi> right into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I could not see that the pole came in collision with anybody in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—she was in a dark dress, I could not see her—the prisoner came up; he was apparently drunk; I touched him on the shoulder, and warned him not to say too much, as I believed one of the ladies was dead—his answer was that if he had broken his b—neck too, there would have been two of them out of the way—he said more, and made use of very bad language to Mr. Ward—Mr. Ward told me to go to my horses, and take no notice of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of the Great Northern Railway Company, and have been so since 1851. I was employed in the audit department—the registration of stock was not in my department until Feb., 1856, when, in consequence of some investigations, I was called in to assist in that department—I produce a transfer, No. 3623, dated 7th May, 1852; it pur<lb/>ports to be a transfer of 312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., consolidated B stock, from John Morriss, of Manningtree, to William Henry Dickson—I believe this signature, "John Morriss," to be in Redpath's writing, and this signature of "Timothy Shaw," the attesting witness, also—(<hi rend="italic">This being read was a transfer of</hi> 312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">consolidated B stock, from John Morriss, of Manningtree, to William Henry Dickson, for the consideration of</hi> 364<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">subject to the same conditions on which the said John Morriss held the same; accepted by William Henry Dickson, and signed by him in the presence of Timothy Shaw, of Manningtree, and by John Morriss, in the presence of W.

               <p>of a shade of a doubt—I have seen him write many times—I cannot tell you how many—I have looked over him when writing—I have only had an opportunity of seeing his writing within the last twelve months, all these transfers are in 1852 and 1853—I had not seen Redpath write at that time—it was after February that I first saw him write—I cannot say how often since—I have taken a great many documents into his room, and have seen him write a great many—I do not swear to this Stephen George Hammond being Redpath's, I state that I believe it to be Hammond's genuine signature—I believe Hammond is here—there are three attesting witnesses, Hammond, Sidney, and Shaw, and of those three signatures I swear to two—I believe that this is Hammond's writing as an attesting witness to one of these documents—there have been mistakes made, I have no doubt, in the books, in reference to transfers in the hurry of business—I never omitted to enter a transfer in the name of the vendor, nor in the name of the purchaser—other clerks may have done so, I cannot state positively—I know more of the registry office since I have been there than the other clerks—I have been through the transfer book to about No. 18, 000 odd, or 19, 000.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you aware of this law, "The said deed of transfer shall be delivered to the secretary, and be kept by him, and the secretary shall enter a memorial thereof in a book to be called the Register of Transfers, and endorse such entry on the deed of transfer, and shall on demand deliver a new certificate to the purchaser?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard of it—there is such a transfer book at the Great Northern Railway—Mr. Mowatt is the secretary—the book is kept in the registry office, the office in which this has occurred—this transfer is endorsed with a corresponding number in the transfer register—none of these transfers are endorsed by the secretary; they are numbered according to the number in the register of transfers—my initials were placed at the back of these as having taken them out—I have examined 18, 000 transfers; up to the present time there are about 22, 000—there are not as many as 40, 000—we have five different kinds of stock, besides the A and B stock; they are original 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock, part of these shares were converted into the A and B stock; 5 per cent perpetual preference, 5 per cent, redeemable preference, that is redeemable at 10 per cent, 4 1/2 per cent. preference stock, and 5 per cent preference stock, redeemable at 5 per cent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As regards these transfers, has the secretary ever endorsed them according to the instructions of this Act of Parliament to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—he has never written his name on them—when a transfer is made, it is generally sent to the company, either by the broker of the vendor, or of the purchaser—as soon as it is received in the office, it is entered in the transfer receipt book—all these transfers are undoubtedly entered in the transfer receipt book, otherwise they would not have that number—there are no other books in which they are entered, only the ledgers—the transfer is entered in the transfer receipt book by whoever attends to the post—it is not the duty of the party who receives a transfer of stock, to see that there is that stock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell me that you conduct business so loosely that if a transfer of 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock comes to your office, to the proper office, that you do not verify, and see whether that stock is in existence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly we do; but you asked me if the party who received the transfer did so—somebody does undoubtedly verify—all these transfers are entered in the transfer receipt book, and it is the duty of some person to verify the stock—the</p>

               <p>transferees of these documents have all been receiving dividends from the company since 1852—I have never speculated in stock—I do not know whether any of the directors of the company are present—I know Mr. Graham Hutchinson by name, and also by sight—I know Mr. Parker, and Mr. Arbouin the chairman of the finance committee, Mr. Dennison the chairman of the company, and Mr. Reynolds the accountant; he is still in the employment of the company—these gentlemen are still directors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that all those gentlemen have held stock in fictitious names in the Great Northern Railway? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that; I know they have held stock—I do not know that all those gentlemen have held stock in fictitious names in the Great Northern Railway—I know that some of them have held stock in different names to their own—I do not know that some of them have held stock in one, two, or three different names to their own, I will swear that, I have never lent my name to a director—I did not know that a great many of the officers of the company speculated in shares—I mean to say that I have only found since I have been through the books, that several of the officers have held stock at different times—I do not know of several of the officers holding stock in Other names than their own—I came from Mr. Reynolds's office in Jan. or Feb.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The stamp that is on each of these transfers would be put by Mr. Clark, the registrar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know who it would be put by—I cannot answer whether it was his duty to do it—it would be put by some one in the office—every transfer ought to go through the registrar's hands; whether they did so or not I do not know—they are all entered in the receipt book—the registrar might see that day by day—I do not know whether he would; it is not for me to say; I really do not know.</p>

Hammond—No. 16770 is the next, that is Hammond's—I have not gone through these transfers for the purpose of seeing who the attesting witnesses are—I was asked this question a month ago, but I did not know that I should be called upon—No. 16731 is witnessed by S. G. Ham<lb/>mond—No. 492 is witnessed by Redpath—No. 916, 917, 574, 545, 610, 623, and 1073, are all witnessed by Redpath—No. 16777 is attested by Cork ill; that is the witness who was examined in the last case—that is a transfer from Sidney—No. 2018 is witnessed by Corkill—No. 2257 is witnessed by Redpath—Nos. 2484 and 2485 are each witnessed by Redpath and also Nos. 2550, 2571, and 2643—(<hi rend="italic">The witness was requested to furnish the particulars of the remaining transfers before the dose of the case</hi>)—I do not know that holders of stock in the Great Northern hold it in a great many different names.</p>

I was in the neighbourhood of Old Kent-road, about 12 o'clock—I came by the last Greenwich omnibus that was going to the West-end; I got down at the Bricklayers' Arms, to take a Favourite omnibus from London-bridge—I asked the coachman the nearest way to London-bridge——he directed me down the road—as I went along I met two women—I asked them the nearest way to London—bridge—they said, "If you will give us something to drink, we will show you"—I said, "You shall have anything you like to drink if you will show me"—we went into a public house, and had some wine and cakes—I then asked them to show me the way—they said, "Down that way," pointing to the right—I went down that way—I have no recollection of the females accompanying me—I had been drinking, but I knew what I was doing—when I went down the street, the first sen<lb/>sation</p>

I reside at No. 73, Marigold-street, Rotherhithe—I am a turner—the prisoner works in the same shop with me—on 27th Dec, he came into the shop at half past 5 o'clock in the evening—there was an ap<lb/>prentice there, and the prisoner said to him, "Have you left work?"—he said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "Who told you?"—he said, "Joseph," meaning me—the prisoner said that it was like my b—impudence in doing so, and he took up the candlestick, which stands about ten inches high, took the candle out, and threw the candlestick at me—it missed me—he then took up the oil stone, which is about six inches long and weighs about three pounds, and he threw that at me—that missed me—he then took up the large hammer, and threw it at me—it struck me on the right cheek—I was knocked down senseless—the apprentice was there all the time—when I was down I do not know what took place—when I came to my senses I found the prisoner holding my head down—it was in the dark—he let go, and I got away from him—I have a wound on the top of my head—that could not be in falling, as it is on the top, and I fell on my back—I called, "Murder!"—some persons came in with a light, and I was taken away—I am suffering now from the effects of it—I cannot work.

On Saturday, 27th Dec, I was in the shop with the last witness, about half past 5 o'clock in the evening—I had a candle alight—the prisoner came in, and the first thing he wanted to know the reason why I had left off work—I said Joseph told me to leave off—he said it was like his impudence to tell me so—I did not hear Joseph say he was master there—he said he told me to leave off work—the prisoner then took up this candlestick, and threw it at Joseph—it did not hit him—he then took the oil stone and threw it at him—that did not strike him—he then threw this hammer at him, and he fell down senseless in the dark—the prisoner was abusing him in the dark, when he was on the ground—he was close to him—I heard a scuffling, but I could not see what it was—Dixon then came in with a light—Joseph was lying on the floor senseless—I lifted him up and put him on the block—the prisoner went out, and as he was going I heard him say, "I will do for him," and he walked away.</p>

               <p>of that, Pierce came up to London that same day, leaving me there—I either remained a week or stopped till the week was up, I cannot say which—I noticed on one occasion the way in which the safe that brought the bullion was—before Pierce left, we noticed generally the way in which it came—we were always there to notice whether the bullion safe was opened or not—we had not seen it opened.</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that on the occasion of a parcel coming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was before Pierce came up; a chest was going to be sent up to London empty, it was placed on the platform, and a man named Sharman, I believe a ticket porter, came out to lock the chest; and he used one key and there was another key suspended, which I supposed was the key of the other lock—I saw that done, and when he had locked it I followed him into the office, to see where he put the keys; and he put them into the cash till, a drawer under the desk that is at the office where the tickets are distributed at the harbour station—when I came up to London I saw Pierce and Burgess—during the time I remained at Folkestone after Pierce had left, I frequented a house there kept by a man of the name of Meadows, or some such name, in the upper part of the town—Chapman and Ledger, the two clerks, used to go there, and I used to go there to play at billiards with them—I did not succeed in getting any information from them—they gave me no facility whatever in the object I had in view—Pierce was living in Walnut-tree-walk, Lambeth, at this time—I mentioned to Pierce what had happened at Folkestone during his absence—I named to him that I had been down there seeing the trains in, and the policeman was always there looking for him—I stated to him that I thought we should be able to get the im<lb/>pressions, provided I had an introduction to one of the men, of the name of Sharman I think it was but, being a stranger, I could not make myself acquainted with him—it was then arranged (Pierce made the arrange<lb/>ment) that he should see Tester and make an appointment for Tester to meet me at Folkestone, and introduce me to this Sharman to walk about the station with me—Pierce met Tester, and made the arrangement to meet me there—I did not see him meet Tester—he told me that he had done so, and I was to go down to Folkestone, and stop there, and Tester was to meet me there as it were by accident—I went down alone—I should think that was something like eight or nine months previous to the robbery—I cannot speak correctly to dates—I stopped at the Pavilion Hotel that time—I only remained there two or three days, to the best of my recollection—I saw Tester at the up station on the Sunday, and we walked together down to the harbour station, and walked about—when I met him he merely asked me how I was, and such like, or if the parties were there—I said I had seen them, but I could not introduce myself to them—he said, "I will make it all right for you"—we walked arm in arm together down to the harbour station, and went into the office—he showed me about the office, and the, telegraph, and such like, and there we saw the man named Sharman, the ticket clerk—Tester introduced me to Sharman as "a friend of mine, stopping here for some little time"—when he introduced me to Sharman, it was proposed that we should go to the Pavilion to have a glass of wine—Sharman consented, and brought a friend with him—Sharman, his friend, and me and Tester went into the Pavilion—I called for some sherry and biscuits, which we partook of—Tester and Sharman were in conversation about how business was going on there, whether they had much bullion crossing, and</p>

               <p>such like; the principal of the conversation was between Tester and Shar<lb/>man, I merely sat there as any other person—I believe Sharman to be the name of the man, the ticket clerk, or something similar to that name—Tester dined with me that day at Folkestone—it was on a Sunday, I do not know the date—no one but Tester dined with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything then said about this robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He asked me what my opinion was; I said, I thought it was very likely, as I had had an intro<lb/>duction to Sharman I might go with him at the time he was issuing out tickets, and get an impression of the keys—Tester came up to London on that same day—I stopped at Folkestone—I used to take a walk on to the beach, or round about, to pass away my time—I generally endeavoured to throw myself in the way of Sharman, but he was a very sedate young man—I could not get further than the time of day with him; I could not get at all intimate with him—I did not see anything more of the chest, or the place where the keys were kept—finding that I could not get any way familiar with Sharman, I came up to London—I saw Burgess and Pierce—I told them that I could not make any impression with this Sharman on account of his being so sedate, but we would let it remain a little while, and we would go down again when the police had forgotten Pierce, which was consented to—during this time the key of the bullion chest was lost—Pierce communicated it to me—he told me that he had received a letter from Tester, stating that one of the keys was lost, and the bullion chest would have to come up to Mr. Chubb's to be repaired—after Pierce had made this statement to me, he stated that Tester had told him he expected the box up, and to let him have some wax to take the impression—I objected to that—I said, "No, I must take the impression myself"—he saw Tester, and commu<lb/>nicated that to him, and then the arrangement was made between Pierce and Tester for me to be at the arcade,—near the terminus, at a given hour of the day, and if he had the key he would let me take the impression—I went there accordingly, and met Tester—he stated that he had not got the key then—I met him the next day, and the same took place for two or three days or more—eventually I told him that I did not like standing under the arcade so much, and an appointment was then made to be at a beer shop at the corner of Tooley-street, kept by a man named Waller, or some such name, Wallis—I went there, and met Tester and Pierce—Tester produced two keys; they were new keys of Chubb's make—I told him that I must take one of them up stairs for a few minutes, at which he rather hesitated for a moment; he said, could not I do it there?—I said, I should prefer going up stairs—I rang the bell, and asked the waiter if I could go up stairs and wash my hands—he called the chamber maid, and she showed me up into a bed room; and I there took the impression of one of the keys; both keys were alike—I should say they were both for one lock, they were duplicate keys—I took two or three impressions on some wax—I then came down stairs, and returned the keys to Tester, and he went away, and I and Pierce went.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At this time, were you in the habit of see Burgess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we were in the habit of meeting Burgess; we always knew what train Burgess was upon, and if we had not any appointment made with him, we used to go to Sterne's and meet, and when he came in, if we had anything particular to talk about we used to go out into the dark—Sterne kept a public house in Tooley-street or a turning into Tooley-street, frequented by the servants of the company—I saw Burgess after taking the impressions of the key, I stated to him that we had one, that was half way, but the one was very</p>

               <p>little use without the other—the first time of my going to Sterne's beer shop was with Pierce; I met him there several times afterwards—I and Pierce and Burgess talked the matter over, how we could obtain the second key—it was proposed that I should go down to Folkestone and stop at the Pavilion Hotel, and Pierce was to send a letter to me in the name of Archer, stating that he would forward a box to me containing 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was possessed of money at that time, I advanced, I think, between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that purpose, in sovereigns—I went down to Folkestone on a Saturday, and stopped at the Pavilion—I received a letter from Pierce through the post—I destroyed that letter; it stated that he would forward a box down to me in the care of either Ledger or Chapman—I do not know which, and that he had insured it to the value of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I forget which—it was to be sent in a small box, to be insured at the London terminus in the usual way and directed for E. A Archer, to the care of one or other of those persons at the Folkestone station—I received the letter on the Saturday—I went to the office in the harbour, produced the letter to Chapman or Ledger, I do not remember rightly which it was that was in the office, and asked them if they had a box for me—they said it had not then arrived; and I told them I was stopping at the Pavilion if one should arrive—I inquired again on the Sunday; it had then arrived—I went to the upper station to see the train arrive and the iron chest put out—it was taken out in the ordinary way—it was then forwarded to the lower station—I walked down to the lower station and showed my letter to Chapman; Chapman stated that he believed he had got the box for me—I saw Chapman open the safe—he only used one key—there were two locks on the safe; but by unlocking one the safe opened, there was only one key used at that time—I noticed that he took that key from a cupboard at the back of the office, on the left hand going in—he took the box out and told me I must sign a form for the receipt of it—I told him that I was not able to do so as I had met with an accident and hurt my finger, and I would trouble him to do it for me, and he did so; he filled it up for me and said, I must get you to sign it, and I signed it in the name of E. R. Archer (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this signature is my writing; the other part is in Chapman's—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "South Eastern Railway—Specie and Finance Way Bill, London to Folkestone, Oct. 30th, 1854; received the under—mentioned case in iron chest, J.

               <p>that we got there—we went there to watch the arrival of the boat from Boulogne—we waited till she came in, and went down to the harbour—I noticed that Ledger and Chapman generally when the boat arrived left their office, and went out to search the passenger's luggage—when the boat arrived we were down on the harbour, and we saw Chapman and Ledger leave the office—I and Pierce went to the door of the harbour master's office where the clerks kept the key—I stood at the door—there is only one door—it is facing the water—Pierce went in to the cupboard, and brought the key to me—I took the impression of it, and gave it to him back, and he put it into the cupboard again—the door of the office was on the latch, not locked—I cannot say whether the cupboard from which Pierce took the key, was locked, but I supposed it was not, or he would not be able to get the key—I did not take any notice of the cupboard door; I was looking to see that Chap<lb/>man did not come back—we returned to Dover the same day, and had our tea at the Rose, and after tea we returned to London by the train—after I had obtained the impression of the second key, I met Burgess in London, and communicated to him the success we had met with in getting the second key, and we said that it was a very good job we should be able to com<lb/>plete the robbery, and he said that he would do all that lay in his power to do so—he lived at New-cross at that time—there is a house near there called the Marquis of Granby, parting the road from Lewisham to Green<lb/>wich—I met him there on one or two occasions—Pierce was with me, and I think Tester, but I will not be sure—I met Burgess there several times—I next proceeded to make keys for the bullion chest from the impressions—as I had not the convenience to make them at Pierce's house, I and Miss Kay made up our altercation that we had, and I got the keys made at Cambridge villas—I finished them myself—I filed the blanks to the impression—at this time Pierce lived at Walnut-tree-walk—I began the filing in an empty room over the gateway in his house—there was a difference between me and Fanny Kay—she was living in Harleyford-road, Vauxhall, and I used to go backwards and forwards there—she was living as my wife—I had had a child by her—we made up our difference, and I took a house at Cambridge-villas, and she went to live with me—it was there that I went on finishing the keys—Pierce at that time lived at Walnut-tree-walk, and from there he removed to Crown-terrace, or Crown-place, Hampstead-road—I cannot rightly state the time I had been at Cambridge-villas before Pierce removed to Crown-terrace—after he removed there, he was in the habit of coming to Cambridge-villas—he assisted me to remove there from Harleyford-road—he was at Cambridge-villas, and assisted me to make a file, and any little thing I wanted him to do he did—we used to do that in the wash house adjoining the garden—the tools I used were files, and a ham<lb/>mer and chisel, whitesmith's tools—they were my tools, and were kept in a wooden box painted green, and also in a small wainscot box—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and here are some of my took—here are two in particular which I know—while the filing was going on, and after the keys were finished, an arrangement was made between me and Burgess and Pierce to go down and try them with the safe—we used to com<lb/>municate to Tester, as we proceeded, what progress we had made—I was to go down with Burgess, and if he had the chest, to try them—I went down seven or eight times to try them; I travelled by the train as a second or a first class passenger, and if he had got the chest, I used to get into the van and try the keys, at Reigate, or any other place—I tried them five or six times, and altered them if they did not fit, and they at last</p>

               <p>opened it—Burgess was always the guard, I never tried them except when he was guard, he saw me open it—after I had succeeded, I met Pierce and Tester at Burgess's house often; and it was stated to him that the safe was all ready, and that they were waiting till Burgess got on to the mail train—the tidal train is the train by which bullion is generally sent, but at cer<lb/>tain times it would go by the mail train; any bullion that came after the tidal train had gone, was sent on by the mail—it was the mail train that was robbed—we had a meeting at Burgess's, to state what was to be done with the property, and how we were to go down to complete the robbery—I can speak to Burgess, Pierce, and myself being present—it was 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of gold we thought, and we were to get shot to make that weight—we calculated that the 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of gold would weigh about two cwt.—12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was spoken of, as we thought that would be as much as me and Pierce would be able to carry—I and Pierce went to the shot tower, over by the Suspension-bridge—Pierce went and bought one cwt., placed it in two small carpet bags, and brought it to the gate, he had one, and I had the other; we walked across the Suspension-bridge, got on an omnibus, and took the shot to Cambridge-villas—Pierce repeated the visit to the shot tower, and bought 50 lbs. twice again, making two half cwts.—I did not go the second time, or the third time, I only went once, and he bought the half cwts. at two different times—the bags were at first placed in the par<lb/>lour, and afterwards they were taken out of the canvas bags in which they were, and placed in my trunk; they were brought in canvas bags—we after<lb/>wards weighed it into 8 lbs. and 4 lbs. parcels, and they were placed in some blue check bags—Fanny Kay was at home when I arrived, and a servant named Charlotte Paynter—they were the only persons, except my child, who lived in that house—my trunk was in the first floor bed room; the house consists of two rooms on the ground floor, and three on the first floor; there are no rooms above the first floor—the room I speak of was that in which I and Fanny Kay slept—the trunk always remained there until I came away, but the shot was taken from there, and placed in the wash-house in this box (<hi rend="italic">the one produced</hi>) for the convenience of weighing it into 8 lbs. and 4 lbs. parcels—I do not think Fanny Kay had any opportunity of seeing us put the shot up in parcels; if she had opened the box she would have seen it, but I do not think she had curiosity enough to do so; at times it was open, and at times it was locked—I had the key—after that had been done, we had about 10 lbs. or 12 lbs. of shot more than we required, and me and Pierce carried it out in our pockets, and distributed it, in the fields, and the road, in the neighbourhood of Pierce's house, in Crown-terrace—we then had four leather courier bags made with a strap to sling over the shoulder, and go under the arm—Pierce and me ordered them together, at the corner of Drury-lane and Queen-street—we fetched them, and then tested them; we carried them with the shot to Cambridge-villas, and in so doing a few of the stitches came undone—I made some wax ends, and sewed them up at my place—they were made of drab leather—they had such a strap as this round this box, but this is not one of them—the shot was removed to Pierce's house, Crown-terrace, in carpet bags, by a cart and horse which Pierce got—the courier bags were placed inside the carpet bags with the shot—one bag, a black leather one, was made on purpose for Tester, I had it made for him; we four met together and asked Tester to come down to Reigate, and take part of the gold up, which would lighten our load, on his return to London—he con<lb/>sented, and I got that bag made for him, and placed it in the carpet</p>

               <p>bag with the others—the shot was in the bag, and all these arrange<lb/>ments made at Pierce's house—I first saw that bag about a month or two before the robbery took place, I cannot speak accurately—all was then in readiness for the robbery—when Burgess got on the mail train, an arrange<lb/>ment was made that me, Pierce, Tester, and Burgess should meet at London-bridge on certain days which were picked out from the list of tidal trains; I am speaking now of the time when Burgess was on the tidal train, and I and Pierce went to St. Thomas's-street in the Borough in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the carpet bag and the tools for breaking open the boxes—we hired the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> either at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand by Chalk-farm or by the Red Cap—we did not go from Pierce's house, we walked a little way to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Pierce had on a black wig and whiskers, and a cloak—he carried the two courier bags, one on each side, and a carpet bug in his hand,' and I had a cloak and two courier bags, and a carpet bag containing the shot—that was the first occasion—we drove to St. Thomas's-street, near the hospital—I got out, and left Burgess in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I took my courier bag off, and my cloak—I walked according to appointment, and met Tester, who stated that there was none going down that night—we repeated that for five or six nights; I will not say exactly, but as many as that—Tester was the man that I generally used to see—I saw Burgess on one occasion—on all those occasions we found that the bullion chest was not going down, and we went back to the neighbourhood of Crown-terrace, and then carried the bags—when Tester came to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he had a conversation with Pierce at the window, general conversa<lb/>tion about the robbery, but what the words were I cannot tax my memory with now; I learned, while out, that the bullion chest was not going down, and then he would come and have a conversation with Pierce, who was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I remember on one occasion being at a coffee shop in College-street, not on the night of the robbery, that was by the turnpike gate; but, previous to that, Pierce carried the large bag over his shoulder to a coffee house near the Eagle in Camden-town, left me there with my two courier bags and carpet bag, while he went home to make himself up with his wig, and bring the other things out, and he brought a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and we went together to London-bridge—on the night of the robbery, we were in a coffee house in High-street, Camden-town, near the Southampton Arms, near the turnpike gate—we walked there, and I and Pierce went in and had our tea, and Pierce left the bag, with the two large carpet bags, and the two courier bags; and, after some time, he returned with a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I lifted the large bag in, and we drove to St. Thomas's-street—we had each the two courier bags, and, when we reached there, I got out and went to the station as usual, and Burgess came out and wiped his face, which was the signal agreed upon that the chest was going down—he was at the gate of the station where carriages drive in, I do not know the name of it—he then went to his train, and I went to St. Thomas's-street, and found Pierce where I had left him—I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive to the Dover station—while he was driving to the station, I placed the two courier bags on and the cloak—I saw Tester between the outer station and the incline—he said in a hurried voice, "All right," and went towards the office to get his ticket, as I judged—I went and got two first class tickets, and gave the two carpet bags to the porter, telling him that they were for Dover, and to wait till I came—I kept on my courier bags—I gave one of the first class tickets to Pierce, and went on to the platform—Pierce got into a first class carriage, and I walked to the guard's box, saw the carpet bags, and said they were for Dover—they were given to Burgess, and he put them into his van—the small leather bag was inside one of the large bags—it was</p>

               <p>Dover—the shot we used was not all of one size; it was two different sizes, one smaller than the other—the gold was placed in the courier bags and the carpet bags—when we got to Dover, I took one carpet bag, Pierce took the other, having the courier bags on us—we walked out of the station to an hotel, I think it was the Dover Castle—Mrs. Divers, or some such name—I am not positive whether I got out of the train at Folkestone, or whether I rode in the guard's box, but Pierce had got out previously and taken his seat in a first class carriage, with the courier bag upon him—I am not positive whether I was in the guard's box, or in a first class carriage, when I arrived at Dover—I think I was in a first class carriage, but I will not speak posi<lb/>tively on that point—the carpet bags were in the luggage department, the guard's van—I believe the train was due at Dover about 11 o'clock at night—when we went to this house we walked into the coffee room, and placed the bags under the window, in one corner, and ordered supper—while the waiter was gone to get the supper, we took the courier bags off and placed them down in the corner—the waiter inquired if we wanted beds; I told him no, we had driven in, and were going up by the mail train—the mail train leaves Dover at 2 o'clock in the morning—after supper, I took the tools that I had used, the mallet, chisels, and that, to the pier, and threw them away, to lighten our load; I returned back again; Pierce was left in the room—we paid our bill, and then asked the waiter to put us a little brandy up in a soda water bottle, and a few cigars—while he was gone for it, we replaced our courier bags on our shoulders—he brought us the brandy in the soda water bottle, and the cigars; I then took one bag, and Pierce the other, and we walked to the station—we did not take tickets for London; the porter met me at the gate, and wanted to take the bag; he very politely said he would carry it—I objected to his doing so; he offered to take it out of my hand—he asked if we had tickets—I said we had two coupons from the Ostend line—we had two Ostend tickets—Pierce had obtained them previous to starting from London—they were blue tickets—I do not know whether I had them at Dover, or whether Pierce had them, or whe<lb/>ther we had one each—the porter asked me to show our luggage—I showed them, and he said there had been no baggage through the Custom House that day from Ostend; I at the same time put my hand in my pocket, where I had a little trifling silver, a few shillings; I put them in his hand, and said, "No; we got them through yesterday," and he passed away and left us—no further inquiries were made—we came up in a first class carriage—no one was in the carriage but ourselves—Burgess was guard of that train—I did not notice how many passengers came up by that train; there were not a very great many, but I did not notice particularly; there were not a very great many, not at starting—as we came along the line we opened the large bags, and distributed the hay, threw it away—when the train stopped at one of the stations, I do not know the name of it, Pierce got out, took the two large carpet bags, and left them in the waiting room—they were then empty; we had thrown the hay away as we came along—the gold and the coin were then in two small carpet bags that had been inside the large ones, and in the courier bags—the train arrived at the London bridge station at it's usual time in the morning; I do not remember the exact time; I think 5 o'clock was the time it was due, but I am not positive—I and Pierce got it, and walked down the station, carrying the small bags in our hands, and the courier bags on us under our cloaks; when we got outside the gate we took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive to the Great Western—when we got near the Great Western we told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man that he was making a</p>

               <p>fire bricks to make the furnace of—I pulled the common stove out of the first floor back room at Cambridge-villas, and there erected the furnace with, the assistance of Pierce—Pierce brought the stones in a horse and cart—(<hi rend="italic">some stems were here produced</hi>)—that is one of them; I know it by this hole; it was chipped out on purpose to cause a draught stronger through the furnace—I see here a piece of gold now sticking to it—having erected the furnace, we procured some crucibles and an ingot to run the gold in in melting, to put the gold in another form, to east it into long ingots of 100 oz.; we had a pair of scales and weights—Pierce bought some of the crucibles, and I bought some—we proceeded to cut the gold bars, 100 oz. off at a time, melted them in the furnace, and poured them into the ingot—we melted them in the crucibles by charcoal and coke—it requires very great heat to melt gold—on one occasion, when I was taking one of the crucibles out of the furnace, it broke, and the gold scattered over the floor and burnt the flooring—nobody came into the room besides me and Pierce while we were so engaged—Miss Kay brought some bitter ale to the door once or twice, but we would not allow her to come in—she said, "You seem very hot; what are you about? you seem all in a per<lb/>spiration"—I made some frivolous answer that it was nothing concerning her, or something to that effect, and shut the door—I do not remember anything being said about aprons—we cut up the courier bags, and part was used as a defender to prevent the fire from burning my hands; those we burnt, and a part were kept to make a covering for one of my trunks to defend it, the rest was burnt—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two pieces of leather</hi>) these are part of them—that is where it was burnt by the fire—it took me three or four days to melt the gold—the heat was so great we were obliged to put the fire out for fear of setting fire to the chimney—Pierce remained with me all day on those days—he had his meals with me—on the 'first day Fanny Kay went to see the child; it was out at nurse at that time; then there was no one in the house but me and Pierce; we sent her away on purpose—she was at home when the bricks were brought—they were brought in a cart in a canvas bag I think; or covered over with something—I think Pierce brought some cement or some charcoal on the day Fanny Kay went to see the child—they were things that were to be used in the melting, and which we could not procure in the neighbourhood—Pierce went home of a night to sleep.</p>

               <p>with Pierce a little while, and then I took apartments in Stanley-place, Paddington-green, where I resided at the time I was arrested upon the charge of which I was convicted, which was on 15th Aug.—I lived in Pierce's house with him about a week, or it might be a fortnight—during the time I was there Tester and Burgess both came there by appointment which I had made—when we were all four together it was named what money there was, and a division took place—I and Pierce and Tester received 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and Burgess received 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the produce of the gold that had been sold and the American coin—they received it in notes, all of it—we had received it in gold, and Pierce took the gold to the Bank of England and obtained notes for it—the notes that I received as my share 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were in my trunk at Stanley-terrace at the time I was arrested—Pierce had the remainder of the gold—he made a hole in the pantry at the bottom of the stairs of his own house at Kilburn-villa, and there he buried it, under the steps which go into the house from the front garden—there is a fore court to the house—you ascend to the house by four or five steps—the pantry is underneath those steps, and he made the hole in the pantry—we were together for some time on the evening that the division was made—I stopped there rather late, all the <hi rend="italic">busses</hi> had gone—I walked with Tester and Burgess to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand by the canal bridge that runs across the Paddington road, and they got into a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and came to town.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you at the time of the robbery, and afterwards, in possession of any Spanish bonds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—they were 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bonds, I believe—I had bought them through Mr. Young, a stockbroker, of Bartholomew-lane—that was some considerable time before the robbery, I do not remember when—I sold 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of those bonds to Tester on the night of the division at 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid me for them with part of the notes that he had received as his share of the division—I never saw anything more of the remaining gold—the Spanish bonds are payable to bearer, transfer<lb/>ble through a stockbroker—on the morning that I was arrested I saw Pierce at his house, and made an appointment with him to meet me at my lodging in Stanley-place at 2 o'clock, to walk to Shepherd's-bush to obtain the child's clothes and chaise—he had the child at that time, he fetched it from the nurse the day before—he met me at 2 o'clock at Stanley-place, we then walked across the fields to Shepherd's-bush—he went into a public house, and I went into Fanny Kay's lodging, and fetched the child's clothes and chaise, and gave them to Pierce—I there stopped and wrote a letter to send to the nurse, with part of the chaise which they had destroyed, which I intended to send by the Parcels Delivery Company—after writing that letter I got into the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> about 4 o'clock, or a quarter past 4, to come to Holborn to keep an appointment that was made previously by a man named Humphries—I was taken into custody on my way, with the note and parcel in my hand—I afterwards made an arrangement with Pierce with respect to the care of my child—I never saw him afterwards until he was arrested—I only heard from him through Mr. Wontner—I had stock to the amount of 3, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time—Mr. Wontner had that money, and he gave it over to Pierce's wife to invest for the benefit of my child and its mother, Fanny Kay.</p>

               <p>name of the place.—I have been down to Margate several times—I may have given a description of the place to the prosecution—he occupied the front parlour—an elderly female who kept the house served the tea; I do not know her name—I did not see anybody else there; I did not sleep there, I slept at a public house of the sign of the "Elephant," where Tester went and partook of a glass of grog with me in the smoking room—I met Tester on one occasion at Folkestone, and walked arm in arm with him from the up station; we usually used to walk arm in arm when we met—I say, we did so on that occasion, because we always did so, that is my only motive—I did not always walk arm in arm with him in London, I did when I met him out of town—I will not say positively, there might be an exception, but generally speaking we always walked arm in arm when I met him out of town—I am positive we walked arm in arm from the up station—I do not know whether anybody saw us arm in arm or not; it is impossible for me to say—the division of the plunder was, as near as my recollection will admit of, about two months after the robbery—it was Tester's own proposi<lb/>tion that he should buy the Spanish bonds—he did not know that I had Spanish bonds to sell—he asked me which was the best way for him to invest his money: I told him that Spanish bonds were paying 7 per cent, and it was merely transferring a bit of paper, I had some that I bought, at 47, or something thereabout, and I would sell them to him at 48—he con<lb/>sented to do so, and took 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of them at 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., without making any further inquiry—I told him whom I had purchased them of—I believe the market price was about 47 at the time—I do not know when it was I pur<lb/>chased them, the bill was in my trunk when I was arrested, it was some long time before, I could not state the time—I have not any of these Spanish bonds left, I had 200, Pierce had it, it was in my trunk when I was arrested, and Pierce had the remaining 200—I have not seen him since—I was arrested on a charge of uttering a forged cheque, you defended me.</p>

               <p>was living with me at Stanley-place at the time the charge was made against me—Humphries was not examined as a witness; it was a vindictive feeling that was the cause of my being arrested—Mr. Mullens stated that which was not true; he said he was in a bank opposite, when the man went in to present the cheque, and to the best of his belief I was the man who was standing outside; he never stated it on any of the examinations—I was not there, I was at Shepherd's-bush at the time—I had never been in the city at any time that day until I was taken in charge—I was met by some man, who handed to me a bag containing farthings instead of sovereigns—he was standing at the corner of Bedford-row, where he could command a view of Humphries' house, as my appointment was to be at Humphries' house at 5 o'clock, to receive from him 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I had lent him on the Monday previous—I had an appointment to meet him at his house and receive the 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his house was a door or two from the corner of Bedford-row, where Smith was standing—this was on the day of my arrest—as I was going to Humphries', Smith was standing at the corner—he turned round and saw me coming down—he approached me and said, "Oh! I am watching for you, "—I asked what he was watching for me for, he said, that "Bill (meaning Humphries) had sent him to meet me, to tell me not to go to his house as there was a screw loose"—I asked him what it was about, walking my way at the same time—he said that he believed it was something about Captain Money's affair—Humphries had been arrested a week or two before, on a charge of attempting to steal Captain Money's child—in walking along, he said that Humphries had sent the 200/. by him, at the same time pulling a bag out of his pocket, and giving it me—by this time we had got near Red-lion-square—the police officers were watching—I asked him who those men were following—he said that he did not know.</p>

I speak of Mr. Weatherhead who is now governor of Newgate—he was then station master—I remember Mr. Chaplin bringing three boxes On the evening before the robbery; they were like those produced—I knew that they were supposed to contain bullion—they were placed on the side of the scale which is outside, on the platform, close to the door of the superintendent's office—the weights were taken by me—the box like this which is marked P. D. 184 weighed 1cwt. 1 qr. 16 lbs.—the box of Mr. Spiel man's weighed 18 lbs., and the other 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 15 lbs.—after they were weighed they were put on a truck or barrow, and taken into Mr. Weatherhead's office, where they re<lb/>mained</p>

               <p>till the train was about to start—Tester was in Mr. Brown's office, the superintendent's, which is up stairs on the first floor—I do not think Tester in the course of his employment would have the means of ascertain<lb/>ing when bullion was going down—the book in which we enter the weights is in the station master's office near the platform—besides me there was a party named Bailey and Scanlan—Scanlan weighed them, and I took the weights from him.</p>

D. 184—it was sealed—I do not think this seal on it is any part of our seal—(the witness examined it with a candle)—I swear that neither of these are our seals—we only seal them in one place.</p>

D. 184, weighed, in French measurement, 54 kilogrammes 500 grammes—they weighed together 190 kilogrammes—the third box being so small was put on the others, and it produced then 198 kilogrammes, being 8 kilogrammes more—after they had been weighed, the large box being in bad condition, I had it nailed by the labouring men attached to the Custom House, and had it put on a truck, and had the small box put into a safe place in the truck, and the second one outside with other bales and packages, and dragged to my office—I happened to see them all the way, but I do not generally do so—when they got to my office they were unloaded, and remained there till they were sent to the rail under the charge of our guard—they were weighed separately at my office—the box P. D., 184, weighed 54 kilogrammes 500 grammes; the other, 136 kilogrammes 500 grammes, and the small box of Spiel man's, 7 kilogrammes 100 grammes; the total was 198 kilogrammes and 100 grammes—I had no idea of anything then—I afterwards received the weights taken at the London bridge terminus—I have reduced the English measures to French—the English weight of the box P. D., in London, has been sent to me as 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 16 lbs., which I calculate and represent in French measure as 70 kilo<lb/>grammes 725 grammes; that is, 71 all but one quarter—in the French weight it is 16 kilometres, and a trifling fraction; less in London than in France—I have not calculated what the English weight of 16 kilogrammes 620 grammes is, but 1 cwt. is 70 kilogrammes; there are 2 lbs. avoirdupois to a kilogramme—I was informed also of the weight in London of the other two boxes, and found that the weight of them in France was something more—I went with the boxes to my office, and joined them as they were going into my yard, and went in with them immediately, as I was busy—they remained in my office under my eye all the time—the two large boxes were before me and the small one behind me, and about half past 6 o'clock or a quarter to 7, they were put on the same truck, and taken down to the railway—I did not see them down there, but I have people who generally go with them—I saw them on the truck—I saw the one marked</p>

On 28th Oct., 1854, I was married, and went away from my duties for a short time, from Saturday, 7th, till I think the following Wednes<lb/>day or Thursday—I was absent on 30th Oct.—I do not know Agar by that name—I have seen a man go through the Court that I have seen at Folke-stone—I do not know his name—I saw him, previous to my marriage, at the Rose Inn, kept by Medhurst—I saw him there twice—I do not think that house is frequented by the servants of the company—I only know one who frequents it besides me, that is Mr. Chapman—I have seen the man sitting there, but not conversing with anybody—I do not recollect that I have spoken to him—there is a billiard room there and a smoking room—I recol<lb/>lect once Agar was introduced by the landlord when I and a clerk in the Provincial Bank were in there to supper, before my marriage—the landlord brought him in, and in consequence of what the landlord said, he came and had supper with us—after my return from my wedding trip, I saw Agar again—I now distinctly recollect seeing him on the harbour, he spoke to me, and told me that during my absence he had forwarded a valuable parcel to my address—I do not think that was many days after I returned—he did not invite me to go anywhere at that time, but I must have seen him afterwards, because he asked me if I would go to the Pavilion and take wine with him, which I declined—a person there named Conden, made a com<lb/>munication to me in consequence of my being with Agar—my office is close upon the harbour on the pier—I had a key of the bullion chest—I cannot say for certain the exact place where I kept it, but it must have been either in</p>

               <p>the bullion room, or in my pocket, or in a desk which I had behind me—there is no drawer to my desk, or under it, or near it, nor in anybody else's desk, in which tickets are kept—a person named Sharland had an office quite separate from mine—when a boat arrives from Boulogne, it is my duty to attend to the landing of the passengers and render them any assistance they may require in passing their baggage, and Chapman's duty is partly the same, he sits by my side—on the arrival of a boat, I should go out to the landing of the passengers and Chapman sometimes goes—either the super<lb/>intendent's clerk or Mr. Chapman's assistant would remain in the office—I have known the office to be left when a boat arrives—there are two locks on the bullion chest, but I believe only one was in use at the time of the robbery—I was on duty on the night of the robbery—I do not think I saw the bullion chests removed that night—I do not recollect it, but I saw them next morning, and saw them put on board the steam boat in the charge of McNie.</p>

I am inspector of police to the South Eastern Railway Company, at Redhill; in 1854 I held the same appointment at Folkestone harbour—I know the three prisoners—In 1854 I saw Fierce at Folkestone harbour in company with the witness Agar; I believe it was in May, 1854, they were on the pier, standing near to where the passengers were going on board the steam-boat which was in connection with the tidal train—the tidal train had just come in—I should think they were there on that occasion about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I cannot say the exact time—I believe they remained there until the boat had sailed—I then saw them leave the pier and go in the direction of the town—I had some reason for noticing Pierce more than an ordinary person—I did not see what part of the town they went to after they had passed the pier—I did not follow them into the town—I cannot recollect whether any bullion was shipped on that day; it was frequently shipped about that time—I saw them together about ten or a dozen tames after that, usually on the pier at the time of the departure of the boat for Boulogne, and the arrival of the boat from Boulogne—I made a communication upon this to Mr. Steer, the superintendent of the Folkestone police—I pointed them out to Mr. Steer, and also to a man that he sent to me—I saw Agar at Folkestone in Oct. 1854—I saw him go into the booking office of the station at Folkestone harbour—he was there aboutten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he brought nothing out—I went in while he was there, and saw him looking round at Mr. Sharman, the booking clerk, whilst he was making up his money in the inner office, adjoining the booking office—Agar was in the outer office—he could see Sharman, by going to the doorway; he could look round the corner at him; he did so—I saw him again on the following day, on the pier, I think between 11 and 12 o'clock—he was with Tester—the boat was then getting ready to start for Boulogne—nobody was with him when I first saw him, but a very short time afterwards I saw him with Tester—I knew Tester perfectly well—I saw them go from the pier in the direction of the Pavilion Hotel—I did not watch them much beyond the station—the Pavilion Hotel is close to the station—I should think they must have been in my sight altogether for twenty minutes on that occasion—I believe Mr. Ledger was away at that time; his marriage was about that time—I saw Tester again that day at the harbour station—he came and went up by the train which left Folkestone harbour at half past 7 o'clock in the evening.</p>

I am night watchman at the London and Greenwich terminus—I know Tester—I remember seeing him at the Greenwich booking office one night in May, 1855—it was before I heard of the gold robbery—I first saw him that night entering the Greenwich booking office; it was about ten minutes past 10 o'clock—the last train went at twenty minutes past 10 o'clock at that time—he went to Mr. Russell—there is an open window where the tickets are issued, and he spoke to him through the open window—I heard what he said; he said, "Good evening, Mr. Russell"—Mr. Russell returned the compliment, and he said that he had just come from Red-hill—Mr. Russell said that it was sharp work; because he said that he had been between office hours—I went away then, and came back about ten minutes afterwards, or not quite so much, and went into the office—Mr. Russell was then in the office; nobody else; Tester had left—Mr. Russell desired me to shift a box for him out of the way, and I saw this black bag then down against this box—I shifted the box on one side so that I could move the box, and said to Russell, "Whose bag is this? it feels very heavy and <hi rend="italic">lumpy</hi>"—I took it up in my right hand, and put it on one side, and Mr. Russell said that it was Mr. Tester's—it felt heavy and lumpy, just as if a stone was in it—it was about a foot long or more—I did not remain till Tester came—I did not see him go in, neither did I see him</p>

Chubb's, after the locks had been re-combined and altered, to the best of my recollection, Mr. Brown took charge of them, and put them in a drawer in his office—that is not the office in which Tester was employed—Tester's office was the outer one next to Mr. Brown's, and opened into it—Tester received instructions from Mr. Brown to dispose of the keys—I know no instances in which he has had occasion to visit Folkestone, or Dover, or Red Hill, on the Company's service, except with respect to these keys when they were lost.</p>

Some years ago I was an assistant at the refreshment bar at the Tunbridge station, and while there was acquainted with Burgess, who introduced me to Agar, that was in 1853: some time after which I became intimately acquainted with Agar, and had a child by him—I lived with him at several places, and in Dec, 1854, went to live with him at Cambridge-villas, Shepherd's-bush—before that I had seen Pierce in Agar's company, in Harleyford-road, Vauxhall, and at Greenwich, where I lived, and at Tooley-street, at the Green Man public house, I think it was—I have seen them very often together, and taking meals and refreshments together—so far as I saw, they were well acquainted with each other—I did not see Burgess in Agar's company from the time he introduced me till we went to live at Shepherd's-bush—Pierce went by the name of Peckham—on 7th May, 1855, my child left me to be weaned; Charlotte Painter was then a servant of ours—one Sunday, a fortnight after that, I went to see the child—I remember Mrs. Bessel's death, our next door neighbour, she died on 18th May, 1855—it was after that that I went to see my child—on the Tuesday or Wednesday night before that, Agar was absent all night—he was away the week after, and a few days before—I saw him next day, in the afternoon part—I cannot say exactly the time—he came with Pierce, in a cart; they had two bags with them—I think it was two—they carried them into the washhouse—I did not see them opened—after their return Pierce was there generally every day—after 21st May, he and Agar were in the back room, first floor—I looked into that room once when they were there together, and saw that they had got the stove out and a very bright fire in the chimney—when I opened the door they both ran to it and shut it, but I do not think they said anything to me—before that they had been much in the washhouse, but I do not know what they had been doing, I never went in while they were there—sometimes they were there for the course of the morning, and I heard them hammering very often—they also brought into the house shooting bags, made of drab lea<lb/>ther, and one black one—when I peeped into the room up stairs I heard a loud noise, a furnace, it was like the roaring of a large fire—I heard that going on for several days—I saw what appeared to me to be square pieces of stone brought down from that room by Pierce, one end was in a pail and the other he held with a duster—after I had heard that noise, they came down to their dinner and their meals, very hot and very dirty—I inquired what they were doing, and they said, "Leather apron weaving"—they gave no other answer but that—I have heard them speak of Burgess and of Tester—I have gone into the room after that noise has ceased; the stove has been replaced and blackened, and the floor burnt in a few places—about the time that my child was weaned, they wore the fashionable capes, shortish cloaks; Agar had his about two months before my child was weaned—I never saw Pierce looking otherwise in respect of the colour of his hair than he does now—I have seen him with more hair about his face, but his own hair I believe—some short time before Agar's arrest, he left me, and I re<lb/>mained at Cambridge Villas a short time—he went to Kilburn, but I did not at that time know that he was there—he came to see me before I heard</p>

               <p>that he was arrested; the child was not with me at that time, he was at Rotherhithe, with a cousin of Agar's—after I had left Cambridge Villa, I saw Agar at St. George's-road, the day before his arrest; before that I had not seen him for a considerable time—after he went away I remained in lodgings in St. George's-road for some time, Pierce provided the money for that up to January—I cannot say how much he gave me, it was different sums; he was to have allowed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, but he did not do that—I went to live at his house in January, and remained till the latter part of April, the child was with me—I left on account of words with Pierce—while I was at his house there were two trunks of Agar's there, there were his clothes in them and a box of tools, I do not think there was anything else—I saw no money which I knew belonged to him—I saw his watch there, and a set of shirt studs, and a diamond ring, but no money or notes—I have seen Pierce with a great deal of gold before I went to live at his house; he had a little bag of sovereigns about this size—he once told me that he asked Agar to lend him a sovereign, and Agar would not; some<lb/>times he said he could get money out of him and sometimes he could not—he has only once told me that he had asked Agar to lend him small sums of money, that was during the early part of the time that I was at Cambridge-villas—Pierce asked me to lend him a shilling when I was at Greenwich, in 1854—previous to the gold robbery, Agar used to sell his old clothes to Pierce; I suppose he sold them, I have seen Pierce take the old clothes away, and have heard them making a bargain for them—I have seen notes as well as gold in Pierces possession after the robbery, I cannot tell to what amount; I have seen a roll of notes in his hand—after I left his house in April, I had no means of support, and made application to Pierce for money, I got it, and I applied again and got it, I applied to him again and was refused—after that, I saw Mr. Weatherhead, the Governor of Newgate, and made a communication to him; I afterwards saw Mr. Rees, and made a communication to him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that your child was not registered in the name of Agar. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew it when he was registered; he was two years old on 7th July last—in 1854 I knew Agar's real name—Adams and Agar are the only two names I ever knew him by—I know a person named Hodges, he never visited me—I have been in his company, but not for a very long time—he used to give me money, not less than a sovereign at a time—while I was at Pierce's I was out all night for two nights—it was not three nights—I have not been brought home there tipsy—I did not have a quarrel with Pierce on account of my drunken habits, it was on account of a letter I had from Agar, and I left the house—I will not swear that I have never been brought home drunk to Pierce's—I do not recollect being brought home drunk in a wheelbarrow to Shep<lb/>herd's-bush—it might have happened—I should not think it could have happened more than once—I did not hear of something of the kind after<lb/>wards—I have not been down to Portland Island at all where Agar was—I have been supported by the Company since the disclosure which I chose to make—they do not allow me anything, I get my food and lodging, but not my clothes—I do not exactly know how long they have done so, but I suppose it is since last Oct.; two or three months—I knew that Pierce was what is called a betting or sporting man—I have not seen money in his possession, which he has stated in my presence was won by racing—I never saw him with a betting book—I never saw him making books up in the presence of his wife—I will not undertake to say that the amounts which I have received are not as much as 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not think it; Mrs. Pierce did not say in my presence that I had—I will venture to swear it is not 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Pierce has not frequently complained of my drunken habits; she has told me that it was a pity that I should do so, but merely in a friendly way; she never had occasion to complain of me in her house.</p>

Consols, given by Agar to Pierce, to be settled on me to provide for me and my child; Pierce told me he had no money—the second part of the letter which caused the quarrel, was talked of between me and him, he wrote it from Pentonville; he told me I was to buy the two children, Pierce's boy and his boy, two silver cups, and several other things—he said what I was do in the letter, but I had no money to buy the things; he wanted a geography and several things, and Mrs. Pierce proposed sending him an old geography of one of her daughter's—Agar said that Pierce was to give me the money, and I told Pierce so, and his wife too—since X was first examined, I hove been living in the house of a police inspector, Thornton—I have had money, but I have been supported and my child.</p>

I drive one of my own cabs, No. 3016—I remember being out with my cab in the spring of 1855, and being called by some man, and driving to somewhere near the Prince of Wales; it was about 7 or half past 7 o'clock in the evening—I stopped about 200 or 300 yards from Crown-terrace, at the corner of the high road—the man who had called me, then went away towards Crown-terrace; he afterwards returned with another man, they had two or three bags with them—I cannot swear which, one I think was leather, and two carpet bags—they ordered me to drive to the Brighton station—when I got over London bridge, they stopped me by the Bridge Hotel, on the right hand side—one of the men was, I should say, four or five inches taller than the other—when we got to the Bridge Hotel, one got out, and went towards the station, or to<lb/>wards Tooley-street, the one who remained in the cab, ordered me to St. Thomas's-street—I went there, and stopped against Guy's Hospital—I was told to pull up there—the men had mantles of some description; they had not got them on when they went in, they were on their arms then, but they placed them on when they got out, at least one man did—I could not hear anything that passed inside as I went along, I merely felt the action of the cab was very different to what it out to be, as if somebody was standing up, or moving about—I never felt the bags, and could not form any opinion whether they were heavy or light—the man who got out of the cab was away, I suppose, a quarter or half an hour—when he returned they ordered me to drive back again to where I had come from—when I got up to Hamp<lb/>stead-road, I was ordered to turn up towards the Mother Shipton—I did so, and they discharged me there, and went away with their bags—that is about 200 or 300 yards from Crown-terrace—there are two ways by which you can go to Crown-terrace; those are the two ways. I have mentioned—I saw the men again, I cannot say whether it was a week afterwards, or it might not be so long: they came and fetched me off the rank then, near Chalk Farm; I was not on the rank the first time—it was the same man that fetched me, the shorter man—he took me to the same place, went away, and brought another man with him, and the same lug<lb/>gage—I think it was the same person that he had fetched on the former occasion, but I cannot swear to that—the two were of different heights—I cannot swear that the tall man was the same, but I know the shorter man that hired me was—I drove them then to St. Thomas's-street, on St. Thomas's Hospital side—I stopped there, and the shorter man got out—I noticed the same sort of action of the cab that time—they seemed to be rustling or moving about in the cab, as if they were looking out or something—after the shorter man had been away about half or three-quarters of an hour, he returned; they had some conversation, and then they ordered me back again—on that occasion they had cloaks on their arms when they got in—I then went to the Prince of Wales-road, on the Hampstead-road side—I was ordered to set them down at the other end—they got out there, and took their luggage away; I could not carry it, because you cannot get down that road—that is about 200 yards from Crown-terrace—I saw them again; it might be a week after, but I cannot remember how long it was—the one man fetched me again from the rank, the short man, the same that had fetched me on the two former occasions—he took me to the same the Hampstead-road, the Prince of Wales's corner, left me, and</p>

               <p>fetched the same man, I think, as before, but I could not swear as to that; he was of the height of the man that had come on the former occasions—they brought their luggage and cloaks just as before—they told me to drive to St. Thomas's-street, in the Borough—I did so—I pulled up, I think, on the St. Thomas's Hospital side—the short one got out, and went away; he seemed to bend his way to the left, as if he was going towards Tooley-street; I do not know whether there is any way to the station that way—on that occasion I lifted one of their carpet bags; it was heavy; it weighed, I should say, a quarter of a cwt., or more—the man returned to the cab the third time, got in, and ordered me back to where I had come from—I should say this was the latter end of April, or the beginning of May; it was somewhere about that time, it was always dark when we returned in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 143, Grove-street, Camden-town; I drive a cab, and have done so for twenty years. I remember being hired by two men at Camden-town—from the time I first spoke about it, which is nearly two months ago, it was about fifteen or sixteen months; it might have been more—Pierce was one of the men, and Agar was the other—it was in the evening part—they both came together; I was on the rank in High-street, Camden-town—they brought some bags with them, two, if not three; by the way they put them into the cab, they appeared to me to be heavy, because the cab rather sounded at the bottom—they got in, and desired me to drive St. Thomas's-street, in the Borough; I pulled up on the left hand side, at the bottom—I believe there is a way there to the arch of the railway terminus—Agar got out of the cab, and the other one remained—Agar went to the left, towards the arch—he was gone half an hour—when he returned I heard him say to Pierce, "It is not a going down to-night"—he then got into the cab—I drove them up to the top, on the near side, and I believe they had a glass of ale; one of them had, I know—they then ordered me to drive them to the Mother Shipton—they got out there—one got out first, and went into the public house, into the doorway—they took out the bags, and paid me my fare—when I was crossing the road I looked round, and saw them both going along Prince's-terrace, towards Crown-terrace; they had their bags with them—I did not take any notice of the way in which they were dressed—I had seen Pierce before, up and down Camden-town—I have seen Agar and Pierce both together, but not to know them, to have anything to do with them, before that time—I have seen them coming along together, and pass the rank in High-street, Camden-town, which is my usual place of standing, and has been for the last twenty years.</p>

I have conducted the investigation in this matter, and am conducting this pro<lb/>secution—I went to the house at Kilburn-villa, on the same day that Piece was taken into custody, it has a garden in front, and leading from the garden to the street door, there is a flight of stone steps—I went down to the base<lb/>ment part of that house—I found a sort of pantry underneath the front steps—I made a search there—I found that the ground had been disturbed against the wall of the pantry furthest from the house, underneath the steps—a hole had evidently been dug there at some former time, and in place of the clay which was the natural formation of the ground, I found, that the hole was filled with loose cinders and rubbish, there were appearances which enabled me to judge how recently the hole had been filled up, in the cinders were fresh leaves and autumn berries, and part of the claw of a lobster, evidently quite fresh—there were several things found in the house, some Turkish bonds to a considerable amount, I believe 2, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or thereabouts, some deeds, leases, securities for money, I O U's and promissory notes, and things of that sort; the officer who has them will give the particulars—several boxes were found—the green tool box which has been produced was found in one of the attics in the same condition that it is now; these two pieces of leather were in it—I had previous to this, on 22nd Sept., been to the house, No. 3, Cam<lb/>bridge-villas—it was then uninhabited and empty—it was a house of two stories, with two rooms below and two above, with a small dressing room—I went up to the back room, first floor—I found an ordinary stove in the chimney place—I caused it to be removed, and behind it found the three fire bricks which have been produced—the chimney was entirely free from soot, and had evidently been subjected to a very intense heat—I examined the bricks and found appearances of gold on them—they were exactly in the same state as they are now—I looked at the floor—I found that the boards had been burnt in several places, principally in front of the fire place, between the fire place and the window—I caused some of the boards to be taken up where the burning was, and I Sound several small particles of gold—these are them (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—they had evidently dropped through the boards on to the ceiling below—at the time I went to Cambridge-villas, I had not had any interview with Agar, at Portland; I had, of course, before Pierce's arrest—I did not, in my interview with Agar, say anything to him of what I had discovered at Cambridge-villas, nor did he know that I had been to the house—I had an order from the Secretary of State to be permitted to see him—upon the second occasion of my going down, he made a statement to me—he had made the statement before I went to the house at Kilburn-villas;. it was in consequence of that that I went to the cellar, as I have described.</p>
