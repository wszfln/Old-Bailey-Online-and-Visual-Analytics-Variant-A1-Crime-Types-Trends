I keep a turner's shop, I bought this cloth of the prisoner the 9th of November at my door, I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge; he came and asked me if I wanted any hair cloth, saying there was 18 or 19 yards three quarters wide, he measured it for 19. I gave him thirteen shillings for it, he was taken up that very day se'nnight at another shop offering some stolen matting.</p>
               <p>Mark Hall. The prisoner came to my shop on the 16th, to offer to sell some matting; I having heard of this cloth being stolen, stopped the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Two men brought the cloth to me to sell, my business being the same as theirs; I sold it for them, and got a little by it: If they had let me alone I believe I should have taken the men, they said they had many more things to dispose of, in the turning way that they had failed. I don't know either of their names.</p>

[He shewed a pair of tongs much bent.] These tongs, when I went to bed after making all fast, were standing in my chimney in the parlour; I found in this condition, laying in the shop, the things mentioned in the indictment gone; the prisoner and evidence absconded, they lived in the neighbourhood, I knew them well. On the Monday after a man came to me and said there was a drawer lying in the field behind Holywell-Mount, I went and found it to be mine ; there were some old cloaths laying by it, which I apprehended might belong to the prisoner. I took an officer and went and searched the prisoner's father's house on the 21st of November, but could not find him: then I went and searched Guest's house and took him. I took him before justice Withers, there he owned he, the prisoner and the prisoner's brother Joseph, rob'd me of the goods mentioned, that the prisoner and he had sold them, some at Salisbury, some at Newbery, some at Bristol, and some at Reading ; he had on a cap and a pair of shoes, my property, which I then lost, I found nothing more.</p>

Some of the things we sold going, some there, some coming back, I don't know the towns names; coming back the prisoner took seven silver spoons out of his pocket and flung them away, they being mark'd fearing they should be catched, the prisoner throwed the drawer over into a field by the side of Holywell-Mount, I pulled off my old rag of a shirt, a waistcoat, and apron, and throwed them away a little distance from the field where he throwed the drawer.</p>

After which the prisoner and Hall went out. I had pull'd out my pocket-piece and believe they had seen it. I went out again about five or six minutes after them. Going into my own door they stopped me. George Hall put his hand to my eyes and mouth, and swore they would blow my brains out if I resisted. The prisoner took my watch and money out of my pocket.

We took away the leather, 36 skins, 3 linen aprons that hung on a line betwixt two houses, we took a pair of pumps from out of the workshop. As the watchman came by that back place, we fastened the door fearing he should knock against it; when he was gone by, we went with the goods to my apartment; we sold three of the skins, and the rest of them were taken again by the prosecutor. They were to have been sold to a man that buys all manner of stolen goods, where the prisoner lodged. He wanted me to let him have them for a tenth part of the value ; so we quarrelled, and so the affair came out; the constable heard us quarrel, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040006"/> he came by.

            . I am wife to the Prosecutor; we went to bed on the 11th of Nov. betwixt ten and eleven. There were two night gowns of my child's, three aprons, a blanket, and table-cloth in a tub. When I got up in the morning about six o'clock they were all gone; the copper was taken out of the brickwork and gone, the window open. After this, I met the prisoner with one of the aprons on, and knowed it directly, it was made out of an old check shirt of my husband's. She said she found it in the channel; after that, she said she found it in two other places. We took her before Justice Gore, she confessed which way she got it. She said two men,

The next morning my wife and I got up between three and four. The prisoner was just after us, which was what he never used to do. These things mentioned were in a cupboard below; about six we found the door of it open, and the ring and money gone, he then said he had six pence to spend. I had a suspicion of him. I had him taken up. We took him to the Horseshoe and Magpye at the New-Bridge Foot, the justice not being at home; there he confessed, (after I said don't let it be lost, I would have it be of service to somebody) it was not lost, and put his hand into his breeches and pulled them out, wrap'd up in a dirty cloth. The ring had M B B. dated 1728; one of the half guineas was a pale one with a crack in it, produc'd in court and deposed to. He said he opened the lock with a case knife and took the things out.</p>

When I came to him, he put his hand into his great coat, he said, your money sir; said I, you surprize me very much, to ask me for my money at this time of the day, in so publick a road; I made no offer to give it him, I believe he was confounded a little, there was a pause about a minute, then he put his hand into his great coat again; and said, Come sir, don't dally. I still made no offer to give it him, but was thinking to myself whether I should or should not. Then he said, Sir, I am in great distress, give me any thing you can spare. Then I took off my glove and put my hand in my pocket, and was going to give him some money, but had a thought to count it, which was 6 s. and gave it him. I had my watch in my pocket, the chain hung out, he never ask'd for that; but said, thank ye sir; I said, much good may do you; and at that time I had no thoughts of going after him: I recollected I had seen some people as I came, I rode back, knowing if I gave the alarm he must be taken; he went off towards Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was you going?</p>
               <p>Ansell. I was going towards London. I rode and alarmed the people before he had robbed me five minutes; they were at the Old Hat. Then I believe the prisoner was out of sight. Some of the company galloped away without knowing who they were to go after; but I described the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040011"/> riding a brown or bay horse, at the time he might be about half a mile from me, to some of them. When I came to Hanwell-Heath, I observed them all to turn out of the road towards Brentford. I turn'd short to go a nearer way. And believe I was within 3 or 400 yards of him when taken, but it was on an elbow, so that I could not see him. When I came up, Mr. Knevett was at the side of him, he was also surrounded by three or four horsemen more, I don't know them all, one was

               <p>Q. Was you under any surprize or apprehension of danger when you gave him your money?</p>
               <p>Ansell. I was, or I had not given him any money. I should not have given it him out of charity.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken, what did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Ansell. He seemed very penitent, and declared it to be his first offence.</p>

Betwixt eleven and twelve, on the 25th of Oct. the prisoner sent me to Mrs. Pollard's for a peck of coals; I was gone about half an hour, when I came back, the prisoner was below, rubbing her hands all over bloody; I ask'd her what she had done? she made me no answer; Mrs. Pollard followed me directly; she asked the prisoner, what she had been doing? she answered, she had kill'd Henney, then I went up into her room, and saw my babe lying all in its gore upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what account did Mrs. Pollard go with you ?</p>
               <p>M. Hyde. I heard a person say in the street, where is Henney's mother, she was murder'd. So Mrs. Pollard hearing it, went with me.</p>

               <p>Isabella Pollard. The child had been at my house about three quarters of an hour before it was murder'd. I sent her to fetch me half a pint of beer, which she did; after which, her mother came for a peck of coals; while she was there, a young woman came, and said, where is the child's mother? it is murdered. I called to the mother, she was gone from my house to the next door. I told her, she ran, and I after her, to the prisoner's house; when I came in, I saw the prisoner rubbing her hands all over blood. I asked her what she had done? she said, she had kil l'd Henney. I ask'd her what she did it for? she said, what was that to me? she went into the yard; I went up stairs, and saw the babe lying dead all in its gore upon the floor; it was cut from ear to ear.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Hyde. How had she used to behave to the child before this?</p>
               <p>M. Hyde. She behaved in my sight very well to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she behave amiss to her, out of your sight?</p>
               <p>M. Hyde. I never asked the child any questions about her behaviour to her.</p>

I came down stairs after I staid as long as I could; then I found the lower part of my house was clear'd into the garden; then I look'd about me, to see who I had with me. I saw the prisoner walking in the yard, after that I thought of my effects in the cellar, I called for help and got in there, I had help till I got best part out. After which I was pulled out of the window, with my shoes and stockings burnt, I missed several things and had intelligence that there was room to suspect the prisoner. I got my Lord Mayor's warrant on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040013"/> the Wednesday morning, I went to this house and found his daughter; I asked her if her father had not given her some plate? she said he had a hat-buckle and a medal ; she show'd me the medal it is a mixt mettle, and said the hat buckle is at a pawn-broker's. She went with me, the pawnbroker delivered it to me, it was pawn'd for 1 s. 6 d. The prisoner was brought to me at the Red-Cross in Red-cross-street, by Mr. Fuller. I said to him, do you know me ? he said he remembered something of me. The constable held the candle down under the table. I looked on the buckles in his shoes, and knew them to be mine. I ordered them to be taken out, which they were, [the three buckles and medal produced in court and depos'd to.] I lost several poundsin money, but I cannot fix it on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Trimmer. I had, my Lord; the prisoner seemed to be exceeding busy at the fire. After I came to my self, being almost spent, he was cutting my window, where there was no danger, I said, pray don't go to do me more damage, he said d - n you, I'll take it all down. Mr. Brian spoke to him to desist, so I took the hatchet out of his hand.</p>

            . On the third of last month, the prisoner came home about ten at night, he said he had been at a fire at Hagerstone with one Mr. Rule. On the next day in the morning, my wife informed me he had given his daughter a knee buckle to wear in her hat, and when I came home at night, she inform'd me the girl had showed her a pair of silver shoe-buckles and a medal, and that she said she had a box of stones. I was at home, his daughter and my wife were with me; he came in and asked his daughter if she wanted any money? the girl said yes? he asked her if she would have gold or silver; she said half-pence would do, so he pulled out a linen bag, but I was reading. I did not see the money, but heard it chink; he gave her some halfpence, and said I have got a piece of gold left still. On Tuesday morning I went to work, he did not, we are both carpenters, and work together. Mr. Rule was at work with me, he was at the fire. I asked him if the gentleman had given the prisoner any thing for assisting at the fire? he said he did not know. Said I, his daughter show'd my wife several things; he was all of a tremble, and said, I wish the gentleman is not robb'd. The prisoner told us he was going to buy himself a new waistcoat. I saw him that day at night with one on, we not having opportunity to talk then, agreed to meet at the Green-Dragon in Moorfields to talk more about it, so after I had done work, I went and found Mr. Rule there. We agreed to acquaint the Gentleman of it, which we did. I described the silver shoe-buckles to him, with mens faces upon them, he said he had had them several years by him, and also an odd knee buckle; so he agreed to come the next day with a warrant; he did, and sent for me to the Anchor in Coleman-street, to take up the girl. Rule and I were sent by the prosecutor to secure the girl; we met the prisoner at the end of Beach-lane, we brought him in at the Red cross to the prosecutor. The constable told him he had a warrant against him from my Lord Mayor, for robbing that man at the fire, and that we had found some things already. The prosecutor ordered the candle to be held down, he look'd at the silver buckles in his shoes, and said they were his property. Then the constable took them out. I was with him before my Lord Mayor, he there said he found the buckles just by the place where the prosecutor took the out of his hand. When he was going to Newgate, he said he found a bag on the floor, but said rat me, there was not above 2 d farthing in it, that he found a box, but there was nothing in it but gum, and that when his acquaintance came to hear he was in trouble, he should get the things and he'd send them to the gentleman.</p>

            . I am the constable ; on the 6th of Nov Mr. Trimmer came to me with a warrant to serve on the prisoner. I went to the prisoner's house, there I found his daughter. I examin'd her about the effects mention'd in the warrant, she took the medal out of her pocket and said her father gave it her and the knee buckles ; we kept her in custody till we found her Father; he was brought in at the Red-Cross in Red-Cross-Street. I took the candle and held it to his feet; the prosecutor said they were his property, they were taken off, I have had them in my custody ever since. I took him before my Lord Mayor; there he said he found the buckles near the place where Mr. Trimmer demanded the ax from him, and at Newgate he said he found a bag with 2d farthing in it.</p>

Last Tuesday he came just after three o'clock, and was let in about four. I was alarmed with constables and watchmen. I came down stairs, and one of them told me, they had taken two of my men with a great parcel of lead. They had brought Foste r, with his arms bound. Hope was at his fire melting. I told Foster, I had seen him before. He said, he used to come to bring messages to Hope, and that he had the lead of him; that one of his feet was in the shop, and the other out at the time, about an hour ago: and that there was another young man in the watch house that was with him. He said, they were to carry the lead to Hope's lodging at Islington. Then I charg'd a constable with Hope, he beg'd for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hear what Foster said?</p>
               <p>Cunnick. He did. Then I went to the watch-house in St. Martin's le-Grand, and saw Howard, who told me the same that Foster did; that they had it of their master Hope. That he and Foster, lodged at the same house where Hope did, and that over night, Hope had asked them, if they could get up betimes and call him? he had a jobb for them, and should pay them; that they did, and came all three together, that when they got near my house, he planted them against the church wall, and gave them this signal, that when he shut the door, they were to come to it; Foster said, he was the first that came up; Howard said, he stood on the other side the way, and Hope carried his parcel to him, and put it on his shoulder. I then saw the lead, there was about a hundred and half of it, one piece of it is a large, deep sea lead, for a man of war, and there is fifteen ingots produced in court, and deposed to, all cast in the prosecutor's moulds. Howard is a countryman, he cry'd much, and said he was intraped into it.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my stand is just going into Newgate-street, on Thursday morning, about 4 o'clock, I saw Foster and Howard coming with the lead, they were going down St. Martin's Le Grand. I ask'd them what they had got there ? they told me lead. That they were carrying it to Islington to a place call'd Prison Bars. I call'd to another watchman; we secured them in the watch-house, the constable examined them separately, they both said as the prosecutor has mentioned. Foster said he could tell us where they had it. Howard said he could not find the place again. We took Foster, he brought us to the prosecutor's-house. We knock'd at the door, Hope opened it. Foster said, that is he that gave us the lead. We asked Hope if he had any authority to give such persons lead, he said he had. Then we said we must speak with his master. He came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040016"/> down, we got a constable and watchman in that ward, and secured Hope</p>

               <p>I cast all the lead myself that very morning; master sent me on the monday morning to buy all the lead I could, we being to cast on Tuesday. I carried some on the Monday. I went as soon as I awaked, and carried the remainder of it. I melted it. I asked these two men over night if they would do a jobb for me. I told them when I had cast it, I would call them, they were to stay in the church yard. I call'd them in about 3 quarters of an hour, and gave it them to carry home, it being my own lead.</p>

               <p>Foster's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was at work for this man on the Monday, and at night he asked me if I could get up early in the morning, saying he'd satisfy me. I did, we went together to the prosecutor's house, when we came to the church, he bid us stop till he called us. When he called us we went, and he gave us the lead to carry to his room.</p>

            . Hope lives in Goswell street, I live servant in the same house. Last Monday morning I was sent of an errand, to the Bell in Wood-street, with a letter betwixt five and six in the morning. When I got up he asked me to light a candle, I sawa matted basket in his room by him, I went down stairs and put out the candle. He came down with a basket on his shoulder, with something in it, that seemed troublesome. I went with him, and parted with him in Wood-street. I have been in the house about two years; I never know'd any thing of him but what was just and honest.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Newark. I have known him seventeen or eighteen years; I never heard a bad character of him till now. And now I don't believe he was guilty of robbing his master.</p>

I asked him what he meant? (he was a very ugly looking fellow) said he, you offered to commit sodomy with this man, meaning the prisoner, whom I had not seen till he spoke. He came up and said yes, d - n my precious limbs if he did not: and that they would have me before Alderman Ironside. I was very much frighted and desired them to let me alone, then the prisoner told me he fancied I was of some character, and that he would not blast it. And if I'd make him some satisfaction, they would let me go about my business and say no more about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said so?</p>
               <p>Burch. They both said so, but the prisoner in particular. Then I told them I believed they were two rogues; and offered to run, from them then they knocked me down several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did?</p>
               <p>Burch. They both did. I saw nothing in their hands, I believe it was with their fists, but I was so afrighted I hardly knew what they had. Then I called out for help, and murder, &amp;c. then Mr. Dimford and one Ward, were coming by; there were several people, coming by at the time they did not interrupt or assist me, the prisoner and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040017"/> other man curst and swore a great deal, the other got off but we secured Noke.</p>

            . On the 15th of November, about seven in the evening I was going home, going up Lombardstreet about 15 or 16 yards behind me, I heard some blows like men fighting. I heard the word sodomite, there I saw two or three men in a fray, I went to them, I saw the prosecutor receive a violent blow on the side of the head; after that he made towards me. He knowing me, he call'd out, You know me, I did not know him at first, but upon his second time calling I knew him. I said what is the meaning of all this? to the prisoner and the other man. How dare you use a man in this manner? One of them said D - n him he is a sodomite. I said I believed him to be a very sober, honest man. They swore a pretty deal he was. I said you look to be two very suspicious fellows, and I shall know who you are. They said they had never seen one another before. There were many people then gathered together, presently the other was missing. Said I to the prisoner, I think you have a very ugly look. He talked of bringing several gentlemen to his reputation, and amongst-the rest one Mr. Heath in Crooked-lane. We secured him and took him before my Lord-Mayor and he was committed.</p>

I went backwards and took the candle with me. I returned again in about ten minutes. I found three drawers open, and the things mentioned in the Indictment gone.

               <p>Sparrow. I have met with some of them. South being taken up for another fact, I went to him in Newgate. He told me he and Farrel came into my shop at that time and took the things, and put them into Barker's apron, and went into a publick house in Long lane. That there he wrapt them up in the velvet cloak. From thence to their place of rendezvous in Black-boy alley, and

On Wednesday the 13th of November, I dined at home and served some customers in the shop, then the goods were there. I went out, when I came home, my wife told me I had been robbed of the goods mentioned, and that the wooden till was found in Jewin-street. On the Thursday se'nnight following, we heard Mrs. Taylor had been robbed, and the person taken in the fact. That his name was South, and that when he was examined before alderman Asgill, he owned he was concerned in robbing me, and mentioned the two prisoners, upon whose information they were taken. South and Farrel were brought to Guild-Hall on the Monday. Sir

             thought necessary to examine them separate. There Farrel gave information where some of my things were. After that he told me how he committed the robbery. That he came into my shop, being best acquainted with it, (as he was apprentice to a shoemaker near me, and has been in my shop often.) He said to Barker, you may as well tell where the things are. Then she told me that she and a woman whom she called Long Sue, sold the tea chest for 3 s. to one Costers, that keeps the Queen's Head in Chick-lane. That they went to one Ferguson's in Barbican, and pawned the stays for 4 s. and the Spoons and Tongs for 6 s. in the name of Cob. I went there, and upon examining their books, there were a pair of stays pawned in the name of Cob, but were fetched out the next day by the same person that brought them. I inquired after the tea chest, but could get no account of it. The people said they knew the prisoners, and that they had been at their house.

He tore my muslin handkerchief from my neck, and tore me along by the back of my neck. I called out to my neighbours, he ran away. This person was Gilson. The other 2 were by.

             and I were drinking together, he said where do you lie to night? I told him at a house in Buckle-street, Goodman's-fields; he swore he did not know where he should lie, but if there is money to be had, he'd have some; we had a pint of beer and a dram of gin, he call'd me out and said, if you'll take a walk with me, I'll get money. We met Roberson by Tower ditch side. I have known him 7 years ; he told me he had not been at sea this four months; that he could not get his R off. We had a pint of beer. Said he, you are a true hearted fellow, we'll make ourselves. How Tom? said I, said he, there is a barge with 15 chests of money in her, and wanted me to go and we might conquer all the few people on board, and get it. We met Gilson in Goodman's-fields, between 3 and 4 o'clock. We had some discourse, Robertson wanted to go into the Minories, saying that was the best place to rob in, there being most to be got, the other said not, and that he used to mill their cloaks withoutside Aldgate at the ship, I said I think White Chapel by the Dead-Wall is better. We went there; this was about 6 o'Clock, Robertson asked what Arms we had, Gilson swore a bloody Oath, here is a thing, and pull'd out a Pistol from his Pocket, wrapp'd in a Handkerchief, he gave it to Robertson, who-said he must put more Prime in it. The first we met was a Soldier; Gilson struck him with a Stick, and took his Hat: I said, throw the Man his hat again; then we swore the first person we met we would have his money, then we went into Church-lane, there we stood a good while. We saw the prosecutrix and another person. Gilson said, damn your blood there is a prize, said I, don't be so hasty, he ran directly and said. damn his soul if he'd come away. She began to cry. I heard him swear a bitter oath he'd have it, the woman with the lanthorn run, he swore at me for not knocking her down, saying, why don't you out with her glim?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prosecutrix before ?</p>
               <p>Summers. I lodg'd in her house about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lodge there?</p>
               <p>Summers. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you followed this practice?</p>
               <p>Summers. Never till last thursday night. I call'd to Gilson fearing he should use her ill, and said, there is no good there. We went from Buckle-street to White-chapel, then to the Minories, then to the Black Horse in Rag-fair. There came in a ynsman of mine a shoemaker, he bit his lips and call'd me out, saying, what company are you in? did not I tell you what Robertson was, that he keeps company with pick-pockets. Said I, I am afraid they will bring me to the gallows. I told him a woman we robb'd knows me. He said never mind it, sit down and eat your bread and cheese, I'll put it fast asleep.

            . Summers came to me that Friday night about six o'clock. he said he was very poor, and wanted me to pay for a pint of beer, I drank once and paid 3 d. I went about my business. About an hour after he came again, he shewed me the handkerchief, and wanted to leave it with me for a shilling or 1 s. 6 d. then Gilson pulled it out. I said I'll have nothing to do withyou. I then paid 3 d. more and went away. They were all 3 together at the Coach and Horses, just where I live, in a street joining to Wellclose-square. After this Summers came to the door and said he was inthralled he had robbed a woman, and said he wished he had not done it, and wished somebody would take him up. I went and found Stanley, Morris, Hammond and Mackdaniel at the India Arms; I told them an acquaintance of mine had been in a robbery, I left them at such a place. When we came there they were gone, we went and searched farther on and took them at the Black-horse; Gilson owned to the taking the handkerchief.</p>

             came by and called me by my name and asked Bell how he did. She said she wanted to speak with him, but must go to her father first. When she returned. she asked him for a Dram, he said he had no money, she said will that young woman lend you some ? I said I had none. She lent him three halfpence. She put it into my hand to fetch a dram. I left them at the door. When I came with it I found them both where I left them. I was gone about 3 minutes. She drank first, Bell second, and I third. Her mother coming she whipped into the house and ran up one pair of stairs. she bolted herself in. The bolt is within-side. Her mother was making a noise. Then Mr. Gyles came back, he said if her daughter was there she should have her. Her mother and he went up, and asked her to open the door, she would not. Then Mr. Gyles broke the door open.</p>

Upon which I came home, there I found it broke and the flap of it down, a tin chest, with the things mentioned in the indictment in it was lying on the stairs, and all the things gone, a hammer and chissel of my own, were one lying near the tin box, the other on the flap of the bureau. The prisoner at the bar was my labourer to grind colours, look after my horse, and go on errands, &amp;c. When I understood Grigby was absconded, I inquired after the prisoner, and was informed they were at an alehouse at skittles on the 12th, the best part of the day. The prisoner not coming as usual, I sent and found he was gone from his lodgings, and had taken what things he had along with him, I went to Goldsmith's-Hall and sent bills amongst the trade, and advertised in the papers ; and by virtue of the advertisement, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040023"/> worthy gentleman of Bridgwater in Somersetshire, got the prisoner apprehended; and in order to do justice to my country, I have brought him here. Some time after the robbery one Mr. Slayter who keeps an alehouse at Baguali's-Marsh, came to my house with one of the papers I had printed; saying two such persons which I described, had changed the two guinea piece with him. It was a very remarkable one, I had it many years, I could know it from ten thousand, there is a flaw in it that goes from one side to the other. He brought it, I gave him 2 guineas for it. I had a ring stopped at Smithfield bars brought by a woman, but they were not so lucky as to stop the woman. My apprentice has not been heard of since he left the prisoner.</p>

             rung the stable bell, I went and let him in and went down stairs again. Just as I got down stairs again the prisoner knocked at the fore-door. He brought the key of the shop, and begged a bit of soap to wash his hands. He went up stairs, and cross the passage, and opened the door. We heard it shut but we did not see him go out. Just after that Grigby called down the kitchen stairs and said, Master will be at home to night or in the morning. After we had done washing, we wondered the apprentice did not come home as usual. We went up stairs and there saw a small tin chest wide open, with a hammer lying by it. We had never seen the chest before. We went into master's room and into the dining-room, to see if every thing was fast in the dining-room. We saw the flap of the escritore down and a chizel lying upon it. We went and desired a watchman, to go for Mr. Edmonds master's foreman. He came with the watchman. We searched the house. My fellow servant and I are very well assured nobody had been in the house, but Grigby and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jonnathan Slayter. I live at Bagnall's marsh, or what is called Black-mary's-hole, about a furlong from the prosecutor's. I keep a publick-house. On the 12th of August in the evening, came in a man and a boy near the close of the evening. There came with them an acquaintance of mine. I cannot pretend to swear to either the man or the boy. They asked for a shillings-worth of Liquor, it was either rum or brandy and water. I think after that they had another. After that my man brought a 2 guinea piece to change. My wife did not know what it was. He is shew'd it. [The prosecutor deposed to it as his property, and be likewise.] The lad said he should be lock'd out, so they both lay at my house. After the advertizing these things I wait, and carried this 2 guinea piece to the prosecutor.</p>

            . The prisoner and Grigby lay together at Mr. Slayter's. I waited upon them till they were in bed. They being late lay there. I know'd Grigby before he was apprentice. I was a lodger in Slayter's house. I drank with them the next morning, but going to work, saw them no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mittleditch. I live at the White Hart in Leather-lane. On Monday the 12th of August the prisoner and a lad came into my house, he knew me some time before. They had some beef and cucumbers. They went away. The prisoner did not come home again that night; he lodged with me at that time. The next morning as I was coming from Hatton-Garden, I met them both together, the lad had a bundle on his back. The prisoner something in his apron. The prisoner said he had lost a quarter of a day, by lying in bed too long, but he was going to work now. I cannot say I shall know the boy again.</p>

               <p>I was under a cloud. I told my master where I belong to, and that I must go home. He advertized me to my home. The boy came to me and asked me what I had to my supper? I said a mutton or a beef chop, he said if I would give him part he would come, for it was washing day. He came, I treated him with 2 pints of beer. Then he said he did not care for beer, and if I would go with him he would give me a treat, and knowing this man, we went along with him. The Evidence said if I would go into the country he would go with me. There Grigby pulled out that piece of gold and laid it upon the board. I took it up, I might throw it in order for change I am not positive. He said he had it of his sister, the next day I was fearful<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040024"/> of being arrested for money I owed I did not tell my master I was going away then, but I had about a fortnight before, one time when he paid me.</p>

I sent for her to come as usual, she came, she was not in the house half an hour before she stole a shirt, a neckcloth and a handkerchief. We had her searched and found the things upon her. Then she confessed the rest, and also where she had pawned some shirts and neckcloths. We went to the place and got some of the shirts again.

He asked for a bit of bread as my family were eating. I asked him to eat a bit of meat, he did, he staid from 3 in the afternoon till 12. There were 3 or 4 people with him at first, I imagined by his manner of proceeding he knew them all. About 12 he asked me who I had in the house? saying he had a charge of money about him and must lie there all night. I told him that his bed was a shilling. He asked for change for what he called a Shina, that was a 36 s. piece. I said I had but a guinea, said he, what have I had? said I, so much; he said his money was in the waistband of his breeches, I turned my face from him while he went to take it out. He said give me the silver, I did 21 shillings and held my hand for his money. He took up a knife and said if I stirred he'd do me a mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawkins. I never saw him before that time. He talked to me as if he had known me a long time. He said he wanted to go to the play, I lent him half a guinea. He talked so much goodness I thought he was much better than many of us christians.</p>

               <p>Coming by this woman's house about 5 o'clock, I was called in by her. She said she know'd me. She wanted me to drink pint of beer. She got a girl in white gown, she groped and felt at me. The woman ask me if I please go up stairs and have fire. Said she what signifies starving in this company<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040025"/> in a large room. We'll go where is a bed, we went up, she brought up 2 bowls of punch, after that the girl asked me go to the play. I went with her to it and back again, she ask me if I would go to supper, tell me what will have. I said some pork stakes. She said she could get some mutton chops. She would not let me keep the Mans company below, but be with this girl up stairs, thinking I had great deal money. She decoyed me still to stay and sleep there. She said what time will you get up, you are as safe as in queen's house, it will be but half a crown for your bed, and a girl to lie with you all night. I finding it was bad house would not stay. She would hang me for a farthing, Look into her character, my Lord, see what a character she has got. I have serv'd my king and country great many years.</p>

I ordered my ostler up, he came down and said there was a considerable quantity of lead gone, I went up and found it so; on the Wednesday following, the 30th, I went up into the gutter about half an hour after 7 o'clock in the morning and missed more. Then I went to my butcher in St. John's-street, he and I went into Charterhouse-lane, and peeping through a hole in a door, in an old house that comes to the back of my yard, but 2 or 3 houses distance, I saw the 2 prisoners putting some lead into a cloth or sack; they went out with each some. I watched them down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040027"/> the lane ; her's was in her apron, and his on his head; they went through the sheep-pens in Smithfield, down Cow-lane. I went and got a constable; we took them coming down a lane by the New market. Lowe confessed he stole it from me, Butcher said he was to give her a breakfast for carrying it with him; they were taken before Alderman Whitaker, before whom Lowe owned he stole the lead from my shed, and the woman received it through a hole : I have taken dimensions of the width of the gutter, and it fits exactly. Lowe said he sold as much before, as came to 7 s. [The lead produced in court and deposed to.]</p>

               <p>Jos. Cooper. I paid Mr. Tibey, the Friday before the Lottery began to draw, for ten tickets, 118 l. 15 s. in which payment there was a goldsmith's note for 84 l. and a 30 l. Bank-note, and the rest in money.</p>
               <p>Jos. Hall. On Friday evening, the 8th of November, about 6 o'clock, I went into Jonathan's Coffee-house. I heard Mr. Tibey make a bargain for ten Lottery-tickets with a neighbour of mine one Mr. Parsons. Mr. Tibey all on a sudden turn'd about, and laid hold on the prisoner at the bar, saying, This man's hand was in my pocket, Lay hold on him: People cry'd, Shut the door, keep him in. A crowd gathered round him; I heard one or two people say, He flung something out of his hand. I looked down, and took up two notes, one inclosed in the other; the outside was a Bank-note of 30 l. the other a note of alderman Ironside and company, for 84 l. this was about 2 or 3 yards from the place where Mr. Tibey first charged him with having his hand in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hall. They lay close to his foot; Mr. Tibey described them, and they were delivered to Mr. Capes.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people in the Coffee-house?</p>
               <p>Hall. The Coffee-house was almost as full as it could hold.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was the prisoner to Mr. Tibey, when he said that man's hand was in his pocket?</p>
               <p>Hall. They were close together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not Mr. Tibey cry out, O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! then turn about and lay hold on me, and say, I don't like you? Then he charg'd me.</p>
               <p>Hall. I did not hear any such word, only this: This man's hand was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Tibey? I suppose he's here.</p>
               <p>Hall. He is a Quaker, and does not care to swear.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say in answer?</p>
               <p>Hall. He said, Sir, Me! not me!</p>
               <p>Q. Did he change countenance ?</p>
               <p>Hall. I did not see he did at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mr. Tibey, when you took up the notes?</p>
               <p>Hall. He was moved towards the end of the room.</p>

            . On the 8th of November, about six in the evening, I was in Jonathan's Coffee-house ; the crowd was very great: In endeavouring to pass from one end to the other, I passed by Mr. Tibey; he said, I don't like this fellow, he has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040028"/> had his hand in my pocket. The prisoner made some reply, I cannot tell what. Mr. Tibey made answer to it. Fellow, I felt your hand in my pocket; and added, Why don't you lay hold on him? Upon which Mr. Hall clapt hold on him. There was an outcry in the room, saying, Shut the door and search him. Then somebody said, He has dropt something. I looked upon the floor, and at the prisoner's feet there lay some papers folded up together, which Mr. Hall took up and gave into my hand. I turned about to Mr. Tibey, and asked him what were the notes he had lost? He said, a Bank-note and a goldsmith's note. I opened them, and found the outside note was a Bank-note, and the other a note of 84 l. as he had told me before; they were sealed up, and kept in my custody ever since. [Produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>On his being cross-examined, he said the papers were found immediately upon the calling out he had dropt something; there he saw them lie immediately: That when they were taken up, there was but an open place large enough for a man to stand : That he did not think any body else could drop them : That Mr. Tibey and the persons near him were well known there: That Mr. Hall was close to the prisoner: That Mr. Tibey was betwixt him and the prisoner: That there might be 200 people in the room.</p>
               <p>Jos. Holmes. On November the 8th. at about 6 at night, I went to Jonathan's Coffee-house; I had not been in above a minute, standing on the right-hand of Mr. Tibey, before he said, A pickpocket! a pickpocket! that man had got his hand into my pocket, (meaning the prisoner) pointing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to him?</p>
               <p>Holmes. About half a yard or a yard from him: He said, Lay hold on him. I laid hold of one arm, and Mr. Hall of the other; in an instant, there was a voice said, He has dropt something. I looked down and saw the papers on the ground; I went to stoop for them, but the crowd bore so hard I could not stoop. Mr. Hall took them up.</p>

            . The prisoner is the person as nigh as I can guess, which I saw on the top of the house, I followed him from house to house, till we lost sight of him. We pursued so close, that had he not got in at the window, we must have taken him upon the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was formerly a housekeeper. I was indebred to a man 17 l. 17 s. I had a writ after me this half year. I lodg'd in St. Martins-lane. They came after me several times. I had notice they were after me at that time, they were over the way at the Plough. I staid till 12 o'clock. I went down into the city, and went in at a nighthouse there, and staid, thinking I was safe, I had been there about three hours. There came in a sheriff's officer, he fell in discourse with me. I knew him by sight, but not his name. In his discourse he pretended to quarrel. I saw him send out a boy. I made my escape. This was about five in the morning, I turn'd up into Shoe-lane, there lives an acquaintance of mine, one Jones, on the left hand upon a turning, they lodge in a garret. I thought to get there for cover. Just as I got to the door, I met the man going to work. I told him my reason for calling, he said, go up into my room, I did with him, the officers followed him as fast as they could. The garret window being open, I went out into a gutter, climb'd over the houses, there I staid till daylight; when it came to be light, where was I, but at the bottom of Holbourn-hill. I dont believe I have any witnesses. They waited all day yesterday. Your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, may as you please, I am very easy about it.</p>

On the 13th of October I was drinking at the King's Arms in Fleet-market, the prisoner and Oglebury pick'd my pocket of a shirt and neckcloth, within ten minutes after I got out of the house. They had been drinking there.</p>

A young man directed me to where they lodged in Black boy-alley, I went first into the house, there was a woman that seemed to deny them to me; I said I did not want them for any harm. Then she took the candle and went up stairs, they were going to bed, they threatned to kick me down stairs; I said if they did not give me my things I'd charge the watch with them. I looked over the bed and saw my neckcloth and shirt, I took them and said now I have got them again; I heard them whisper as I was coming down the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you hear them whisper then, you are very deaf now?</p>
               <p>Trustraham. I have been deaf about a month, I catched cold. I was not deaf before, I was gone out of the house about half a dozen doors, then Oglebury came to me and said stop, I have something to say to you; I made a push back into a chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this?</p>
               <p>Trustraham. This was about 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are chandler's shops open there till twelve o'clock?</p>
               <p>Trustraham. Yes they are, the prisoner came up and snatched off my hat and wig just as I was stepping into the shop, I catched my hat in my hand, away he made off up the alley with the wig. I went to the house they made at the door, the woman let me out at the back door and I went home, and said I had been robbed by 2 chaps, there I was told they went up Long-lane swearing and cursing about the wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any weapons?</p>
               <p>Trustraham. They had not.</p>

On the 13th of November, I got up about seven o'clock, going by the door where the prisoner lay, below stairs, I knock'd, he made me no answer: I went round into a court and got into the room, he was gone: I found my bureau broke open, the lock of it was wrench'd, and my money gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was it?</p>
               <p>Knowles. I remember particularly 5 thirty-six shilling pieces, a moidore, a 3 l. 12 s. piece, about 25 guineas, and 9 l. odd in silver; to the amount of 50 l. and upwards; it was in bags.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been your servant ?</p>
               <p>Knowles. He had been with me about three weeks. About noon that day I had a messenger from Barnet, that he was taken there. I went and found him at Mr Jones's house at the Ship and Dragon. We took him before the justice there. He confessed every thing. The justice had all the money in keeping, except 20 s. There was 49 l. 11 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the same particular pieces amongst it, that you spoke of?</p>
               <p>Knowles. Yes, my Lord, there were.</p>
               <p>Burgy Jones. I live at the Ship and Dragon in Barnet. The prisoner came to my house between 5 and 6 in the morning on the 13th of November. There being a light he knock'd at the door. I was up, he was on foot. He asked if he could have a pint of beer and a pennyworth of bread and cheese.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040032"/> I brought him out some bread and meat; after he had drank 2 or 3 pints of beer, he would have a quartern of gin in each pint, the beer was not strong enough. Then he said, cannot I have a pint of brandy to chear me upon the road? I measured him some and put it into a bottle. Come, said he, drink, my boots are full of money, I have money enough. I said it's well for you. He fetch'd his Boots rom the other side the kitchen (they were hanging cross his shoulder when he came in) He pulled out a bag and told me an old aunt died and left it him, and he was going into the country to live upon it. He gave the bag to me to count, for he said he did not know what money was in it. There were 4 bags one within another. The first had 12 guineas and a half. I think the next had five 36 s. pieces, one 3 l. 12 s. the rest in guineas. Each had money in them. The other 2 had each silver in them. In the whole I believe there was about 50 l. I had a suspicion by his appearance he stole it. I said I had an old rich aunt in Lancashire, and I know'd where she laid her money. I robbed her and came up into this country and settled myself with it. Then he said he had done the same. (This I said to bring it out, I never was in Lancashire in my life.) Then I charged 2 men with him and carried him before justice Hasel. Then he confessed he stole the money from Mr. Knowles. He is show'd one of the bags, and said, that which was on the outside was singed; he picks it out. All the others I believe to be the same I then saw.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Knowles. Was the money you lost in these bags?</p>
               <p>Knowles. It was one of them I made, and marked the word Silver upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you used to open this bureau in the prisoner's presence.</p>
               <p>Knowles. I never did; but that night, I bid him come and warm himself by the fire, at which time I put up forty eight shillings into the bureau.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I insist upon the money being counted in court, before I say any thing.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I paid the money away a few days after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing more to say.</p>

               <p>Spendal. There was one missing, which was not finished, the button-holes were not made. The woman that was at work on it came down stairs and complained; upon which we made enquiry. They had got the prisoner into the parlour, taxing her with knowing which way it was gone: She owned she had took it. Said I, Very likely she has took more. Then she owned to 2 more, till at last she owned to 8, which she said she had pawned to 6 different pawnbrokers: This (holding one in his hand, with the 2 button-holes not finished ) she owned she pawned to Mr. Erwin, for 6 shillings.</p>

The first got away. I stop the prisoner with this lead in his apron. [Produced in court.] There was a man passing by; I desired him to lay hold of the prisoner, while I ran after the other, who had dropt his lead, and ran for it. I could not catch him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lead missing from that house?</p>
               <p>Ballard. There was; and I and another man, who is not here, sitted this lead to the place; it sitted exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040033"/>Q. How old do you look upon the prisoner to be?</p>
               <p>Ballard. He says he is 15 years of age, he would never tell who was with him.</p>

               <p>There was nobody with me, I had been over the water to Tooley-stairs with a fair. I returned and went back behind that house to ease myself, there the lead stood against the wall.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he here?</p>
               <p>E. Rice. He is not, my husband is very ill. so he cannot be out when I am: the company had not quitted the house, only one had been out once, and the prisoner twice. I opened 2 cupboards where I used to put them, it was not in either of them; I looked under the table and said to the men, it is hard I should loose my tankard. I thought they had played the wag with it, I looked at the prisoner and said don't you know of it, he said no; said I to my knowledge, you have been outtwice, he answered he never had been out since he came here to drink, and said many bad words. I sent the maid for a constable unknown to them. The other young men said they were very willing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040034"/> to go to the compter, or where I pleased till I was satisfied. Then Boulton slid towards the door-way, and laid hold on the door to go out. I took hold on the skirt of his coat, and said he should not go out any more than the rest. He said he wanted to make water, then I said he shall go into the cellar. He went down, when he came up again, the constable was come. The prisoner sat down by the table, and said I wanted to persuade him to say he had it. I said, if you have it don't frighten me but let me have it. Then the constable took him into the kitchen with the others. Then Charles Price came out and bid me not be frighted, for I was likely to have my tankard again. Then he went out.</p>

            . I went to this house to have a little beer before I went to work, Boulton called me on one side and asked me to do him a favour, that was to go to Mrs. Daws's for the tankard, or else for her to bring it under her apron. I came out of the kitchen into the tap-room, and told Mrs. Rice, I had heard of her tankard; she ordered the constable to go with me. We went to the woman's house nam'd Dawes, where the tankard was left, but she was not at home; so I went to my work. When we found where the woman was, we went again, she was at the Cart and Horses; we asked her for it. She said the prisoner brought her a tankard. She show'd us where it was, and took it out. She said he told her he found it among some rubbish. She delivered it to the constable, and we brought it to the prosecutrix. They had a warrant against the woman but she is absconded.</p>

            . In mine. The prisoner at the bar, brought these things to me, and went away again. And after that came again, as we did not agree for the price the first time. The second time she was to have had the money or the lace. We thought them too good for a journeyman tradesman's wife to wear. So I detained the lace. I went the next morning to see for her at the place where she lived. She was gone and never came again. She was taken up near Turnham-green, in the Bristol waggon. Mr. Tompson had delivered a bill at our house of such and such things lost, which was the occasion of my going to his house to inquire about them.</p>

               <p>Boudilla. This is not Mr. Delamotte's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose do you think it is?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. I think it is the prisoner's own handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him write?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this affair ?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. The porter told me the prisoner had carried this sack of oats to Mr. Jefferson's, he gave me no money.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. He was grainary man, when he has had a ticket of Mr. Delamotte or me, then he used to carry out corn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always send a ticket when you send him?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. We do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember he ever carried out any without a ticket?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. No, I don't remember he ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say he always had a ticket when he carried any out?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. I cannot take upon me to say he always had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known money paid unto your master, for oats delivered without a ticket ?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. I cannot remember there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a ticket went to Mrs. Jefferson before this?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. I can't remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he carried out oats with a tickets who gives the receipt?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. I do, or my fellow clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever brought money without giving a receipt?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you sign the receipt when you give one.</p>
               <p>Boudilla. I write, For Mr.

               <p>Q. How long was this after the carrying out the oats?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. This was four days after that, he carried the oats, the third, and brought the money on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this man carried oats to a customer, had he authority to receive money?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. If he had a receipt of the clerks he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a customer had a mind to pay the money, when the oats were carried home, had he authority to receive it?</p>
               <p>Boudilla. Some he was paid, I believe without having a receipt of us.</p>
