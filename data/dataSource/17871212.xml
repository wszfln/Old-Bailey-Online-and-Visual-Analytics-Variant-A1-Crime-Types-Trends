I handed him the remainder of the liquor, he sat and just drank out of it, I do not think he had laid down two minutes, before he jumped out of bed with a naked knife in his hand, he made a catch at the deceased, at her by the neck, he said, I will, I must, I must, I must! and how I got out, were I to die this moment, I cannot say; he put the knife to her throat naked, cut her throat under the left ear, got her back against the table, and there she lay.</p>
               <p>What did he do after this? - I ran out, I could not stay, I was so frightened, I got assistance, the officers of the night; I came back, and when I came back with my assistance,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120006"/>he stood behind the door with the naked knife in his hand, and he said the first that entered the door, was a dead man.</p>

               <p>Do you know how long the deceased lived after this? - She died directly, before any assistance could be got; in about ten minutes I saw her dead, when I returned.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Had you had any acquaintance with this man before? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Then he accidentally picked you up as a woman of the town? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What aged woman was the deceased? - I believe, to the best of my knowledge, she might be about four or five and twenty; she lived with a young man, and I lived with her; she was going to smoke a pipe in the chimney corner.</p>
               <p>According to your account, every thing had been very agreeable? - Not a wry word of any sort, no more than there is now, so help me God.</p>
               <p>This poor woman had been attending to him, and gave him his change? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say this was a ground room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any body near the door at the time this happened? - No.</p>
               <p>All that this man said of any sort was, I must, I will, I must? - He said, I must, I will, I must.</p>
               <p>And immediately jumped out of bed and destroyed this woman; what had he drank? - He had only drank three pennyworth of rum and water.</p>
               <p>What is brandy hot? - Hot porter with brandy in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is a very intoxicating liquor? - The shrub never was touched; after this unfortunate thing happened, this man stood at the door with his knife, threatening to kill any body that came in; when the assistance came he did.</p>
               <p>Was he naked at that time? - He had nothing on but his shirt; I was going to bed, he was undressed and expected me.</p>
               <p>This poor woman and he did not appear to be acquaintances? - No, they had never seen one another to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had he asked you to come to bed after he went to bed? - No, not a word, but he laid himself quietly down, and his hat doubled; when he asked for liquor I gave it him.</p>
               <p>What had he done with the rest of his clothes; you said he folded up his breeches in a foolish sort of way, made a sort of doll of them? - He put them on his right side; I never saw the knife before in my life, nor I should not know the knife.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any conversation at the time this accident happened? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember him saying, that if he had not done it, he should have been done himself that night? - He said something, but I did not hear what it was.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when the assistance had got in and secured him, his being asked by any body that was present, why he had done it? - No, I was so frightened, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you sit with the prisoner at the alehouse? - I believe it was between eight and nine, to the best of my knowledge, when he came in.</p>
               <p>How long did he sit? - Not a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Had you much conversation? - Not at all, any further than I told you he asked me to drink, and if I was going home, nothing more.</p>
               <p>Did he appear (sometimes you may see by a man's manner) to be disordered in his mind? - Nothing at all, any more than any gentleman present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was you doing at the time he seized the other woman? - I was standing just ready to go into bed, he never asked me to come to bed, nor spoke the least cross word any more than any gentleman here.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe, Captain Nelson, you was the commander of the Boreas Frigate? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner fail under your command? - He did.</p>
               <p>How long was he in the service under you? - Near four years; he was paid off the 30th of November last, at Sheerness.</p>
               <p>What money did he receive? - In August we were paid off, he then received about forty guineas; when the ship was paid off in November, he received ten or eleven more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Constable. Had he any money about him? - Six guineas and a half; before the Justice; he acknowledged before the Magistrate that he did not lose a farthing to his knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Captain Nelson. Had you an opportunity of knowing the character of this man, as far as humanity and good-nature were concerned? - Perfectly; it seldom happens that any man can serve four years without being guilty of some sort of offence; that man, at times, I have made some remarks, that he appeared melancholy, but the quietest, soberest man that I ever saw in all my life, he appeared to me to be a man that had seen better days, and at times became melancholy; when I heard of this affair, I said, if it is true, he must be insane, for I should as soon suspect myself, and sooner, because I know I am hasty; he is so quiet a man, and never committed a fault during the time I knew him; seamen, I know perfectly, when they come home, the landlords will furnish them with raw liquors; I saw myself thirty or forty people from that ship, that were made as mad as if they were at Bedlam, and did not know what they did: I know, that when seamen are furnished with British spirits, it turns the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120008"/>But as to this man, do you apprehend, that liquors upon him would have had that effect? - He is not a drunkard by any means; therefore of course liquors would have had more effect upon him.</p>
               <p>Can you fairly say, that this man, under the pressure of a good deal of liquor, did appear to you to be insane? - He was a cooper on board; and at the island of Antigua, I think it was, he was struck with the sun, after which time he appeared melancholy; I have been affected with it; I have been out of my senses; it hurts the brain.</p>
               <p>Do you think that has been the case with respect this unfortunate prisoner? - I have thought so years ago when he was under my command.</p>
               <p>Is he a man, from your knowledge of him, likely to commit a deliberate foul murder? - I should as soon suspect myself, because I am hasty, he is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think, while he was on board your ship, that he was so melancholy, and so much beside himself, if he had committed a fault you would not have punished him for it? - If he had been guilty of a fault I should have punished him; I myself have been struck in the brain, so that I was out of my senses.</p>
               <p>When he came home did he conduct himself as a reasonable man? - Usually; always so.</p>
               <p>Court to Hawkins. What day was this when you took him into custody? - The 2d of November.</p>

               <p>I keep the public house in Lower Shadwell; I know the prisoner; I saw him after he was paid off the first of this month, the day before this unfortunate accident; on the Saturday evening I saw him, and was in company with him, and likewise on the Sunday he was at my house, but I did not see him; I do not know where he lodged on the Saturday night, there was something particular that struck me in him; I had a particular friend that lodged with me, and he began telling me a story of being robbed, or going to be; and I wanted to know the rights of it; he talked in such a manner that I was quite struck, not like a man in his rational judgement; he observed to me, that there was a whole gang of people about him, and he looked as if they were just after him; he looked startled, which I thought he need not be in my house; and he told me that there were about sixteen men that wanted to rob him, knowing that he had property, and had been paid off; and he signified to me, that he gave them a good deal of money to get shut of them, I asked him the particulars twice, and he rather seemed to affront me; I thought it was something very odd, a man that I was acquainted with four years back, that he should, in the first set off give me such answers; and I observed it in an hour after to his friend.</p>
               <p>You say you have known him about four years before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe it was in the year 1783, before he failed in the Boreas frigate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be an altered man? - Greatly so.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you, from his whole conduct, to be a man in possession of his right mind intirely? - That was the observation I made, that he was not; I made the observation an hour after I had seen him, to his friend in the house; he bore, four years before, an extraordinary good character; he was quite the reverse to a man that would do a cruel thing; he appeared greatly altered; his friend's name is Thomas Carse.</p>
               <p>Is he a relation of his? - Yes, he is his cousin.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it in the morning or in the evening that you had this conversation with him? - In the evening, about six or seven; it was just after candle light.</p>
               <p>Had he been drinking? - They had two pots of porter, in my house, among five or six; I looked at him when he talked in such an irrational manner, to see if he was in liquor, but he did not appear to be in liquor, but in sad troubles somehow or other.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in your house then? - He was in the house, I imagine, an hour and half, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120009"/>Had he been drinking elsewhere? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How much had he drank while he was in your house? - I think it was two pots of porter; there were five or six of them; his cousin, and more friends, I looked at his face two or three different times; his giving me such an odd answer made me look in his face to see if he was in liquor, which I did not think he was at the time; I do not know where he had been before he came to my house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a first cousin to this man; I am a cooper; I lodged at the house of the last witness; I first saw the prisoner on Saturday was fortnight, after he came from Sheerness, he came to the house to me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular in his manner and conversation? - Yes, Sir, a good deal different to any thing I had seen before.</p>
               <p>What was the first that struck you? - He spoke sometimes in a different style, and did not express himself as I have heard him before; he was some way melancholy, and did not speak freely, and used to sit a considerable time without speaking any thing at all.</p>
               <p>When he did talk, what sort of conversation did he hold with you? - What he talked about to me was mostly, that coming from Gravesend, he was robbed by some people resembling watermen.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether he had been robbed, or attempted to be robbed? - He said they attempted to rob him, and threatened him with his life; and he told me he gave them fourteen guineas to save his life.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether that had satisfied them or not? - He said to me, that they seemed to be satisfied with it, but that they threatened his life, if he did not give them the money.</p>
               <p>Did he appear as much at his case, and as little under apprehension as he used to be? - He did not seem to be as he used to be, for he was all confused, and did not care whether he spoke to any body or not.</p>
               <p>Was he that sort of man before he went to the West Indies? - No; he was not; I never heard any thing else said of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk at the time of this conversation? - No; he was not drunk, as he appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be under any alarm about these people? - He wished to be out of my company; he wished to get home; he said he was all sore, and wished to get home to his bed; he spoke to me as if he had been beat by somebody.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether that was true, or mere fancy? - I could not tell only as he told me.</p>
               <p>He did not talk of going before any Magistrate? - No; he was in company with me on Saturday night, and the Sunday night also.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this morning or evening that you had the conversation with him, about people threatening to rob him? - It was the evening I suppose; to my knowledge, it was between five and six.</p>
               <p>Do you know where he had been the former part of the day? - He had not been above an hour or two in town; he told me he came from Blackwall.</p>
               <p>To Captain Nelson. Was the prisoner sent to the hospital in consequence of being ill? - He was sent to the hospital with a fever which affects the brain; I thought to send him home as an unfit person to serve in that climate.</p>
               <p>Have you known instances of that disorder of the brain leading persons to acts of desperation? - It has happened to a person.</p>
               <p>Court. How was he now in coming home in point of his understanding? - He appeared to me melancholy almost always.</p>
               <p>Did he do any act of desperation while he was on board your ship? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did he know what he was about after he came from the hospital? - Yes; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120010"/>had any complaint of him; he never committed any fault, I thought him mild even to the last; he did not care to associate with any body, he used to appear melancholy and reserved.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the crime of murder consists in slaying a person by malice prepense, or aforethought; and so bad is this, that whoever slays another, the law presumes it is done with malice aforethought; and it behoves the prisoner to give a reasonable excuse for his actions; and if he does not, it is the duty of the Jury to find him guilty. The excuse here is that of madness; if that excuse had been proved to the utmost of its extent, and to your satisfaction, it would undoubtedly be a reasonable one; but then the madness that is brought on a prisoner, must arise from the visitation of God; it must be the consequences of some disease; but even if there be antecedent disease, if there be the seeds of madness lurking in the blood, and the party be reasonable and in his senses, in the ordinary transactions of life, and he voluntarily inflames his blood, and by means of drunkenness, draws out that madness which before was lurking in it, the law does not excuse him: whether or no this is the present case, it will be for your consideration. Under all the circumstances of it, the question is, what sort of madness this was that afflicted the prisoner at this time; it seems pretty clear, that at the time he committed this act, he clearly was mad; there can be no doubt upon it, he could have no provocation for it, the woman had not taken any of his money, the deceased woman had not robbed him, she was sitting quietly smoaking her pipe; that, coupled with all the evidence, can afford no doubt in your minds but that he was at the time insane: the only question is, how he was, when he was sober? for at this time he was drunk, there can be no doubt of it; he had been drinking so much of this hot beer and brandy, that it was enough to over-set any man alive; then you hear, that coming home from Antigua, he was sober, perfectly mild, never in a passion, never committed any desperate act whatever, or any thing that bordered on lunacy; on the other hand he was melancholy, he was mild and of a gentle disposition; the captain tells you that British spirits make sailors mad; whether he had been drinking that night does not appear, he talked like a madman, on the Sunday night; he had been drinking in that house only two or three pots of porter with five or six people, not sufficient to intoxicate him; but whether he had been drinking before this does not appear; therefore it is for you to form your judgment; if you think that when he was sober and free from liquor, he knew what he was about, and was capable of discerning right from wrong (and the captain tells you he was) then it is no excuse at all that he got drunk. Whoever gets drunk, and commits a crime, it does not excuse him at all; he is still answerable for it, in consideration of the law. If you think when he was in his sober senses, he certainly was accountable for what he did; then, when he was intoxicated, he voluntarily brought upon himself that infanity, in which he committed this rash action; on the other hand, if you think whether drunk or sober, he was equally unaccountable for his actions, you must acquit him.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, the gentlemen wish to know of the keeper, how his conduct has been since he has been in custody?</p>
               <p>Court. Why I enquired that, before I put him on his trial; but the keeper shall tell you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. Mr. Villette has had more conversation with him than any body.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Villette sent for.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. I have heard nothing of that sort; since he has been with me, he generally kept his room.</p>
               <p>Mr. VILLETTE sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. The Jury wish to be informed by you, Sir, how the conduct of this man has appeared to you, when you conversed with him? - Why, I really thought him insane; at one time he gave a very odd account of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120011"/>men and boys following him down Ratcliffe-highway; I asked him for what; he said he thought they wanted to rob him; I asked him how he came to commit such a horrid offence; he said he picked up this girl, and went into the house with her, and got into bed; and he desired her to get into bed, but she did not; and she said to him, you will not want your shoes and stockings any more; and he thought he heard men and boys at the door, and that before that, men and boys had chaced him down Ratcliffe-high-way, and they accused him of house-breaking.</p>
               <p>Had he the appearance to you at that time of a man disordered in his mind? - That odd account struck me; at first I thought him perfectly in his senses, but that account appeared odd to me, I could not conceive why men and boys should chace him down Ratcliffe-highway.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to have always turned upon that by the evidence.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you frequently converse with him during his confinement? - I have talked with him two or three times; this was the second time; I sat down some time; he confessed he had killed the girl, and that was the account he gave.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. He never had the appearance of a man counterfeiting madness by your account? - No, he never had.</p>
               <p>- PITT sworn.</p>

               <p>Have you had any conversation with this unfortunate man since he has been committed? - Very little.</p>
               <p>Has he at all times had the appearance of a man in his perfect senses, or has he at any time had a different appearance? - I can say very little to that; he has kept very close in his ward; but he came out once, and wanted to speak to me; I asked him what he wanted; he said he wanted me to lend him three guineas; I said that was what I never did to any prisoner; the man has been very comical at times, very much by himself, and seemed rather indifferent about the matter; at one time he told me, if he had not served them so, they would have served him the same; but that one of the women ran away, or else he should have served her the same.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for some time, and returned with a verdict</p>

            , you stand in a miserable situation, being convicted of one of the greatest crimes that human nature can commit; you have taken away the life of an innocent and unoffending fellow-creature, in a manner, accompanied with a degree of savage fierceness, that is without example; it does not appear that you received any provocation whatever from the unfortunate victim of your brutal rage; what motive therefore can have instigated your mind to the commission of so cruel and atrocious an act, is at present unexplained to the Court; but by your own intemperance, you have brought yourself into that state of mind, and inflamed with liquor, you have been guilty of this cruel act; the law rightly provides that you must answer for that offence, and will not suffer any person to derive an excuse from their own intemperance and folly. It therefore becomes my duty to follow up the verdict of the Jury, by pronouncing upon you the dreadful sentence of the law, which is, that you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence, on Wednesday next, to the place of execution, there to to be hanged by the neck, until you be dead; and that your body be afterwards delivered to the surgeons, to be dissected and anatomized, pursuant to the statute; and the Lord have mercy on your guilty soul.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120012"/>But from the circumstances of the case, which were by the learned Judge submitted to the consideration of the Jury, though they have been of opinion, that in point of saw, under the right direction of that learned Judge, they were under a necessity of finding you guilty, the Court will respite the execution of your sentence, till his Majesty's pleasure shall be further known.</p>

               <p>Jury. It was the unanimous request of the Jury, if your lordship's goodness had not anticipated it, to have recommended it, as particularly necessary, that an enquiry should be made into the state of the man's mind before execution.</p>

I said no; he said nor I; he went out; I looked after him; I thought he had something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120013"/>in his pocket, and at the same time he ran, before he got ten yards from the coffee-room; there is a long passage; I took him directly; he was not out of my sight till I took him; he ran as hard as he could; and I followed as hard as I could; he went a little way in the street, about thirty yards, and he dropped his hat; he took no notice, that made me pursue him with more vigor.</p>
               <p>Did he stop to take up his hat? - No; I was coming rather close to him; I cried murder, and stop thief, thinking that would ring in the ears of the people; just as he got to the middle of Charing Cross, near the statue, he put his right hand in his pocket, and made a rattling, and flung the tankard down in the street; I saw him do it; I ran and took up the tankard, and still pursued him with the same cry as before; just as he got very near the Spring-garden Coffee-house, a man came out and opened his arms, and took him; his name is Anderson.</p>

            25. 18.)</p>
               <p>Carns. This is the tankard; I have cleaned it many times.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my property; it was the property of Aaron Young, who died, and left it to his wife, and she was my wife's aunt, and left it to me, and some more property; I believe the figures 25, 18, mean the ounces; but I know the tankard perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long Mr. Young had his tankard you do not know? - No, Sir, his widow kept the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>It came to your wife as a legacy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell what it cost at first? - No.</p>
               <p>It is an old tankard? - So it shews on its face.</p>
               <p>What is the lowest value you would set upon that? consider it is a capital charge. - The Gentlemen of the Jury can judge better.</p>
               <p>But we are to hear your evidence? - The value I put upon it was five pounds; there is but one value for old silver, that will sell for nothing else.</p>
               <p>I should be glad to know what you value it at, as it affects his life? - I should be glad to recommend him to every lenity from the Jury; I suppose it cannot be worth less than three or two pounds.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, to be sure of the thing, rather than rest on supposition only, you might think it less than two pounds? - You may call it if you please one pound.</p>
               <p>We must have some value from you, the law requires it? - Then value it at twenty shillings; and I recommend also to the Jury to shew every lenity.</p>
               <p>Court. Old silver receives a certain value at goldsmith's shops; I suppose they would give you five shillings an ounce, or five shillings and four-pence? - I believe they would thereabouts.</p>
               <p>You have not weighed it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the Jury will form their judgment how many ounces it weighs.</p>

               <p>My Lord, to deny the fact would be very horrid; at the same time I leave myself entirely to your mercy; at the time the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120014"/>fact was committed, which my witnesses will prove, I was very much intoxicated, or else no man in the world could attempt to do a thing of the kind, to put a tankard in his pocket where there was forty or fifty people in the room; as such I leave myself entirely to your mercy; I never was guilty of such a crime before; I never was at the house before in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you observe that the prisoner was in liquor? - I did not perceive any signs of it indeed.</p>
               <p>Jury to Carns, the waiter. Did you discover any marks of intoxication at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness in Court, who is the keeper of Tothill-fields, who can prove that I was so much intoxicated, that I even fell out of the coach as they carried me to prison, and that I did not know I was in prison till the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think that will be of any use to you; if you was to prove that you was ever so much intoxicated; because an honest man, if he was ever so drunk, would not steal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Very just, my Lord.</p>

I leaned over, and she hove up her elbow, and I saw the card of lace slide from under her arm; I did not see it under her arm, I only saw it slide down; this is the card; she was a great deal more composed than I was; we sent for a constable, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that card was one of those that were in the shop before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mrs. Pudner, how far from the door was this woman standing, at the time she was cheapening the lace? - It may be a yard.</p>
               <p>Your's is a narrow shop; is not it? - Not very broad.</p>
               <p>She was looking towards the door to look at the lace? - She turned to the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120015"/>That is the best situation of examining any commodity that is in your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After that she returned three pieces into the box, and you thought she had four? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was then talking about the price of one? - Yes, when I looked at her, I saw the lace slip down.</p>
               <p>I believe you found afterwards that she had been buying some other commodity at Mr. Lee's, your neighbour? - Yes, she said she had been at the next door to enquire for lace; that I found to be true of Mr. Lee; I never saw her before in my life to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>At the time you was serving her, Mr. Pudner was there, and your niece? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said she had a long sattin cloak on with arm holes in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you talked of some motion that was natural enough? - Yes, it might.</p>
               <p>You have recently before lost a good deal of property? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street, I was on the Brentford road on the 27th of November, in the evening; I heard of a robbery done that night; I went out of that road into another, and apprehended the prisoner in the Uxbridge road, at Knotting-hill turnpike; I searched him there, when I got him from the horse on the ground; and in his right-hand coat pocket I found a loaded pistol and this bunch of hair, and this piece of black silk, and a purse; and I found a small key in his waistcoat pocket, which he said belonged to the chest he had in his lodgings; he would not tell me where he lodged, and I did not know; when he was examined before Sir Sampson Wright, the next day, the gentleman where he lodged came down; his name is Little, he is here; and one Hughes went to his lodgings on Wednesday; I went with Little and unlocked a chest with the key which I found in the prisoner's waistcoat pocket; Little lived the top of Titchfield-street, Marybone.</p>
               <p>Did it open easily? - Yes; it was a deal box or chest, about a yard and a half long; there was a little till at one end of it, which I opened, and found this seal; when he was examined again, the seal was brought before Sir Sampson Wright, and the prisoner was present; he said he had bought the seal, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Recollect Sir, it is very material, do not say more than you are sure of; did he appear to know any thing of the seal, or did he appear to be ignorant of it? - He said it was his own seal.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that positively? - I will not say it positively; I think to the best of my recollection, I cannot be sure whether he said it was his own seal; I will not swear it.</p>

             coming to my house, the prisoner was not with him; I was with him when he unlocked the box, which was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120017"/>the second or third time he came; I saw him take out several things, I cannot say what they were; I saw him take a seal out, but I cannot describe it.</p>
               <p>Did the box belong to the prisoner? - It was brought into our house, and I should look upon it to belong to him; the prisoner himself brought it in, and I helped him with it up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did the woman live with him all the time? - Yes, and behaved very well in our house.</p>
               <p>In what capacity did she appear? - There was nothing disorderly, they behaved like gentlefolks.</p>
               <p>By what name did she pass? - I do not know any thing of that; she was always called the lady, and he Mr. Fitzroy.</p>
               <p>What sort of hours did the prisoner keep? - Very good hours, he was always at home almost, very seldom out; he behaved like a gentleman at my house.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the 23d of November last? - I cannot say I recollect the night; one night the gentleman was out late, but it was not very late.</p>

               <p>What do you call very late? - I believe it might be half an hour after eleven, or near twelve.</p>

               <p>How long was that before he was taken up? - I cannot say exactly; it was the latter end of the week before.</p>
               <p>How many days? - I cannot positively assert the day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner Looking's Counsel. You say this gentleman and lady lived together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You supposed them to be man and wife? - I had no reason to think to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Did they go by the same name? - He went by the name of Fitzroy, and she was called the lady; I understood her to be his spouse of course.</p>
               <p>You say before you saw this seal, that this man who lives in Bow-street had been two or three times at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was not there at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they ever pretend to be married? - I can say nothing to that.</p>
               <p>Did they ever say they were married, or did they pass for man and wife? - When people live together, and of course lay together, your lordship must be as good a judge as me of that; it is impossible I can know that, I will not pretend to say, because I know not; it was never mentioned whether they were man and wife or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wentworth. Please to ask this witness whether he ever saw any improper or suspicious people come to see me during the time I was at his lodging? - I never had no such thought about me, but he behaved like a gentleman, and paid his way like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Was it me that took your lodgings or not? - I know not which; they gave me half a crown, I do not know whether it was given by you or the lady; my wife took it, not me; I was not in the room Mr. Wentworth.</p>

               <p>(Deposed to by the Prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you had the seal? - I do not know, may be not more than three years; I can swear positively to them both; I described them before I saw the watch particularly; my watch is so very remarkable, that perhaps there is not one in the whole Court like it; among the engravings in the brass work, on the edge of the cock of the watch, is my name engraved.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have not you seen that a very common impression among the Wedgwood seals; it is a very common impression I know? - I never saw any of them.</p>
               <p>Court. There are a great many of them; is the engraver here that made the seal? - No, he is dead.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Wentworth, would you say any thing? - I wish to ask Mr. Maynard a question, (be so good to stand up) whether Mr. Maynard, or those that went there to search the box, knew any thing of the box, till I freely told them about it the next morning?</p>
               <p>Maynard. I was not there that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then Macmanus was there: I really knew nothing of the seal being in my box; if I had I would not have told them; this person who lived along with me, had a key of the box as well as me; she has freely acknowledged that I did not give her the watch; Mr. Lewer has not said that I robbed him; I only thrust that those paragraphs that have appeared publicly against me, in the papers, may not have any effect on the minds of the Jury; I have been ranked among the most notorious of offenders; and I wish that any person that has published those paragraphs against me, would now come forth like a man.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. How was the person dressed that robbed you? - In a drab coloured great coat.</p>
               <p>Was it such a coat as that? - I have one like it myself.</p>
               <p>Was it of that colour? - It was much like it.</p>

               <p>Did she say there was anybody present at the time? - No; I do not recollect she did; they gave her a week from Friday or Saturday till Wednesday, to find out the man, but no man was produced.</p>

             for a defence; I do it on the authority of the Court; I myself was counsel in a prosecution against some men of notorious bad character, and that case had great weight with me, coming from the authority which it did; it was the case of a haberdasher, Mr. Nott, there were four men principles, and two women were indicted as accessaries; upon the evidence it turned out, that these two women were living with two of the prisoners as mistresses, avowedly so, in the character of single women; the things were found in the women's apartments; Mr. Justice Buller directed the Jury to acquit the women; for he said, that what they did was under the coercion of the men: now, my Lord, in this case, the evidence stands thus: that they took this lodging together; that they lived together as man and wife, without giving any person any reason to the contrary, therefore she was under his control at the time she came with the goods, which, if she did receive from him, she received while under his control and coercion; it would not justify her in the original act of the robbery, that I am very willing to allow, but she has no right to question the actions of that person to whom she looks up for assistance; on whom she depends; whose servant she is; who has power to compel her to do things at times from fear, she cannot resist his commands; she takes them under those circumstances; it would be hard to call that a felonious receiving from a woman who has not the power to resist; there is the same control existing here that there was these; therefore I hope the same reason will produce the same effect.</p>
               <p>Court. In the case you mention, there was a clear ground of acquittal; there were four men principals; there were two women lived with the principals; they took the stolen goods, and went and pawned and sold them; it is immaterial which; it did not appear from any single circumstance, that they knew they were stolen; but the case here is very different; for, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120020"/>this case, the woman comes with a false story to the pawnbrokers, and says, she lives in such a place, and gives a false description of her lodgings; as to the principle you mention of coercion, no person but a wife is intitled to that protection; as to a mistress she is not intitled to that protection; she cannot plead any coercion; she was at full liberty; she might have gone to a Justice of peace.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Perryn. I was on the Rota at the time the indictment was tried, which Mr. Knowlys mentions, with respect to the burglary that was committed in King-street: with respect to the circumstance he mentions, I have not any accurate recollection or memory of what passed on that occasion; but I have some faint recollection, that under the circumstances of that case, Mr. Justice Buller was of opinion, that the property being brought to the lodgings, which were the lodgings of the men as well as the women; they were considered only as inhabitants in the place, and that it was not a case within the provision of the legislature, as accessories after the fact, for this place was considered as the lodging house of the men; and the goods were brought there, and deposited there; and the women had nothing to do with the business; now, according to my idea of this case, the Jury will consider of it, and my brother will state to them his opinion of it; this seems to me to be a case of a similar nature: for this woman lived with this man; the person who let the lodgings to them considered them as man and wife; they cohabited as man and wife; if a man goes out on the high way, and brings home a watch, and desires a man to pawn it, the legislature never meant that was the case of a receiver of stolen goods; because the receivers are more atrociously guilty than those who steal; this case appears to me to be this, that this woman, whether wife or not, he desired her to go and dispose of the watch; according to the idea I have of it, and she is entitled to the protection of a wife in my apprehension.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you known her for the last year or two? - No, I cannot say I have; she lived a servant with me three years, and I had no reason to doubt her during that time; her sister lived with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then so far as honesty has been concerned, she has been a very good girl? - Yes, I have no reason to doubt it; her father and brother have lived in that farm, and the family of them, near a hundred years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Wilkinson called another witness, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. The coercion, there can be no pretence for it; a married woman who commits larceny, in company with her husband, is excused; but that never was in this country extended to any mistress or concubine; but the rule of law is directly contrary; and even in the case of a wife, she must be under the immediate coercion of her husband.</p>

               <p>I was robbed on the 27th of November last; I was returning to town about five in the evening; I was stopped by a single highwayman, and robbed of a metal watch, about a quarter of a mile before I reached Hounslow; I was in a post-chaise with two ladies, Mrs. Hurst, and Mrs. Grundy; we were coming from Slough.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner; can you swear to him being the person? - No; the man appeared to me to have a great coat on, and to be a tall, thin man.</p>
               <p>Do you know the colour of that great coat? - It appeared to me to be a drab.</p>
               <p>Was it light? - No, I cannot say it was.</p>
               <p>Had he any disguise on his face? - I did not perceive it.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot speak of the person that robbed you? - By no means; the person I saw at Sir Sampson Wright's, which was the present prisoner, appeared to me to be a very different man to the man that robbed me, and I noticed it at the time; there was a Wedgwood seal, and on it a device of Hercules; I think there was a steel chain and key; I have seen my watch since; one of the patrol produced it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You say you was robbed by a single highwayman, and in your judgment the prisoner is a different person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was the Hounslow road? - Yes, according to my idea at that time, for I put my head out of the window after the person left me, and his horse seemed to be a very dark chesnut or black.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the patrol in Bow-street, that go from Hyde-park-corner to Brentford; on the 27th of November I set out, and a post-boy informed me a gentleman and lady in his post-chaise, had been robbed an hour before on Hounslow-heath; this was about six; I went to the chaise, and the gentleman let down the glass; he said, he had been robbed by a single highwayman, a lusty man; he had on a drab coat, and something black over his face; he said, he lost a metal watch; a steel chain and wedgwood seal tipped with silver; that gentleman was Mr. Hurst, the prosecutor; I took his name at that time, and where he lived; after they gave me the description of the horse, I went away; and after waiting some time about half after seven, within a few yards of the turnpikegate, a man came and called gate; I bade the man be careful in opening the gate; I went to the gate; he kept his distance, and seeing the prisoner at the bar answer the description, and the horse exactly, I stopped him and searched him; as I attempted to apprehend him, at that time, he turned his mare's head round from me, and put his left hand down in a great hurry to his waistcoat pocket, and flung his arm a great way from him; I said immediately, Sir, you have thrown something; I found in his right-hand pocket this pistol, and a black silk, and a bunch of hair, and a purse; I cannot say what he flung from him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you search to see if any thing was found in the road? - When I searched him, not finding a watch, I said, Sir, you have thrown a watch away; upon my honour, says he, I have not; I put him into custody, and searching with a lanthorn, I found a metal watch at some distance from him.</p>

               <p>Are there holes for the eyes in that silk? - Yes; nothing was in the purse; in his waistcoat pocket I found a guinea, two half guineas, and four shillings in silver; nothing more than what I have mentioned upon him; we then took him to London, and put him in the watch-house till the next morning, and took him before Sir Sampson Wright; he was examined that day and committed.</p>
               <p>Did you produce that watch at Sir Sampson's? - Yes, it has been in my custody ever since; it was the same that I found over the pales.</p>
               <p>Was that at such a distance that he might have thrown it in the manner you have described? - Certainly, my Lord, being on horseback.</p>
               <p>In your judgment was not that at a greater distance than what he might effect by throwing his hand from his horse? - He stood up and threw his arm very strong; I observed where the arm extended to, made me point that way; then I charged him with having thrown a watch away, not having one upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am very glad you did not hear Mr. Hurst's examination, there is so great a difference, I shall ask you but a very few questions; what road was this that you took this man in? - The Uxbridge road, an hour and half after the robbery.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was it? - It was a light chesnut horse, with a hunter's tail.</p>
               <p>The gentleman did not swear to him at Sir Sampson's? - I understood that he swore to him; I mean that he swore to his watch there.</p>
               <p>That introduces one question; how much all you get by the conviction of this man? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>I knew that would be the answer exactly; how long have you been employed as an officer in Bow-street? - Pretty near five years.</p>
               <p>And you cannot tell what you would get by the conviction of that man? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120024"/>Court to Maynard. Tell me exactly the description the prosecutor gave you? - He told me it was a lusty man in a light drab coat, buttoned up to his chin; that he had a round hat on, and something black over his face; he said he did not see his features.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any further description? - He said he thought it was a chesnut horse, and had a hunter's tail.</p>
               <p>Did he say it was a dark chesnut? - He thought it was of a dark colour.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to ask Mr. Hurst some further questions: does the prisoner wish Mr. Hurst to withdraw now?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no such wish.</p>
               <p>He gave no further description? - Only told me what he had lost, a metal watch with a steel chain, and describing every particular; and the lady her purse.</p>
               <p>Did he mention the maker of the watch? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>When you apprehended this man at the turnpike gate, was it light enough for you to distinguish his face? - It was a very moonlight night, indeed; the moon had been up for two hours, or an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. At the time of the robbery the moon was not up, it was about five o'clock.</p>

               <p>What kind of horse was it? - A chesnut cropt mare, with a white face.</p>
               <p>Had he always hired the horses of you in October, by the name of Fitzroy? - Yes, always; I did not know where he lived, he did not say particularly where he was going, neither did I ask him, he hired it for the day, and mounted it between twelve and one; the horse was never brought back to my stable, till I brought it from Sir Sampson's people; I saw it in possession of one of Sir Sampson's people.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was a light chesnut mare, and with a white face? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Was the mare you saw at Sir Sampson Wright's servant's the same you let to the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Maynard. Was you present when that mare was shewn to the last witness Dunn? - I shewed it myself.</p>
               <p>Was that the same mare that the prisoner was riding at the turnpike gate? - It was.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw the mare, it was shewn to me; I was much surprised to see the mare so different in colour.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the patrol; on Tuesday the 27th, Mr. Hurst gave us information that he had been robbed by a man in a drab coat and a chesnut horse, and a blaze in his face, a bald face, a kind of a white in his face; Maynard and me crossed over into the Uxbridge road, and waited at Kensington gravel-pits turnpike, and about half past seven, the highwayman, as we supposed, according to the description, came up; Maynard went up to the gate, I followed him; just as he was going to seize him, he threw something away; Maynard said, take care, he has thrown something away; I saw his arm go, but I cannot say I saw any thing go out of his hand; we pulled him off the horse on his back, on the ground; I held him while Maynard searched him; Maynard found in his right-hand pocket a pistol, a piece of black silk, and a purse; and in his other pocket, he found some money; I searched the left side, but found nothing there, and I took this whip out of his hand; we went into the turnpike house, and he took this drab coat off his back; after that we got a candle and lanthorn, and searched about, and Maynard brought in a watch that he said he found on the ground; I was in a hog-sty at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120025"/>time I did not see it found; we said it answered the description that Mr. Hurst gave us, with a Wedgwood seal.</p>
               <p>(The watch shewn to Mr. Hurst.)</p>
               <p>Jury. What sort of a night was it? - Why it was not very light; it was half past seven; it was not wet at all.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - Why I think it was rather moon-light; I am not quite sure of the night; it was not dark.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to see any thing go from the prisoner's hand? - I was rather behind Maynard, I saw his arm go.</p>
               <p>(The watch and seals shewn to the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe this is my watch, and seals, and chain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Hughes. You are employed by Bow-street? - Yes, I am partner with Maynard.</p>
               <p>He does not know what he shall have for the conviction of this man; perhaps you do not know? - Conviction! Sir; it is our duty; we do not think of conviction. Grant is another patrol; he proves nothing more than catching the horse.</p>

               <p>What kind of horse was it? - A chesnut horse; it was the same that was afterwards carried to Sir Sampson's, and shewed to Mr. Hurst.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was there when Mr. Hurst was quite astonished to see this horse was not the one he told you: he was quite astonished to see this horse; did not he tell you so? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say; I have no witnesses to call at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hurst. My Lord, I beg pardon for interrupting; but I never told the guard that he was a stout lusty man; I always held this language, that he was a tall, thin man, nor did I ever say he had any thing over his face; but that I judged there might be something, because I could not see his features.</p>

            ; and when he came I called the prisoner into the parlour, and said, Rachel, I am very sorry I have to speak to you on the subject I am going to do; she says, what is that? I said, I have reason to suspect you are dishonest; says she, what makes you think so? I never took any thing that was your's in my life; I said, I have reason to think that you have; says she, who has told you any thing? I said, it is no matter who has told me any thing; I have reason to suspect it, and I am sure you have, and I must insist now on looking into your box, which she seemingly readily complied with; we went to go up stairs; the young woman ran to go before, I called to her, Rachel, stop; let us all go up together; she readily unlocked her box, and the first thing that were presented to view, were the two sauce boats; she was going to take them out; I took the things out of the box, and gave them to the officer; my wife owned the things that were her property, and they were given to the beadle; he has them now in his possession; when all the things were taken out of the box, we came down into the dining-room; I wrote down on a piece of paper the different articles the girl had taken; then the beadle took them into his possession, and the girl to the watch-house; when the prisoner went before the Justice, she signed a paper, and made her mark to it.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said to her before she put her mark to that writing? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Was any promise of any kind made to her? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Any threat? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Was it read to her? - It was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120032"/>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Who guided her hand to make the mark? - The clerk.</p>
               <p>The woman did not know what was doing? - She heard what was read over; it was read very distinctly, and in the presence of the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Had not you said before that, come, Rachel, confess all, and you shall not be hurt? - I never said any such thing. (Shewn to him.) I swear I saw her mark it.</p>
               <p>And you can swear that is the paper you saw her make her mark to? - I can.</p>
               <p>Did you witness it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Is not that your hand writing there? - It is not here.</p>
               <p>You said you witnessed it just now? - No; I did not say I set my hand to it.</p>
               <p>What is there particular in her mark? - A cross.</p>
               <p>You know her mark pretty well if I am not misinstructed? - On the other side there is my own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Were the very words taken down? - It was put down that she acknowledged to the things; I cannot particularly say, whether the Justice signed that or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So this young woman had lived five or six months in your family? Yes.</p>
               <p>And she came to you with a very good character; and kept it till the good woman was in the straw? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>That is a time when good servants, pretty ones particularly, lose their characters, and at that time you began to have a little matter of suspicion? - I was uneasy in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Of course there was a nurse in the house? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>The nurse is always a gossip; did not the nurse tell some nonsensical stories about you and Rachel; it was very natural for the master and Rachel to have slanderous things said of them when the good woman laid in? - I do not know I am sure, I am sure I do not.</p>
               <p>Indeed you do? - I insist upon it I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not be positive; there was a new guinea of a new coinage received in the shop while the good woman was in the straw? - Very probable; my shop is a retail shop.</p>
               <p>Did not the nurse say, that Rachel had that new guinea? - Not that I know of; I never heard any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Did not the nurse say it? - I know it is not true.</p>
               <p>But they will say things of poor women; that you and Rachel were walking arm in arm in Covent Garden together? - I never heard of any such thing.</p>
               <p>In a word, did not the nurse tell some nonsensical stories that made the good woman a little matter jealous? - There was an uneasiness in my mind.</p>
               <p>No curtain lectures about it? - Nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>When you got Rachel into the parlour, did not you say, if you will confess you shall not be hurt? - I never said such a syllable, nor such a word, nor a word like it.</p>
               <p>Where were these things kept that you found? - They were kept in a row where my wife was.</p>
               <p>In the room where she lay in? - Certainly, the most part.</p>
               <p>In what part of the room? - There was a chest of drawers and another large chest in the room.</p>
               <p>The nurse in course was pretty generally in that room? - She was frequently there.</p>
               <p>Were these things there when your wife was brought to bed? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>But Rachel, till the down-laying bore a very good character? - Yes; she did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did that young woman ever hint anything of that sort before? - Never; I mean to say, that I never heard such a thing mentioned till now in this court.</p>

               <p>Then it was no mark for you in laying the things there again? - No; I laid the things as near as I could in the same place; I went by a mark of a hole in the hedge; the prisoner came about half after six and removed the oystershell.</p>
               <p>Was he alone? - Yes; he came into the ditch directly; it was a dry ditch, and took hold of the black bag and lifted it up, and then caught hold of the white; and threw the black bag on one side, and took up the white bag; he had not gone above two yards before I caught him.</p>
               <p>Had he put it on his shoulders, or what did he do? - I cannot be positive; when I laid hold of him, he cried out, Lord have mercy upon me, what shall I do; I said, we have got him safe enough; he said nothing till we had got to the prosecutor's, then he said there was nobody concerned with him.</p>
               <p>What did he say about himself? - Going over the fields by Mary-le-bone workhouse, he said, it would not touch his neck, on less it belonged to the dwelling-house, or joined to the dwelling-house, but now he was sure of going to Botany-bay.</p>

               <p>How long have you lodged at this house? - About a month.</p>
               <p>How long had the prisoners lodged there? - All that time, and a long time before, I believe; I lived in the same man's rents, but I did not think the house was so bad till I came to it; a poor man cannot always get a lodging when he will.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Randall. How could he see through the crack of the door, and if he knew this man was going to be robbed, why did not he come in to his assistance? - I saw it through a hole I could put my thumb through; there are two holes; I should have got knocked on the head if I had gone in.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the house after this supposed robbery? - I lodge in the house now; the women have not been seen there since.</p>

               <p>MARGERET JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came to our house with an old lady that she had lodging with; her name is Duffey; and she asked me if I wanted two silver spoons; she said they were in pawn at Mr. Dixon's; they were pawned singly for eighteen pence a piece; I gave the old lady half a crown and sixpence to fetch them; and she went and brought them.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Duffey pretend to have any interest in these spoons? - No; I had a child in my lap; and she said she would fetch them; the prisoner said she was very much distressed; I have seen her up and down our Court; but never knew any thing of her; the prisoner said they were her property; I asked her, three times over, if they were her own, and she said yes; she said she would take 4 s. for them; and I gave her a shilling more than the half-crown and the six-pence. (The spoons deposed to by the mark R. E. T.) I am very sure they are mine; these are the spoons I missed a day or two after she was gone.</p>

               <p>I have a stall; and sell fish in Oxford-road; I lost cod fish at different times; on the 16th of November I lost two cod fish, the prisoner is the man that took them; I took them from him; I was a good distance from him, giving a gentleman change for a guinea; I saw the prisoner at the stall; the man went from the stall; and these three fish were gone; I pursued him, and asked him if he was on the other side of the way? no, says he; he gave me bad language; says I, I think you are the very man I saw taking the fish; two gentlemen came, and we laid hold of him, and found the two large fish in his breast; I could distinguish them to be my own property; I bought them the same day; not six minutes before I saw the man taking them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure you saw him taking the fish from your stall? - Yes; he owned them himself at the Justice's.</p>

               <p>Court. How long have you been in this country? - About five years; I came from New York; I am servant to Mr. Culliford's; I remember bringing some shop goods to the prosecutor's, I carried a piece of cloth, I do not justly know what it was, I carried them, it was linen cloth, that was on the 30th of November; I found it on Mr. Longman's stairs.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Longman? - A musical instrument maker in Cheapside; I go up some stairs to Mr. Culliford's shop; it is a shop where he finishes instruments of music; when I found it, I threw it into a packing case, and went up stairs, and acquainted the men; and in about three minutes afterwards, I carried it up stairs into the shop where the men was at work; they advised me to leave it till the next day, to hear if it was enquired for; it was not enquired for, so I took it down to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120043"/>Hussey's, that is next door; I do not know how it came there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Messrs. Longman and Brodrip employ a great many men in their trade? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Their house adjoins to Messrs. Hussey's and Witter's? - Yes; there is a church-yard at the back of both houses; there is a back court between his house and the warehouse; the court runs between the two front houses and the warehouses.</p>
               <p>Is there any difficulty in getting from Mr. Longman's warehouse to Mr. Hussey's warehouse? - I cannot say about that, there is no back way to go, he might go down the trap door where they put the linen, if he liked to jump down.</p>

               <p>Did you tell him it would be better for him or worse for him? - Nothing of that kind; I accused him of putting the long lawn in that situation; he at first deny'd it; I told him it was of no use to deny it, I knew it was a fact; he very suddenly confessed it, and Mr. Longman was by, he said he did take it, with intention for Mr. Longman's servant to take it away at night; that Mr. Longman's servant,

               <p>Then it was a conclusion of the same transaction; it was an inquiry into more goods, the property of Mr. Hussey? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>You say, that after some time he confessed; how was that some time employed? - It was after it was known in the family.</p>
               <p>Was not it said, why you know you have confessed? - I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Try and bring your recollection a little back; because these mens lives are at stake. - That time was employed by Mr. Hussey's son saying he knew them to be their property.</p>
               <p>And adding to it, therefore it is no use your denying in it? - I did not hear him threaten him; he charged him with bringing the goods there, in a very pointed manner, several times, which he denied.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear it would be as well to confess? - He was charged with it very pointedly, and after that he confessed it, I do not recollect conversation about his having confessed any thing else.</p>

               <p>You deal very largely? - Yes; he confessed that he took it at two different times.</p>
               <p>What is the prime-cost value of any one piece of those that was found? - More than I have charged, it is charged at forty-two shillings.</p>
               <p>I ask you what any one thing, in the state in which it was found, was worth? - That piece of long lawn that was found on the stairs cost upwards of two guineas, I mean to say it cost me upwards of two guineas.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - Sometime.</p>
               <p>How long? - Several months.</p>

               <p>I was robbed the 9th of November last at the bottom of Queen-street; six men came down Queen-street and pushed at me, and one of them run against me, and drew my watch out of my pocket; it was a silver watch, with a steel chain, and two glass seals and a metal key; the prisoners were two of the men.</p>

               <p>How long were they coming up to you and pushing you at the time they took your watch; how much time did it take up? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a long time; they might have done it in much less time I should think; will you venture to swear, that in the course of a quarter of an hour, when they were shoving you about, that you can swear to their persons so as to know them again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you observe which of the six it was that pulled your watch out of your pocket? - Yes; I caught hold of him; it was the prisoner M'Carty, the man in the blue jacket; the first time I caught hold of him I got the watch from him.</p>

               <p>And on such occasions every body was shoving here and there, and so on? - Yes.</p>

               <p>And they told you, though you lost your watch, if there was no force and no shoving about, there would be no reward; but if there was, there would? - They did not say so.</p>
               <p>What did they say? - They said, if you are sure of the men, I did say, I am sure of one of the men that took the watch from me; then they said, I should consider about it; and I should not swear any thing more than what was true; that was the thief-taker.</p>

               <p>Has that watch been in your possession ever since? - Yes, it is in the same state it was when I received it.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I know it by the seals; there is no particular mark on the watch itself; there is a blue glass in one, and a green glass in the other; on the blue seal there are three lions, and on the other side there is a man; and on the other, there is a freemason's seal; I lost that day such a watch, and such a chain, and such seals; I swear they are the same that was taken out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>When the prisoner M'Carty, according to your account, had taken the watch out of your pocket, what became of it? - He took it out, and I saw it hang in his hand; he gave the watch through his right hand, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120048"/>the prisoner Hartman; afterwards it was found on the ground.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards was it taken up? - It was found directly; I do not know who it was that found it.</p>
               <p>From whom did you receive it, Mr. Freeman? - Freeman. As I had hold of the prisoner Hartman, I heard the watch drop; I could not stoop myself, therefore another hand picked it up; the prosecutor had the other fast, and the prisoner Hartman's hand was clinched; the moment Roberts laid hold of him on one side, I laid hold of him on the other; at that moment the watch dropped and the glass broke; I did not see M'Carty; I know nothing of him.</p>

               <p>Then you are the common runner of an office? - Yes, Sir, I am a constable.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a runner belonging to that office? - Two years and a half.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, you have had no conversation with the prosecutor, Mr. Harman, about any reward? - No.</p>
               <p>This man is not forthcoming that picked up the watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any body gave any instructions for this indictment? - I gave the instructions; we were all together; I gave the instructions to the clerk, and he took it.</p>
               <p>In writing? - In writing.</p>
               <p>Who wrote it? - I believe Roberts wrote it; I am not sure whether I wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>For a highway robbery? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>I dare say, as you are only a late constable, since May last, you know nothing about rewards? - Yes, I do very well; I know this, that in case the men are convicted, the county certainly are to pay that sum.</p>
               <p>And you are to have your share of that sum? - Most undoubtedly; I know no other way of doing it but as a capital offence.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - Yes, I do swear so.</p>
               <p>How often have you attended here? - I have attended here, I suppose these four or five years.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know, if these men are only convicted of stealing without force, it would not be capital, and there will be no reward? - I saw the force, I told my Lord Mayor so, and I put my hand up to my breast at the time; that I have sworn to-day is the same; if the men were to be acquitted of the force, there would be no reward; but I saw the force committed: I do not come here to talk about the reward, I come here to speak the truth of the robbery; I know this, that if I indict a person, I should indict him the right way.</p>
               <p>I desire an answer to my question; do not you know that, if these men were not indicted for a highway robbery, there would be no reward? - No, to be sure there would not.</p>
               <p>If they were indicted for a simple larceny there would not? - No, not for ten-pence.</p>
               <p>Ten-pence! what do you mean by ten-pence? - Did not you say simple larceny.</p>
               <p>I did not say perit larceny; now Mr. Freeman, if he was indicted for privately stealing, there would be no reward? - I saw the robbery committed.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTS sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 9th of November I was going down to the bottom of Queen-street; there was a mob of people assembled together, and I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner contending with each other; I asked what was the matter; and the prosecutor immediately, said, he had lost his watch; I immediately pulled Hartman out of the crowd; Freeman came and assisted; and we took him up to a public-house; the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120049"/>followed us, and said it was his watch; I did not see the watch taken up; I did not see the other prisoner there; he was taken before the Lord Mayor, and the prosecutor swore positively to him; he said he was not the man who took the watch out of his pocket; but it was another man shorter than him; and he should know the man if he saw him; and that the man who took it, gave it to Hartman, and that Hartman dropped it as soon as he saw me; this was said in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Court. These men seem to be pretty much of the same size; now, did you see the other man in company with Hartman at this time? - No, I did not; when I saw Hartman, I knew him for some time; I did not look for any body else; I am a person employed by the proprietors of the General Insurance Office, in Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there a great croud? - A great many people there; the first that I observed, that I knew, was Hartman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Roberts, Which of the fire offices do you belong to? - Neither.</p>
               <p>Which office was it that you was talking of? - The General Insurance Office; it is made pretty public now, No. 102, Bank-buildings.</p>
               <p>What are you talking of; do you mean that that is advertised? - Mr. Weller is the proprietor of it, I believe.</p>
               <p>What is your department in that office; treasurer or paymaster? - No, Sir, to apprehend people that commit robberies.</p>
               <p>In plain English, a thief-taker. I suppose the best part of your emolument is the reward? - No, I have a weekly salary; I have heard of the reward as well as other thief-takers; I was employed at Bow-street four or five years ago; I have not been in that capacity for these two years past.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, if you turn your eyes round, you may see some people that knew you at Bow-street: how happened you to quit Bow-street? - I believe it was about a mob or riot that happened at the handsome milliner's in Coventry-street; there was another person of the name of Roberts, and I were there at the same time.</p>
               <p>So you was dismissed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of you wrote the instructions for the bill of indictment? - One Threadway wrote them: I have never talked of the reward to any body.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with Freeman about the reward? - No, not respecting the reward; but we have been speaking about whether they would be convicted.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you never talked to Freeman about the reward? - Yes I do mean to say that never a word but about the apprehending the men; I told the prosecutor no more than I tell the court.</p>
               <p>Have you never had any talk with him about 80 l.? - I do not know that I have; I never said any thing about what he was to say; I told him that if in case he applied to the Court for his expences, I dared say they would allow it him; I never told him of 80 l. I will swear I never talked to Freeman about the reward; I have told him there are rewards paid.</p>
               <p>What reward did you tell him? - I told hiw in case a man was convicted of a highway robbery, there would be a reward of 40 l.</p>
               <p>When did you say that? - I cannot say, I might have told him such a thing, but not about these two men, but I will not swear positively; I might.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many people are now accused by you at this time? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, in an objection to the admission of the evidence of Fleming, I will take the liberty of observing that the law, in guarding the innocent, takes care that no man shall be put in peril on the testimony of a suspicious witness, though he may describe all the circumstances that belong to a robbery, he shall not be permitted to say A. B. or C. are partners in his guilt: what is the case of this man? I have not a record of his conviction; and it is only out of his own mouth that I can affect him by incompetency. Then what is the question I ask him - From how many persons now accused by you (confining it to a part, which he himself, by his own confession before a magistrate, has acknowledged); I ask him, from how many persons now accused by you, and against whom you are now received as a witness, have you been in the habit of receiving stolen goods? He has the indemnity of the magistrate, having admitted him as a witness, and he cannot now be prosecuted. My Lord, you have no testimony yet to confirm this man. I admit it is proved that there has been a robbery committed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120053"/>but further you know not; there is not one single circumstance in the evidence that confirms this man, or that at all lets him in; he comes here as an accomplice, and upon what sort of (permit me to ask) tenure? Would any of the best men among us hold our lives, our liberties, or our properties, if such men as Mr. Fleming were to be received as witnesses against us, unconfirmed by more respectable testimony? My Lord, the law has been frequently laid down in the most luminous manner by your lordship; and also by other Judges, that such a witness should not be received against any man. My Lord, he is sent here, he does not come here; your Lordship will not now set a precedent for the first time; I therefore humbly hope, that Mr. Fleming, in the present case, however he may be received in others, in which he may have the good fortune to be confirmed, will be sent away, and his testimony rejected. I humbly hope your lordship will say, we run no risk in this case, in trusting to the baseness, the infamy, the falsity, or malicious testimony, of a man who confesses himself unworthy to live in society.</p>

             makes it his common practice to receive the evidence of an accomplice, in the first instance; other Judges differ from him, and expect there should be ground laid before the evidence of the accomplice is received. I have always followed that mode; but this man does not appear to me in the light of an accomplice. If you examine him on the Voire Dire, you have nothing to do, but to ask him, if he is interested in the matter in question; if he appears to be interested, it is the custom to reject his testimony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do not make him out an accomplice; my objection goes for nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. But even with respect to that objection, this matter was referred to all the Judges; on the very first day of this term, Mr. Justice Buller tried a person for a felony, and he was convicted on the evidence of the accomplice only; he referred the case to the twelve Judges; and the ten Judges that were present were unanimously of opinion, that it only went to his credit, and not to his competency; and that he might be received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Undoubtedly it is in your Lordship's discretion, and it is to me perfectly indifferent, as sure I am no honest man will trust to such a witness.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. You was directed by Fleming to get these things? - Yes; he had been before the magistrate, but he never said a word about these things then; he went with us, and broke open his mother's two doors; we could not get a key; she was not at home, and there he shewed us all this property, and a variety of others.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. I produce a toothpick-case and a silver thimble from Vanderberg; Fleming said he had such things; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120055"/>and asked for them, and they delivered them immediately.</p>

            , the pawnbroker; I gave him six pound ten shillings for them. (Shewn to the prosecutor.) I believe them to be mine; there is no private mark; I lost such articles that night; I have had them two or three years; they had not been used above two or three times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What may you be master Jacobs? - I have been brought up, since I have been fourteen years old, in buying of the pawnbrokers unredeemed goods; I bought them as such.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath then they were represented to you by Fleming, the pawnbroker, as unredeemed goods? - Yes, they were; he did not tell me so; he told me he had a pair of candlesticks and some knives and forks; I bought them from a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Is that true, that you bought them as unredeemed pledges? - To my knowledge I did.</p>
               <p>Were they so represented to you by Fleming as unredeemed pledges? - Yes; by Fleming.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - I do not swear.</p>
               <p>Were they represented to you by Fleming as unredeemed pledges? - Yes; I bought them as unredeemed goods.</p>
               <p>How long have you dealt with Mr. Fleming? - Never but this once; and I bought two watches before of him, that is all the dealings I have had with him since he has been in the shop for himself.</p>
               <p>Have you ever dealt with him except for the articles you have mentioned to-night? - I dealt with him in his master's shop; once for a lot of jewellery; his master was Mr. Wright, in the Armory; them are the three occasions, and the only ones, that I ever dealt with him in my life; nobody christened the watches for me; I never had any christened; they did not go to Holland; the candlesticks I sold to one Mr. Davis, with some watches, who took them to Holland.</p>

               <p>The reason was, because you knew them to be stolen, and was afraid to sell them in England? - I exposed these goods to the whole trade; the watches are here in London; I sold them to Mr. Dobree; they were not christened to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you not to sell these candlesticks? - They were all broke; some holes in the bottom.</p>
               <p>Was the copper beat out? - No; I sold them for old silver; not to go to Holland; the man went to Holland.</p>
               <p>How soon did you sell them to Mr. Davis; after you bought them of Fleming? - A fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did you keep them? - In my house in Adam's Court, Duke's Place.</p>
               <p>Did you keep them till there was a complaint that there had been a robbery at Captain

             was robbed of them.</p>
               <p>Did you sell them till Fleming was in custody at Bow-street? - Yes; I sold them a week before; Fleming did not tell me he was about to be in custody.</p>
               <p>And what day of the month did you sell them? - I believe it was the 2d of December; I bought them the 22d of November, on Thursday; I never kept any melting pot.</p>
               <p>(Fleming called in.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have told us you are a pawnbroker? - I am.</p>
               <p>And an accomplice, as far as a man can be an accomplice, who has received stolen goods? -</p>
               <p>Court. That is not a question that he ought to answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120056"/>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I am not asking him about any other act of receiving stolen goods, than that which is relevant to this indictment; I have the examination here, that in 28 different felonies he is a common receiver; I do say, that the Jury should know what sort of man he is, because at present there is no evidence but his to affect these prisoners.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether he is an accomplice or not, has not appeared in evidence to me; you say he is; the Crown is not bound by any act of a Justice of peace; wherever a witness has come on the credit of the Justice, the general practice has been not to call on that party to be prosecutor; but in the case that I mentioned, though he was an accomplice, he was judged to be a competent witness to be examined; and after his examination, his credit to be left to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I agree, that it is to the credit of this witness that I am to be permitted to examine him; but how can it be left to the Jury to say, upon their oaths, and to refer it to their consciences, whether a man is a fit man to be received as a witness, unless they have the premises before them; I do not ask him to accuse himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Fleming. You said you stood in circumstances differing from most other witnesses, and hoped that his lordship would protect you from accusing yourself, being an accomplice? - I did not say I was an accomplice; I said I had been admitted as an evidence, on account of having received these articles which were produced.</p>
               <p>How many persons are now in custody on information from you? - Only these two men and another, on this indictment.</p>
               <p>How many are there? - There may be ten or eleven.</p>
               <p>Do not you know, that on this very indictment there are five persons; that there is Cuthbert, that there is Keep and Vanderberg? - No, I do not know that their lives depend on it.</p>
               <p>But you have charged two of them as receivers; how many persons have been accused by you of different crimes during the last month, to all of which you have been privy? - It is impossible for me to enumerate them all; I know of eleven in custody.</p>
               <p>And how many out upon bail? - Two, Sir.</p>
               <p>No more, Sir? - I do not know of any more.</p>
               <p>How many have been accused by you? - There are eleven in custody; I do not come forward for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>How many persons have been accused by you of different crimes during the last month? - More than eleven; but I cannot recollect how many in number more.</p>
               <p>How many of those have been accused by you of capital offences, affecting their life? - Most likely all.</p>
               <p>How many felonies have you given information of, in the course of the last month, in different parts of the town, which you have been privy to, and shared the plunder? - I apprehend they are all felonies, there are so many persons, you see.</p>
               <p>How many felonies? - I have disclosed a great number more felonies.</p>
               <p>Do you believe there are fewer than thirty? - I do not know rightly.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in this course of trade? - It might be about five or six months ago; it appears that these goods have been stolen, and that I have received them.</p>
               <p>Did not you know these things were stolen? - I can bring people to prove the propriety of my conduct, before I went into business; these men being in possession of these sort of goods, I could not suppose they came by them honestly.</p>
               <p>Then, Sir, you knew that they were stolen? - Sir, I cannot say that I did not; I think, Mr. Garrow, you as well as the rest of the public, ought to be very much obliged to me for bringing those people forward.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Sir Sampson Wright has expressed his misery, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120057"/>could not convict you, and execute you at Newgate? - No, Sir, I do not think he could.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the robbery of any kind.</p>

               <p>Court. The part of the indictment which charges this prisoner with a burglary is defective, there being no hour mentioned; the only question that remains to be considered is, whether the indictment, notwithstanding that defect, may not be considered as a good indictment for stealing in the dwelling house, to the amount of 40 s.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's counsel. I shall leave it to your Lordship, whether that defect is fatal to the whole indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. My present opinion is, that there is enough in this indictment to charge him, with stealing to the amount of 40 s. but clearly, not with the burglary.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I only found the things at Fleming's mother's by his direction; Fleming, Townsend, me, and Carpmeal went all together in a coach; she was not at home, when we got in the house; we got in at the street door, and Fleming desired me to break open two different doors, which I did, and there we found the things, according to his directions.</p>
               <p>In what capacity does Fleming come? - As an evidence, he was brought to Bow-street on the Sunday morning, by Jealous, Townsend and me; and he made a confession of all the things that he knew.</p>
               <p>Is he admitted an evidence against Durham, as an accomplice? - No, as a receiver, buying them as receivers do, in general, from the people that steal them.</p>
               <p>How did you find these goods? - By Fleming's information; when Sir Sampson Wright talked to him, he said, this was a part of such a robbery, in such a place, and part at such a place, and part at such a place.</p>
               <p>Was he at the time accused of this particular robbery? - No, not of this, nor of any other that I know of; but of some things that are to come before your Lordship another time: when Sir Sampson Wright told him, he would admit him an evidence if he would make a clear confession of all the things he had bought at different times.</p>
               <p>Then he was not under charge for this particular fact? - No.</p>
               <p>Then before he gave that information, he was not accused of this robbery, nor of receiving those goods? - It was not known, to my knowledge, till the time he gave information of it himself, and several more as well as this.</p>
               <p>What was Fleming apprehended for? - He was apprehended for receiving stolen goods; Mr. Jealous, and two or three more of our people, went to a house somewhere near where he lived, and there was a quantity of things; and the woman said they belonged to Mr. Fleming, the next day Jealous, Townsend, and I went down to Fleming's and took him into custody; says he, what is this for? says he, I know what it is for; it is for such things that were found at Mrs. Burkett's last night, yes it is; says he, very well, I expected you to come; I could have been out of the way, but I staid in the way on purpose; when he was brought to the office he offered to make a discovery, Sir Sampson Wright would not take it from him at all then; he desired him to recollect what he could then, and he would give him time till Monday; on Monday he came up, and had wrote down several things; and he said, I have still more robberies; Sir Sampson Wright said, let me get through these you have told us already, and write down what you have more to discover; and if there is any part you dislike, when you have wrote it down, contradict it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you present when all this conversation passed at Sir Sampson Wright's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then all that he knew of this business was discovered in consequence of this? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Had not Fleming an assurance of safety or protection in proportion to the discoveries he should make? - Yes, I believe so; Sir Sampson told him, that if he told every thing that he knew from the first of his connection to the present time, he should be at liberty to deliver it, and be safe; and if he kept back any one thing he must expect no favour.</p>
               <p>In consequence of this, among other things, he told you where these goods were? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120065"/>Did he go with you when you found them? - Yes; my Lord, but they had been moved from where he told us to another place, which was his mother's; he said they were at his sister's, we did not find them there; when we went to his sister's, the husband of the sister was in bed, he got up.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - I do not know; I should think not; we found the things at his mother's; Fleming went with us to his mother's, she was then gone to Fleming's; the inside doors were fast; he strove to open them, and he could not; so I kicked the doors open.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of these things, or any thing of the prisoner's connection with this robbery, but what he told you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Fleming tell you how he came by the knowledge of these things? - Yes; he said he had bought them from the different prisoners that were in custody; sometimes one, sometimes two, as much as I know; when he bought them of people that were present, he mentioned their names; and when it was said where was this done? he said, at such a place.</p>
               <p>He admitted there, that at the time they were bought by him he knew they were stolen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether he knew any thing of this robbery before it was committed, or whether he had any hand in the robbery itself? - No; and I remember very well Sir Sampson asked him whether he had been with these people doing any thing? and he said no.</p>
               <p>Court. It does not appear to me, Mr. Peatt, that win this case, Fleming stands precisely in the light of an accomplice; he stands, at present, in the light of an accessary after the fact, but not as an accomplice in the fact; therefore, I do not well see how I can avoid examining him, and hearing what he has to say; it goes very strongly to his credit; but I doubt very much, whether he stands in the situation of an accomplice; my idea of an accomplice is a person that confesses himself guilty of the very fact the prisoner is accused of; now this man does not stand charged by his own confession, or otherwise, but of one crime, which is a crime greatly affecting his credit; it is the crime of receiving these goods after the fact committed, knowing them to be stolen; and there is no doubt; but the Court and Jury ought to receive the evidence of such a witness with great caution; but I doubt, whether there is any principle of law, that I can decline examining him upon; if he appears on the evidence, to be an accomplice in the same fact with which the prisoner is charged, and admitted as an evidence, as an accomplice, there being no other evidence to affect the prisoner, I certainly would not call him, nor permit him to be examined.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. I trust your Lordship will not receive his evidence; in the former trial he was heard and considered in that light, and the confessions he has made, has been in consequence of promises, and there being no other evidence, I trust you will not receive him, because, he stands precisely, in point of credit, in the same light as an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He is not an accomplice, nor is there any objection to his competency.</p>

             brought part of this property to me some time last month; it might be about the middle of November.</p>
               <p>What do you call the middle? - The fourteenth or fifteenth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120066"/>Where did you get the remainder of these things? - Of the prisoner John Durham; about four or five minutes after Smith came in, Durham brought in a bundle also, then I opened both the bundles.</p>
               <p>Was Smith there when Durham came? - He was.</p>
               <p>What did Durham say? - He said there were some things, and desired me to look at them to buy them; there was one Keep and Vanderberg in my house at the same time; not in the same part of the house; I looked at them and bought them.</p>
               <p>What did you pay for them? - I am not sure, as I told Sir Sampson Wright, whether it was four guineas, or whether it was four pounds ten for the whole that they both brought.</p>
               <p>Who did you pay the money to? - I laid it on the counter, and Durham took it up.</p>
               <p>Did Durham take up the money for the whole, or only for the things in his bundle? - They were sold all together, and Durham took up the money for the whole.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what day of the week this was? - I believe it was on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>What time of the night? - It might be about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry how these things had been come by? - No.</p>
               <p>Then it was immaterial to you? - I knew the men before; and I had bought things of them before.</p>
               <p>Did you conceive these things, at the time you bought them, to be honestly come by or not? - I really thought they were stolen.</p>
               <p>You thought so then? - Yes; Sir Sampson Wright told me the consequence if I did not tell the whole truth, therefore I do.</p>
               <p>Did Durham say any thing how they were come by? - No.</p>
               <p>How did these things get to your mother? - I sent them to my sister first.</p>
               <p>Did you put any mark on these things, from any other things that you bought? - No; when I sent these things first to my sister, I do not think there were any things there.</p>
               <p>But how do you know these things to be the same things that were brought to you by Smith and the prisoner? - Because there was one gown and coat that I bought with the rest of the things that I kept at home; that gown and coat I delivered, on the 3d of December, to Macmanus and Townsend; that was a part of the property.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether that gown and coat was in Smith's parcel, or in the prisoner's parcel? - I cannot recollect that; I know this corded dimity bed-gown; the gores or gussets are not of the same sort; I had sold the bed-gown, and a person told me of it afterwards, I did not examine it at the time.</p>
               <p>Then you have only the word of the person you sold it to? - That is all, in that case; I know this scarlet coat; when it was brought to me, the buttons were all covered with paper, and some of them are now covered; this is the same coat, as far as the best of my knowledge will go; it is a remarkable coat lapelled, which is not as they make them now; it was in one of the two parcels, I do not know which; here is a remarkable gown and coat; this I sent to my sister, and I brought it away myself, and I sold it to Mrs. Cox, and I saw her make her mark; she expects to lay in every day.</p>
               <p>Court. You must put that out of the case? - Here are two pair of sattin breeches, and a tissue waistcoat; I cannot speak positively to those I have sold; there are no other things that I wish to swear to; this gown and coat, this scarlet coat I can positively swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It is scarcely possible, I think, that more light can be thrown on your character, than has been already.</p>
               <p>Court. As to character, you need not give yourself any trouble.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You have not been very strict, I suppose, at any time, in asking questions of the persons that came to pledge?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120067"/>- I have received things since I have been in business; most likely in the same way I have received these; I gave a full account of every thing I knew.</p>
               <p>If you had had them things in your possession which were liable to be called in question, do not you suppose yourself to be in danger, if they were not ascribed to some particular person? - Yes, Sir, I comprehend that these things that were found in my house, if I had been unable to account for them, I should certainly think myself in danger.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Pincutt. Look particularly at the coat, and the gown and coat? - I have a bit of the gown and coat in my pocket; I know it perfectly well; I only know it from the pattern, and having long sleeves.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing particular in the make of it? - Only that it had long sleeves, and a tucker in it; not more than that (The piece handed to the Court.) I know the scarlet coat to be ours, by the buttons being covered; Mr. Pincutt saw it himself, and said it was his; he is gone abroad; I only know it from the buttons being papered, and lined with white silk.</p>

               <p>I am not guilty of the horse, I was sent to borrow this horse; I said what shall I do if they ask me for an address? says he, tell them I keep the Cape Coast Castle; I went to Mr. Pegram, and told him the horse was not for myself, but it was for another person that kept the Cape Coast Castle; I never saw any thing of the person since; I never met with him since; I enquired for him every where, and I heard the horse was gone to Portsmouth, I went there after the horse; I had not been in town five days when I was taken. I was bred to the sea; I have no evidence.</p>

               <p>You know you was examined at Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you told us all that passed at Bow-street; on your examination, did not you there say, that Higgins had not been out of your house that day, nor the day before, nor the day before that? - No, I did not say that; I said I believed he had not been out that day, but they all came into my room together.</p>
               <p>Did not you say at Bow-street that you believed Higgins had not been out of your house that day? - I said I believed not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you believed he had not been out the day before? - No, I did not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Tell me whether you will venture to swear that you did not say to the magistrate at Bow-street, that Higgins was not out of your house either that day, or the day before, or the day after? - I did not say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120076"/>so; I said I believed he had not been out on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Did you say the Saturday or the Friday? - I will not venture to swear that I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe that the young man was not out of your house on the Friday night; that is a dangerous question to such a witness as you? - To the best of my knowledge, I cannot say; but on Saturday I know he was not.</p>
               <p>What time was you at home on the evening of Friday? - About six or seven.</p>
               <p>Did you go out after seven? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was Higgins out after seven that night? - No, not on Friday night; but in the day time I cannot say; but after night, I am sure he was not out.</p>

               <p>I take it for granted that you came today from Duck lane? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you come from to-day? - Why, from prison I came to-day.</p>
               <p>You have been in a little trouble, as they call it about this business? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Therefore you are swearing to get yourself out of trouble? - I would not swear any thing wrong; if you was a widow with two children, you would be glad to do any thing in the world to maintain them.</p>
               <p>Is it a furnished lodging? - Yes.</p>

             came in together to our house; Fleming came in afterwards; they went up stairs into Higgins's room; but I cannot tell what passed, and Fleming brought down stairs a black bag; I cannot tell what was in it; he desired it might be put away into the closet where Mr. Jealous found it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you lived with Mrs. Burkitt? - About six or seven years.</p>
               <p>You lived with her then, when she lived in Fleet-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You came from prison too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew her when her husband was alive, poor man? - Yes, I lived with her, and have been with her ever since.</p>
               <p>You knew Fleming very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has he been used to come backwards and forwards to your house? - I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>How long has she lived in Duck-lane? - Abot three months.</p>
               <p>You know she lived there by Fleming's desire? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was not you present when they agreed that she should take the house in Duck-lane? - No, I was not; I cannot tell when Mr. Fleming called first upon us; he did not assist in moving.</p>
               <p>But you saw him as soon as you got in? - He called in as he went by.</p>
               <p>Was that the first day after you went to Duck-lane, or the next day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>After that, how often did Fleming use to call? - He used to call as he went by.</p>
               <p>He was a very intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Burkitt's; was not he? - Not as I know; he went about his business; he used to call in.</p>
               <p>Did he use to leave things at your house? - I believe he did; really I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Will you swear he did not leave things at your mistress's, till he called for them? - He has left things several times, till he fetched them away.</p>
               <p>How soon after you went to live at Westminster, did he come with the first bundle of things? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Were the things always put into that cupboard? he put them in himself.</p>
               <p>What part of the house was that cupboard in? - The back room; there was no lock upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. You say that Higgins, and all the rest of the prisoners came in together on the Saturday evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had Higgins been out? - He had not been out at all.</p>
               <p>Grace Maddox, Holden and Grose, all came in, and went up stairs with Higgins? - I cannot tell you whether Higgins<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120077"/>was out or not; they all four went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Then it was not true that the four prisoners came in together; you have sworn both ways; which is the truth? - I cannot tell; Higgins came in with Grose and Holden, and Grace Maddox.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that he came into the house or into the room; did the four prisoners all come into the house together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Do I understand you right, that you are now, upon recollection, sure that Higgins; Holden, Grose and Maddox, all the four prisoners came into the house together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how long had Higgins been out? - That I cannot say, I was at home all the evening.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing Higgins before he came in with the other prisoners? - I saw him up stairs in his own place.</p>
               <p>How soon did he go out from his own place? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Did you see them come in or not? - Only Grace Maddox.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoners come into the house, or did you? - Yes, I did see them come in.</p>
               <p>Who did you see come into the house? - I saw Holden,

I told him yes; they were in a black bag then; I do not know rightly which it was that gave me the bag to look at them, I looked at them, and I think I paid for seven sheets, eight table-cloths, four napkins and a white cotton counterpane; there were more in the bag than that, but the others I considered of no value, and I gave them to the prisoner Maddox; then after I had looked at them, I think it was Grose, but I am not sure, asked me five guineas for them, which I refused to give; I told him I could not afford to give more than three guineas for them, which if they would not take, it would not suit me; I then went down stairs to Mrs. Burkitt's, and while I was sitting in Mrs. Burkitt's front room, Higgins called to me; when I went back again, they agreed to take the three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120078"/>guineas; I folded up the things separate, and put them on the table; after I had done that, I put them in the black Nags and paid three guineas for them; I carried them down stairs into Mrs. Burkitt's back room on the ground floor, and I put them there into a closet, and desired her to take care of them till I came for them; she told me she would; I paid the three guineas into the hands of Grose.</p>
               <p>What became of the money? - I believe it was divided among them; Higgins said, we must give her something; I saw no other woman in the room besides

               <p>Had you any further conversation with them about these things at any time? - No; not a syllable more than what I have told you.</p>

               <p>Court. You have used the house of Mrs. Burkitt from the time she came into Duck-lane, to leave things at occasionally? - I did.</p>
               <p>You have told us; on a former occasion, that you have carried on this trade of receiving stolen goods for six months before you was discovered? - That was the only time I was in business for myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And that was the only trade you carried on? - No Sir, it was not; I had not any promise of making a full discovery; I was not charged with any thing; when I came before Sir Sampson he asked me if I knew Higgins? I told him yes, and Grose; Townsend came to me, and said Sir Sampson wanted me.</p>
               <p>That is the usual way? - I might have gone away if I had chose it, but it would not do for me to leave my country on such a thing as this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You added last, that you found it necessary to fix somebody with every article that was found in your possession? - That I found it necessary; yes, I certainly did.</p>
               <p>That unless you could get rid of every article of stolen goods found in your possession, traced or to you, you would be in danger? - If I was the most the most vile person in the world, what punishment should I deserve to fix on an innocent person.</p>


               <p>A punishment that the laws of this counttry do not impose on you; how long have you been connected with Saunders; - I have known him several years; I have sold him several articles.</p>
               <p>Did you use to sell your plate to him to go to Holland? - No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Who is the person who took your plate to Holland, Davis? - I never sold any thing to Davis in my life.</p>
               <p>How many times may you have sold articles to Saunders? - I cannot tell how many times.</p>
               <p>Did Saunders know you was a common receiver of stolen goods? - He might know.</p>
               <p>Did not he know it? - Well, he did know.</p>
               <p>He knew it from you? - There is not the least doubt of it; I look upon it I know the value of these things as well as any man in England. I look upon the utmost value of them to be four guineas, or four guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Giving the full value makes no difference.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Saunders that those articles you sold to him were stolen? - From our connection he could not doubt of it; I did not tell, my Lord, last-night, that I sold plate to go to Holland.</p>

               <p>What did you pay for the things? - I cannot rightly tell; they asked me twelve guineas, and I gave them six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How came they to tell you these things came from an uninhabited house? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not that surprise you? - No.</p>
               <p>Where do you come from now? - I have not been in prison.</p>
               <p>You have been here very often before? - I never was in this court before in my life, nor before any Justice; I never was examined before; there might have been another man of the name of Saunders, but it was not me.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Fleming? - About six months.</p>
               <p>You and he have dealt together in stolen goods for six months? - I know nothing at all about it; I have been acquainted with him, and have had dealings with him.</p>

               <p>In stolen goods? - Stolen goods! we never ask that question; Fleming never told me the things he brought to me were stolen, nor told me the places they were stolen from; he never told me any thing.</p>
               <p>How came you to send the things abroad? - When I have a parcel of things, I always send them to people that send them abroad; I never was in any court, nor before any Justice; I am not in custody; I went voluntarily before the Justice, I came up on account of Fleming; I knew nothing of this affair at that time; Sir Sampson knew nothing at all about it.</p>

               <p>I did not send to Fleming, the prisoner lodged at our house, and he sent for Fleming, and Fleming came to our house, and said, he wanted him; Hardinge brought in this clock, I cannot say whether it was Monday or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>When was the 15th of October? - On a Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Did Fleming come there? - Yes; he gave a guinea; I do not know how the prisoner got his living, he used to go to market; he had a jack-ass and he had it backwards in my house.</p>

I verily believe this is the clock; the maker's name and size correspond; it was in a frame, the frame is gone; I wound it up for seven years; it is not numbered at all; the key exactly corresponds to it; Duck-lane is about a quarter of a mile from the hospital; I cannot say I ever saw the prisoner before I saw him at Sir Sampson's; the key fits it exactly; the case was taken away with it, and this part of the ornament was broke off and left behind; they were such ornaments as that clock had; they were found on the ground next to the hospital where the window of this room opens into; the apothecary has a right to occupy all the rooms.</p>
               <p>Does the apothecary pay any tax for the windows of this room? - I do not know; I rather conceive it is paid by the stewards, I believe they pay the taxes of the whole house; Mr.

            ? - I believe she has a connection with the prisoner Brown, but I do not think he is married to her; presently after Todd and Watson came into my shop, that was on Monday evening the 10th of September, between nine and ten; about two or three minutes after, Higgins and Brown came into my street-door, and went into the parlour, while Watson and Todd were in my shop, and Higgins and Brown in the parlour; I looked at the things mentioned in the indictment, except the spoons; after I had looked at them, Higgins and Brown came into the shop; there was one

             in the parlour; I believe Brown went to the parlour again to him; then there was Higgins, Brown, and Watson in the shop; they were on one side, and I on the other; after I had looked at them, one of the three asked me the price of them, and they asked me three guineas for them.</p>
               <p>Did they say they were their own property, because they were brought in by another person? - I apprehend I am not at liberty to give my opinion on that subject; but they asked me three guineas for those things which Brown had brought in; that was more than I could afford to give; I gave two pounds seven shillings and sixpence for them; while I paid for them, Brown came into the shop; then they went away.</p>
               <p>Who took the money? - I think it was Todd; but I will not venture to swear that; there was a division of the money in my shop; they all went away at one time; I have sold the gowns, and I think all the other things; but I am sure of some to one Saunders, a Jew; and I believe one of the gowns he has to produce; he had one of them by him, and I sold these seven yards of cotton to Mrs. Barlow.</p>
               <p>Was that piece of cotton a part of the property you bought of the prisoner? - It is impossible for me to swear to this; it is a common pattern, but I sold Mrs. Barlow seven yards of the same pattern and sort of cotton.</p>

               <p>Fleming. I do not think it is in the same state it was when I sold it to Saunders; it has been picked to pieces.</p>

               <p>Fleming. I sold him a gown of this pattern, and I think it had the stain in the back, which is in it now.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mason. I swear this to be my gown, I described the mark in it at Sir Sampson's, before it was open, which is a mark of blood in the body of it, and there it is.</p>

That woman that you mention might be a principal, and we might be accessaries after the fact: Did I ever sell you any thing particularly, or ever call at your shop, any otherwise than to pledge my things? - Todd and Watson came into the shop, and Higgins and Brown went into the parlour; then they came into the shop, and after the money was paid, they all went away together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watson. Did I ever sell you any thing? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120087"/>Do you live together? - No; I parted with him just at his own door in Duck-lane; I live opposite this public house; it is not far off.</p>
               <p>Then you was present when the Watchman came in and broke open the door? - Yes, I was eating my supper at the same time, and he was with me.</p>
               <p>Did you go up stairs with them, or did you see any thing that was going forward there? - No Sir, I eat my supper quietly; I did not interfere at all in it; I left him at his own door.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Mason. This boy, John Jones, who was last examined, says, he, together with Watson, and a woman and man, was at supper at the time the watchman came in, and went up stairs? - Not to my knowledge; it is common for people to bring their victuals and sit in the tap room to supper; when I called in the watchman at ten o'clock, I instantly ordered every body to be turned out; I do not remember this boy Jones to be there the whole evening.</p>
               <p>Do you know that boy? - Very well; he lives just opposite; I will not swear he was not there, but I do not remember him.</p>
               <p>Jury to Fleming. Was the woman Sophy Brown ever in custody? - Yes; she was taken; she denied bringing the property to my house, and then Sir Sampson discharged her; I do not know for what reason she denied it, but she did deny it.</p>
               <p>Jury to Fleming. Was there no body in your shop but yourself? - No Sir, Mr. Vanderberg was in the parlour; I do not think he heard any thing that was said.</p>

               <p>Are you sure they were there when you went to bed? - I will not take upon me to say that they were there till eleven or twelve o'clock; I had occasion to go out late to the watch house; I did not see them when I returned; they might have been taken before I went out; there was a mustard pot found in Mr. Keep's house; I was not present when it was found; I have been it since; I have never found any of the other things; I never saw any of the prisoners till I saw them in Bond-street.</p>

               <p>I went along with Townsend to Keep, and I saw him deliver it to Townsend; I found no part of this property but at Keep's.</p>
               <p>Court. Now I see there is a remaining witness of the name of Fleming? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I must ask you for the information of these gentlemen, who are not yet acquainted much with the situation in which he stands; he was apprehended for another distinct fact, for being supposed to have some stolen goods in his possession? - He was apprehended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120088"/>in consequence of some things found at Mrs. Burkitt's</p>
               <p>And originally on her information? - Yes; she said some things belonged to Fleming.</p>
               <p>When he was examined I believe he acknowledged these things and offered to make discoveries if he could be admitted as an evidence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The magistrates thought proper to admit him, on condition that he would make a full disclosure; and keep nothing back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In consequence of that he discovered a variety of robberies? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In all of which he has been the receiver of stolen goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's counsel. I submit to your Lordship, that you will not call Fleming after this; there is no evidence against the prisoners except that of Fleming.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot refuse to hear Fleming's evidence, not prevent it's going to the consideration of the Jury, for, however they discredit Fleming, he is not charged as an accomplice in this fact, but as an accessary after the fact; the accessary is not an accomplice before conviction; an accessary is certainly a competent witness.</p>
               <p>FNANCIS FLEMING sworn.</p>
               <p>Have you any knowledge of this robbery? - When I was at Sir Sampson Wright's on the 2d of September, I told Sir Sampson what things I had bought of these men at the bar; and among other articles was the mustard pot, and other things; I believe there was a pepper castor; I remember the mustard pot exceedingly well, I bought this of the three prisoners between two and three months ago, I cannot specify the time nearer than that, I know the date of the indictment very well, but I do not know it was that time.</p>
               <p>Where did they sell them to you? - In my own shop.</p>
               <p>What time of the day or night? - Early in the morning before breakfast.</p>
               <p>Were they all together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did they say at the time? - That they had found these things, and a black cloak at the same time.</p>
               <p>Which of them produced the things mentioned in the indictment? - I do not recollect, I am sure they were all together, I told Sir Sampson so. I do not recollect that they said how they came by these things, the mustard pot is here; I sold the pepper castor with some other plate to Mr. Blank, refiner, in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the mustard-pot then? - I sold the mustard-pot to Mr. Keep; at his own house in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>How long after you had bought it? - It might be a fortnight or three weeks; none of the prisoners were present when I sold it to Mr. Keep.</p>
               <p>Court to Townsend. Is that the mustard-pot you found at Keep's? - Yes, Keep gave it to me.</p>
               <p>To Fleming. Is that the one you sold to him? - Yes, I believe it is; but it is impossible to swear to it positively, because there are others of the same sort; I sold him a mustard-pot of the same size and pattern; I verily believe this to be the same, but to say positively I could not; there was no glass to it when I bought it.</p>
               <p>Did you attend to it at the time you bought it, and sold it, so as to know it again? - I marked the pattern, no otherwise, for I intended to have kept it for my own use.</p>
               <p>It this the one you sold to keep or not? - Yes, I take it to be the same, I have no doubt of it, I never had one like it before.</p>
               <p>Court. We have heard from the officers and from the counsel before, the situation in which you stand; you was admitted a witness on condition of making a full discovery of all the property that had come to your possession? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>I think you said, on a former occasion, that you had been in business about five or six months, and made it a practice of buying goods of people that you knew to be stolen? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What house does the first witness keep? - I never was at his house in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120089"/>You was not at his house the day the things were missing? - No.</p>
               <p>To prosecutor. Do you know Fleming? - No, I never saw him, till I saw him at Bow-street, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>(The mustard-pot deposed to.)</p>
               <p>What is the value of that alone? - I gave two pounds four shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Fleming. That pot could not have been traced unless I had made a discovery.</p>

               <p>Did any body go with you? - I told him I did not think it was material; but that I would call upon a friend and take him along with me; I called on a person, he was just at dinner, and as his people were from home, he could not go; the prisoner and me went to Bartholomew-close, to my brother-in-law's, he was at home, I went to the house, and the prisoner stood at a little garden gate; he run away, I went after him, he got there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before me; I then sent for a constable and had his box opened, I found nothing of my property in his box, but this razor and a snuff-box; they were mine clearly.</p>

               <p>Are there any marks on either of them? - Yes, there are.</p>
               <p>(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. By what mark do you know the razor or the snuff-box to be yours? - I know the razor to be mine, by the name upon it, I had four, but they are gone.</p>
               <p>What name is upon the razor? - Pearson; it is a French razor.</p>
               <p>But he makes a great many besides yours? - Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any private mark of yours upon it? - Yes, Sir, there is a cross.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you buy it in Paris or in England? - I bought four of them in a case; I know the snuff-box by having it in my compting-house these two years past, with snuff in it; I never missed it till I found it in his box.</p>
               <p>There is no particular mark upon it? - There was a particular scented snuff in it; it was in it when it was found.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you suspect this boy before? - I suspected he had wronged me.</p>
               <p>How could you wish to keep him? - Because I was not provided.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120090"/>Court. What did he say when these things were found in his box? - He said the razor was given him by a French gentleman, that I had in my house.</p>
               <p>Did he mention the name? - Yes, his name is La Belmontier; he has varied in that account; he then said he found the razor among some rubbish, (that was to one of my servants, not to myself.)</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about the snuffbox? - He said he looked upon it as of no consequence, and he took it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Counsel. This man whom you suspected so much as a thief, when he gave you warning, and told you, he was going to learn a trade, I believe he told you who he was going to live with? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>You asked him to stay with you? - Yes, it was only a few days before.</p>
               <p>How came you to desire him to remain in your service till you got a servant? - I could not do the employment I wanted them to do; I suspected him a few days before.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue with you after he gave you warning? - There was a month's warning; he continued all that time, and about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>Was that before the officers came in from the Custom-house or Excise? - No, it was after; I do not know that any officer of the excise came in at all.</p>
               <p>What, were they Custom-house officers? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Do you not recollect the day? - It is a small occurrence, having five hundred or six hundred pounds seized.</p>
               <p>The young man was a servant in the house then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If he is convicted of your petit larceny, he cannot be a witness? - I do not know that it it will come to trial.</p>
               <p>What, is it made up? - No.</p>
               <p>It is nicely contrived, the old razor and the tin box, a very clever thing; you know if he is convicted, the crown cannot call him as a witness? - I do not know that, if it is so, it is my own bringing on.</p>
               <p>Is not it so as I say? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Then will you give us some satisfaction how you could desire a man to stay six weeks in your house? - It was only two days before that that he told me he could not stay, he was not going to learn any trade at all, I can swear that, and I will call a person that will prove it; Mr. Keene told me so himself.</p>
               <p>How long had you missed this razor before? - I had missed four of them for nine weeks.</p>
               <p>There is a mark? - Yes; long before they were taken out of the box; I put the same mark on them all when I sent them to be set.</p>
               <p>Jury. What, was it done with a knife? - I cannot tell; it was a knife or fork.</p>
               <p>Now as to the tin box, there is no mark upon that? - I know it to be mine from the scent of the snuff, from having it a long time in my possession.</p>
               <p>The man told you where his box was? - He told me it was in Fann-street, but not where.</p>
               <p>And he desired you to have somebody with you? - It did not strike me as odd in him, but that led me to get somebody with me.</p>
               <p>The constable was present I believe? - The woman of the house was there.</p>
               <p>How many days before you went to search this box had the officers of the customs been at your house? - Six weeks or more.</p>
               <p>And yet if he would have staid, you would have kept him? - No, only till I had provided myself with a servant, which was to have been in a few days; I engaged a servant.</p>
               <p>Are any of your servants here? - Yes, several of them.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to call any of them? - They can be no evidence for me at all; they were not present when I took him up.</p>

               <p>You are sure of that? - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Then he did not say of the tin box that he had taken that, because he thought it of no value? - No, I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What are you? - I am a constable; my house is facing where the box was, and being so handy he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the key of the box; who was present? - Mr. Keene was present; I did not see them open it, but I found it open when I went into the room, the lid was put up, I was behind the prosecutor about a yard.</p>
               <p>You did not see the lid lifted up? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Do you mean that the box was open before the prisoner went into the room? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had he time enough to open it, before you went into the room? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, the prosecutor and the prisoner went in first, and Mr. Keene and you after? - They were close together, not a minute difference.</p>
               <p>Then he had no opportunity of opening the box without his master? - None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the prisoner first when you was sent for? - In the house where he lodged, he was below stairs in the house when I went in.</p>

               <p>Did you tell Mr. Read you did not intend to learn this boy your business? - I never spoke to Mr. Read about it.</p>
               <p>The master has told the Jury, on his oath, that he believes the boy went up stairs to take things out? - No, Sir, the box was open before, he never minded the box being locked; but the door of the room was locked, and my wife had the key, and gave me the key; I have known the young man about a twelvemonth, a very honest character he had by every body; I am a master carpenter in Fann-street.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the box was searched? - No, I was in the kitchen talking to his master's brother-in-law; Mr. Read, the constable, and this young man all went up together; he came without any authority, he had no warrant to search my house at all.</p>
               <p>When did your wife give the young man the key of the room? - She gave it to the gentlemen when they went up to search.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that perfectly? - I believe she might give it him.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner some time; in the month of July, I cannot say the day, on Sunday morning the prisoner came to me, and brought me a waistcoat, together with a pepper castor, two or three table spoons, and a saucepan, and as much plate as weighed eleven ounces; there was a white handkerchief and some other things, for which I paid him three pounds seventeen shillings; the plate I had sold with some other plate, to Mr. Blank the refiner in Long-acre; that is the same account I gave to Sir Sampson.</p>
               <p>Who was that waistcoat delivered to? -</p>
               <p>I sold that waistcoat to one John Vanderberg in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you make any mark on the waistcoat before you sold it to Vanderberg? - I made a remark, but no mark.</p>
               <p>Do you keep any book of your receiving stolen goods? - No I did not, I have no memorandum of the time, I know it was the latter end of July, for the first house I took, I did not like, as it was very inconvenient, because I thought of settling in another way of business; I am a single man, and I thought of marrying.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is very unlucky for the family you meant to honor with your alliance; you are the same Mr. Fleming that has been a receiver of stolen goods for six months? - I am the same Fleming that was examined before you on a similar occasion; I have no more to do this sessions.</p>
               <p>Are you the same man that said this, that there are certain persons who know you to be a common receiver of stolen goods? - I signed that, that is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Now my honest, worthy friend, Mr. Fleming, how happened it that you kept this a secret all the summer months, from July down to December? - I did not mean to disclose it, unless I had been compelled to it.</p>
               <p>Unless you had been compelled to it by the danger of the gallows; I dare to say you was charged with nothing when you made this disclosure? - To my knowledge I was not; I know the situation I am in.</p>
               <p>Hear the question and answer it; do you mean to swear, that at the time you disclosed this robbery, you was charged with no offence? - No; I certainly, Mr. Garrow, am well acquainted with the consequence; not that I know; that I swear.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear now, that you was not charged with any offence at the time you made this disclosure? - I must take time to recollect that; I made some disclosures on the Sunday, and some on the monday; I cannot recollect which it was; I was first taken in custody on the Sunday morning.</p>

               <p>Court. You was charged with somewhat then; was not you? - But I did not know it.</p>
               <p>You might not know what it was for; but you was charged with some offence; upon your oath did you make this disclosure till you was charged with some offence? Not till I was in custody; I was in custody with the officers in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Now did not you know, at that time, that you were in custody for having goods in your possession, which, if you did not shift off from your possession, you was liable to be taken into custody, and hanged for? - You must excuse me; you speak too quick for me.</p>
               <p>Did not you do this to save your own neck; did not you make the disclosure to save your own life? - I know my motive for making the disclosure; I suppose I must answer, Mr. Garrow, in the affirmative, for I know no better; I certainly made this disclosure to save myself.</p>
               <p>One question more, and remember what you said last night; Do not you know, that unless you fix on some person every particular article of stolen goods found in your possession, that you are still in danger? - Be so kind as to repeat it; I know,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120095"/>Mr. Garrow, that I must fix on the right person; I apprehend, Mr. Garrow, I am still in the same danger if I do not fix on the right person.</p>
               <p>Then you are now swearing, in order to fix this danger on somebody else to save yourself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You say you did not mark the waistcoat, but you remarked it? - I will tell you, on one side there is a darn very near the pocket.</p>

               <p>Who gave you that waistcoat? - His wife.</p>
               <p>Townsend. I believe I found it on the 3d or 4th of December.</p>
               <p>- MITCHELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an Attorney at Isleworth; on the 27th day of July last, in going to Oxford assises, I left this waistcoat, with several articles, with Mr. Wheeler, in a bundle; I am perfectly persuaded, from the darn that is here, this is the waistcoat, I left with him; it was made too long for me, therefore I desired the tailor might cut some off it, which reduced the pockets, and they are now exceedingly shallow, and the darn, I believe Mrs Mitchell made; I have not the least doubt in the world but it is mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was out of your custody from July to December? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Fleming. Look at that waistcoat? - Here is the darn; when I bought the waistcoat, the strings to the back were not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mitchell. There were no strings in it when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many scores of pounds may you have turned in stolen goods during the time you have been in business? -</p>
               <p>Court. You are not bound to answer that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much money have you turned in the course of your trade? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He is not bound to answer that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many waistcoats have you bought in the course of your trade? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether you have bought a dozen? - I cannot tell; I have a number of white ones that I bought in the summer time; it is impossible for me to say; if I was to say any particular number, I am sure I have bought half a dozen.</p>
               <p>A dozen? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Can you tell the particular description of all the waistcoats you have bought, and all the marks you have had to them? - That would be impossible; I kept this waistcoat two days in my house; I was courting a young lady before that.</p>
               <p>They coveted the alliance no doubt? - That does not advert to the business, therefore I must address his Lordship; I sold it the ensuing week after I had it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel; there has been a great many very infamous paragraphs inserted in the papers, I hope that will have no weight on you, my Lord, and the gentlemen of the Jury.</p>

               <p>Now how often, upon your oath, has he searched your house for stolen goods? - That was the third time, but I never had any acquaintance with him at all.</p>
               <p>How long is it since he found all the saddles and the seats of the sedan chairs at your house? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Not in the Plant? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not he himself find out the Plant in which you kept the two new saddles, and twenty-seven sedan chair seats; he never found these at your house in his life? - Never at my house in this world.</p>
               <p>Never in your house; where did he find them? - No, he did not in my house; is there any body here to prove it?</p>

               <p>You had nothing to do with these things? - No.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask this woman whether she received stolen goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, Mrs. Cottrell, had you nothing to do with them? - I never had.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of them? - I knew nothing of what she had got in her place.</p>
               <p>How lately before this had he searched your house for stolen goods? - May be two years agone.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that he had not searched your house for two years? - I cannot justly say when it was.</p>
               <p>Was it a year? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it six months? - It is last summer was twelve months when he searched it last.</p>

               <p>He is very ill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Very ill since the business of the cart; don't you know he is indicted for stealing a cart? - What my husband does I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Your husband is indicted for stealing a cart? - I do not know that he is.</p>
               <p>You never heard he was indicted for stealing a cart? - He is in the hospital.</p>
               <p>What hospital? - In the Borough.</p>
               <p>In St. Thomas's hospital? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - He was there.</p>
               <p>When was he there upon your oath? - I have nothing to divulge about my husband.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath when was he there? - Last Sunday.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120097"/>Do you mean to swear that? - I seed him on the outside.</p>
               <p>When did you see him last in St. Thomas's hospital? - Last Sunday, I saw him on the outside of the gate.</p>
               <p>Was he at that time a patient in St. Thomas's hospital, upon your oath? - Yes Sir, I believe it is St. Thomas's Hospital; it is in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Will you swear he was in any hospital last Sunday? - I will swear it; I will swear he is very ill.</p>
               <p>Was he a patient on last Sunday in any hospital in the Borough? - Yes Sir, he was.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - I swear I feed him there.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, that last Sunday he was a patient in any hospital in the Borough; give me an answer, yes or no? - I am but a foolish woman; he is there; he may be there now for what I know.</p>
               <p>When did you see him last a patient in any hospital in the Borough? - Last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Am I to take that so? - He was there last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Did you see him there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In an hospital in the Borough? - Yes, I did see him in the hospital; he does belong to the hospital; he has belonged to it some time.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you, last Sunday, see your husband in any hospital in the Borough? - I spoke to him at the gate.</p>
               <p>Was he in the hospital? - Yes; I dont know whether he may be there now.</p>
               <p>Court. It is easily known; it is a fact that will appear by the books of the hospital; and I tell you fairly that is a fact of a kind, which, if not true, you can be convicted for perjury on: therefore did you, or did you not see your husband in any hospital, in any of those hospitals as a patient last Sunday? - I spoke to him at the outside of the gate last Sunday.</p>
               <p>When did you see him in the hospital last? - I can't justly say when it was.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - It may be a month or two.</p>
               <p>Is it a month? - It is more than a month.</p>
               <p>In one of the wards of the hospital? - In the hospital I saw him.</p>
               <p>Was he in one of the wards of the hospital? - I saw him walking on the outside.</p>
               <p>When did you see him in the hospital, within the gate of the hospital? - I always send my girl to him.</p>
               <p>When did you see him last in the hospital? - I can't justly say when it was.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him in any hospital? - I have seen him in the hospital.</p>
               <p>In what part of it? - I can't justly say.</p>
               <p>Was it in the wards of the hospital? - It was in the yard.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that he was a patient there? - He was a patient for any thing that I know.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that you believe he lodged in the hospital at any time during the last month? - I don't know, I can't tell; I saw him and spoke to him; he is not with me, I can't say how long it is since he left me; it is more than two months.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, don't you know where he has lodged for the last two months? - He was at work at Brentwood.</p>
               <p>What is his complaint? - A spotted fever.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in the hospital when he had the spotted fever? - He was at Brentwood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the time the things were stolen, this man came to search the house? - What things, Sir?</p>
               <p>The things for which he is indicted; he was searching the house for stolen goods? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>How many pair of sheets with the names taken out, did he find at the time; that choaks you; I don't wonder at it? - Did you speak to me?</p>
               <p>It is my luck to speak to some of the greatest rogues in the kingdom? - I mean to swear that he found no sheets in my place, with the marks picked out.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, recollect, Mr. Mason and Mr. Pasan were both present, and can convict you of perjury; upon your oath, how many odd sheets did they find with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120098"/>marks picked out? - They never could find any; I am certain they never could find any, for the pair I lost was not marked.</p>
               <p>Never was marked at all? - They never had been.</p>

               <p>How many had you with the marks cut out? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Now, Mrs. Cottrell, to come nearer home; how long is it since you were indicted last; (No Answer.) that I should think you must remember? - I can't justly say that.</p>
               <p>Take your own time and tell me? - I was indicted; it is pretty nigh two years; it may be between a year and a half, and two years.</p>
               <p>Where was that little mistake? - At Guildhall, Westminster.</p>
               <p>There you contrived to buy them off, and left your neighbourhood? - Buy what off?</p>
               <p>I must not ask you any more about that; my Lord will stop me if I do; you was tried though? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was for no good, of course; did you keep a rag-shop then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And have kept it ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went to make a complaint to Mr. Parker, the Justice, of this man's robbing you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he heard your story? - Yes, he heard my story so far, that be only bantered and abused me.</p>
               <p>And refused you a warrant? - I never asked for a warrant.</p>
               <p>He did not give you one? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>When I came in, I saw people in the house.</p>
               <p>Who? - Mr. Percival; the child told me there was some people in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you see yourself who they were? - I went up to dinner, I went down afterwards, and saw Mr. Percival getting in at the window of her bed-room; he got up by the help of a linen horse from the ground.</p>
               <p>That was after you had dined? - No, Sir, I had not dined, I was gone down to fetch some water, and I saw him getting up on the horse, and getting in at the window; I asked the child for the key, I opened the door, and I saw Mr. Percival by the side of the fire place, and I saw him take from the saucer something that appeared to be a guinea, and as he took it from the saucer, it fell upon the shelf.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing else? - I then locked the door, and hung the key up in the same place as I took it from.</p>
               <p>Who was with Percival? - No living creature in the world in the room only myself standing at the door; the room was very small, and I could easily have seen if there had been any body there.</p>
               <p>Did any body come to the house with him? - There was a man followed him, and came into the room, and searched my room.</p>

               <p>Was that before or afterwards? - Afterwards.</p>
               <p>Where was he at the time? - I know not, I never clapped eyes on that man before in my life.</p>
               <p>He searched your room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he search it for? - He said for some things that were lost,</p>
               <p>How lost? - They suspected, Sir, the things that were sold there, had been lost; I know not what.</p>
               <p>How lost? - The man's house at the ship had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing more than this? - I have no more to say about it.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>You told my Lord, your name was Crannis? - That is my own name, I never was married in my life.</p>
               <p>Was not you married to Wild? - That man was never any thing to me; I never was married in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120100"/>You knew Wild? - I have seen him before now.</p>
               <p>You saw him before he was hanged? - He never was hanged.</p>
               <p>What became of him? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Did he go to Botany? - I can't tell.</p>
               <p>So when the soldier was hanged, you took up with a drummer? - Why should not I? that is not any thing I come about.</p>
               <p>You knew Mr. Percival by sight? - I have seen him many a time.</p>
               <p>Where? - Walking in the street.</p>
               <p>Do you know the Park? - I never frequent the Park so often.</p>
               <p>Not above once a night, unless you have a good quick trade, then three or four times; how often has he taken you up as a common prostitute in the Park, in his life? - I never was taken up as a common prostitute in the Park in my life, by him; I have been taken up for debt; Mr. Percival never took me up.</p>
               <p>You never was taken up but for debt; do you mean to swear that? - I don't mean to swear any thing, more than I have sworn.</p>
               <p>Have not you been taken up within the last twelve months as a common prostitute, and how often? - I am not obliged to relate here how often I have been taken up.</p>
               <p>Is it so often that you cannot tell; we cannot whip you for it; was you never taken up, yes or no, except for debt? - I am not obliged to relate that to the Court.</p>
               <p>I don't ask you whether you are a prostitute or not; but whether you have not been taken up as one; have you ever been taken up as one? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you have never been taken up as a prostitute, don't you know that, as a street-walker? - I am not obliged to take my oath on that; I don't chuse to relate that to every body.</p>
               <p>How often have you been taken up in the last month? - I have no business to relate that to you; what I have said about that man is just.</p>
               <p>How lately is it that Mrs. Cottrell took you up? - Mrs. Cottrell is here, let her speak whether she had any just cause.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has not she taken you up? - She gave me a piece of paper with a shilling, and brought me here.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, don't you know that she has at this moment a prosecution over your head, unless you swear for her in this? - No, Sir, I did not rob her.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has not she threatened to prosecute you for a robbery, unless you swear for her? - She never did in this world.</p>
               <p>Has not she charged you for the robbery? - I never did it in my life.</p>
               <p>Has she never told you that she would prosecute you for a robbery? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Has not she told you, that if you swore for her, you would have from the Court half a crown a day for your attendance? - No Sir.</p>

            . Then Mrs. Cottrell never said to you, in the hearing of Mrs. Bolton, that if you did not go on with this matter against Percival, that you had perjured yourself, and would have the law against you? - No Sir, if you will give me leave to speak; there was a man lodged in Mrs. Cottrell's house; I had a girl lodged with me in distress, and who had lived along with him; he told her if she would swear every thing she heard me say, she never should want clothes.</p>
               <p>This is a long story instead of an answer: I ask you, upon your oath, has Mrs. Cottrell never said to you, that if you did not go on against Percival, you would have the law against you? - No, Sir, she did not.</p>
               <p>She did not say this to you, that you would have half a crown a day for every day you had been with her about prosecuting Percival? - No Sir, she never did say that.</p>
               <p>Was you at Mrs. Cottrell's house when Percival found the saddles there, and the sedan chair seats? - No.</p>
               <p>What part of the house is the plant in? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Don't you know what the plant is; why the place you put the stolen goods in? - I know nothing at all about it; I never saw any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Was the child in a situation to see this man take the guinea as well as you? - I saw him take it off the shelf, and I told the child I saw him take the guinea.</p>
               <p>Before he went out of the house you told her that? - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Is that your mark? (Shewing a paper-writing.) - Yes, I believe it is my mark.</p>
               <p>You made information before Mr. Parker, the Justice? - When I went before Mr. Parker, there was such a laughing at me, that they would not give me leave to speak; they jeered me, and made game of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120103"/>You was sworn, and what you said was wrote down; I will read you what you said, among other things:</p>

               <p>"that you saw him take a guinea off the</p>
               <p>"shelf, that you then locked the door, and</p>
               <p>"hung the key on the nail from which you</p>
               <p>"had taken it, but did NOT tell the child</p>
               <p>"that the said Percival had taken the guinea." Did you swear that before the Justice? - Mr. Parker was the gentleman that read that over many a time to me, and I told him I did tell the child.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true, that which is put down here,</p>
               <p>"but that she did NOT tell the child that she saw Percival take the guinea?" - I did tell Mr. Parker over and over again.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? -</p>
               <p>Court. Let me caution you: that gentleman has in his hand an information, taken upon oath before a magistrate, signed by you; you will judge whether you are strong enough, in your own knowledge, to support a charge against that magistrate, of setting down the contrary of what you said upon oath before him; the evidence of that gentleman, and of his clerk, and of every body else present at the examination can be had; and will you now venture to swear, that you did not say what is there specified? - I said, over and over, to Mr. Parker, that I told the child of it.</p>
               <p>You told Mr. Parker, before you made your mark to this information, that you had told the child that he had taken the guinea, before you went up stairs? - Yes, Sir, I told him over and over again.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell Mr. Parker, that you did not tell the child so? - I did tell Mr. Parker; Mr. Parker asked; I told Mr.

             I did, just as I hung the key up.</p>

               <p>Do you know where Cottrell is now? - I have heard the children say he is in some hospital.</p>
               <p>How long is it since he left home? - I never trouble my head about his affairs.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 6th of November I was going home to my lodging; I crossed through Farthing Fields, and I met, in a kind of a gateway, three men, two in soldiers clothing, with bayonets in their hands; The prisoner at the bar came and took me by the collar, and demanded my money; I am confident to the man; it was dark, but there was a lamp in the street, just by the very place; the prisoner took me by the collar, and demanded my money, upon which I told him I had none; he told me he knew better; upon which I gave him a guinea and seven shillings, and my watch.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - My Lord, I picked him out of the three battalions upon the parade; I never saw him, to the best of my knowledge, before that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120105"/>How long was it that this robbery was in transaction? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>In the course of that time did you make so accurate an observation of his person, as to be able to swear he is the man? - I took particular notice of some kind of a cut on his left eye; he had me so close, that it was impossible to be deceived in the man.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - My Lord he is the man.</p>
               <p>You say he robbed you of a guinea, seven shillings, and your watch? - Yes, my Lord, one of the other two, who was on the other side of me, says, you have got a good hat, and he took that off; one of the others gave me a stroke with a bayonet on the head; then they quitted me, and I followed them; then as I was going about fifteen yards on, the prisoner came up back to me, with the bayonet drawn in his hand, and swore, by the Holy Ghost, if I came one step farther, he would plunge the bayonet in my guts.</p>
               <p>Have you ever recovered your property? - No, I am a seafearing man, I was going to Jamaica again, and I thought no more about it as I had my life safe; and a soldier told me that the outliers were to be on the Bird-cage-walk on Sunday, and for me to come there, as he thought he knew the man; upon which I got up pretty early on Sunday morning, and went there, and walked up and down the banks, and in the second company, next the grenadiers, I saw this man, the twelfth man on the right.</p>
               <p>At this time, when you made this observation, had that person pointed out this man? - No; I fixed on the prisoner at the bar, before I ever met him.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before he robbed you? - Never.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar very well; I keep the Bald-faced Stag in Holywell-row near Moorfields; he was quartered on me in August last; he belonged to the first regiment of guards; he is discharged now; he continued in my quarters till about the 12th or 13th of November; when he was taken up; there were other soldiers quartered on me, but I had no others besides him, at that time; he came the 21st of August.</p>
               <p>Now can you give an account how this man passed his time, from the 21st of August till the 13th of November, when he was taken up? - Sometimes he went out to work.</p>
               <p>Then during that time you could give no account of him? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you say what became of him on the 1st of November? - No.</p>
               <p>On the 2d, 3d, and 4th? - No.</p>
               <p>On the 6th? - On the 6th there was a woman lived with us to help the maid; on that day, her daughter was said to be married to a man with a wooden leg, which makes me take notice of that day in particular; I went out in the afternoon, about four, and returned about five; and when I came home, the prisoner at the bar was in company with these very people, making merry.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from Queen-street, Wapping? - I look upon it to be better than a mile and a half; they continued there all the evening, till between eight and nine; I cannot say particular to a few minutes, but I am certain it was after eight, and it might be near nine before they went home to bed, then the prisoner went to bed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this was on the 6th of November? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. What day of the week was it? - It was on a Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Now from the hour of five, when you first observed the prisoner at the bar to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120106"/>in this company, till the hour of eight or nine, when he went to bed, might he not have been absent so as to go two miles and a half, without your observing him? - No.</p>
               <p>Had he never been out of your sight during the whole of the time? - Never more than five or ten minutes; he was in company with these people all the evening; Gilmore the soldier brought some mutton stakes, and the wooden legged man brought liquor.</p>
               <p>Was he any relation to the wooden legged man? - No.</p>
               <p>How came there such an intimacy? - Gilmore and the old woman had known one another, by being in the house together.</p>

               <p>Has he had any mark on his eye? - Not the night that they said he committed the robbery; on Tuesday the 6th of last month, he had no black eye at that time, no other than what I always see on his face; he had no mark at all.</p>
               <p>Was you of the wedding party? - No, my Lord, I only came to the house for my beer, I saw him at five, six, and seven that night.</p>
               <p>Then you had three pints of beer instead of one? - No, my Lord, I staid till six, and went out, and came in again at seven.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday night, the 20th of November, I laid hold of the prisoner Harding; the prisoner Archer found means to escape; I brought Harding up to the prosecutor's shop; and on searching him, I found the duplicate of the reading glass in his pocket, and on searching his other pocket, I took this wire out and this chissel. (Producing them.) Accordingly I went to the pawnbrokers, Messrs. Stanley and Butcher in East Smithfield; that is all I know; the ticket is dated the 19th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was on Tuesday, after the robbery was done? - Yes.</p>

I had not known him before; he said he lived with his father and mother in East Smithfield, and that he was lately come from Greenland; I thought it was his own, and he said so; I thought he might make use of it at sea.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Are you sure that is your glass? - I had a glass like this, but I can't say there is any particular mark upon it that I can tell it.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of last month the two prisoners came to my shop, and shewed me two pair of spectacles; I asked them where they got them; they informed me on Tower Hill; I asked them whether they were sure they did not steal them? they said no; I asked them what they asked for them? and they said two shillings a pair; they were both present at the time, I believe; I am quite sure of one; the little one pulled a reading glass out of his pocket afterwards; says I, I am sure you did not come honestly by them.</p>
               <p>Which did you buy the spectacles of? - Of the little one.</p>

Upon this conviction, the learned Judge thought proper to respite the judgment upon you, upon a a doubt with her you could be convicted of murder upon an indictment or inquisition for petit treason; and also, whether the information of

               <p>It now appears that you have been duly and legally convicted of one of the most atrocious crimes that human nature can commit: and although upon the forms of law it has been thought proper to acquit you of the aggravated crime of petit treason; yet the murder of which you were convicted, was attended with circumstances that rendered it's guilt not less atrocious, and of which you must also have been convicted, if there had been competent evidence in point of law on that point. The crime that you have committed is equally an offence against the laws of God and man; it is of all others the most aggravated in it's nature, and the most dangerous to society. Bound to the unfortunate person, whose death you have been the instrument of, by every tie of duty and obedience, while you were in her service; and one of those on whom she had a right to depend for protection, you have (instigated by the most wicked motives) in the hour of rest, and when this unfortunate lady was in her own chamber, and in her own bed, where she might expect security from all, and be under the protection of her own family; you have, with murderous intention, availed yourself of an artful means to be introduced into her chamber; where you, or those with whom you have been associated, perpetrated the horrid fact. Under circumstances such as these, you can expect no mercy from your Sovereign and the Court. The judgment of the law must necessarily take its course upon you. By means of the case that has been reserved for the consideration of the Judges, a long period has been allowed to you to reflect on the enormity of your guilt. Happy will it be for you if that period has been so employed as to work a change in your obdurate heart, and to produce in you that state of mind, which from the infinite goodness of God, may procure you that mercy hereafter, which the laws of man must of necessity deny you here. It depends on your own heart whether that respite has been fortunate or unfortunate; for unless your time has been so employed, and produced that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120004"/>contrition in your mind, I fear it will be an aggravation of your guilt. It only remains for me to discharge my duty, by pronouncing upon you the dreadful sentence of the law; which is, that <rs id="o17871212-1-punish428" type="punishmentDescription">
