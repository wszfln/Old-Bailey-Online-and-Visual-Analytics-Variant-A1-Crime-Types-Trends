               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you last saw them safe in your room - A. About seven o'clock, as near as I can say. I left my room at seven o'clock, and did not return till-nine; I left nobody in the room; when I went out I locked the door. When I went out, Logan was not at home; each of us had a key of the room. I came home about nine o'clock; I found the room door wide open; there was no marks of violence on the door; it had been opened by a key, or a picklock. The first time that I saw the things was here, in this court, in April last.</p>

We went in, and brought out the bed; we brought out the bed on the left hand in the room, sheets, blankets, two quilts, a bolster, and a pillow. The street door was shut, and latched; we lifted up the latch. The parlour-door was locked; we opened that with a picklock-key; we brought out the bed and bedding, and took them to Mr. Saunders's, in Dudley-court, Crown-street; he declined buying them. He told us to go to Whitfield, he would buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he - A. A farrier. I and Brown went to Whitfield, the prisoner; I and Brown had the bed, sheets, blankets, quilts bolster, and pillow. We found Whitfield up stairs in the first floor, he lodged there. Brown and me knew him before Brown went up and told him what we had; I staid down stairs. Brown and Whitfield came down stairs to me; we asked him whether he would buy the bed and bedding; he said, bring it to the shop, and he would look at them in the work-shop; we took them in his work-shop up the yard. We shewed him the bed, sheets, blankets, and quilts; he looked at them all. He told us to go to the King's Head public-house, and he would come to us. He asked us to tell him what part of the town it came from; I told him it came from St. James's, about Peter-street. He said, if he knew what part of the town it came from he should know how to dispose of it; then he told us to go to the King's Head public-house; I and Brown went, and left the bed and bedding there. He came to us in five minutes; he asked us what we asked for it; we told him two pound. He said, he would give us twenty-three shillings, that was all he would give; we agreed to take it. He gave me and

The lower room we call the parlour; it opens into the passage, and the street door is generally upon the latch; we have lodgers in the house, in the two pair. On the 23rd of November, my father went out in the morning to work, and my mother went out just before one; my mother says, she double locked the door. The lodger was out at work. I went out about four o'clock in the afternoon; I did not try the parlour door, it was shut; I opened the latch of the street door, and shut it again. I returned near seven, it was quite dark then; I had no light with me; the street door was open. I went up stairs, and when I was up stairs I heard a noise; I thought it was my mother come home from work. I came down for a light; I observed the parlour door open, and no light in the room; I went over the way to get a light; I was not a minute hardly in getting a light; I returned with a light; I went to go in the parlour, the woman pushed the door, and would not not let me go in; when I found the woman in the room I held the door that she should not come out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the woman, did you - A. I did not; I only heard her voice. I called for assistance. I went out at the street door, and several people came to my assistance; I begged them to hold the street door while I went to my mother. I fetched my mother, and when I returned with my mother, the prisoner was in the passage. My mother went for an officer; two officers came. She said, pray let me out, she wanted to go home, she had a long way to go, as far as Chick-lane, Smithfield; she said, she had come for a peck of coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your mother sell coals - A. No, sir, nothing at all. And she said, she wanted a person of the name of Phillips, a bead-blower.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room where she was - A. I did, before she was taken away from the house. I observed the parlour-door lock had been forced off with an iron crow; I saw the iron crow; it laid between the sacking and the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your mother such an instrument as that - A. No, sir. The prisoner was secured; she had moved a caravan box that stood upon a deal box; she had moved it off the deal box and put it on the bed. The caravan box contained linen, and wearing apparel. The officer took her in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you recollect what time it was your daughter fetched you - A. About ten minutes after seven. I was at work when she fetched me, and when I returned I saw a crowd at my door; I went into the house, and saw the prisoner there; the prisoner was in the passage. I found the parlour door had been broken open; the lock had been forced off the door; it was on the ground, and there was an iron crow between the bed and the sacking.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any such instrument as that in your house - A. No. My caravan box was turned topsy-turvy upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing - A. She said, she came from Smithfield for a peck of coals; she enquired for a Mr. Phillips, a bead-blower, at No. 3; my house is No. 9. There is no such name of that trade in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23rd of November, I was sent for; I went to the house immediately, and another officer got to the house about seven o'clock. I saw the prisoner in the passage, near the door; the door was then open. I took her into the parlour to search her; I found nothing particular on her, only some halfpence, and the key of her own door. I saw the lock of the parlour laying on the floor, it had been forced off. On searching the bed, this iron crow was found;

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010005"/>JURY. It is a large spike nail; it is not a crow.</p>
               <p>Wood. I have no doubt, in my own mind that the door was forced with that instrument. I asked the prisoner if that instrument was hers; she denied it, and said she was going for some coals. She said she lived in West-street, Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is West-street from Martha's-buildings - A. At least half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she anything with her with which she could bring the coals - A. Yes, there was a bag. I told her it was a long way to come for coals; she then said she wanted a Mr. Phillips, a bead-blower; she was informed he lived at No. 3, in that place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband is abroad. I have four children. I had been out at work; I came home; my daughter said there were no coals; I went out to get some; as I went down stairs a woman asked me if I knew Mr. Phillips, a bead-blower; I said yes, but I did not know where he lived; she said in Old-street-road, and she would shew me. I went with her to this court in Old-street; she told me it was No. 3. I counted the doors; I went in at the third door from the road; I saw the young woman; I thought it might be Mr. Phillips's daughter going up stairs. I knocked at the door; the young woman came down stairs; she said, there is somebody there. I went up stairs; they fastened me in. I came down stairs again. I never went in my room whatever there. They laughed; I thought they were joking: she said I should stay in until she fetched somebody for me. If I had been a thief I could have run away, and not have staid in that manner. It is far from my disposition to go a thieving. I depend upon my honest labour for my support. I was never in the parlour until the officer put me in.</p>

            ; he lives in the house himself, and the prisoner lodged in the house. All the other part of the house is let out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you took the prisoner up - A. On the 11th of November, last month.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, tell me all you know of this transaction - A. A few days back the prisoner passed my door; he said he was just come out of the country; he asked me if I could tell him of a private lodging I told him no. I asked him where he came from; he said from Doncaster in Yorkshire; I replied, that is just by where I came from, come in, and stop a bit, I will enquire for you. After he came in I spoke to him about them that I knew; he said he knew them also; I then said, you can sleep with me until I can get you a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he from that time sleep with you - A. Yes, except the two nights that he slept out of his lodging. When he came back the first time he said he had been robbed; the first time I thought he had been robbed; the second time I thought he had not been robbed. He came home with the same story; after dinner I said I would go with him to the house where he had been robbed, which was of a Sunday. I then went with him to the house, and then from the story he had told I supposed it to be true, and then the next day we obtained a warrant to apprehend the people; they got clear. I told him, although he had been unfortunate he should have victuals and lodging with me until he got employment; so it went on for a fortnight. This was the second or third night that he slept out; he said with me from the first night until the Thursday fortnight following. He got up; I thought he went out to get employment; he soon returned again; that was the 11th of last month; he returned back in half an hour after he went out; he said he thought there was nothing to be done in London, he thought he would go off into the country. I told him I would give him some victuals to eat as he had no money. He seemed to say he was going towards the North, and seemed anxious to get away. I gave him an eighteen-penny piece to get a pot of beer; his hand shook, which led me to suppose all was not right. When he was gone for the beer I went and unlocked a caddy that I had got, and found that I had lost fifteen pound in bank notes; two five-pound notes, two two-pound notes, and a one-pound note. There was some money left behind, but that was shut down under the lid of the caddy. The caddy was still locked. Soon after, he came back with the porter; I accused him of taking the notes. He denied it, and said that he had not got it. After some time talking with him, begging him to give me the money, he would not; I sent for an officer; his name is

            . The officer came; I then told the prisoner if he would give me the money I would forgive him. The officer told him to give up the money. I then gave charge of him, and he went out with the officer. I did not go with them; I staid in my shop. In about fifteen minutes be returned with the officer, and the officer brought back the fifteen pound that I had lost, but I did not see the notes until I saw them at Marlborough-street office the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after - A. About an hour and a half I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop do you keep - A. A chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the caddy stand in your shop - A. No, in a drawer in my bed room. I don't think the drawer was locked; the caddy was locked, and the key in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had ever opened the caddy in the presence of the prisoner - A. Yes, frequently of a night I have took money out and put money in while the prisoner was sitting there.</p>
               <p>Q. During all the time the prisoner was with you was the prisoner in any employment - A. No, except doing an errand for me, which he always seemed extremely willing. That is all I know, except speaking to the notes when they are produced.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NEVILL. I am an officer of Marybone, and assistant watchhouse-keeper. I was sent for to go to Mr. Leach's. I went there; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010006"/>and Mr. Leach were talking together. Mr. Leach wished to have his money; he said he thought it a cruel thing of him if he did not assist him in finding it; he did not wish to have; him but he did not like to lose his money, as he had been so kind to him. The prisoner said he had not got it; he refused to look for it. Mr. Leach then said he must give him in my custody. The prisoner asked me if he was given in my custody should I prosecute him. I said, I should not prosecute, but if Mr. Leach gave him in custody I should not let him go again. I took him in custody. The prisoner called and asked me if I would permit him to go and find the money. I told him I had no objection to his finding the money, but I must go with him. I went with him into Hyde-park; he turned short of the right hand side of the Cumberland gate; he walked first, and I followed him about two hundred yards under the wall; he went up to the wall, there he stopped, pulled up a turf, and then pulled up something. The notes were doubled up in his hand; I could not see them. He brought his hand towards his clothes, as if he was going to put them in his pockets. I immediately seized him by the wrist, and said I must see what is in your hand. I pulled the notes out of his hand by force. I immediately then put the notes in my pocket unexamined, any further than I could see</p>
               <p>"Five," outside. I brought him back to Mr. Leach's house first, and told Mr. Leach that I had the prisoner and the notes both. These are the notes. I took the prisoner to Marybone watchhouse, and when I had locked him up I examined the notes. It was so near the time of going to Marlborough-street, I did not shew the notes to Mr. Leach until I was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the notes - A. I can swear to the notes; there is the two five-pound notes, two two-pound notes, and a one pound note; I know them to be my notes by the marks upon the back of them; the two five pound notes are marked; one with the letter N upon one of the fives, the other with the letter R.</p>
               <p>"February" I remember perfectly well upon this one. The two two's have the names of the persons I took them of in the neighbourhood; Mrs. Collins is written by herself; the other is Mrs. Gibson; I wrote that with my own hand. I am certain they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the notes to take to the bank; I carried them to the bank in Hyde-park, and put them in the bank. The officer said he would make a little money of me; and Mr. Leach said he would not appear against me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never gave him any notes to carry any where, nor entrusted him with money only for a pot of beer.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Starey - A. Four years and about a month. The stable has been occupied with the horse ever since I have been with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing but the stable - A. The coach-house. I sleep over the coach-house. On the evening of the 20th of November I took the horse and chaise down to the stable at ten o'clock in the evening; after I had taken the horse out of the chaise. I put the chaise in the coach-house, and the horse in the stable, and after I had fastened the door up I went to bed. The reins and great coat were in the chaise in the coach-house. I locked the stable door myself. I went to bed about half past ten o'clock, as near as possible. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning precisely. It was light at seven o'clock. When I came down I came into the coach-house to get into the stable. I saw before I came down stairs the coach-house door had been broken open. It was Saturday evening that I went to bed; on Sunday morning I heard a noise; I am not certain to the time; it was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you, know it was not before twelve o'clock that you heard the noise - A. I am sure it was not; I had not much sleep before I heard the noise. On Sunday morning it was I heard the noise, it was like as if something had fallen; I got up in the room, suspecting the horse was loose, but not hearing any thing afterwards I went to bed again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you perceived the coach-house door was forced - A. Yes. When I went down stairs I found one of the doors were open, and the lock was broken off. I missed the great coat and the pair of reins of the chaise harness. I saw them again on the Monday morning.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 21st of November last, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man, each of them had a bag on their shoulders; one man went down Elder-walk; the prisoner past me; I was going home down Lower-street, Islington; I stopped the prisoner; I asked him what he had got; he said, a few turnips. I asked him if that was all; he said, no, he had got some reins that he had found in a ditch. I told him I was not satisfied with that, he must go with me, and as we were walking together I met a brother officer that has the care of the watch-house. When I took him to this officer, he made his escape from me. I commanded the watchman to assist me. We pursued him beyond the Britannia fields; there the watchman got up to him first, and took him. He is here. I secured him, and brought him to the watchhouse. I left the bag in the care of the other officer, while I pursued him. These are the reins that were in the bag.</p>

The prisoner said, he had turnips; I said, you had better examine the bag. I saw a pair of reins in the bag; there were some turnips also in the bag. I said to the prisoner, this has a very suspicious look; where did you get these reins; he said, a man, a rat catcher, that he knew desired him at Stoke Newington to bring them to Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cutler. When you met the prisoner in Lower-street, which way did he appear to be making from - A. From Newington-green.</p>
               <p>Q. to Franklin. You were saying that a rat catcher desired him to bring them from Stoke Newington to Islington - A. Yes; he was to make a shilling or two of them if he could. I then said to Cutler that it had a very suspicious look. Cutler ordered the watchman to assist in taking him to the watch-house; the watchman's name is Shirley. Then Cutler stepped a little nearer to the prisoner; the prisoner started across the road; directly Shirley and Cutler ran after him. I took care of the bag and reins, and after they put the prisoner in the watch-house, I gave Cutler the bag again.</p>

               <p>REV. EDWARD BOWEN. I live at Stanmore. On the 13th of November last, I was coming to town in a post chaise; I had three portmanteaus on the foot-board with straps, and passing through <placeName id="t18131201-5-crimeloc24">Bow</placeName>

                        targets="t18131201-5-off21 t18131201-5-crimeloc24"/> I heard a knocking under the chaise; I looked out before and behind; I saw nothing but men in a cart. I again heard the noise was forward; I looked out; I saw a hand coming from under the chaise; I opened the door, and called stop. I then saw the prisoner recovering himself from stooping, run off; I pursued him, and brought him back. The post-boy pointed out to me the portmanteaus; I saw the straps hanging down.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what had been moved - A. Instead of the portmanteaus standing right square, they were a little oblique, but still on the foot-board; they were a little out of the line they had been placed when we sat off from Romford. Neither of the portmanteaus were removed from the spot where they had been.</p>
               <p>COURT. It was an attempt to commit a felony, but very properly prevented; it will be unnecessary to go any further in this case. There was an attempt to commit a felony, but the party was interrupted before it was done.</p>

            . I am a broker. On the 15th of November, I saw the prisoner in company with two others, near Great Turnstile; they were endeavouring to commit a robbery at the corner of Turnstile; it was very dark. They throwed open the door of a shop, at the corner of Great Turnstile; the prisoner was engaged in endeavouring to get a silk shawl out of the shop; his head was just within the door. This was not Mr. Johnson's house. He was prevented, they came, and shut the door immediately. These three boys then went on, until they came to Mr. Johnson's door; when I placed myself on the right hand side of the way. They were about the door for a quarter of an hour; they were endeavouring to take the prints from out of the shop, and at the moment a waggon passed by, which hindered me from seeing whether they took any thing; before that, I took particular notice of the linen, where it was placed, and at the moment the waggon was gone by, I noticed a piece of print was missing. I still kept my station, and I missed one of the lads. In about five minutes after that, the prisoner went into the shop, as if he was going to purchase a print, laying hold of the print, and looking at it, and at the same time he laid hold of it he brought it out of the shop; I immediately then run over the way, and went to lay hold of the prisoner, when he dropped the print; he had it in his hand, in the street; I saw him drop it. He run about ten yards. he was never out of my sight; I then laid hold of him, brought him back to the spot where he had dropped the print; I picked up the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010008"/>print, and took the prisoner into the shop; Mr. Johnson said, it was his print. I then conveyed the prisoner to Bow-street office. This is the printed cotton; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Johnson. Look at that printed cotton - A. Yes; it has our shop mark; I am positive it is mine and my partner's property; there is about twenty-one yards of printed cotton at two shillings and three-pence a yard; the value of it is about two pound four shillings. They took two pieces of print.</p>
               <p>Q. About this time who else was in the shop - A. Two customers, the boy, and myself; the shop-man was gone up to tea: the boy was in the back shop; at the moment he was clearing the goods out of the back shop into the front shop. I never knew it was lost until Vaughn brought it in.</p>

On the 18th of November, both the prisoners entered Mr. Hart's shop, they asked for some white calico; I shewed them three or four pieces. After a short time they pitched upon one; I cut them a yard and a half off. They then asked for some pink muslin; that being in the back, there is a partition that divides the two shops. I shewed them two pieces of two different shades of colour; there being a piece of the same colour in the front shop, they conceived it was the same colour; they both went into the front shop. After looking at it the second time, they said, they would prefer one of the two that I had been shewing them in the back shop. I then left them in the shop, ran for the two pieces which I had been shewing them in the back shop; they pitched upon the palest shade of the two; I cut them off a quarter of a yard, the quantity they wanted; they paid me for the two articles, and went out of the shop. In about an hour and a half, Lee, the officer, came into the shop, and brought the calico which they had taken; I owned it, that being Mr. Hart's property.</p>

            . I am an officer. About five o'clock on Thursday evening, the 18th of November, I was sent for, at Mr. James, a haberdasher, Holborn bridge; Mr. James desired me to take the two prisoners in custody. I proceeded to search the prisoners. Upon the person of Carpenter, I found this piece of calico. I then searched Wheeler, and in a small basket which she held in her hand, I found these two pieces of calico. In conveying the prisoners to the Compter, the prisoners particularly requested me to keep this piece of calico, and said it was at my service the piece found upon Carpenter, if I would keep it for my own use they would he much obliged to me. I made enquiry in the neighbourhood; I judged I should find the owner. I went to Mr. Hart's shop, and before I produced the yard and a half of white cotton, and the quarter of a yard of pink muslin, I had found in Wheeler's basket, the last witness told me he had sold them two articles. I then discovered the owner of the seven yards of calico found upon Carpenter.</p>
               <p>Blomer. The yard and a half of white calico, and quarter of a yard of pink cambric muslin, Carpenter purchased of me; this piece Lee, the officer, brought in is the piece stolen; it is seven yards of calico, value half a guinea; they stole, they did not pay for it. I am sure it is Mr. Hart's property; Mr. Hart's private mark is upon it; it cost half a guinea. I did not miss the calico before it was brought back by Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shopmen does Mr. Hart employ - A. There are four sons constantly employed; two of them were in the shop while the prisoners were there.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; called one witness, (each,) who gave them a good character.</p>

I went after the prisoner; I asked him where the pig was that he had taken off the hook; he said, he had seen none.

               <p>Q. How long had he been out of your observation - A. Perhaps fifteen months; he appeared as well as ever I saw him in my life, quite composed. After I referred him to the back door to go for his trunks, he went out at the front door, and came back at the front door; he might be absent a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes: when he came into the warehouse he asked for Bottomley again; Bottomley was not returned. He said nothing more; he went out. It was past one o'clock before I saw him again; I then saw him at Mr. Haigh's desk.</p>

I said, bless me, Thomas, are you here this morning: what! have you got out of St. Luke's; yes, he said, he got out that morning out of the window. I said, it was an unfortunate circumstance; I had understood he was to be out soon; it was unfortunate that he had broke out. He then said, he was going into the country; he wished me to let him have two or three pounds; I paused for a short time; I said I would go up stairs and see. I came down again directly, and told him he should have the money. I had a ten-pound note in my pocket-book; I sent out for change; he had the money before he went. He stopped and breakfasted with me.

             gave him the money, not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him how much money he had - A. I did not ask him any questions; he breakfasted with me, my wife, Mrs. Haigh, and Mrs. Haigh's daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he was going - A. I said to him, you seem quite well; he said, yes. I asked him if he was well; he said, yes. I then said, as you are going into the country, when you get down there what do you intend to do. He answered, that he had laid all his plans before he came out. I enquired no further about it, being in haste to get away; the time was arrived which I usually appear at the warehouse. I went away, leaving the prisoner with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you in the whole - A. Altogether I was not more than five minutes with him. It was half past eight when I first saw him. I went out before nine o'clock; I was absent from him part of the time dressing myself. He appeared to me quite cool and in his senses. He might be insane and I not discover it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before he was confined - A. I had not seen him since February last. I called twice at Hoxton to see him; when I went to enquire for him they shewed me into a room; he was confined at Hoxton, in a mad-house. The keeper came along with him. I talked with him. I did not stop more than five minutes. I asked him if he was well. He said he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the habit of seeing him for a long time before - A. No. He was sent to Hoxton in October. Before the 20th of October I had not seen him for eleven years. I do not recollect the time I saw him before that. I did not see him from the 20th of October to the early part of November, not above three or four times.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now, when you did see him before he was confined, what was his appearance to you - A. had heard before I saw him of his printing paper about his giving peace to all the world. I said, he certainly must be mad. I said that on seeing the papers. When I saw him and conversed with him he did not appear to me to be insane, but he might be, and I not able to discover it. Before the prisoner was sent to the madhouse at Hoxton, I had heard that he had printed and published papers. I went and saw him at Hoxton; I was there five minutes; I conversed with him upon these two occasions at Hoxton; he was then the same as when I conversed with him on the 30th of November; he then appeared to me to be as sane as on the morning of Tuesday last. I saw no difference.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner before - A. Never until Tuesday the 30th of November, then he came to my shop between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, he said, he wished to look at a pair of pistols that were in the window; he dealt with me for them; he gave me one pound fifteen shillings for them. Very little conversation passed between us, and what did, was about the mould for casting the bullets; that he was very particular about. He asked if the mould was the right mould that belonged to the pistols; he examined the barrals, and was very particular about them, he unscrewed the barrals; I told him, I had no doubt but it was the right that mould belonged to the pistols. I had some difficulty to persuade him that it was so, but upon my warranting them, he said, he would take them. He then said, I presume you can make some abatement; he then produced two one-pound notes; I gave him five shillings change. He seemed to have his circumspection as well as any other person might be in purchasing; he was attending to see if the screw fitted.</p>

He mentioned his own escape, and named the different places he had been in, and mentioned where he was going to when he left me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in his senses - A. His behaviour was melancholy in the extreme; his sentences were incoherent. I mentioned to him that I thought he ought to be happy with his uncle; his reply was, that he was crowded, he had not room enough; and at another moment he said my brother was in my house; I declared he was not. His appearance was not collected, but I cannot judge.</p>

Here, well done, what is the buz; I have got a bill against you for gratitude; well, well, I'll look at the accompt, and see how it stands. Oh, Daniel, the balance is in my favour. Why, my little man, what sort of clerks do you keep; they have not given me credit for one single thing; what countrymen are they. Oh, the Lillies, the Lillies, are you Lillies; stop Daniel, I have got a bill to execute against you of several thousands, for defamation. NB. It seems entirely to depend upon your clerks; send them to Goggan before they ruin you. Mr. Haigh, for you I have a great regard. The demand I have upon you, and others, must be in force; I have sworn by earth, and shall I couple hell. The debt I must have, and will. Madness in your mind is a satisfaction; in mine it is is a disgrace. Duty demands satisfaction, and satisfaction I'll have, or I will perish. I ask, and I will have a joint affidavit, or ten thousand pounds; the joint affidavit to be taken by you, Daniel Haigh, Mrs. Haigh, Mrs. Hutchius, and you, the above named men, women, and children, to swear before the Lord Mayor, and furnish me with the affidavit; that you, neither before or hereafter, in public or private, say, that

            , and others whom it may concern.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Daniel Haigh. When you returned to town on the 1st of December, did Rhodes return - A. He left me after the date of the second letter, before the third. I believe the day after I received the second letter, I called him into the accompting-house, and settled with him; he gave me a receipt for the balance, as to his wages.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his conduct at that time - A. He was exact in business, the same as he used to be, and after we had settled, his conduct then was exactly as it used to be. When I asked him what he saw in my conduct to demand of me five thousand pounds to overthow the Government; he said, that would not do; he must have a larger sum now.</p>
               <p>Q. After the last letter, did you take any measure to put him in confinement - A. I went, and consulted with Mr. Stephens, in the Old Jewry; he was put in a private house at Hoxton, at Miles's, at Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a house for insane persons - A. It is; he continued there I think two or three months; he was removed from there to St. Luke's, by my permission.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 30th of November - A. I saw him pass my accomping-house window; I have no doubt he saw me; he looked in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in you went backwards - A. I went with two gentlemen and my son; I don't think I should have gone, only I was called away. A friend met me behind the Bank; I told him what had happened. I did not see any thing of the transaction of the death of Prestow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive that printed paper of the prisoner - A. No; I received some one at the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The day that you invited Rhodes to dine with you at Battersea Rise, you had a long conversation with him - A. Yes, we talked together a good while; he talked of giving peace to the whole world.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it very wild, and in consequence of what you observed you engaged Mr. Haslam to come and see him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And after that, you finding he was insane, you had him confined - A. I did, and when we heard that he was away from St. Luke's, assistance was sent to get him back again if he could be found.</p>

             was at Ramsgate at the time he first mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you any printed papers - A. I heard there were such things; I conversed with him upon the subject of the printed papers while Mr. Haigh was at Ramsgate; he seemed determined of giving peace to the world; I talked to him about it. I suggested the great impropriety of publishing a paper of that sort; he went off immediately, and stopped the publication of it. In short he went out of the house to do that, when he returned he told me he had suppressed it. I told him not to circulate any more; I found his name at the bottom of the paper. I told him we should have a number of people come to the house, when the paper was circulated. He went about his business as usual. Except in that single subject there was no departure from reason.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his natural temper and disposition - A. I always thought him very sullen and obstinate; he was always very friendly with me; we were upon the best terms, in short, we could not be otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010013"/>Q. On the 30th of November, did you see him at Mr. Haigh's warehouse - A. I did; when I first saw him it might be about noon; when he came in I was busy in the warehouse; I went up to him, and shook hands with him. I asked him how he was; he said, pretty well. I said, you look very well. He said; how is Mrs. Charles. I asked him, how they treated him; he said, pretty well; better than he expected. I said, you look pretty well Rhodes. He then went into the warehouse, where there were some furniture prints lay; we began talking about one thing or the other, that might have taken place in the business; there were one pile of prints he observed in particular; he said, this is some of the old stock, and I rather think it was some of the old stock. We went on about these prints; he took down one of these prints, put it on the counter, he observed the date, and seemed to think they were part of the old stock; his uncle did not join in the conversation. I conceived his conversation was rational. I was told that a gentleman wanted to speak with Mr.

             quitted the accompting-house before you went up stairs - A. He quitted the accompting-house when we sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he quit the accompting-house without passing Rhodes - A. Yes, he could. I remained upon the top of the stairs a few minutes; while I remained on the stairs, I saw Rhodes quit the warehouse, and go into the accounting-house; I stood there until I saw Prestow come into the warehouse; it is an open stair-case. Prestow went into the accompting-house, he perceived that Rhodes had a pistol, he retreated, and stepped back; Prestow had a small stick in his hand, he might hold the stick up; I cannot say whether he did or no. Prestow advanced a second time; I saw him go into the accompting-house, and I heard the report of a pistol; after the report of the pistol, I saw Towe run in, and I ran in after Towe; to help to secure the prisoner. Towe was endeavouring to take the other pistol from him. I ran up to the prisoner, and put my arm round his neck, in order to secure him too; Towe was on the other side endeavouring to take the pistol from him; we secured him. I saw some man in the passage, I beckoned to the man to come and assist; when he came in I run off to get a surgeon; Prestow was laying with his head on one of the steps bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the stick that Prestow had in his hand - A. A man told me afterwards that was the stick.</p>
               <p>Metcalf. I was sent out to fetch Prestow.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Prestow - A. He was <rs id="t18131201-11-viclabel60" type="occupation">serjeant of the night</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether Prestow was known to the prisoner - A. I don't know. When I returned with Prestow, I stood at the right hand side of the accompting-house door outside, in the warehouse. The prisoner then was in the place where Mr. Haigh generally sits. Prestow went to the door; the prisoner held the pistol up; the prisoner said, he had another; that is all I heard him say. Prestow stood at the outside; I stood behind him. Prestow had a stick in his hand; Pristow said, he had a pistol. Prestow advanced the second time; I stood where I was. I don't think Prestow spoke, holding the stick down. It appeared to me that he struck with the stick, to strike Rhodes, I cannot say whether he did or no; the prisoner fired in the twinkling of an eye; I saw the discharge: I saw it flash in the pan; I ran backwards at first when I saw the flash I heard the report, Prestow fell dead, and never stired in the least as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Prestow advanced near enough to reach the prisoner with his stick - A. He was within half a yard of him. There are two steps in the accompting-house where Rhodes was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the Coroner, that Prestow struck his legs - A. It appeared to me that he struck where his legs was; I think he meant to strike his legs in my own mind; I cannot exactly say whether he hit him or not.</p>

            , went to seek after him; I first saw him at Mr. Haigh's accompting-house, about one o'clock in the day, he was in the warehouse; soon after I saw him, I said, I was come for him; he drew a pistol from his pocket, told me to take care of myself; he presented the pistol at me; I withdraw to another part of the warehouse, towards the door; he walked backwards and forwards in the warehouse. I saw him go into the accompting-house; I saw Prestow come. The prisoner was alone in the accompting-house; when Prestow came, Prestow opened the accompting-house door. I could see the prisoner, I was on one side of Prestow. Prestow went a little way in the accompting-house, with the door in his hand; the door opens inward; the prisoner presented a pistol at Prestow; Prestow said, oh, dear man, you lay for shooting, do you; and withdrew. Prestow was a powerful man. Prestow advanced the second time quick up to the place where Rhodes was; I did not see Prestow aim a blow, or see him have a stick the second time; the first time I did. I saw Rhodes present the pistol at Prestow the second time, I heard the report, Prestow fell immediately, he shewed no signs of life afterwards, as I saw. Upon Prestow falling, I rushed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010014"/>forwards to secure Rhodes; Mr. Charles and somebody came to my assistance; I took the pistols from him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you rushed forward at him did you see any pistol - A. He presented a pistol, and snapped the pistol at me; I rushed forward and laid hold of him. He was endeavouring to cock the pistol again; I took the pistol from him. The other pistol I believe was down on the ground; I am sure he had two pistols. After I had secured him I took him back to St. Luke's myself, and then the officers, Harrison, and Cartwright, took him in custody at St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you convers with him as you were taking him back - A. I did; he told me if the other pistol had gone off he should have shot me as dead as Prestow.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen. I received these pistols at Mr. Haigh's house, one had been discharged, the other was loaded with powder and ball. I asked him where he got the pistols; he told me he bought them in Tottenham-court-road. I took the prisoner from St. Luke's; Harrison was with me. He said, he got the powder and hall in Oxford-street. I asked him where he got the horn that the powder was in; he said in the Haymarket. I then asked him if he knew Prestow, he said, he knew him very well to be an officer, and a resolute man, for he had seen him handle an Irishman bringing him up Aldermanbury; he knew him to be a resolute man. I then said, suppose Mr. Nalder had come, would you have shot him! yes, he said, or any other person that came to molest him. He gave very regular answers to every question I put to him; I took him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I feel myself an injured person; it appears the capital part of the charge is done away; I need not defend myself on that head. In October, 1812, I published that paper; I was taken up and placed in the Compter by Mr. Nalder, the City marshal, he said he would take me before the Lord Mayor; he began to search me; I made no resistance. He took from me a knife, and when I was in the coach I asked him whether I might have a private or public examination; he said, which I pleased. I said I prefered a public one; I was taken into a private room in the Mansion House; the letters were all taken before the Lord Mayor, read, and all sworn to, except the third; Mr. Haigh could not swear to that. A gentleman said, his lordship would not do any thing in it, he would wish to defer it until the Thursday week. I had an idea that they were going to take me to a private mad-house; said, I had no objection of going to Newgate. I was sent back to the Poultry Compter, and on the day that I was to be taken to the Mansion House, instead of taking me there, two keepers from the mad-house came for me; Mr. Nalder said, there was an order for me to go to the mad-house. I was shewn into the turnkey's room; the two keepers came in, they said, they had an order to take me; I pulled my coat off to have the straight jacket on; they said, I was quiet enough. When they got me a few hundred yards towards Miles's mad-house, they tied my hands, they searched me; I had some money they did not find; I gave that up. I did not know what a place a mad-house was, and on the 9th of April, I was taken from there to St. Luke's Hospital. When I had been there three or four months, I was informed the physician said I was quite well enough to go out; I then thought they had no right to keep me there after the physician said I was well; I was determined to break out. I got out, and got the money that has been stated. I bought the pistols to protect myself, as it may appear to the court and the jury. This man has stated that I knew Prestow; I did not know the man was an officer. I found he came to take me, but I never heard he was an officer until I was in confinement. They have stated that I presented the pistol at Mr. Prestow, I do not think they could see, except looking through a glass-door; I do not think that is legal to swear looking through glass.</p>

            . I am the apothecary of Bethlem Hospital. I have been conversant with the complaints of insane persons about twenty years; I have in that time had the opportunity of seeing many thousand cases. In November last, by desire of Mr. Haigh, the prisoner was introduced to me under a feiganed name, rather against my will; I had one interview with Rhodes for near two hours; my opinion is that he is absolutely insane; on my certificate he was put into Hoxton mad-house. I invited him a dozen times at Miles's; his mind was in a state of insanity; I delivered my opinion that he was an uncurable lunatic.</p>

            . I am the apothecary of St. Luke's. The prisoner was brought to our house on Friday, the 9th of last April. I saw him almost dailey; he was brought to the Hospital in a deranged state; he continued in a deranged state; he was always so. I saw him on Monday before he escaped; he was in the same deranged state. I considered him unsafe to go into society.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. From what do you form your opinion that I am insane - A. From your action, and ideas, and your general conduct told me that you were an improper person to be at liberty.</p>
               <p>Q. You judge from ideas; you have a good opinion of yourself. Do you remember ever my being confined with a strait jacket, or a hand-cuff - A. I do not.

               <p>Q. Why did I not shoot my uncle when I was there - A. I coneeive you had not a fair opportunity of doing it.</p>

I saw him every Monday, and in my judgment he was insane the whole of the time. I should consider it imprudent that he should be at large. He certainly was not capable of judging whether his actions were right or wrong.</p>

I remember Mr. Moxon being there, and near ten o'clock I missed the coats and hats off the chairs. I had seen them on the chairs. I went into the room, and asked the gentlemen if they had missed them; they said, no. I recollected in the course of the evening seeing two persons coming and making some enquiries, but whether they were the prisoners I cannot say. That was about nine o'clock; it was dark then.

            . I am an officer. I was the person that brought the great coats into the Bath hotel. On the 10th of November I was upon duty that evening; I was at the Gloucester coffee-house, seeing the mails off, as we generally do of a night. We attend regular from eight o'clock to a quarter past eight. The two prisoners passed the Gloucester coffee-house. I am sure of their persons; I knew them well; that induced me to follow them: they crossed over to Harlington-street to the door of the Bath hotel; they walked by the door several times; they entered the avenue; that is the covered way of the street door, before you come to the glass door; they then went round to the other door in Piccadilly, they went into the passage there; that is an open<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010016"/>passage; they returned back into Harlington-street, and at that door they watched there for some time in and out of that avenue, until there was an opportunity. I saw one of the prisoners push the door open, and go in, and the other held the door until he came out. They both then came away together, as close as if they were arm in arm together. I followed them down Harlington-street; I had placed Payntington and Jones at the corner of Harlington-street, to prevent their escape. When I got near to to them I called out to Payntington and Jones; I then saw something drop from one of the prisoners. I cannot say which of them, nor could I tell what it was until I came to it. When they came out I perceived a bulk in one of their arms; which of them had it I cannot swear. It dropped from one or other of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you see sufficient so as to be sure that one of the men that dropped something was one of the men that came from the hotel - A. I did. I am sure I found in Chambers's pocket a pair of gloves. I observed a button at the wrist of the gloves. The next morning I saw the gloves that Jones found in the necessary; they were the same gloves. Chambers asked me for the gloves and handkerchief I found in his pocket. I gave them him; I thought they were his own. The next morning I saw them again, when Jones found them in the necessary; they are the same gloves I found in Chambers's pocket.</p>

In the mean time, Mary Hayes, my washerwoman was with us in the house; she confessed of taking many things. She gave up some duplicates to Miller, the officer, and said she had taken many things to pawn. She, Miller, and I, went to the pawnbrokers, Mr. Fleming, in Whitechapel. I there saw a silver soup-ladle which I knew to be my own. On the Saturday evening following the prisoner came to my house; she gave me a considerable number of duplicates out of her pocket; I said it was a shocking business she was engaged in; I asked her what could have induced her to have done so. She said, her family had been the ruin of her; she had to pay her brother's funeral expences. I said, I could not pass it over. I sent for the officer, and gave him the duplicates.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your house robbed on the night of the 27th or the morning of the 28th of November - A. Yes. On the night of the 27th, I went to bed at twelve o'clock; we were all in bed by twelve o'clock. My servant lad saw the house properly secured. My sister went to bed last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself see that the house was properly secured - A. I did not. I was up first the next morning; it was day-light then. That was Sunday morning. On my going down stairs the first thing I found was this closet broken open where this property was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was this closet - A. Adjoining the shop, in the centre of the house. The door had been fastened with a lock. The door was wide open; the wood work had given way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen that door locked the night before - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say when you went to bed it was safe - A. My sister kept the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was in the closet - A. Not exactly. It was the place that we usually kept our copper money; and the boiling house was broken open. There is a range of buildings from my dwelling-house to my boiling-house. We go into a yard out of the house, into a washhouse. We cannot go into the boiling-house without going into the wash-house in the yard; that yard is enclosed by a brick wall all round. The boiling-house appeared to have been wrenched open by a crow, or some such instrument. There were no fastenings to the closet in the boiling-house. There are two doors to go through before you get out of the boiling-house to that closet. The back door of the house was upon the latch; it was not locked. They could not get into the yard without getting over the wall, or getting into the boiling-house. A pair of large gates were forced open; they go into a back street; these gates were forced open; they were shut the over night. There were some silver spoons missed out of the cupboard; they have not been recovered. I saw an instrument fitted to the place by the officers.</p>

               <p>Q. I mean out of the house into the yard - A. All the doors of the house were shut; there is a pully, to it, no fastening at all. The boiling-house door that opens into the yard that was shut with a bolt; I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the closet adjoining the shop - A. I kept the key of that; that closet is in the middle of the house; I know it was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was in that closet - A. Copper tied up in five-shilling papers, and a few half-crown papers.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of halfpence do you suppose them to be - A. About fifty pound. I tied up all the money myself. On Sunday morning I was up first; I came down stairs about half past eight o'clock, and when I came down all the papers of halfpence were gone out of that closet. Me and my brother, a servant maid, and a servant lad, slept in the house that night. I know nothing of the prisoner; I never recollect seeing him before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday morning last, the 28th of November, about eight o'clock in the morning. Freeman and Dalton were with me. We went to Weatherhead's garden, Virginia-row, Bethnal-green. We had information that the prisoner lived in that house. He was not at home then. We wanted until nine o'clock; the prisoner came home. I opened the door to him when he knocked; I seized him immediately. I had found these halfpence in the sitting-room; they were all found before he came home. We secured him after a little resistance. I asked him whose halfpence these were; he said he knew nothing about them; some person must have brought them; he asked who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You found his wife there did you - A. Yes, and she said some woman in a blue and white gown.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010018"/>There are more halfpence than a man can carry at once; I then took the prisoner to the office. On Monday morning I went with Dalton to the prisoner's house, and found this crow.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find at his house at Bethnall-green, before the prisoner came there - A. I found this quantity of halfpence, which is five pounds, or thereabouts; they are in paper parcels, tied up in this apron; my fellow officers found the other things. A clock hung up in the room, I asked him whose that was; he said that was his, but the halfpence were not. His wife and three children were in the house, nobody else; there were only two rooms. The oldest of his children is ten or eleven years of age.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday morning, a quarter before seven, I awoke. I got up, dressed myself, and went on purpose to get something to drink; there was a man I had spoken to in the week, I asked him to dine with me on Sunday; I went to where he lodged, in Black Horse yard; I enquired of the niece whether he was in; the girl went up stairs, and asked him if he was willing to get up, because William was below. I went up stairs and the man that was with me; we had a drop of something to drink, and when we came down stairs I went directly to my own place, and directly I came to my own door, them gentlemen catched hold of me; I said gentlemen, what do you mean by this; they said, you know. They took the other man in custody as well as me; he has been liberated.</p>

It appeared to me to be a whole sheep. I asked him where they got the sheep from; they told me out of Mr. Vass's field. I asked him if it was Mr. Vass's sheep; he said, no; they were taken into grass. He begged forgiveness, and that I would not take him before the magistrate on account of his wife and family; he said it was the first time, and the only sheep he ever had. After I had secured Luck, I secured Taylor; they both begged for mercy; they both informed me it was the first sheep they ever had taken, and the only one.

Walsh and I went to search for the two skins; we first of all called upon Champion, Mr. Vass's bailiff; I asked him whether he had any sheep laying near the ground of Mr. Wilson; he said, yes. The prisoners had described down by Mutton-lane, near Mr. Wilson's; they told me the sheep lay in a field near Mr. Wilson's. We counted the sheep eighty-eight; we searched about for the skins; we could not find it. We could see the places where two different sheep had been killed. After missing two sheep by the shepherd's account, the constable and I went to Taylor's house; Taylor's house is about three quarters of a mile across the fields from where the sheep were; we searched his house; in a sort of a back house there, we found a sheep cut up, and salted down in a large red pan.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the same morning - A. Yes; the mutton was cut in pieces not bigger than a pound and a half or two pounds, not at all as a butcher would cut. The meat was quite warm in the middle of the pan.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour in the morning was this - A. Between nine and ten; the meat was pressed very tight in the pan, and the pan was covered over with a top, and the cover was made of red earth, the same as the pan, it fitted close; there was a bloody sack just by it. I said to Taylor, you told me you had only one sheep, and you also said, you had thrown the skin into a dell hole; he then said, they had throwed the skins into the brow of the hedge, and Champion found them there; in the mean time we went to Mr. Walsh's Champion found them; I left him in search of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Champion. Where did you find the skins - A. I found them under the brow of a hedge near Mutton-lane, in Mr. Wilson's field; I carried the skins to Mr. Walsh's, the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dawkins. I understood you to say that Taylor said it was the only sheep that then they had taken - A. They both said so; they were both present. When I searched Taylor's house, Taylor was not there; he was in custody with Luck, at Walsh's, the constable. I saw Taylor's wife, I knew it was his house; I enquired; the person that told me said it was Taylor's house, and he said, that is Taylor's wife; she said, she was not. I was with his wife at the house; I never was there with Taylor. He was a prisoner from the time I took him until he was committed. Walsh was with me when I went to Taylor's house.</p>

After the prisoners were secured, I took the sheep on my back; I carried it near three miles to Mr. Dawkins's house; about seven o'clock we took the prisoners to Mr. Walsh's house. I was left in custody with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you apprehended the prisoners - A. Luck said, he had the sheep from Mr. Vass's field. They both begged forgiveness of the crime.</p>
               <p>MR. WALSH. I am a constable of Barnet. Dawkins and Emmitt brought these two prisoners to my house about seven o'clock in the morning; when Dawkins and his partner brought them, the prisoners said they had brought the sheep from Mr. Vass's field, near Mr. Wilson's; we searched about the field; we could not find them. We saw where two sheep had been killed; when we discovered two sheep had been killed, we went to Taylor's house as Dawkins has described before, and after we had taken the meat from Taylor's house, we took the two prisoners before the magistrate. I have had the skins in my custody ever since; these are the skins; I received them from Champion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I branded the hips, on the off hip with the letter B. and here is the B. on the off hip on both these skins; to the best of my knowledge they are my skins.</p>
               <p>Champion. The marks on the skins are exactly the same as the others.</p>
               <p>Luck's Defence. We did it for want; we were greatly in distress.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. I have got four small children. I was greatly in distress. I had my rent to pay; I did not know which way to get a bit of bread.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know him; did he come on board your ship on the 30th of October - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner first - A. When I went on board the second ship from us; the ships were all close together, alongside of one-another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the prisoner before you saw him on board that ship - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had a watch, had not you - A.Yes; the watch was in the cabin, in the bed place; I sleep in the bounds of the big cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when you last saw your watch - A. On the night of the 29th of October, between nine and ten at night, I then saw my watch either in the cabin or the bed place. I missed my watch between twelve and one o'clock. Before I missed my watch, I heard a trampling upon deck; I went upon deck, and asked who it was. I asked the man what he wanted. It was dark; I could not see his person. He told me he was going on board the Mary of Newcastle. I then looked for my watch, it was gone; the man went over our ship, and went over the tier. I called the ships crew up, and told them I was robbed of my watch, and that a man had gone over the tier of the ship, I was suspicious of him; we then got a lanthorn, and went in pursuit of him, and found him in the second ship from us; he was standing at the back part of the rudder trunk,

I took the prisoner to my own ship, and kept him there till day light, I then sent for an officer; the officer came, and took the prisoner before the magistrate. Before the magistrate I laid my watch down on the table; the magistrate gave it into the constable's possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The night being dark the waterman unfortunately put me on board this ship instead of my own; I heard the mate sing out; the waterman said here, take this watch, keep it for me; I did not know whose watch it was; the prosecutor heard me sing out for the waterman.</p>

Yes, he told me he had lost his watch; we then took a lanthorn and went over the tier to look for the man; I saw him behind the rudder trunk in a ship, the next but one to us. I said to the mate, he is here; he began to hustle his clothes, and asked what we wanted with him; he said he was mate of a ship, he had plenty of money and good friends; I said you have got our mate's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010021"/>watch, and we must have it. He said he had no watch. I looked sharp at the prisoner to see what sort of a man he was. I saw the glass of a watch in his right hand. I then told the mate he had a watch in his hand; the mate took hold of the watch. The prisoner said he had not stolen it. He wanted us to put him on board the Mary, and he would shew us the person that took it. We then took the prisoner to our own ship, and the next morning the prisoner was put into the bands of a constable.</p>

On the 17th of September, in the morning, about eight o'clock, the master of a vessel laying next to the brig Samuel; the brig Samuel was then laying at the Custom-house quay; the master of the vessel produced to me this pocket-book, observing that there were ship papers in it; no doubt it belonged to the master of a ship. I examined the book in his presence, and found the papers of the Samuel. On shewing them to the captain and mate of the Samuel, the captain stated these papers were in his book previous to his losing it. This book was found on the deck of the vessel, as if dropped by accident. On examining the letters in the book in a foreign language, which are Portuguese, they got an officer; they went in search of the thief; in so doing, the Samuel went away from the Quay. On the 14th of October following, a Yarmouth vessel was laying at our Quay; her name, the Hannah, Captain Miller On the night, or early the next morning, the prisoner was detected in the state-room in the act of taking his watch, previous to which he had pulled off his shoes and gone into the forecastle and took the boy's jacket; he afterwards went into the captain's cabin, where the captain seized him; he was taken to the Compter.

             - A. He is an old man that sells fish about the streets. The prisoner had lodged there. On my looking into the bundle, I found the pocket-book in the bundle. I came back to Giltspur-street compter, to the prisoner. I took the bundle to the prisoner; I asked him if he knew any thing of the pocket-book; he said, yes, he did; then I asked him if he had the captain's property; he said he had, it was country notes; he could not get rid of it. He said if I would get the captain not to prosecute, he would give up his property; he said he wanted to give up the property to Captain

This was on Tuesday evening; he told us he would give up the property on the following morning, and to go with us, and when we got to No. 14, Drury-lane, I saw it was a large distillers. I said to him, you did not lodge there; he said, no, he should not tell me where it was until he had got a letter from his landlady.

            . I sell things in the street. On the Tuesday before the officer came to my house, the prisoner came to my house; he came in with a handkerchief in my hand; he had a pennyworth of spice-cakes, which he paid for; he had a pipe in his hand; he lighted it, and went to the street door. I was going out to get some cakes. I said to him, do not leave your handkerchief there, perhaps my child may play tricks with it. He left the handkerchief, and went to where he resorted. It is the same handkerchief the officer found.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in it - A. I don't know; it was in the same state that he left it. On the Friday afterwards I asked my child if the man had been for the handkerchief; she said, no. After that, the girl came over; she said, have you a shirt of Antony's. I said I did not know; I had an handkerchief, if you want it, take it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you over find your watch - A. No, the watch has never been found. He would not give up any of the property. I have got my pocket-book, and that is all. This is my pocket-book.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of November, I was stationed at the back door of Mr. Dunman's house, in Petticoat-lane; there is a window there which enabled me to see what was going on in the warehouse. I saw Tongue walk along the warehouse; he had a candle in his hand, and two bundles; he came and opened the back door of the house in Petticoat-lane, when he opened the door, he gave Heseldine two parcels under her blue mantle; she then came out; I followed her into Aldgate High-street; I stopped her there. I told her I was an officer; she made great resistance. I shewed her my authority; she submitted then. I searched her, and found eighteen pounds of soap upon her, a pound and a half of tea, a pound of coffee, and five pounds of sugar. I asked her where she lived; at last I went with her to her lodgings. We went down stairs to a lower apartment; she said there was nothing there. She then took me up stairs, there I found tea, sugar, nutmegs, cloves, plumbs, raisins, and currants; after that I returned to the house where the prisoner Tongue was; I told Tongue. I had taken Heseldine in custody, and had taken her to the Compter; he said, he was sorry for it; he gave it her; he was guilty. Heseldine told me the mam lodged in the house where I found these things, and he had give her the property. Heseldine opened the door of the house with the key she took out of her pocket, and with her key she opened the drawers in the room where the things were found. This is a bag of tea I took from Heseldine.</p>
               <p>Fairbrother. That is the bag of tea I found in the closet in Tongue's room; there is my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; called four witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

When I put him in, I saw a drab coat on the front seat inside; soon after that, I got up outside of the coach myself, and several people got inside of the coach, among whom was the prisoner, he got inside; But previous to the coach going out of the yard, I saw the prisoner get out of the coach on the near side of the coach, with a drab coat on his arm; he then walked out of the yard, and I saw no more of him; I described him to Mr. Adams, by which means he found the man, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he inside of the coach - A. I suppose not more than seven or eight minutes; I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Subscription-room at Lloyd's. Between four and five in the afternoon, one of our young men observed to me that the prisoner looked rather suspicious, he had on a great coat, it was too long for him; he went out of the door; I followed him down stairs, overtook him in Cornhill, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my coat; I saw it on the back of the prisoner myself.</p>

I went with his wife to the top of Shire-lane; he was standing at the top of the lane, and we spoke together. I asked him how he did; he asked me how I did; I said, I was very well.

             did; I said he was very well when I saw him last; that was on Sunday, and I was very sorry to see him there; by there, I meaned Newgate; that I wanted some screens of him, meaning bank notes. We walked together until we came to a house in Carey-street. We went in, and drank together. He said he could let me have a score if I wanted them. I said I would have two first, to try them. He came out and agreed to me the next morning at eleven o'clock, at the corner of Carey-street; by eleven o'clock on the next Wednesday, the 21st of July.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010025"/>We parted that day. I communicated to Avory what had passed. The next morning I met Avory and Wainwright at the Green Man in Shire-lane. Avory gave to me a one-pound bank note, which he marked, to buy two forged notes of the prisoner. Avory and Wainwright went to the house where the prisoner and me had been the evening before, and I went to the corner of Carey-street, according to promise.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st - A. Yes. I met Griffiths there according to promise; he gave me two one-pound notes; I gave him the same one pound note which Avory had given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing been said by him what price you were to pay for them - A. Ten shillings a-piece for them; that was mentioned the evening before, the 19th of June. Me and the prisoner Griffiths went to the house where we had been the evening before; that is in Carey-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Avory and Wainwright there - A. Yes; they were there, and I saw they were drinking together, and Griffiths and me drunk together. We then came out, and I and the prisoner agreed to meet at the Three Herrings in Bell-yard. That was to be the next evening at ten o'clock. Then I went to the house where Wainwright and Avory were, and shewed to them the two notes that I had purchased.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they for you - A. No; I took them to Mr. Westwood, and delivered them to him; he desired me to mark them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they marked before you parted with them - A. I parted with them to Mr. Westwood, they were not out of my sight before I marked them with my name.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two notes - A. These notes were marked by me before they went out of my sight; I am sure these are the two notes I received of the prisoner. On the following evening, I met the prisoner again at the Three Herrings; Avory and Wainwright were both there, they were not apparently in my company, they were in the same room. I met the prisoner there, and the prisoner said, he did not like the note I had given to him the morning before, it had been marked by some of the small bankers: I said, it would make no difference to me, I gave him twenty shillings in silver for it, and he gave me the note back. Then we came out, and agreed to meet the next morning at the Green Man in Shire-lane; I walked with Griffiths to the end of Cary-street, and then we parted. I then met Avory at the end of Bell-yard; I told him that Griffiths had returned me the note, and I had given him twenty shillings for it. Then on the next morning I went with Avory to Dickens's house, the officer in Gray's-inn-lane, where Avory searched me. He gave me that one-pound note and a dollar. The one-pound note Avory gave me to by more notes of Griffiths, at the Green Man, in Shire-lane; then Avory and me went to the Green Man in Shire-lane; this was on the 22nd of July. I went there along with Avory, and had my breakfast, and change of a note to pay for my breakfast. I told the landlord to keep it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did your breakfast come to - A. Five pence. Then soon after

             came in; we drank together, and then came out, and going up Shire-lane, Griffiths gave to me a one-pound note, a bad one; I gave him ten shillings in silver. We then walked together until we came to the end of Carey-street, then we stood and talked some time, and then went to the Five Bells, in Chancery-lane. We drank together, and he gave me a direction to find him any time if I should want him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you spend at the Five Bells - A. Five pence there, and when we drank at the Green Man I paid two pence towards the reckoning at the Green Man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then altogether you spent a shilling at the two houses - A. Yes. We then came out, and parted. I then went with Avory to the Black Dog in Gray's-inn-lane, where he searched me; he found on me a one-pound note and fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the one-pound note that you received of Griffiths - A. Yes, and fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver. We then went to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no money in your pocket but what had been given you by Avory - A. No. On the 27th of July, the prisoner's wife came to me; I bought a note of her; I gave eleven shillings for it. On the 27th of July the prisoner came to me at the Guy earl of Warwick, Gray's-inn-lane; that was in consequence of an appointment with Griffiths's wife; he met me there. We sat and drank together some time, and agreed to meet on the 28th, the next evening; he did not come on the 28th according to promise; his wife came on the 29th, in the evening; she told me her husband should come.

             to Warman. What place are you a native of - A. I was born in Birmingham. I left Birmingham quite young. I get my living here by wine portering and shoe-making. I continued in that line a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you went into Worcestershire<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010026"/>- A. It is four or five years since I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there before you left it - A. I was there two years or better.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being present at any assizes in Worcester - A Yes. I stood at the bar. I was tried, sir, and when I went out of court I went to jail, and staid there two years and better.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Bateman, of Worcester, do not you - A. Yes, he lost a cow. I was in the court the same day as he was; and after he had said a good deal about me, I was not allowed to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the judge - A. I forget.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you serve in the wine trade while you were in London - A. Mr. Moss, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you serve any person in Coventry-street - A. Yes, Mr. Cole. I was there for a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You parted with him on excellent terms - A. Very fair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never apply to him for a character - A. No, I did not want a character of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about bottles of wine before you left him - A. Yes; he missed some wine, but I did not have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you confess to him that you stole his wine - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cole is in the parlour. Did not Mr. Cole accuse you of stealing two bottles, and you acknowledged having them - A. I acknowledged the bottles were there, but I did not have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you admit to him that you had stolen the wine - A. I am sure I forget now whether I did or not. The property was there, I never had it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in town since you left your comfortable quarters in Worcester - A. Ever since the 6th of June last; I came up to town and got a place at Mr. Clark's, a wine-merchant, in Maiden-lane. I think I went to Mr. Clark's on the 14th of June. I arrived in town on the 4th; I staid at Mr. Clark's until the latter end of the summer; it was before I laid an information a long time. When I bought the notes of Griffiths was last July. It is eighteen months since I came up from Worcester. I have been in London two years next May.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you serve after you left this gentleman - A. Then I went to Mr. Perry, a wine merchant in Warwick-row; he deals in wine, spirits, and is a publican.</p>
               <p>Q. He keeps the Goat and Compasses, does not he - A. I never knew the sign. I lived there three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you serve afterwards - A. Then I went to my mother's home, and worked at shoe-making. She lived then in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Myers - A. I cannot say, a long time before I left Moss's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Myers was a practiced house-breaker; did not you know he was a thief all the time of your acquaintance with him - A. Yes, not all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you introduced to Griffiths - A. By the recommendation of

             - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you also state to him, or some of them, that you had a private still and could supply gin at a cheap price - A. No, I left gin at Griffiths's house, it was not out of a private still, it was bought at a shop; I kept it at Mrs. Baker's up at the Seven Dials. The direction he gave me to find him is there.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen Griffiths before the 19th of July - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you dealed in bank notes with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this gin to be left - A. I did not agree for the gin to be left; I took it there, and left it for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which gin you said came out of a private still, it was not true, you had bought it elsewhere - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You met Griffiths on the 19th of July, and had a conversation about bank notes - A. Yes, sir, there were several things occured, I cannot remember now; there was nothing mentioned about gin that time, the gin was left, that was after the Friday as I had seen him on the Thursday; the 19th was on the Monday, nothing passed about gin or a private still then. I saw him on the next morning; on the 21st I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass about gin or a private still then - A. I gave him a bottle of gin then.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st the officers were all present, were not they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they saw you - A. I gave it him as we sat in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not the officers see that - A. They might for what I know, I cannot say they did; I delivered to him then a bottle of gin. I saw him the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. At which time was any thing said about a private still - A. There was nothing said about a private still.</p>
               <p>Q.You have admitted already that you said you had the gin from a private still - A. No, I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it for money - A. We were to whack it; he was to have the gin of me for nothing until he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010027"/>sold it, and then we were to part the money. I was to buy it at the retail price.</p>
               <p>Q. And you left this gin at this lady's house in the Seven Dials. Upon your oath, did not you tell him that you could get gin from a private still at ten shillings a gallon, and he was to pay you in bank notes, and now you say you were to get the gin at the retail price - A. Yes, the price was not mentioned; when the gin was sold it was to be shared what he sold it for. I was to buy it and pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he sold fifty shillings worth, were you to have twenty-five shillings, and he twenty-five shillings - A. That was not agreed; the money that he sold it for was to be shared between us.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did you leave at the woman's house - A. I left two quart wine bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that - A. I think it was on a Friday, I am not sure.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you detected any other persons in this offence - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect any benefit from detecting persons dealing in bad bank notes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Wainwright - A. A matter of eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. That was when you were in town before - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you told him before this time that you began to deal with Griffiths, of your journey to Worcester - A. I told him that I had been convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps you had mentioned it to Mr. Westwood - A. It was not mentioned till afterwards I had bought of Griffiths; Mr. Westwood knew it before.</p>

               <p>Q. The officers were not with you there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You met the next day at the corner of the street - A. Yes, I met Mrs. Griffiths at the Green Man; I went to the house in Carey-street with Avory and Wainwright.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not search you then to see what was about you - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray how came it that Avory and Wainwright did not go immediately and seize the man - A. I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. The note was marked on purpose that they should know it again. Did not you say to them you had better go and take him now, the thing is done - A. No; I went to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. The note was marked there by you, that note never having been out of your possession - A. Yes; the next evening I saw Griffiths again, Avory and Wainwright was with me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell them to take him then, how came you not to do that - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. He returned to you the note that had been marked by the officers, and the mark that he pointed out to you was the mark that had been put upon it - A. I believe it was; I did not take notice of it. He said I do not like the note you gave me last night, it has been marked by some small bankers; I put the note in my pocket; I kept it the whole night myself, and then gave it into the hands of the publican in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon the 22nd they gave you more money, they gave you back the same note and a dollar, was the dollar marked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Griffiths had the marked note a day and a night before it came to you with this complaint, he had it on the 20th, on the 21st in the evening he returned it; these are all the notes, and there is your hand writing on the back of it - A. Yes.</p>

             signed that - A. I believe he did; that was on the 20th. On the 21st I saw the prisoner again at the Three Herrings in Bell-yard; Wainwright was with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you go there by appointment with Warman - A. Yes, I did; Warman and the prisoner were in company drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing pass from one to the other - A. I saw Warman give to Griffiths some silver, I saw the prisoner give Warman a note; it appeared to be a bank note. After this they went out together; I went out after them, and Wainwright with me went out after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them together in the street - A. No, not at that time. I saw Warman a very few minutes after that at the top of Bell-yard, he shewed me that good note that I gave him to purchase with; he said he was to meet him the next morning at breakfast time, at the Green Man public-house, Shire-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning, the 29th, where did you first meet Warman - A. At Dickens's, in Gray's-inn-lane; I searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he left Dickens's what money had he about him - A. A one-pound note and a dollar. I then went with him to the Green Man, there he had a basin of tea, and a quartern of gin they had together; he changed the note with the publican by my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give directions to the publican about that note - A. Not at that time, after it was changed. The prisoner came in about ten minutes; when the prisoner came in he joined company with Warman, they drank together; he paid his reckoning; they went out together. He paid two-pence towards the gin; they went out together; I followed them; they went talking together up Shire-lane into Carey-street and there they talked together some time. I followed them, and as they kept talking together I went round Chichester-rents; when I went round into Chancery-lane I saw Wainwright opposite of where the prisoner and Warman were walking together; Wainwright was watching them. I went to Wainwright; he told me they were gone into the Five Bells. I went after them, and waited until they came out. I saw them coming as if from there, they went a little way up Chancery-lane and parted.</p>
               <p>Q. When they parted did you follow Warman - A. Yes; I met Warman in Holborn, he and I went to the Black Dog in Gray's-inn-lane; I there searched him again; I found upon him a bad one-pound note and fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver. I went with Warman to Mr. Westwood; I delivered that note to Mr. Westwood; I marked it before I parted with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How long have you been acquainted with Warman - A. Wainwright recommended me to him; he told me he knew somebody that passed away bad notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Warman mention about himself - A. He told me he knew a man of the name of

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010030"/>Q. In September you found a bill against Griffiths; had Warman told you of his adventure then - A. No; the first I heard of it Mr. Westwood got it out of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before you found a bill - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the bill in September sessions - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear the indictment was under some difficulty respecting of its being tried, and was not you for the first time informed that this man had been capitally convicted in the country - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not true that within a month this man told you that he was a capital convict - A. No, it is not true; I never knew nothing of it until Mr. Westwood inform me of it; since Warman has acknowledged it he has told me of it, not before.</p>
               <p>Q. The first night that you see him in company with Griffiths he went out and was absent from you five or ten minutes - A. Yes, some minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. When - A. When the two first notes were purchased.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see your marked bank note again, it was full twenty-four hours in Warman's possession, how it got there you could know nothing, more than what he told you - A. No, not any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it quite possible he might have got these other notes from some other man - A. I do not know; I was in company with him all the morning, he was not in company with any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not searched him so as to know they were not already in his pocket - A. No, I had not searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 22nd you met this man at Dickens's, how long were you there - A. A very little time; I there searched him as close as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to you and said he had sold one-pound note for two bad ones, it did not occur to you that was the time to take him - A. No, not till I had got directions.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was it that you saw Warman and Griffiths in company together; did you see a bottle of gin handed - A. No, I never saw a bottle of gin handed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw a paper that you supposed to be a bank note passed could any thing pass without your seeing - A. Nothing could.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is not true that a bottle of gin could pass without your seeing it - A. I do not think it could; I sat directly opposite at the time this transaction was going on, from the 20th to the 22nd of July. He gave old Mrs. Myers some gin to take to her son. That is all I saw pass between them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, having a clear conscience of the charge permit me to address you. I most solemnly declare my innocence of dealing in any forged notes whatever; I have no doubt in my own mind Warman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010031"/>has done this either to obtain money from the bank solicitor, or a permanent situation in their employ, be it for which of these it is swearing my life away. I grant my character has been impeach, that imputation does not resemble the present charge. And as it appears by the officers and Warman, that this is a premidated business; they have thought proper to select me for a viction, as I have been unfortunate they thought they might assail me with impunity. I feel convinced through a disgraced individual. No prejudice will operate upon the present occasion to my disadvantage; when he states that he was recommended to me his subject was entirely different, as you will see by the purport of this letter in my hand; I have the letter which was sent by his friend Myers.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Griffiths, a young man has called upon me, he informs me he is in concern with a private still, he will sell you cheap; yours respectfully H. MYERS. P. S. You may see him every morning at nine o'clock, at the Green Man." This letter was delivered to me by Mary Weston. He wishes to impose upon this honorable court, I trust your lordship will examine the evidence given by Avory and Wainwright, they do not correspond with the evidence of Warman, namely of purchasing forged notes of me; there I drew their premeditated guilt in this business. Their giving Warman a one-pound note for the purchace; why then after they had so far completed a fair case for conviction, why not apprehended me; this I am sure must convince your minds as men of understanding, that you are satisfied no purchase took place. Gentlemen, that this was a premeditated business; another reason shews it, my returning a one-pound note; how inconsistant, can any man believe that for a minute; would not a guilty man have kept the marked note in his own possession, sooner than returning it, this is too glaring a thing; a guilty man could have no difficulty in gitting rid of such a note rather than risk life. Would not a guilty man have destroyed this testimony, but that must rest upon your opinion. I was seized in Gray's-inn-lane, and taken into the shop of a broker, who is in court; who stated that he saw me searched, and what money I had about me, which was seven shillings, was given me back. I hope gentlemen you will clearly weigh the evidence given, and give an impartial verdict. I trust your lordship will consider that no man's life ought to be at stake for such a man as Warman. I by mere accident learned that he was convicted of a felony; I am not the first innocent man that Warman has accused as will appear to the court. I have made every possible enquiry; I have wrote to Worcester to find the man; had I brought the man it would clearly prove that he wanted to swear away an innocent man's life. I was offered by the prosecution a pardon of this charge if I would plead guilty of a crime that would have subjected me to transportation; I could not plead guilty of that offence.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time that you made the entry was it in its present state, or in any other state - A. It certainly was not in its present state. The total of the bill was 732 l. 13 s. 8 d. as entered in my book. I remitted this bill to Mr. Kingsford. I sent it by one of my clerks.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the bill - A. I took the bill home to my residence at Wandsworth, there it laid until the 17th of May, and then having occasion to go to town on the 17th, I took it to the bankers Messrs. Perrin; I endorsed it before I took it them.</p>

            . I am a bill broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Cast your eye upon that Victualling bill, and tell me whether you discounted that bill - A. I believe we did, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. For whom did you discount that bill - A. For Barber and sons; the principal sum carried out in that bill is 731 l. 17 s. 5 d. We discounted it for Barber and sons, on the 1st of July.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it - A. I brought it to the accompting-house, perhaps I gave it into the hands of my partner, or laid it on the desk, or gave it into the clerk, or partner, Mr. Brind, and from the statement of our books it went into the hands of Mr. May, or his clerk. The entry in my book is the hand writing of my partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know personally what became of it afterwards - A. No further than appears in my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see Mr. May afterwards - A. Certainly not</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him upon the circumstance of that bill - A. To the best of my recollection I believe not, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scarlet. Were yours the hand that received it from Barbers - A. Yes, it was paid into my hands; I brought it home to my accompting-house, and laid it on the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. But you made no entry upon it - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the constent practice of bill brokers to enter the bill in the book on the same day - A. The entry does not take place on the same day perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you always enter them in your books - A. Not always enter very bill in the book that we discount.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you received this bill of Barbers, were there any other money or other bills to the amount of 14,000 l. at the time with this; is it your course to give a bankers check or bank notes - A. We pay over money to the amount of 10,000 l. without making any entry; in a large concern we pay in one payment for the whole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. When you do not enter them at the moment, what means do you adopt to know; what I want to know is when you make a payment of 10,000 l. how do you know whether you receive more or less, there must be some period when some gentleman must want to know how he stands - A. We can tell, we make our arrangements in the evening or the next morning; we take paper memorandums in our pocket-book at the bankers desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Cast your eye upon that, tell me whether that produced you 1700 or 700 - A. I obtained for it 731, I have do doubt about it whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was passed away what did it produce to your house - A. Only the sum that we had given for it, that I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. So though it is not carried into your ledger you have documents that you are able to ascertain the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010033"/>the fact, and if a 1000 l. had been paid over, you would be able to ascertain the fact - A. Certainly, the same evening or the next morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. With respect to that particular bill, you have no doubt you received it for 730 l. odd - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that from a recollection of your own or from any memorandum - A. By the entry in our books. I have no personal recollection of the bill.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRIND. I am in partnership with the last witness, Mr. Usher.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the persons that transact your concerns in your accompting-house - A. Ourselves, and the clerk, Mr. Nicolls.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to your entry in your book respecting this bill, what is the first entry you have - A. A bill entered 731 l. 17 s. 5 d. This is the Bill book; on the 1st of July it was entered. That bill came into our house on the 1st of July; it was brought into the office from Messrs. Barker and son.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the sum - A.731 l. 17 s. 5 d. after deducting the property tax.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that bill afterwards - A. That bill went from our office to Mr. May's office. It is very probable it went from our office by me; I have not the least doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. While it remained in your office, and before it went to Mr. May, was any alteration made in it - A. Certainly not. It went from our office on the 1st of July. We have an entry of it going from the house in another book. This entry is made by the clerk; he is here.</p>
               <p>COURT. The first transaction of it coming into your house is entered by you - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that bill produce to your house any larger sum than that which was on it - A. Certainly not; it went forth for 731 l. 17 s. 5 d. That is the original value deducting the property tax.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it passed from you as a single bill - A. It went out of the house with other bills; it came in with other bills.</p>
               <p>Q. And went from you with other bills - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the person that took that bill out - A. I did; I took it to Mr. May's office, and left them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. May a clerk - A. Yes; he transacts business in Mr. May's absence; he receives all bills that are brought into the office to discount.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he fills up drafts for money - A. I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether he did or no - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Did you ever see a single instance of his drawing any - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. With whom did you transact this particular business of this particular bill - A. I positively cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever transact with the clerk any discount to so large an amount as this transaction - A. Yes; I have left bills frequently with Mr. May's clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. All clerks do receive something for the master's consideration, and when the master comes home he gives instructions - A. Exactly so. 5,401 l. 15 s. 4 d. that is the amount of the whole of that bundle of bills.</p>
               <p>COURT. The whole of that part in which this bill was included -</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. It is so, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the number of the bills - A. Nine bills. They were all Government bills; I got the sum total by 700 l. and odd, not by 1700 l. and odd.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose 1700 l. to have been paid upon the footing of this instead of 700, must not you have seen that an error, and that you were overpaid a 1000 - A. Undoubtedly; a 1000 l. paid over is easily detected upon this occasion; I am certain I received no more than seven. We received cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other transaction with the prisoner that day when you in your return received the discount of the 5,401 l. 15 s. 4 d. - A. The principal eight were a Treasury bill of 100 l. 520 l. and one of 700 l. a Victualling bill 749 l. 2 s. 4 d. and 732 l. that is the bill in question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you say from your own recollection whether you had any personal communication with May - A. I cannot say whether I had or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. You say if the principal is not at home you would leave them with his clerk, if Mr. May would discount the bills he might leave a draft to discount them with the clerk - A. Yes, or by sending cash.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NICOLL. I am a clerk to the two last gentlemen. I find an entry to the amount of 5,401 l. 15 s. 4 d. That is the going out of them; they went to Mr. May; they were to return the cash to the amount of 5,401 l. 15 s. 4 d.</p>
               <p>Q. If a 1000 more had been returned should you have known that - A. We certainly should.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner coming to your house in July last - A. I do, the 3rd of July.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day was it - A. I rather think it was late, it being the last entry in our Bill book; that circumstance strikes me that it was late.</p>
               <p>Q. When does your business close in the day - A.We generally leave the office about half after four, but leave a person until five, in case any body should come. It was between three and four he applied to discount a Navy or Victualling bill for 1731 l. 17 s. 5 d. due on the 3rd of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the amount of the bill when he applied to you for the discount - A. I cannot say; he produced the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bill, and tell me whether that is the bill - A. This bill agrees with the bill in my book except I have entered it Navy; it appears to be a Victualling bill; they are known in the market by the name of Navy bills; they are drawn by the Victualling office upon the Treasurer of the Navy. Upon his applying to get the discount; I answered we would try to get it done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out to get it discounted - A. I myself carried it to Bruce, Simson, and Company,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010034"/>Bartholomew-lane, bankers; that is but a short distance from our place of business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be absent - A. I should suppose not ten minutes. I returned and said, that I had got the promise to have the money for the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner May - A. I cannot say whether he was in the office when I came back; it was communicated to him that we had the promise. I brought the bill back to make a ticket of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not part with the bill - A. Only for my clerk to enter it; my clerk having entered it, I myself went to the house of Bruce and Company, and got the money; I received 1,724 l. 10 s. 4 d. that is the money by allowing all the discounts, which is seven guineas and a penny; I returned with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner - A. I did see him, whether he was waiting or came in afterwards I cannot say; I can say I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver him the amount of the money you had received - A. That I cannot say, whether my partner or my clerk gave it him, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you bring back the amount deducting the discount - A. Yes, in bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner request any loan in addition to the discount of this bill - A. He did of 600 l. We agreed to make him that; the loan was made to him in addition to the produce of this bill; the total sum was paid by a draft.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the draft - A.2,321 l. 15 s. 11 d. That was a draft upon our bankers, Down, Thornton, and Freen.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us the figures of the principal sum making that sum that you have mentioned - A.11 s. 2 d. that Mr. May was debitted in an old balance, the 1st of July: then there is the discount of the bill 7 l. 7 s. 1 d. discount of commission 2 l. 3 s. 3 d. making total 10 l. 1 s. 6 d. that taking of the Navy bill 1,731 l. 17 s. 5 d. deducting the 10 l. 1 s. 6 d. leaves 1,721 l. 15 s. 11 d. advance 600 l. making the total 2,321 l. 15 s. 11 d.

               <p>Mr. Scarlet. But you cannot swear you were present when he received it - A. No, I dare not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. It is possible it might be sent to him in his accompting-house, is it not - A. No; I can swear that it was not sent to his office. My partner, and clerk, knew it was delivered to him in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. You are swearing to what your clerk and partner told you - A. We do not make a minute of every transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear of your own knowledge that the prisoner was present in the office and received the check - A. I can say I know it was delivered to him in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the clerk of the prisoner - A. I have no recollection of knowing him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him - A. I knew him about the month of August following; I cannot recollect whether I knew him at that time or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to your office to ask for the discount - A. He came to our office to ask it to be discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the person he applied to - A. I should think so, because I was the person that went out to get it discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you first saw him - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he brought the bill when first he came - A. Yes, and brought the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect, was not the first application made to you whether you could discount a Navy bill - A. To the best of my recollection he produced the bill at the time; I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do swear that the bill came as the application - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was, positively, that is a matter you cannot be mistaken - A. I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be from the time that you first went out to enquire about this bill, and your return to the office - A. I conjecture about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not in your habit to be going to different bankers in the way of your business - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in this transaction to fix this transaction in your memory more than the others - A. The circumstance that makes me conclude it was late, it was the last entry in the Bill book. I don't know any particular reason but that.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that bill discounted by the Bank for Messrs. Bruce, Simson, and Company - A. It was discounted on the 22nd of July; I discounted it at 1731 l. 17 s. 5 d. deducting for the property tax.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it carried by the Bank into the Navy office for payment - A. It was.</p>
               <p>MR. TWEEDY. I am cashier in the Navy office, in the Victualling department.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bill paid to you by the Bank of England - A. It was; that bill was one of a number of bills amounting to 14,600 l. It was represented as a bill of 1700 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scarlet. You are a cashier in the office of the Treasurer of the Navy - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. That individual bill was brought to you for payment - A. Yes, with six others; I saw it myself. I 
               <persName id="t18131201-34-person459">drew</persName>
             the draft for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. The Treasurer of the Navy keeps no money in his office, only in the Bank of England - A. In the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at that bill before you paid it - A. I have no doubt but I looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. In the hurry of business I believe the practice has been to look at the figures only - A. The bill was detected in our office after the payment took place.</p>
               <p>Q. If the practice has been to look at the figures only, a I might be put in without your detecting it - A. Certainly; generally we look at the body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. That is case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, gentlemen of the Jury, it is not in my power to address you by my counsel. If ever there was a moment that I had made myself incapable of addressing you, it is the present moment. Gentlemen, you stand between the public and the prisoner to see that justice is meted out to both; with you the matter will be rested. When the whole case is gone through, the decision will be left for your consideration. Gentlemen, my life is in your hands, and what is dearer to me than life. Gentlemen, I am of respectable parents; I received a good education in this great metropolis; I have carried on the business of a broker a great many years with credit to myself, and up to this hour I have maintained a character void of offence. I have lived in the bosom of my family; in the society of a most affectionate wife and my children have I spent my evenings after the business was over. I mention not these circumstances that they can clear me of the charges, but I mention these circumstances to shew the improbability, and I think I might add, the impossibility of a man so acting to be guilty of an act to forfeit his life and character, and to bring distress upon his family. I will now proceed to the subject under your consideration: the indictment charges me with having forged the instrument, or of having altered it, and what is indeed the very essence of the crime that I did it with intention to defraud his Majesty, and the Treasurer of his Majesty's Navy. That the hand-writing that was made there is mine, not a tittle of proof has been adduced, and I feel boldly assured that I must be acquitted. The next charge is, that I uttered it knowing it to be forged. Gentlemen, that transaction was conducted principally by my clerk. In that clerk, I reposed the utmost confidence. I was daily in the habit of leaving blank bills signed, for him to fill up.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010037"/>He had the entire management of my banker's credit, and by the clerk was all the bill business transacted. Gentlemen, upon such evidence as this, the most respectable merchant might be placed at this bar. Some few years since, Mr. Weston was placed at this bar; his clerk availed himself of the confidence of his master; he forged a power of attorney upon General 
               <persName id="t18131201-34-person460">Tooney</persName>
            , whose dividends Mr. Cohen, the army agent, was in the habit of receiving. I have not been able to procure the attendance of my clerk; he is beyond my reach. It would be idle to detain you by stating circumstances upon which I cannot procure any legal proof. There is no evidence beyond presumptive evidence of the forgery, and whatever there is further necessary for me the learned judge will point out to you. The learned Attorney-General has done no more than his duty, and I believe I may say, after he has done his painful duty he will rejoice in my acquittal. If there is a doubt in the case the learned judge will tell you to give me the benefit of that doubt. Gentlemen, God be with you and direct you.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I returned with Holmes to the house. I left the prisoner in custody of Holmes, after asking him a few questions; the constable asked him where he took the note, in my presence. He seemed very much agitated, and said he had got it; afterwards, he said he had took it at Smithfield, with others, for a horse and two cows. I asked him where he came from; he said, from Gravesend, and then he said he had received it in change for a one hundred pound note, which he had received in Smithfield for cattle that he had sold.

               <p>Q. Do you remember the witness coming to you requiring you to go to the Equestrian tap-house - A. Yes; on Lord Mayor's day. The Equestrian tap-house is kept by Mrs. Taylor. I saw the prisoner in the tap, and I saw a note which was shewn to me in the tap; I asked the prisoner if he had no smaller notes or change about him; he said, he had not. I asked him to bank the note, and put his address to it; he wanted to know what was the matter with it; I told him we doubted it being a good one. I then asked him where he lived, and who he had got it of; it mattered not, he had get it he said, and as to where he lived it mattered not to me, he lived no where particular he was a travelling man. I told him if he did not give me a more satisfactory account I should keep him in custody, and send over to the Bank to know whether the note was a good note or not. I then said, if Mr. Nicholson would take the note to the Bank I would keep him in custody; I had him in the parlour all the time. He was then very anxious to go after Mr. Nicholson in a coach, he had a great many more notes that he took of the same person, they might be all bad, he had taken them in change of a gentleman. I asked him what sort of a gentleman it was that he had taken them of; he said, a master farmer, a gentleman dealer in Smithfield. At last he told me he lived at Gravesend. I asked him where the gentleman that he took it of lived; he said, he did not know. The prisoner said, he had part of a house with a gentleman at Gravesend. I asked him how he obtained his living; at last he said, he obtained his living by selling liquor on board a ship. I then asked him whether he knew several people that lived at Gravesend; he said, he did not; he had been but three weeks there; he came from Cork to Bristol; that had dealt in cattle in Cork. I asked him if he knew the man he had sold the two cows and the horse to. He said he did not know, but if I would go with him to Smithfield he would shew him to me. Soon after, Mr. Nicholson returned with Foy; he was then searched, and taken to Marlborough-street-office. I saw him searched; he had two five-shilling and sixpenny pieces and a ten pound note upon him. He wanted to pay for the reckoning while Mr. Nicholson was gone for Foy and Glover. He was anxious to pay with the money several times. Foy also found a small key in his waistcoat pocket, apparently a drawer key.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOY. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner; I found upon him two dollars, a six-pence, a ten-pound note, and a key. I learned where his lodgings was; the next day he told me. After I had searched him he was taked to the office, and from there to prison. I asked him the first day where his lodgings was; he would not tell me, and before the magistrate he did not tell. I learned from him the next day, at the house of correction, that his lodging was at St. George's coffee-house, Blackman-street, in the Borough; if I would apply to Mr. Ellworthy, at St. George's coffee-house, in Blackman-street, in the Borough, he would tell me who he was, and that he lodged there. I went there; his lodging was pointed out to us by Mr. Ellworthy; Mr. Ellworthy shewed me the prisoner's room; the door was locked. I told Mr. Ellworthy it was necessary the door should be opened; he broke it open directly. The key that I found upon the prisoner fitted the drawers; the drawers were open, all but the top drawer; that was locked. In the top drawer I found two five-pound notes folded up in a piece of paper, which I marked. These are the two five-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other notes any where - A. I found thirty-two dozen counterfeit tokens in a drawer along with the notes, and under the carpet I found two parcels of notes, one parcel containing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010039"/>twenty, and the other six, in the same room; they were all counterfeit. I found them in a small brown paper parcels under the carpet. The carpet was laid down, and under the carpet were these notes. These are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the trunk that is produced - A. Yes, that is the trunk that I found; the ticket at the top is partly torn off, and some of the bits laying at the bottom of the trunk. There were five good one-pound notes I found in the drawer with the two five-pound notes. They were separate from the five. The bad notes were in a paper, and the good ones by themselves.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were some silver in the upper drawer.</p>
               <p>COURT. There were some good silver that they have denied; do you mean to say they have not given it up to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Foy. There was no good silver in the drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. Paid E. October 8th, what does that denote - A. That it came to the E. table such a day of the month, that is to be delivered free. I have no doubt but that mark was put by myself, from the impression of that piece of brass which you have in your hand.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the price of single letter from Newcastle upon Tyne - A. One shilling, and a double letter. two shillings I am a sorter of letters in the two-penny<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010041"/>Post office to all the divisions; generally I sort them before they get into their particular divisions.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, and look at the stamp ten o'clock, October 8th 1813, F. N. - A. That is our stamp denoting ten o'clock delivery; October 8th, 1813, forenoon; that denotes a delivery by the Twopenny Post, that shews the letter came into the Twopenny Post department.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, turn the letter over, you will find two letters G. P. at the corner of the direction - A. That denotes that it is within the boundry of the General Post delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it some times happen that a letter sent in the General 
               <persName id="t18131201-39-person514">Post</persName>
             delivery gets into the Two-penny Post department - A. That frequently happens.</p>
               <p>Q. When that happens are these letters imprest with the letters G. P. - A. They are, and then the two-pence would not be charged for the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then looking at these marks upon that letter, that letter had come into the General Post, and had been transferred into the Two-penny Post - A. It was certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.There are several divisions in the Two-penny Post - A. There are seven; one is called the Eastern division.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Collit-place, Stepney, within that devision - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is the Eastern business transacted - A.In the Eastern division Post office, Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Letters of the Eastern division are delivered from Lombard-street - A. They are; they are also sorted in Lombard-street for that delivery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. How many persons are there employed in sorting letters for the Eastern division - A. Six.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way is sorting effected - A. They are first taken from the sorting office by the prisoner, who is the charge taker, that is before they get into the Eastern division. The prisoner was on duty on the morning of the 8th of October.</p>
               <p>COURT. They are first taken from the sorting office to the different walks by the prisoner - A. Yes; they have a box to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose duty is it to take them - A. The charge taker. The prisoner was charge taker; the prisoner only takes them to that division. He was on duty that morning.</p>
               <p>Q.They are first sorted into the divisions at the sorting office - A. Yes: they are first sorted at the sorting office into the different divisions, and then carried to the letter carriers office at the Eastern division, they are sorted into walks.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was the prisoner's duty to take them from the sorting office into the Eastern division - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. When he has brought them to the Eastern division what then is done - A.They are sorted part by himself, and the letter carriers, they assist him in sorting them into the different walks of the division.</p>
               <p>Q. How many walks are there belonging to that division - A. Six.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these six was the prisoner's walk - A. Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Collit-place, Stepney, within his walk - A. No, it is not, but it is within the Eastern division.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in the process of sorting in the Eastern division, the prisoner and the other person are each to take them for the different walks; all that are doing duty at that time are employed in sorting them into the different walks - A. Yes; every letter carrier has a seat for himself, and six boxes to sort them into, to saperate them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were employed that morning - A. All six were employed that morning, on the 8th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. In the process if any one chuses to take a letter not within his own walk, has he the opportunity and means of doing so - A.He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps some times it may happen by accident that a letter gets into a wrong walk - A.It does, frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. When that happens what ought that person who has possession of that letter to do - A. He ought immediately he finds the letter to give it to the person whose duty it is to take it; that is what he ought to do.</p>
               <p>Q. But if it came to him by mistake, in whose delivery is Collit-place, Stepney - A. It is the walk within the Commercial-road; William Stringer is the letter carrier to that walk. The letter carriers sign their names themselves. William Stringer was upon duty that morning, as it appears by the signing of the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear that the prisoner was on duty that morning - A. He was; he signed his name. I know his signature.</p>

             to the office they are sorted - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after the letters are sorted at your office they go into that office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is impossible for the prisoner to obtain possession of that letter before it came to to your office - A. In the first instance it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When the letters come to your office are they returned the same day - A. This letter it appears by the stamp could not be returned on the same day to the General Post office; we frequently return them if we notice them in time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say letters that come by accident to the Two-penny Post office, by which you discover where they are to go, are to be returned to the General Post office, are they to be sent in a mass to the General Post office - A. They are sent in a locked box to the letter carriers office at the General Post office; they are taken to the place called the Book; they are re-sorted. It appears by this letter, that this letter came to his hands. The prisoner is a Two-penny postman.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Burt said just now, that the General Post office letters very often go back; there is hardly an office but in which are missorted letters. The men that come against me knew many other letters besides in that division are sorted into my division, and as I am charge taker I have no time for sorting letters. I don't think one gentleman here ever saw me sorting letters. I receive of fifteen men, and while I am taking the money I leave it to them to take them out, I have not time until they are gone to see whether my letters are right or wrong; on Monday morning particularly, when I am gone out, I have to come back, the walk has been so heavy, we have petitioned Mr. Johnson two or three times to alter our walks, to take off the collection of that walk as it is so heavy; if we detain a letter one time we are afraid of giving them back for fear of being turned out of office; we have not time to do what we ought. Mr. Burt has said that the letters are brought in a box; they are not always brought in a box, sometimes he brings them out in his hands; all the men take them out in their hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burt. There is a box for the purpose, whether they use it at all times I cannot say; it is the charge takers duty to take them in a box.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called ten witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Nathan called upon me about nine o'clock on Sunday night. I found the little girl, the prisoner, and a number of people in Nathan's bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon her - A. A key. I tried the key to Nathan's drawers; it opened them. I went up stairs to the room where the mother lodged; that is the other prisoner; I searched the room. I found a few duplicates in the mother's drawers. I examined the chest; she said the key belonged to her father's chest; I examined it, it would not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mother say any thing - A. No. I went with one of the duplicates I found in the mother's chest of drawers, to Mr. Fothergills, a pawnbroker, he produced the bed gown; Mrs. Nathan was with me, she owned the bed gown by a tare in the bosom.</p>

               <p>Prisoner.

I saw him go up Lemon Tree-yard; I followed him up the yard; I saw him throw the seals down; he then run off. I picked up one seal, I gave it to Pring. I saw the prisoner come down Lemon Tree-yard with an old gentleman; as soon as I saw him, I told Mr. Pring that was the man. The prisoner asked me what I wanted with him; I said again that was the man.</p>

When I came to my door my wife opened it; I saw the prisoner in the room; he said is there any one below; I told him there were a few boys at the bottom of the yard. The prisoner asked me if there were any on below; I said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. He meant below in your house, did not he - A. Yes. He said, I will go; then we went out together; he asked me to go down the yard with him, and he would give me something to drink if I would choose to drink it; I went down the yard with him to the bottom of Taylor's-buildings, and then he was taken hold of; he was quite a stranger to me.

On the 15th of November, a little before six o'clock, I heard the call of stop thief; I immediately went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010045"/>out; I saw a quantity of people at the bottom of Lemon-tree-yard; they said a man had gone up the yard that had robbed a jeweller's shop. I got a link and searched the yard; I could not find him. We gave over the search. I saw him come down the yard; I assisted in apprehending him, and I assisted in taking him back to Mr. Jarman's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you about three years ago, in the summer, go to Margate - A. Yes; I there met with the prisoner; he said he was a dragoon; I took him for an officer. He visited at our house; my mother sanctioned it. He continued at Margate three months while I and my mother were there. He paid me a great deal of attention.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your mother die - A. About a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of May last, did the prisoner call<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010046"/>upon you - A. I think it was in April; I saw him in Margate. I saw him three times before he made a proposal of marriage; he came to my room in the Haymarket; I then lived with my aunt. He then proposed marriage; he knew I was of age, and in possession of my fortune. He said, it was very fortunate that he should come just at the time I was of age; he wished the marriage to take place the next day. I said, I wished to consult my uncle and aunt; he said, what signified my uncle and aunt, if I did not marry him he would put an end to his exestance. I consented to marry him; the marriage took place the next Sunday, at St. Martin's church. On the Sunday proceeding the Saturday we were married, he proposed my going with him to the Bank, and taking out two hundred pounds; I said, I thought an hundred was sufficient. After the marriage we went to Barnet, and from thence to Holy-head, and then to Ireland; he quarrelled, and left me. He came over here; I came to London afterwards. He left me in Ireland without any money.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. John-street. On the 30th of October, about half past six, I came down St. John-street, I had suspicion of these two prisoners seeing them walking backwards and forwards before Gunstone and Pricket's shop; I stepped into a passage adjoining the shop. I heard Keville say brush, he gave a whistle. I came out of the passage; I went lower down, told the patrol on duty to look out. I crossed on the opposite side of the way, and watched the prisoners; I saw Helsley go first, and shove the window up; Keville was looking out. Helsley handed it out, and gave it to Keville; they both crossed over to where I was watching them; I laid hold of them both; I called Tio, it is a bye word of ourselves to collect the patrols; Keville struggled, and got his coat off, and got away; another patrol catched him. This is the lard.</p>

When I missed my purse the prisoner was entirely out of my sight; I then went to the watchhouse, and gave information to the officers of the night.</p>

Newitt, the prosecutor, Cole, and I, were together standing in Puckeridge-street; the prisoner came along, the prosecutor pointed towards the prisoner, and said that is the woman; we took hold of her, and brought her to Marlborough-street, and locked her up. We obtained a search warrant; we went to Church-lane with the warrant. I learned by the officer of the night that she lived there and it proved to be correct.

I then charged her with taking my property; she ran back again through the passage; the landlady tried to stop her; she pushed her of one side. When I got there I called out stop thief.</p>

            . I work for Messrs. Jackson. On the 2nd of November I weighed the refuse silver deposited in the can, it weighed twenty-one ounces fourteen pennyweights. I weighed it immediately after one, when the men had gone to dinner. I re-weighed it between nine and ten o'clock; there remained twenty ounces five pennyweights. The prisoner then was about leaving work; he was stopped in the accompting-house; Mr. Jackson sent for an officer; he was searched in my presence, and on him were found two ounces and a quarter of silver, among which was a piece of silver wire three-fourths of an ounce, what he had to work with; the other were clippings and cuttings, that made up the deficiency of the silver in the can. The prisoner said it was his first offence.</p>

On Saturday, the 6th of November, I saw the oats in the sack, and on Sunday I went and marked the sack. On Monday I sent the prisoner with a load of potatoes to Spitalfields market. I immediately followed the team, and walked by the side of him. He said he had got some oats in the cart; he asked me if I saw him take them. I told him I did not. He told me he took them from the granary round the pea rick down the ploughed field, and threw them over the hedge. He then said he would leave the oats. I told him he should take the oats forward as he had got them. I followed him to Spitalfields; there I saw him take the oats out of the cart, and set them down by the side of Mr. Truss's warehouse.</p>

            . I am an Officer of Bow-street. On the 6th of November, between nine and ten in the evening, I and Humphreys went up into the Strand by Akerman's; there were gas lights. We went into the corner public-house. The landlord told us there were a great many pocket-books down the areas in Beaumont's buildings. We went into the Plough public-house: we saw the prisoner, he was warming some beer by the fire: he came to the door: Humphreys laid hold of him. I came up to him. I put my hand to his fob, and pulled out a gold watch. He said, are you going to rob me. I said, no, I want this watch. I asked him whose it was; he said, a man of the name

             gave him the watch, and told him to stay there until he came to him. He told us, if we would wait a bit, we should see, Phene Morgan would come in to him. We secured the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house. After that we went back to the house; Phene Morgan came in; we secured him, and put him in the watch-house.</p>

He said he worked in the London Docks. I heard him go down stairs, and go into the lower room; he remained there about two minutes. He went to the street door, opened it, and went out. On my hearing him open the door so hastily, I jumped up to the bed-room window. I looked out, and saw him with the coat and breeches under his arm. I ran down stairs, threw the door open, pursued after him, and lost sight of him. I am sure he is the man; he lodged in my house four days, no more; I am positive of his person; it was quite light; I saw him very plain, and the coat and breeches under his arm. I am certain of it.</p>

I made haste to the Banker's, No. 66, Lombard-street, and stopped payment of the check. It was a quarter after five when I was there. They told me to be there the next morning, to see if they came in with it. On Wednesday morning I went to Hatton-Garden office, when these gentlemen here asked me what I wanted. I said my six 1 l. notes. They said they had got the six 1 l. notes and the pocket-book, but they had not got the check.

They were going up Brook-street; they walked on the left hand side of the way, and I on the right, till we came to the top of Brook-street, near the potatoe warehouse. I stood at the potatoe warehouse door on the right, and as they were passing me, I saw Williams take some notes out of his pocket-book and give them to the prisoner Golding. They walked on down Dorrington-street, Brook's market, and went into the George public-house, Leather-lane. It being on a particular day, I thought they had committed a robbery. I went to Hatton Garden, and informed Read senior of it, and Read senior went with me to the George public-house, and there Read searched them in my presence. On Williams and Golding he found three 1 l. notes on each, and some silver upon one of them, but how much I cannot say.</p>

I returned to London again on the 13th of November, on hearing from my servant that the watch was gone. At that time the prisoner was in my service.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I live at No. 12, Fleet-street. On the 9th of November the prisoner came to my shop, and offered a gold watch to pledge; she asked 5 l. upon it. I asked her whose it was; she said, her own, and she should redeem it very shortly. I told her I was convinced that was not the truth, and if she would really tell the truth it would save her a great deal of trouble, and save her character. Much conversation then took place, she hesitating to tell me, and I pressing her to tell where she got it from. When she walked into the parlour, she confessed that she was a servant to Dr. Jones; that she had taken it out of a drawer in Doctor Jones's house, and meant to replace it, and if I would give it her back again she would go and do that immediately. She would not tell me where I could see Dr. Jones. She told me where he lived; he was out of town, and she had not the key of the house; there was nobody in it. As I could not find out Dr. Jones's, I sent for an officer. She was taken before a magistrate. I know nothing of the other things.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On the 30th of November I saw the prisoner pass with a piece of beef, it was a piece of a loin and a rump, it weighed 41 lb. I followed the prisoner through part of Great Marlborough-street, across Oxford market. I met with Hammond; we immediately followed the prisoner up Castle-street. We took him to Carsaby market, and made enquiry; we could not find any body that lost it. We took him to Marlborough street office. At last we found Mr. Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Where was this piece of beef taken from? - A. It hung in my open shop about three yards from the door. I was not present when the beef was stolen. I went to the office and saw the beef; I think it was my beef; there was a hook to it. I cannot swear to the hook; hooks bear a great resemblance, and there may be a piece of beef like mine. The tail had been cut off, another butcher might cut it off in that way. I have enquired the prisoner's character, he bears a very fair character.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. On the 29th of November I saw the two prisoners Blenhim and Welch at Mr. Parker's shop window. I perceived Blenhim moving his hand close to the glass; Blenhim and Welch were close together. I saw the motion of Blenhim's hand as if he was cutting the putty from glass. They both went away from the window, and then all the three prisoners got together, and just at the end of the shop window they were conversing together. Then the prisoners Welch and Blenhim left Werrall and went to the window again. I saw Blenhim in the same act as before stated. They both left the window again, and the three prisoners got into conversation at the window again; during the time a cart was going by the door. The prisoner Welch went to the glass, and pushed the glass in; he returned back to the other two, and said I have done it. The two prisoners Blenhim and Welch came to the other window, and Werrall crossed over the way. I saw Blenhim put his hand into the hole in the glass; he took his hand out, and removed half way up to the front of the window; he returned to Welch at the other window. I saw the prisoner Blenhim put his hand in again; the prisoner Welch stood at his right; there was a whistle from the other side of the way; they were making off with them. I took them into custody. I searched Blenhim, and found a knife on him, a tobacco box and a tobacco stopper.</p>

Enston got up; he went to the heap of wheat, and poured the wheat into the woman's basket; the woman came out of the barn with the basket, she went round on one side of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who advised you to prosecute the woman - A. Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the quantity of the wheat - A.About a peck; this is the wheat, and here is a sample from the bulk; the wheat is worth two shillings.</p>

            . I am one of the Barnet patrols. I patrol the road from Barnet to Highgate. On the 7th of September, near 10 o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner with the hay cloth on his back; it was near the seven mile stone where I took him. I told him he had got a hay cloth on his back; he said yes, he was going to the Green Man with it to cover a load of hay in the morning. I kept my eye upon him to see whether he went to the Green Man; instead of going to the Green Man, he turned down the road which goes to Crouch End. I laid hold of him. I told him that was not the way to the Green Man. He said no, but he was going that way. I left the hay cloth at the Green Man. After I had secured him, I gave him to my partner; he took him to the Cage. I brought the prisoner to Bow-street office. The next morning I went to Mr. Spencer's house. I informed Heman; he got up and examined the premises; the hay cloth was missing. The next morning I shewed him the hay cloth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the hay cloth. I was going with it to where it belonged. I was taken in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose three sacks at any time - A. Yes, the prisoner was in my employment. We have almost 80 boys; some sleep in the stable, and some elsewhere. I was watching I saw the prisoner take three sacks out of the yard; he took them out of No. 16 on the wharf. I took the prisoner to the constable; he was taken to the watch-house; these are the sacks I detected him with stealing. I asked the prisoner what he did with the sacks; he said, he took them to put them under his bed.</p>

On the day my master's house was robbed a man came down the area steps; he opened the kitchen door; he asked me for Mr. Gradon, a fellow-servant of mine, the footman. I told him he was not at home, but I thought he would soon return, from the time he had been out, on account of dinner. He then asked my leave to wait; I said, by all means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sit down - A. He was just bending himself to sit down as the parlour bell rung. I immediately went up, and left no one in the kitchen but the prisoner. I went into the dining-room, and while I was in the dining-room the street door bell rang. I went to the street door, and when I opened the door, a stranger (another man) appeared, he also asked me for Gradon.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you for the same fellow-servant as the prisoner had asked you - A. Yes; the man asked me how long Gradon had lived with us, and said he supposed he might see him at three o'clock. I said, you may see him any time this afternoon. No other conversation passed. He turned towards Russell-square; then I shut the door. I went into the dining-room immediately, and took the tray. I saw the same man return by the dining-room window; he was then coming back from Russell-square. I took the tray down stairs into the kitchen, and saw the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the prisoner is the man that you left in the kitchen - A. Yes, I feel quite confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did Gradon come home - A. I saw him come home the next morning. When I found the man at the bar was gone, I went up the area steps immediately, thinking the prisoner knew the other person that came.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went up the area steps did you find the man that was missing - A. No, I could not discover one or the other. I went back again; I went into the pantry, and saw the tray of plate was gone. I had seen the tray of plate in the pantry about three minutes before the prisoner came in the kitchen. I then took a silver fork out to carry up stairs. Gradon did not come home till the next morning. I did not tell Gradon of it, nor did my fellow-servant. I screamed out when I missed the plate; my mistress immediately came down; the intelligence was sent to my master; my master came home with Vickrey, a Bow-street officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What plate was missing - A. I cannot exactly say; my master valued it at one hundred pounds. We found more lost afterwards than what is in the indictment. The tray was full of plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when this circumstance was old to Gradon - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this was any steps taken by Gradon and you - A. Yes; I described the man to Gradon, his dress, and every thing, so far as I was able. This happened on Friday, the 12th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Gradon did not return till Saturday morning - A. No. On Sunday morning, Gradon and I went to the Spanish chapel to see if the prisoner was there. We did not see him there. Then we went to the Crown public-house in Clipstone-street; we sent to the prisoner's house, No. 11, Clipstone-street. I believe he is in lodgings. The prisoner's wife came. We did not see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the prisoner - A. Not till I saw him in a public-house in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you since seen a coat that you know - A. I have since seen a coat that was the colour of the coat the prisoner had on. I did not see the prisoner until he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the persons call again that had called for the prisoner - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner had you the least doubt of him - A. No, I had not. I knew his face then, though he was dressed in a different way. He was dressed clean when he came to enquire for the footman, and when he was taken in custody he was shabby.</p>

               <p>Q.Before you went into the service of Mr. Clements had you known the prisoner - A. Yes, about two years at different times.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you made any communication to him respecting your family - A. I mentioned to him that the young man that kept company with my daughter, his name was Watts; he lived as butler with Mr. - . I do not exactly recollect the gentleman's name. I told the prisoner that just before I went into the service of Mr. Clements.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever introduced him to Watts - A. Never, I believe he might have seen him, but never to have known him. He walked with him once on the 17th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day on which your master's plate was missing - A. Yes. I was out of my master's house that day. I did not return the whole day. I returned at seven o'clock the next morning. I went out with a message for my master; I stopped out without leave. My master told me of the plate being missing about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you suspect to be the person that stole the plate - A. The prisoner from the description of the maid servant. I suspected Carey and Johnson, from the description the maid servant gave me; in consequence of that suspicion we went on the Sunday following to the Spanish chapel, with a vew if we could see any person of my acquaintance. After that we went to Clipstone-street. We sent a message from the public-house to the prisoner's house, to know if the prisoner was at home; his wife came. On the Wednesday following, Watts called upon me, to know why the prisoner called at his master's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010054"/>house. In consequence of what Watts said, the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the place where the book is usually kept - A. No. He asked me the favour to put him on the book present on Friday, on the 12th; I told him I would put him on the book, or cause him to be put on the book sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was ill or well - A. At this time he told me he was ill on Friday, and I believed he was ill on the Friday, seeing him look so bad. He rather paused about it, still wished to be put on the book as present; I told him I would do what I could, if I did not put him on the book, Mr. Nash should.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean sick, do not you - A. Yes; that ended the conversation at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the day did you see him again - A. Yes; he asked me whether he was put down on the book as present. I told him, no, he was put down sick; I dare not put him down any other way; I should have been discharged if I had. He was very unhappy and uneasy. We were together some time. We went and had some beer together after. He said he was unhappy and uneasy. I said, oh, my God, Carey, what have you been doing; I am sadly afraid you have been guilty of a robbery. I said that because I saw him so agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make to that - A. Yes, I have. Oh, my God; I said who saw you. The maid. That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass after that - A. No. We both went home; I went my way, and he went his. I did not tell any body of this for three or four days: I believe I first told the Commodore Gentry of it. I have known him five years and three months; I never knew any thing amiss of him; I would trust him with any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. CLEMENTS. I live at 51, Woburn-place. My house is in the parish of St. George's Bloomsbury, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the plate you lost - A. Between sixty and seventy pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The reason I asked Mr. Everest to put me down in the book sick, the Company only allows two days to be absent in a month. I never did the robbery; I am accused falsely, so help me God.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I fetched the watchman in my house, and gave the prisoner in charge; the prisoner was then in bed. The watchman, I, and Mason, went up stairs, into the prisoner's bed-room. I took up the prisoner's working jacket; I asked him if it was his; he replied it was. I gave it to the watchman; he searched it in my presence. In the jacket pocket was thirteen three-shilling bank tokens, a five shilling paper of halfpence, and a shilling.</p>

In consequence of the money being found in his jacket pocket, I took out my pocket handkerchief, and the watchman tied up the thirteen three-shilling tokens, and kept possession of it. I gave the watchman charge of the prisoner; he took him to the watchhouse. The prisoner wished me to forgive him.</p>

I marked four of them: I made a cross under the neck part. A little after this, I lent a neighbour two three-shilling tokens out of this bowl; they were not marked. I left the four marked ones behind. In the course of half an hour the same person brought two others back; that made the number eight again. Between seven and eight, I saw the prisoner go to the desk; after I had seen him there, I went behind the desk; I then saw five bank tokens had been taken away; they were only three left. I informed my mistress of it. I saw the watchman take thirteen three-shilling bank tokens from the prisoner's jacket pocket, among which were the four marked ones; I picked them out at the watchhouse; they were given to the constable.</p>

Yes; when I get there the cart was in the public-house yard, the things were taken out, and lodged in the house; a bedstead I saw, and I have sworn it to be mine; the other things I have no doubt is mine. I am sure the bedstead is part of the furniture I bought at Mr. Gundry's house.</p>

On the 8th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Sirley came in for a quartern of butter; Parsons came in to give him a farthing. I then missed the bacon off the counter; the bacon was nearer Parsons than Shirley. I taxed Parsons with having taken the bason; he said, he knew nothing about it. I went and fetched Mr. Hawkins, the publican; Parsons then took the bacon out of his hat, and asked forgiveness; he was taken to Marybone watchhouse. This is the bacon; it is my husband's property.</p>

I went out. Before I went out I laid this money on the bar counter; there were 18 shillings in silver. I left it on the bar counter about 12 o'clock at night, and five shillings in halfpence. About 12 o'clock I went to the cook shop to get something for my supper. I locked up the door, and took the key with me. On my return I asked the watchman to give me a light; the watchman saw me to my own door and gave me a light; I saw the money on the bar counter then. I then said to the watchman, if you know a nice girl, we will have a bit of fun to-night. The watchman went away, and left the prisoner in the house. In about three hours the watchman came by and saw the street door open. I then asked the watchman if he knew where the prisoner lived; he said, yes, and took me to the prisoner's room. He and I searched the prisoner's room, and under her pillow I found an old handkerchief with my silver in it. I then told the watchman my pieces of silver were in one three shilling Bank token, two eighteen penny tokens, and two of the shillings were marked.</p>

I gave her a shilling, she fetched half a pint of gin. I told the prisoner I was a married man. I found the prisoner very busy handling me. I drank a glass of gin, and went out to go home. Going along, I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my money and my watch. On the next morning I went to the house where I had been the night before. I asked the prisoner for my watch; she denied having it. She said, if I had lost it it served me right. I got an officer: he found my watch at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I was in Grays Inn lane on the morning of the 15th of November. I saw the prisoner pass on the opposite side of the way with something bulky; it was two trusses of hay tied together with a rope.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010059"/>Q. Did you see where he came from - A. No. I asked him where he was going to take that hay to; he told me, to his master in Portpool-lane. I asked him where he had brought it from; he told me, a little way down Grays Inn lane; he was coming as if from Mr. Ashton's; he observed to me that the watchman, whose beat it was in, knew that it was all right. By this time the watchman came up, his name is Lawrence. I said, Lawrence, what do you know of this hay? He said he believed it was all right; the man goes by here every morning with a couple of trusses, and has done so some time. I asked him what reason he had to suppose it was all right? He told me that he had been appointed on that beat five months, and he not thinking it was quite right, he stopped the prisoner. The prisoner told him the same story as he did me; that the prisoner said to him, as you dispute the hay, I will put it down, and I will go and get a person to prove it. With that Lawrence said he went away, and said I will get a person to prove it. He brought a person that said, watchman, it is all right, and therefore Lawrence said upon this occasion it is all right. I said, I don't think it is all right. I told the prisoner to go on. I saw a watchman going along; I told him to follow me. I saw the prisoner go down White-horse yard; he took a key from his pocket, and unlocked a padlock, and rolled the hay in; he shut the door, and locked it up again. I was with him all the time. I told him I was not satisfied about the hay; he must give me something more satisfactory than what he had told me. I asked the prisoner what his master's name was? he said, that was not altogether his master where he had put the hay; he said he worked there occasionally for this man, his name was Hughes; he said he worked for Mr. Ashton at that time. I did not know who Mr. Ashton was. I asked him whether he got the hay from Mr. Ashton; he said he did not, he had it at a corn chandler's shop. the corner of Little James-street, going into Grays Inn lane. I asked him if he meaned to say he got it at the corn chandler's at that time in the morning; he said yes, Sir, I bid the watchman see that nobody took the hay out of the place, while I went to the corn chandler's to know whether any body had hay there at that time in the morning. I went and found no hay had been sold there. I returned immediately. When I came to the place the watchman was there with the hay, but the prisoner was gone. I called Lawrence to stay while I went up to the watch-house to know whether I was empowered to take the man that had received the hay, and while I was gone Lawrence had apprehended the prisoner.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Blower. On Wednesday afternoon, about three o'clock, Mr. Blower sent me out to receive a bill of a neighbour. I missed a piece of cotton from within the door. As I was going out I looked in the street, and saw the prisoner about ten yards off. I overtook her, and asked her whether she had got a piece of print. She looked confused, and did not answer. I pulled her cloak open, she had this piece of cotton under her arm, it is Mr. Blower's property.</p>

I felt her hand at my watch, trying to get my watch out of my pocket. In about two minutes after she went away from me. I felt if I had my watch in my pocket; it was gone. I went to see if I could see her, I could not. The next morning I went round to the pawnbroker's. I told them if they saw an old fashioned watch, to stop it.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Bullman. On the 3d of December, between nine and ten o'clock, I was going past the bar into the back-parlour, I saw the prisoner take some halfpence out of a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she use to go to the till to take out halfpence to give change to the customers - A. Yes. She continued in the bar about ten minutes, some time after I followed her to the cellar-door, her pocket dropped off, the prisoner took the pocket up, and put in the drawer. When my master came down the constable was sent for, and she was taken in custody, charged with having stolen the halfpence; she said, the pocket was hers, the copper she had to pay for her shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any dispute with her - A. Yes, the same morning; we very often used to have words.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

On Wednesday, the 1st of December, I brought the things in out of the yard, and laid them on the table by the window; this was about a quarter before five at night. I went out to the yard to fetch some more in, and when I came back the things were gone; my lodger came in; he saw the prisoner take the two shirts, stockings, aprons, and night-cap, out of the window. I pursued the prisoner; he was about twenty yards from my house. I made an alarm; the prisoner then threw the things down; I picked up the things, and in about five minutes the prisoner was brought back to my door.</p>

My pocket-book being in that pocket, I seized the prisoner by the coller; the other two men decamped. I conveyed him to Mr. Stackwood's; an officer was sent for, and the prisoner was taken to the Compter. I never let him go.</p>
