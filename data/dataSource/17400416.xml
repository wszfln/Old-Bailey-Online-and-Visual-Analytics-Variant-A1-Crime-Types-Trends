She told me her Mistress wanted some Salt, and had ordered her to wait in my Shop till she came; and therefore, with my Leave, she would sit down: and accordingly she sat her self down by a Vinegar-Cask; near which the Pewter Gallon-pot stood. After she had set a while in the Shop, she got up, and bid me weigh the Salt, while she stepp'd thro' Newgate for 2 Gallons of Gin, and then she would come again. As soon as she was gone, I miss'd the Gallon-Pot; upon which I went after her, and took her in Phoenix-Court , with the Pot upon her. She told me, her Necessity made her do it, and begg'd that I would not send her to Newgate, but rather let her go to Bridewell. <rs id="t17400416-1-verdict6" type="verdictDescription">

I consented; and his Mother sent him Home next Morning, (as I was informed) but he did not come near me till Sunday the 24th of February last, (which was a Fortnight after he had been sent Home) and then my Servant-Maid informed me, she let the Prisoner into the House, a quarter after 8 in the Morning, before I was up. The next Morning (Monday) I got up between 7 and 8, and casting an Eye upon my Shew-Glass, I thought the Goods look'd thin, and that several Things were wanting. Upon this I examined my other Boy, and was satisfied that he knew nothing of them; and the Prisoner being absent again, I suspected him, and upon searching after him, I took him in Hanging-sword-Alley in Fleet-street, on the Wednesday Night following.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160003"/> He was carried to the Watch house, and there we found the gold Ring with 5 false Stones upon him, and nothing else.

She staid some Time in the House, and dined with us; and told us the Candles were for her Aunt, who kept the Jewel-Office in the Tower and as we had served that Person before, we were civil to the Prisoner, and she staid with us from 11 in the Morning, till 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon: she then went out, telling us she would go to the Box-maker's, and order a Box to be sent, into which the Candles were to be put. As soon as she was gone, I miss'd the Spoon and Hood, which lay upon the Dresser, and remembering I had seen both of them in her Hand, while she was in the House, I went after her to the Box-maker's, but she had not been there, nor did I see any thing more of her, till last Wednesday, and then I happened to see her going to take Water at the Old Swan.

It was in the Morning, but I can't tell the Hour. The Woman that was with her, bought enough to make a Child's Frock, and paid 3 s. for that, and a Bit of Cambrick. When they came in, they asked for printed Cottons, to make a Frock; and I shew'd them this very Piece, but they did not like it then; so I let it lie on the Counter, and shew'd them Purple and White, some of which they bought. When the Prisoner's Companion had paid me the 3 s. the Prisoner went out of the Shop, and her Companion stood at the Door talking with me: but suspecting I had lost something, I stepp'd out, and took the Prisoner 5 or 6 Doors beyond our Shop; and when I had got her back into the Shop, she took this Cotton from under her Apron, and gave it me into my Hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent of taking the Linnen. The young Man ( Woodward ) took it up in the the Shop, but whether the other Woman left it there, or not, I can't tell. I did not give it him into his Hand; he took it off the Ground himself, and said, here's the Linnen.</p>
               <p>Woodward. She herself deliver'd it to me, from under her Apron, and her Companion desired me not to pull her about so. The other Woman I let go.</p>

               <p>The Record of Underwood's Conviction was read.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manning . In December 1736, I was robbed by Underwood of 2 Pair of Stockings; they were stolen out of my shop in Holborn. By Underwood's Directions I went to the Prisoner's House: She then lived in Black-Boy-Alley in Chick-Lane. I took her before Mr. Justice Poulson , about a Day or 2 after the Robbery was committed, and one Pair of my Stockings were taken off her Legs: but soon after this, she was admitted to Bail, and I never could find either the Prisoner or her Bail, until some little Time ago when her Bail came and told me she was in Custody, and that I must prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave Underwood 3 s. and 6 d. for the Stockings, and asked him if he had not found them, and said I would not buy them if he had stole them.</p>
               <p>Manning . Underwood was a Boy, about 14 Years of Age; I prosecuted him in January Sessions 1736, for stealing 2 Pair of Stockings. One Pair, which I took upon Him, and those which I found upon Her, were mine. She now says, she gave 3 s. and 6 d. for them; but when she was before the Justice, she said she gave but 1 s. and 6 d. and did not ask the Boy how he came by them. The Stockings cost me 4 Shillings.</p>

            . This Thing was done on Sunday the ninth of March; I was going into the Chapel at the same Time, and was within a Yard and a half of the Gentleman when it happened. I saw him catch hold of the Prisoner's Hand, and he cry'd out, Ma Montre! Ma Montre ! A Gentlewoman coming up, asked what was the Matter? I told her the Gentleman cry'd, Ma Mon-tre ! Ma Montre ! Why (says she) that is, His Watch! His Watch! Upon which I caught hold of the Prisoner on one Side, while the Gentleman held her on the other, and while I called out, - The Gentleman has lost his Watch! she shifted her Hand behind her, and dropped it upon the Ground, just within the Chapel. I am positive she is the Woman, and that I saw the Watch drop behind her, but by the crouding of the People she was pushed a little beyond it, and then we saw it. When we took it up, we saw a little Tin Box on the Ground, in which was three Shillings ; the Prisoner cry'd , - that Box is mine; but I did not see her drop that , though I saw her drop the Watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I lift up my Hands directly, to shew I had none of the Watch?</p>
               <p>Smith. As soon as ever she had dropped the Watch, she lifted up her Hands, and then cry'd out, - Search me! Search me! I am sure she dropped it before she lifted up her Hands, for I saw the bottom Part of the Watch, and the Chain, slipping through her Hand. This is the same Watch, I am almost sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the Chevalier whether the Watch had a Chain to it at that Time?</p>
               <p>Chevalier Rusca . It had the same Chain to it then. The Watch was in the same Condition as it is in now.</p>
               <p>Smith . I saw the Thing from beginning to ending. When the Gentleman had got his Watch again, he went into the Chapel; but the Mob saying he had given Orders to his Footman to have the Woman secured, we took her, and carried her to a publick House, the Sign of the John of Gaunt , and from thence to a publick House in Holhourn , where we kept her till we got more Constables.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if the Gentleman did not seize another Woman?</p>
               <p>Smith. Not just then; - it was afterwards. The Gentleman had hold of the Breast of her Gown, when she threw up her Hands; and I informed him she had dropped the Watch, in half a Quarter of a Minute, - I told him of it as soon as I could, for there was a Croud of People in the Chapel, and then he laid hold of another Woman. I was giving him Notice that the Prisoner had dropped it behind her, while she was holding up her Hands, and just after he had picked it up, he took hold of another Woman, and pushed her and the Prisoner about, as much as to say, - Get out of the Chapel, The second Woman that he lay'd hold of, was one who came up to him after the Watch was found; and desired him not to hurt the Girl (meaning the Prisoner) now he had got it again, I can't say what he took hold of the second Woman for, because I could not understand what he said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of the Watch, nor of that Woman; but the Gentleman held my Hands till the Watch was found; and then he bid us both go about our Business. Besides, - I had then a long scarlet Cloak on, and how could he see me drop the Watch?</p>
               <p>Chevalier Rusca . She had then the same Cloak, which she has on now. (She had a light-coloured short Cloth cloak on at the Bar.)</p>
               <p>Smith. I think she had a red short Cloak on, at that Time; and had a Velvet Hood, and a Hat over it.</p>
               <p>Chevalier Rusca . I am sure it was the same she has on now.</p>
               <p>Smith . To the best of my Remembrance, she was then in a red Cloak.</p>
               <p>Chevalier . I don't remember how her Head was dress'd; but she had a Cloak of the very same Colour with that she has on now.</p>
               <p>Smith . When the Gentleman had got his Watch again, he went into the Chapel, and staid till the Ceremony was over; after which a Man told him the Woman was in Custody, and he must go to Colonel De Veil's. He went accordingly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160007"/> but did not see the Prisoner; for she was rescued from the Constables, as they were carrying her thither.</p>
               <p>Jury . We desire Smith may be asked what Trade he is, and what brought him to that Place?</p>
               <p>Smith. I am 'Prentice to Mr Richards, a Tin-Man, at the Black Horse and Star in Fleet-street, near Fleet-Ditch; and am of the same Perswasion, - a

            , Constable. My Beadle being charged with the Prisoner for robbing the Chevalier Rusca, on Sunday, March 9, he brought her to my House. She then had a red short Cloak on; but it is possible she might have changed her Cloak, between the Chapel and my House. She was brought to me between 12 and 1 at Noon, and we kept her two Hours, because the Gentleman did not care to give himself the Trouble to appear against her, and I did not know how to discharge her. At last I found him out, and desired him to go to the Justice's, and told him, I would bring the Prisoner to him there: but as we were carrying her along, three Fellows with Fire-Arms stopped the Coach, over-against Windsor-Court in Drury-Lane, broke the Door open, and rescued her from us.</p>

            . We took Coach at Mr Ward's Door, and were going before the Justice, with the Prisoner, but when we came against Windsor-Court , one Man came up, and clapp'd a Pistol in at the Coach-Door, and swore he would blow our Brains out. Another bid the Coachman stop: I bid him drive on; but he refused, and said he would not venture his Life. Upon this our Beadle jumped out of the Coach, but another Fellow ran up to him with a great Sniggersnee Thing, and swore he was a dead Man, if he stirred farther. Upon this the Prisoner jumped out of the Coach, and they all ran away together. The Chevalier's Footman gave the Beadle charge of the Prisoner, on the Outside of the Chapel.</p>

             . I am a Mantua-maker, and Habit-maker. I have worked three Years for the Prisoner, and between 7 and 8 for her Mother. I know they are honest People; what I have done for them, they have paid me for. Her Mother liv'd at St. James's, and the Prisoner liv'd first in the Hay-market, and now in Windsor-Court, in Drury-Lane. The old Woman was a green Grocer, and as to the Prisoner's Business, I had no Occasion to enquire about that, - for if she employed me, she paid me. She kept a House, but I don't know what Sort of a House it was, nor do I know her Husband.</p>

They were taken from thence, (as she says) last Saturday was a Fortnight. The Prisoner lodged in a ready furnished Room in my House, but these things were not for the Use of my Lodgers: they were all put up in my Bureau, on Saturday Night, but the Drawer was not locked; and I missed them on Monday Morning following, - it was the Monday after Palm Sunday. I immediately advertised them; and a Pawnbroker having seen the Advertisement, came to me with the Gold Necklace, and asked me if it was mine? I told him, I could swear to it, and enquired if he knew the Person who brought it to him? He said he should, know the Woman again if he was to see her. I had a suspicion of the Prisoner, and let him have a fight of her; and he told me, she was the Person who brought it to his House. Upon this I got a Constable, and told her, if she would confess, it should be better for her. She then told me the Things were all in her Room, and I got a Warrant to search it, but not finding any of them, she was committed to the Gatehouse. The next Morning she sent for me and my Wife, and took all the fault on herself; and her pretended Husband restored these Things.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I believe the whole Discovery was made on a Promise of Pardon. There was an absolute Promise given the Prisoner, when they were before me, that they would be very favourable.</p>
               <p>P. Dekayne. I made her a Promise, in Order to get my Goods again, but I did not give her hopes of Pardon, that was not in my Power; I only promised to be favourable, so as the Law would run.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dekayne. The Prisoner was a Lodger in my House, in Great Earl Street, St. Giles's. We lost these Things on the Saturday Night before Palm Sunday, when no body was at Home but she, and our Apprentice. We missed the Goods on Monday Morning, and by the Prisoner's advice, she and I went to a Cunning Man, on the other Side of the Water; and she prayed to God that the Person who robbed me might be brought to Justice, and as I was so good a Woman, she should be glad (she said) to see them hanged who had injured me. After this she went with me to several Pawnbrokers, and told me she would go 100 Miles barefoot, to see the Thief prosecuted. But as we could get no Intelligence of our Goods, my Husband advertised them; and the Wednesday following the Pawnbroker came with the Gold Necklace and Locket; and the Prisoner coming into the House at the same Time, he knew her, and said he would swear she was the Person that brought it to him. Upon this she was seized and carryed before his Honourable Worship, where she confessed every Thing; and as she came out of his Worship's House, she said she would not part with the Things, - she would keep them to maintain her, while she was in Goal. While she was in the Round-house she sent for us, and when we came there, she desired me to go up Stairs with her: I did so, and she told me it was out of her Power to help me to my Things again, and she fell down on her Knees, and owned she had taken them all. Dear Mrs Poole , said I, how did you get in? At the Door, or the Window? Mrs Dekayne , (said she) your eldest Apprentice went out into the Yard, and desired me to take Care of the Parlour Door, and while he was gone out, I went in, in Hopes of finding a great deal of Money; but finding none I looked about for something else; and the first Things I found were the Rings, the Necklace and Spoons; and Mrs Dekayne, (says she) if I had not been afraid of your Apprentice's returning, I should have looked farther. She owned she had taken all the Things mentioned in the Indictment, and begged for Mercy. I told her she had shewn me none, but yet if she would tell me where the Goods were I would be favourable. So we got the things, and we carried them, with the Prisoner, before his Worship: and when she came there, she could make no Answer to them, but owned she had taken them. - There were no Promises given her of Favour.</p>
               <p>The Justice. The Goods, with the Prisoner, were brought before me; she owned she had taken them, but insisted on the Promises they had made to her, and they did not at all contradict her, nor deny their Promise.</p>
               <p>- Jenkins. The Prisoner had formerly brought several Things to our Shop; and she came with this Necklace on the first of April. I took it in Pawn from her, but it being advertised, I carried it to Mr Dekayne , and he owned it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in her Defence said, that Mrs Dekayne had complained to her that her Husband had carried away some Things of Value; and that she committed this Necklace and Locket to her Care, after she had made her drink until she knew not what she did, or said. But she denied having any thing else in her Custody.</p>
               <p>Mrs Dekayne deposed she had not drank with the Prisoner, and that the Goods were all taken away together, while she and her Husband were abroad. <rs id="t17400416-10-verdict59" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Samuel Jackson . I lost a Cloak, a Gown, a Waistcoat, and a Sheet and several other things, which we cannot swear to, because she deny'd them; but the Goods I have mentioned, were lost the Friday after Michaelmas last. I suspected the Prisoner had taken them, and hearing she was gone to Barnet, I sent after her, but could not find her till last Saturday was three Weeks, and then I accidentally li't of her in Chiswell-street, and taxed her with the Things - I can't say I mentioned every particular Thing, - I did mention some of them, and asked her if she had not stole them? She owned she had, and went with me to a Pawnbroker's, at the Angel and Anchor, at the Bottom of Grub-street, and asked for the Waistcoat and Sheet, in the Name of Perkins, and when the Pawnbroker told her, he did not remember them to have been pawned in that Name, she said it might be in her maiden Name,

I afterwards went to this Man (at the Sign of the Tea-table) and asked him if he would let me have the Gown again without a Search-warrant? He told me, I should not have it either with, or without, a Warrant; upon which I got a Warrant, and searched the House, but, I suppose, he had made away with it, for I could not find it. The Prisoner at first said, she had only pawn'd the Cloak for a Smilling, and that my Wife had lent it to her; but she afterwards confess'd all the Things, and went with me to the Pawnbrokers where she had pledg'd them, - I can't say she told me how she came by them.</p>

             . The Prisoner lodg'd in our House, and lay with a Girl who is our Servant. The Things mentioned in the Indictment, were miss'd the fifth of October last, and I suspected the Prisoner to have stole them, because she said she was going to receive some Money of a Gentleman at the Half-Moon-Tavern, and should return in half an Hour, but she never came home any more. I had Occasion to look for a Cap for my Child, in about an Hour after she was gone out, and miss'd all the Things: nor could we hear any Thing of the Prisoner, till my Husband met her in Chiswell-street , and then she owned she had taken them, and I saw my Gown at the Pawnbroker's, but he would not let us have it, though it was brought down upon the Prisoner's asking for it. We likewise went with her to another Pawnbroker's, where she said she had pawn'd the Waistcoat and Sheet; but the People told her she did not ask for them in the right Name, and therefore they would not produce them: so we saw nothing but the Gown, and that we can't get. The Cloak (indeed) she had worn all the Winter, and it is not worth a Farthing now.</p>

               <p>Richard Crimes . I lost 30 l. out of a Chest in Edward Dudley's House, It was in a Leather Pocket, in a Chest, which was locked, and I kept the Key of it: I took particular Notice, that it was there the 10th of Feb. last. On the 19th of March I was at Work at Stratford , and Mr Dudley came thither to me, and asked me what Money I had in my Chest at his House, telling me he found it broke open. I informed him, I had 30 l. there, and mentioned what Pieces of Money there were. 22 Guineas, 3 Half Guineas, 2 Thirty-six Shilling Pieces, one Moidore, and 7 s. and 6 d. in Silver. Upon receiving this News from Mr Dudley, I came directly to London, and found my Chest broke open, and all my Money gone. Mr Dudley suspected the Prisoner, because he was his <rs id="t17400416-14-deflabel81" type="occupation">Apprentice</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. I am between 14 and 15.</p>
               <p>Crimes. The Prisoner being run away from his Master's House, somebody informed him, that he had been seen with Money upon him; this gave Mr Dudley a Suspicion of him, and he searched after him, took him, and got him committed to New-Prison before I came to Town. While he was there in Goal, I went to him, and examined what he had done with the Money. He told me, he forced open the Chest with a File, and took the Money; and the Remainder, which was unspent, he had given his Master. He gave me an Account, that he went out with the Money into Moorfields, and got into Company with some Boys who were tossing up there; that he carried some of the Boys to an Alehouse , where they had some Beef-stakes drest, and a young Woman with them. One of the large Pieces of Money, (he said,) he had given to a great Boy to get changed for him, and the Boy brought him 21 Shillings for it; and 20 Shillings or upwards, he had spent himself. I asked him how he had made away with so much</p>
               <p>Money? He told me, he had bought Shoes, and Handkerchiefs for several of the Boys, and one Handkerchief, which he had bought for himself, his Master found upon him. In this Manner he said he had spent 20 Shillings. The rest of the Money, that was missing, the great Boy had cheated him of; for he had given him the Bag to hold for him at the Alehouse, while he went out; and when he returned, he told him he was sure he had opened it, because it was not tied up in the same Manner, as it was when he left it in his Hands: Upon which the great Boy denied it, and ran away immediately. The Prisoner was taken before he had squandered all the Money away; and Mr Dudley returned me 24 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Edward Dudley. The Prisoner was my Apprentice, and having ran away from my Service, I happened to see him as I was going with a Friend into the City, and I laid hold of him. I had not any Suspicion of his having taken this Money then; but my Friend, observing him to drop some upon the Ground, told me of it, and I searched him, and took 6 Pence and 6 Pence Halfpenny out of one Pocket, and 2 l. 17 s. 6 d. and a Handkerchif out of another of his Pockets. Upon this I went to get Advice how to secure the Money, and in the mean Time he got away. When I came Home I found Mr. Crimes's Chest broke open; and when the Prisoner was taken the second Time, he owned he broke it open with a File, and had taken away all the Money. Nineteen Guineas, a Moidore, a Half-Guinea, and a Pair of Buttons, he delivered me at that Time, which he owned was part of the Money he had taken out of the Chest. The Prisoner's Father says he is 15 Years old this Month: He has been bound to me between 8 and 9 Months.</p>

The Prisoner was one that used to go achairing, and being a poor Woman, and destitute of a Lodging, as we had a spare-bed in our Garret, we let her lie there out of Charity. The Gown mentioned in the Indictment was my Wife's, and it being missing, we taxed the Prisoner with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160011"/> having taken it and she confessed she stole it on the 26th of last December, and hid it under her Bed, - between the Bed and the Sacking, until the next Morning, and then she carried it away very early. I knew my Wife had such a Gown, and that it was in the House before the Prisoner took it. 'Iis a brocaded Gown; and the Prisoner owned she carried it to pawn at Mr Coxon's the Pawnbroker's, and he stopped it.</p>
               <p>Mr Coxon. About 10 or 11 o'Clock in the Morning, December 26. the Prisoner came to my House, and offered a brocaded Gown to pawn: this is the same identical Gown. Upon looking at the Gown, and examinig her, I suspected she had not come fairly by it, and my Suspicion was increased, by her not giving such satisfactory Answers to my Questions, as I expected from an honest Person. She said at first, that the Gown belong'd to a Mistress of her's in Holbourn . I sent thither, but the Prisoner's Mistress was not to be found. I then told her, I would stop it: she told me, she would go and fetch the right Owner of the Gown, and she went out, and returned again, with a big-belly'd Woman, all whose Clothes upon her Back was not worth 20 s. nor were the Prisoner's better. I told the Woman, she could never be the Owner of that Gown in question, and that I would stop it, and advertise it, which I accordingly did; and the Prisoner came one Evening about 7 o'Clock, (five or six Nights after the Gown had been advertised) and she was then a little better dressed; she asked for the Gown that I had advertised: I looked her full in the Face, - Why, says I, you are the Woman who brought it here! Yes, says she, I am so, and what then? Why then I will stop you; but before I could get from behind my Counter she was gone. I pursued her, but being in my Slippers, and the Ground being slippery with the Snow, she out ran me, and got clear off. I heard nothing of the Owner of the Gown, till a Fortnight or three Weeks after; and then the Prosecutor came and claimed the Gown. I did not shew it him, at that Time, but bid him go to Mr Oldfield's , (the Constable) in Tavistock-Street, and if he made his Property in it appear, I should be glad to return it to him. After we had been at the Constable's, we went before Col. De Veil, and there they described the Gown so particularly, that the Colonel said, it plainly appeared to be theirs, and 'twas pity they had not taken the Thief. In about six Hours afterwards, they did take the Prisoner, and brought her before</p>
               <p>the Colonel, where she owned she had stole the Gown. She acknowledged the same at Mr Oldfield, the Constable's House. I think this is the very Gown the Prisoner brought, and which I stopped: 'tis worth 10 l. and I verily believe it is the same.</p>

I went to enquire for this Jackson at the three Nuns, but no such Person lived there.

I don't know who the Men were, but one of them struck me down with a Blow he gave me on the Breast. When I was on the Ground, they turned out one of my Pockets, and took my Money, - 5 s. I am sure I lost, I believe I had more. The Prisoner, I am positive, is the Woman that came up to me first, for I had seen her at a House where I had been drinking that Night, and she would have come into my Company, had I not refused her.</p>

             came up, and knocked him down in the Dirt. I saw this, but I was afraid to speak then for fear of having my Brains knocked out. But the Prosecutor coming next Day to the House, where he had left his Watch, I told him what I knew, and went with him before Colonel De Veil, where I gave the same Account I have given now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her, whether I did not see her, next Day, in the Constable's House; whether I did not ask the Prosecutor there, if he knew who robbed him; whether the Prosecutor did not say, No; and whether she did not point to me, and tell him, I was the Person? She has a Spite against me, because I once served a Warrant upon her.</p>
               <p>Brown . She never served a Warrant upon me in her Life: Mr Fellows said he knew her, the Minute he saw her, and said she was the Woman. I only told him then, that I had seen her use him ill. I saw the Prosecutor in the House, that Night he was robbed; he had been drinking, but was not in Liquor, - he was not drunk.</p>

I was 'frighted because I was alone, and had a Guinea about me, and more Shillings: but he did not threaten me with any Words, nor did he lay Hands on me; and there were People passing along in every Fields, but this. - I can't say the Prisoner is the Person; but a Man saw him with me, and pursued him, and took him. The Man who saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160013"/> him with me, came up to me, after he had got the Shilling, and asked me if he had not robbed me? I said, - nothing but a Shilling which I had given him. He had something in his Pocket, but I can't tell what it was, for I was in a Surprize, and alone. I was not in Fear of his proceeding to use Violence, because there were People in all the Fields. - He offered no Violence to me. I was afraid because I was alone, and I saw Part of something in his Hand, but I could not tell what it was, being alone.</p>

             . This young Woman and my Master were walking together from Hampstead, and just before they came to this Field they parted, and she went down the Field. I was upon the Shafts of my Cart, driving towards London, and saw a Man run up to the young Woman in the Field: she drew back, and he followed her: and I saw her put her Hand into her Pocket, and give him something. Then I jump'd off the Copses of the Cart, and made up to her. When I was come within 20 Yards of her, I asked her if the Man had not robb'd her? She said, yes: upon which I desired her not to be frighted, but to make over to the Houses, and I would bring the Man back to her. I pursu'd the Prisoner, and he took to his Heels, and ran up the the Field, into the Road that goes to St Giles's, and from thence into another Field, and as he was getting over a Bank, I saw another Man, and called out to him to stop the Prisoner. The Man caught hold of him, and collared him immediately: He struggled to get away, but I got up to his Assistance in a Minute, and told the Prisoner, he must go back to the young Woman, for I did not know what he had taken from her. The Prisoner is the Man; he is altered in his Dress now, but I remember his Face particularly well.</p>
               <p>Q. to Curtis. Did not you apprehend you was robbed at that Time?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I did give him a Shilling, and desired him not to follow me. - I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Staples. He had no Pistol about him when we took him, but he had a Tinderbox made in the Shape of a Pistol, and a Gardener's Knife naked in his Pocket: and when we took him, we carry'd him to a publick House, where the young Woman swoon'd away several Times at the Sight of him. - We had much ado to bring her to herself.</p>
               <p>Curtis . I was more surprized when he was taken, than I was before.</p>
               <p>Jury. What did the young Woman say concerning the Prisoner, when she recovered out of her Fits?</p>
               <p>Staples. She told us the Prisoner came up to her, and asked her for some Money: that she put her Hand into her Pocket, and dropped a Halfpenny; and that she afterwards pulled out a Shilling, and gave it him; and that he told her, if she would not give him the Money, he must take it.</p>
               <p>Curtis. Yes, my Lord, he did say so.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you not to say so at first?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I have not been apply'd to; - I should be sorry to take a Man's Life away.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the Prisoner in Liquor at that Time? (To Staples.)</p>
               <p>Staples. No: he told us he had neither eat nor drank that Day; till we took him to the Publick-house, and there he drank Part of two Pots of Beer. When the Constable came, he asked him if he had the Money about him? He said no, he had flung it away; but when he was before the Justice he was searched, and a Shilling and a Halfpenny were found upon him, and 18 Pence which was given him at the Adam and Eve Alehouse .</p>

            . I happened to be in the Field where the Prisoner cross'd the Bank: after he had got over, he hid himself under some Brambles; I got up to him, and he said, - Pray let me go! Yes, said I, when the Man comes that followed you, and I have known what you 've done. So I held him by the Collar till Staples came up, and then we carry'd him to the Alehouse, where the young Woman was, and she told us, that was the Man, who had taken a Shilling and a Halfpenny from her, and as soon as ever she saw him, she fell into a Fit.

               <p>Prisoner. I had a Wife who lay-in, and was starving, and I begg'd this Money out of Charity. It is not consistent with Reason, that I should attempt to rob her in the open Day, and while so many People were passing and repassing .

When the Prisoner was carried before Colonel De Veil , he owned he took it out of the Passage by the Savoy, where this Man (the next Witness) had left it, and carried it into a Stable belonging to Captain Howard. It was only reared up against the Wall, in the Passage, while the Man (to whose Custody it was committed) went into the Savoy to see a Friend, and when he came back the Gun was gone. The Prisoner did not pretend to say he thought it was lost, or that he found it, but said he took it out of the Passage, and was to have sold it to a Man in the Country for 15 s. but the Man would not have it, unless he would file all the Marks out of it.</p>

             . This Firelock was committed to my Care, by the Officers of our Regiment: and wanting to speak with a Friend in the Savoy I left it in the Passage, and stepped in, for about a Quarter of an Hour. I reared it up against the Wall, when I went in, but when I came out, it was gone. I did not stay above half an Hour in all. This is the Firelock I lost; the Marks are all filed out of it, but there is one in the Ramrod still, and I can swear it is the same. After we had given out Bills, and offered a Crown reward to any one, who would help me to it again, we found it in the Prisoner's Lodgings, while he was abroad; so I had no Discourse with him about it, nor heard him say any thing concerning it, until we came before Colonel De Veil, and there he said he had found it in the Passage by the Savoy. The Justice asked him why he filed the Marks out? He told him he was to have sold it to a Man in the Country, and the Man would not buy it, unless the Marks were taken out. I reared it up in the Passage, while I went in, because no Soldier is allowed to carry Arms with him into the Savoy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When did you lose this Firelock?</p>
               <p>Champion. The 6th of March last.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was after the 11th of March when I found it: and as I was going into the Country, I enquired among the Barracks if any of the Soldiers had lost a Firelock; but I did not care to have it cried, for fear it should have been owned by somebody it did not belong to. As to the Marks, I know nothing of their being filed out. My Wife was ill, and I got a Woman to look after her; and this Woman's Husband (who is a Soldier) coming to my Room to see her, he looked at the Firelock, and went to these Men and told them where it was, and so he got the reward for discovering it. <rs id="t17400416-21-verdict125" type="verdictDescription">

So I took her up, on the Monday following, and when she was before Justice De Veil, she confessed she took 20 s. of my Money out of my Box, and told the Justice there was one Half-crown, and all the rest of the Money was in Shillings and Six-pences. The Money I lost was in such Pieces, in a Box which I put in a Cupboard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know what Questions to ask him; I know nothing about his Money.

But as to these Things, I had a young Man, - an Acquaintance of mine, that I had kept Company with, and he was going to Sea; and before he left me, he gave me 8 s. to buy me a Gown and a Pair of Shoes. When he took me up, I don't know what I said to him, for I was very much in Liquor, and he took a blue Apron, and a Shilling from me at the same Time.</p>

             . On Saturday the 15th of March last, between 6 and 8 in the Evening, we lost some Linnen off the Lines in the Yard, and the Monday following, my Wife met the Prisoner in Saville-Street, (in our Neighbourhood,) with some Things upon her, which made her suspect she was the Person who had robbed us. So we took her before Sir Edward Hill , and the Shift upon her Back, proved to be my Wife's. She delivered us some other Linnen at the Justice's but many other Things she said were at the Pawnbroker's; we enquired for them, according to her Directions, and found the Sheet, and nothing else. When she was before the Justice, I found he knew her; for he said she had been brought to him twice before.</p>

               <p>Mrs Inwood . Two Days after the Robbery I met the Prisoner in Saville-Street, and she having some of my Linnen on, I knew the Things were mine, and had her before Sir Edward Hill. He ordered her to return my Goods, and we found upon her, an Apron, two Handkerchiefs, and a lac'd Mob, and a Shift; the Apron, and the Handkerchief, I had from her at the Justice's House, and she was to pull off the other Things when she came to New-Prison, but we got no more from her, than what were restored to us before the Justice. She owned she went into the Yard and took the Linnen, but she said, she was in Liquor, and knew not what she did: - When I first saw her in the Street, she was standing at a Gentleman's Door to hear some Musick, and as I passed along, I observed she had got my lac'd Mob upon her Head; upon which I taxed her with having stole them, and knew all my other Linnen, which she then had upon her. She owned she had pawned the rest of the Things, and I would have brought the Pawnbroker here, but he is gone out of Town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not take these Things: they were brought to me by another Woman: but the People who were to have proved it are gone down into the Country. <rs id="t17400416-23-verdict135" type="verdictDescription">

            . The Prisoner and I lay together in the same Bed: she complained of a Pain in her Limbs, and kept her Bed for three Days. I can't tell the Time exactly, when this happened, but one Night, I came home and went to Bed, after I had been out all Day hard at Work; the Prisoner in the Night got upright upon her Knees in the Bed; and I asked her, what she was doing? She told me, she was making use of the Pot. In the Morning I got up to go to my Work, and because the Prisoner had been restless all Night, I innocently went to put the Clothes upon the Bed, to cover her; and under her Gown I saw a Handkerchief; and in the Handkerchief I found a Baby wrapped up. I asked her, why she did not call for Help, when I asked her what she was doing, but she made me no Answer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160016"/> at all . This was about 8 o'Clock in the Morn. ing. - I did not observe whether the Child had received any Hurt in its Body , nor can I tell whether it was at its full Growth. - I never heard it cry. Tho'I lay with her, she never informed me of her being with Child, and when I found it in the Handkerchief, she said nothing to me; - she did not own it was her's. I know no more.</p>

            . I am a Midwife and I was sent for about two Hours after the Woman was brought to Bed. I examined the Child, and found it at its full Growth, but it was dead when I saw it, and I can't take upon me to say, whether it was born alive or not. I did not observe any Hurt or Bruise upon it. This was in the Time of the hard Frost; I can't tell what Day it was exactly. After I had seen the Child, I asked, how she came to kill it? She said, she did not kill it; she found it dead, and therefore laid it away from her; and before she would have killed it, she would have gone a-begging with it. I desired her to tell me who was the Father? She said, she could not tell who it was got it, nor where he was, for one of the Men was gone twenty Miles, another thirty, and another four Miles off.</p>

While an old Woman (who was in the Shop) was serving us the Sugar-Candy, Disney took 5 linnen Handkerchiefs, and I took two Rolls of checqu'd Linnen, and I gave them to Sharpless, who stood to watch on the other side of the Way.

            . The Prisoner was with me, when we committed this Robbery. 'Twas done a little before Christmas, - about a Week before, - I believe; and 'twas in the Evening about 6 or 7 o'Clock. The Glasses were hung, one on each side this Gentleman's Shop Door: the Prisoner and I took them away, and sold them to one Mrs Barefoot, in Norman's Court , in Cable-street, near Well-Close-Square, for half a Guinea. I am positive the Prisoner was concerned with me, in this Robbery; and there was another young Man (one Irish Jack,) with us, at the same Time. Irish Jack, (who was a big Fellow,) took down one of the Glasses, and gave it me, to carry home; and while I was carrying it home, Irish Jack and the Prisoner brought the other Glass after me. I was just got in with the one Glass, when they came in with the other. I did not see them take the other Glass, but I saw them bring it home after me, and we were all concerned together. They themselves asked me to go out a-thieving with them. <rs id="t17400416-25-verdict151" type="verdictDescription">

             . I know nothing of the Prisoner, but from my living in the same House with him. I was a-bed the Night the Candles were stole, but hearing a Noise, I got up; and as I was going down Stairs, I saw the Prisoner bring in 2 Sticks of Candles. I heard him call for a Quartern of Gin, and he agreed to sell them to the Man of the House (Stambridge) for that Quartern and a Groat in Money. The Prisoner had the Gin, and Stambridge gave him a Halfpenny; and he was to come the next Day for the rest of the Money. This was about a Month ago, I believe. - I live at Stambridge's House , at the George, in Porridge-Pot-Alley , near Old-Street-Church. Stambridge fells Liquors, but I don't know whether the Prisoner ever drank there before. He came in with the Candles about 9 o'Clock at Night, - or between 8 and 9; it was pretty late in the Evening I know, - but I can't tell the Day of the Month. Mr Gold's House is in Golden-Lane not a Quarter of a Mile from Stambridge's; I should have known nothing of the Candles, had not I got up to see what was the Matter, when I heard the Noise in the Alley, and I intended to have gone out, if I had not seen the Prisoner come in with the Candles, and heard him call for a Quartern. He told Stambridge's he had got some Candles; and Stambridge's Wife asked him where he got them. He said he got them out of Mr. Gold's Cellar. I believe there might be 4 Dozen upon the 2 Sticks. Stambridge since this Fact is run away.</p>

            </rs> The Counsel for the King having opened the Indictment, and the Nature of the Evidence to support the Charge, took notice, that the Prosecution was founded upon an excellent Statute made in the 6th of his late Majesty, Ch. 23.

That the sixth Section of that Statute, in particular, deprived Felons, (convict, and sentenced for Transportation) of the Benefit of Clergy, if they should be found at large in any Part of his Majesty's Dominions of Great Britain, or Ireland, before the Expiration of the Term mentioned in their Sentence of Transportation . That the Words of that Section were, - '' Whereas some Felons ordered for Transportation, '' according to Law, have already, and others '' may, come on Shore, and return, before '' they have been actually transported to '' America; or may break Goal, or escape before their Transportation. - Be it enacted, &amp;c. That if any Felon, who shall be ordered '' to be transported, by this, or any other '' Act, be afterwards found at large, (without '' lawful Cause) before the Expiration of such '' Term, for which he hath been ordered to be '' transported, all such Person, or Persons, being '' lawfully convicted therof, shall suffer Death, '' without Benefit of Clergy.''</p>

He was convicted for stealing Mr Price's Goods, and I was here when he received Judgement of Transportation for that Matter.</p>

Last Sunday Night, about nine o'Clock, I was going for a Pint of Beer for my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160020"/> Mistres's Supper, and saw the 2 Prisoners lurking about Mr Cooke's Back-door. When I returned, I found them still lurking backwards and forwards; at last I saw Ravener go in; Webb stood with his Back against the Rails before the Door, and cry'd several Times to the other, - Go it, - go it. Presently after this, Ravener came out with something under his Arm, and I ran after him, and said, - Tou Dog, I have you! upon which he let fall the Ham between the Posts, and I took it up, and carry'd it into the House. Then Mr Cooke's Man and I pursued them, and took them at the upper End of Charles-Street, Covent-Garden. This is the Ham; I did not see any Marks upon it; but I am sure I carry'd in the same Ham, which the Prisoner dropped.</p>
               <p>Mr Cooke . This is the Ham the Witness brought in, and it is mine.</p>
               <p>Thompson . When we came up with the two Prisoners, I took hold of Webb, and Ravener attempted to run away; but the next Witness pursued him, and knock'd him down; so we carry'd them before Colonel De Veil, and they said nothing at all for themselves.</p>
               <p>Robert Hall confirmed Thompson's Evidence with regard to his bringing in the Ham again, and the taking the two Prisoners.</p>

Upon missing the Things mentioned in the Indictment, we had them cry'd in eight different Places, and offered a Guinea Reward for them. At last a Gardiner at Bethual-Green gave us some Intelgence of the Things, and we apprehended the Prisoner about a Week after the Robbery; and he acknowledged he stole them all out of the Gardens at several Times. He owned he stole the Watering-pot, the Sieve, and Birdcage, out of my Garden, and had sold them to a Birdcage-maker in Whitechaple ; and according to his Directions I found them there, with a Search-Warrant. I heard him make this Confession the Night he was taken, and also the next Morning before Justice Chandler , at Hoxton ; but he would not sign his Confession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was before a Justice before; and I told them of all the Things, and where they were, because they said they would clear me, if I would confess.</p>

This was the Carver; it struck him on the left Side of the Belly, just under the short Ribs . The Point of it took him just under the short Ribs. It made a Wound, and I saw some Blood and some Fat come through the Wound; for his Breast was opened by a Neighbour or two, who came in, after he was hurt. The deceased had given the Prisoner no Provocation at all, as I heard, - for I was but just come to my Uncle's Door.</p>
               <p>The Knife was flung at the deceased, with as much Violence, and Force as he was able to do it, -</p>

             . I have Part of the same Shop, which the Prisoner occupied. I have one side of it, and he has the other. The Prisoner had a fine Tongue, which lay on the Stall-Board, and a Gentlewoman came by, and cheapened it. The Deceased told her it was bespoke: and the Prisoner said, - it was not sold. The Deceased told him it was already sold to a Customer, and was to be sent home, but the Prisoner still insisted that it was not sold . My Head was down at the same Time, and they changed about half a dozen Word, and then I immediately saw the Knife stick in the Side of the Deceased's Belly. The Deceased took it out himself, and then fell down on the Ground, and I ran and called his Wife. The Knife was ly ing near the Prisoner, before it was thrown at the Deceased, but my Head being down at that Time, I did not see the Prisoner throw it. I happened just at that instant to be stooping down for something, and when I lifted up my Head, I saw the Carver sticking in Warner's Belly. The Prisoner and the Deceased were about three Yards asunder, and the Knife was but just come home from the Grinder's, and lay near the Prisoner.</p>

I can't tell whether any Words had passed between them, for I had but just turn'd my Head that Way, when I saw the Carver fly. I heard no Words pass then, before it was flung, The Prisoner flung it at the Deceased with great Force, and I believe it did grate upon the Stall-Board before it struck the Deceased. The Prisoner was about 2 Yards from the Deceased , when the Carver was flung, and it stuck in his Belly, as he was standing at the Corner of the Door.</p>

             . The Day this happened, I was at the Feathers Alehouse , and the Deceased came in, and asked for six Penn'orth of Halfpence for his Mistress (Mrs Clements ). He told me, he had just done his Work, and would come and spend three Halfpence, and smoak a Pipe with me. Upon this he went out of the Alehouse with the Half-pence, and presently John Loop came in, and said - Warner was murder'd. Upon hearing this, I ran out, and found the Deceased stooping on Mrs Whitcomb's Stall-Board. I asked him, what was the Matter! He cry'd, - O Lord! Lord! I am murder'd ! Who has murder'd you, said I! He answered, - Tom Clements . This was not above two Minutes after he went out of the House, with the Halfpence.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did your hear of any Quarrel having been between them?</p>
               <p>Dimmock . No; I heard of none. I have known them both for a considerable Time, and they and I have drank several Times together. The Deceased drank with me the Minute before he went out of Doors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Was there not a Friendship between us?</p>
               <p>Dimmock. As for their Friendship, I know nothing of that. I never saw any Quarrels between them; especially if the Prisoner was sober; when he was drunk, he would be jarring with him. The Deceased was a meek Man at all Times, as far as I have seen; but the Prisoner used to jarr with him, when he was in Liquor. - Mrs Whitcomb's Shop, and the Prisoner's, are both in one: She has one Side, and he has the other. When I saw the Deceased, (after he was wounded) he was leaning on Mrs Whitcomb's Stall-Board, near the Door, and the Prisoner was fitting on the other Side of the Shop, about two Yards off from the Door.</p>

            , a Barber, was at her own Door, cross the Lane, and heard the Words. I was at my own Door, and the Prisoner stood at the Post over against me. The Fact was done in our House, where we all live together. The Prisoner lives up two Pair of Stairs, and I live up one Pair.</p>

               <p>Mr Biggs, Surgeon. About eight Weeks ago, - I believe it was this Day eight Weeks, - I was coming to my Door, and saw about two or three hundred People in the Yard. I thought there might have been some Quarrel, and so I would have passed by, but some People in the Croud knew me, and would not let me. When I came in, I saw the Deceased sitting in a Chair, and my Man was stitching up the Wound in his Belly. The Teguments of the Belly were pierced through, and the Caul appeared. I saw my Man had stitched up the Wound properly, and as the Deceased was a poor Man, I advised them to carry him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where there would be more Care taken of him, than any poor Man can have, in his own Habitation; and it happened to be my Week to attend there. Accordingly he was carried thither; and three Days afterwards, I found the Parts inflamed; the Man was in Pain, and restless, and I was afraid of him. I then observed a great Quantity of Matter, which had pressed out between the Muscles, and the Skin, and that it was likely to be licked up in the Blood; I therefore opened it about three Inches, and after this, the Wound healed kindly, and the Deceased made no Complaints. Where the Deceased was wounded, there was nothing farther to hurt but the Guts, and in this Case there was no Part wounded which was mortal: For if the Guts had been wounded, I should have found it out, by Cholick and Reachings. I did think at first, that some Gut might be prick'd, and that a Mortification might ensue; but afterwards I found, that for three or four Days he went to stool regularly, and complained of no Cholick, or Inclination to reach, and I was not afraid of his doing well; for the Wound healed up, to the Compass of a silver Penny. The Wound that I had made, was not through the whole Integuments , but only between the Skin and the Muscles; and after about a Fortnight, I apprehended the Man was out of Danger; and I was teized to make an Affidavit to that Purpose, that the Prisoner might be bailed: But I deferred it for three Weeks; and after about five Weeks I was under no Apprehension, that he would not do well; for there was no Matter came from the Wound to wet the Lint; and it was dressed lately with dry Lint. Then I made an Affidavit before Colonel De Veil, (about three Weeks ago) that I apprehended he was in no Danger from his Wound. But about four Days afterwards, I observed him to sink and waste; tho' he made no Complaints, and there was no Fever. When I asked him how he rested, he only complained of the Noise of the Persons in the Ward. When I first saw him, he appeared to me to have a bad Habit; and when I went to the Market, I enquired, and found that both he and the Prisoner had been given to drinking; and when a Person has been addicted to drinking, Things not fatal may turn so. Our Mens Wards are close, and confined, and we have been (during the severe Season) fuller of Patients than is convenient; and I apprehended, that as Butchers live in the open Air, the Cause of his Alteration might be attributed to the close penning him up. At last the Wound grew slabby, as Wounds do when the native Heat is gone; but it is a nice Point to determine whether the Wound was the Occasion of his Death. I take it not to have been the immediate Cause; but consequentially, by confining him to his Bed, and by keeping him in one Posture.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your Opinion that he would have been dead by this Time, if he had not received this Wound?</p>
               <p>Mr Biggs. I can't say that. I was apprehensive, that as we were forced to expose the Body of the Deceased, he might get cold; and I observed him to be low-spirited; but they did not give that Notice to the Coroner, which they should have done, so it was impossible to make the Discoveries we otherwise should have done. I do believe the Wound contributed to his Death; and I have seen Trifles of Wounds contribute to a Man's Death: I have known a Pin in a Man's Coat, to prick his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160025"/> knee, and the Consequence has been fatal to him. - In this Case, here was no neglect in the Hospital; there's more Care taken there, than any private Person can have taken of him elsewhere. To give the Deceased his due, he was as regular as any Man could be; and consequentially the Wound was the Occassion of his Death. I saw him in a Quarter of an Hour after the Wound was given; we don't take a Wound in the common Integuments of the Belly to be mortal, nor if the Caul be wounded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. As I understand you, you say the Wound originally given was not the Cause of his Death; and did not you say, the Deceased was so far cur'd of the original Wound, that there was not above the Breadth of a Silver Penny that penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly?</p>
               <p>Mr Biggs. Yes; - the Man seemed to me, to be of a sallow Complexion, and an ugly Constitution; and I heard he had been a very hard Drinker. He was in our Hospital, from the first Day, to the Day of his Death: for in all accidental Cases, Patients are taken in, at any Hour of the Day. - As to the Decay of Strength in the Deceased, it might be occasioned by some Matter, which might be licked up with the Blood in it's Circulation; and the Wound, in Consequence, might be the Occasion of his Death. I saw a Man the other Day, who had a Cut upon his Cheek, and a hallow Wound was made; the Matter was lick'd up by the Blood, in it's Circulation, and was thrown upon the Lungs, and he pin'd away, and fell into a slow Fever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Then a Cut upon a Man's Finger, may be consequentially the Occasion of his Death; how deep was this Wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Biggs. It penetrated the Cavity of the Belly, and then whether it went 3 or 4 Inches, it was no Matter, provided it did not wound the Guts. When we cut, to reduce the Guts in Ruptures, we cut thro' all the Cavities; and if we take off Part of the Caul, we tye it up, and People do well. Had any principal Part, in the Deceased, been wounded, the Symptoms would have appeared at first: but he went on well, for 5 Weeks. The Wound was not throughly cur'd, but it was cur'd to the Bigness of a Silver Penny: and such a Wound if given to 20 Persons, of an healthy Constitution, 19 of them might be cur'd, unless there were any concurrent Causes to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Had you ever any Conversation with the Deceased about this Accident?</p>
               <p>Mr. Biggs. We only ask Questions of our Patients, which may relate to their Cure; - we never ask them any other Questions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The Deceased for several Years has cut up my Meat, and we commonly drank together, 3 or 4 Times o'Day. I never had any Malice against the Man, but supported him all that lay in my Power.</p>

            . I knew both the Prisoner and the Deceased; I have known them both many Years; ever since I was a Child in the Market, I never heard of any Quarrels between them, but I was little acquainted with them otherwise. On the Twenty-second of February, when this Accident happened, as near as I can guess 'twas that Day, Warner (the Deceased) came to my Shop, and asked me what Beef I would have cut? Billy, says I, I can't tell; and so he fell a talking to me about my little Boy. I said, Billy, you seem to have drank more than you have bled to Day. So I have, said he, for my Master Clements and I have had 2 or 3 Drams together; but I will go and see what Beef he will have cut to Day, and then I will go home to Bed: and immediately after this, I heard of the Accident. When the Prisoner is sober, he is a very sober Man, but when he's drunk, he is like a Mad-Man.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's Q. What do you mean, by being like a Mad-Man?</p>
               <p>Stonebank . That is, he hardly knows what he does. I never knew him but doing all the Good he could; and he would treat every Body he come near, not knowing what he does, but as good natur'd a Soul, as any Body could come near.</p>

On the 22d of February, (when this happened) the Prisoner and the Deceased had been at Dinner together at the Feather's Alehouse , and there appeared to be no Difference between them. The Prisoner was much in Liquor, and eat no Dinner at all. The Deceased cut a Piece of Mutton, and put it on a Piece of Bread, and went directly to the Prisoner's Shop to eat it. No Words passed betwe en them; and this was not an Hour before he was killed. The Prisoner is as peaceable as can be, when he's sober, but when he's in Liquor, - I can't say any thing so it.</p>

The Day it happened, the Prisoner, the Deceased, and his Wife, dined together at the Feathers Alehouse, in Clare-Market, and they had three or four Pots of Beer together at Dinner, and I saw no Quarrel between them. The Deceased went from the Alehouse to the Prisoner's Shop, once or twice, and came in again, and drank; and after they had been at the Alehouse about an Hour, or three Quarters of an Hour, they paid the Reckoning, and went out together. I never heard them quarrel; I took them to be Friends. When Clements is sober, he is a civil Man; but when he is drunk, he is crazy: but I never knew him do any thing like this in my Life.</p>

It was after 4 o'Clock, or between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon; and we were got about 3 or 4 Hundred Yards on the Heath, when Moore rode up to the Coach, and ordered the Coachman to stop; and pulling a Pistol out of his Breast, he demanded my Master's Money. Another Man at the same Time rode up to my right Shoulder, and said, let's see what you have got. I asked him, what he wanted? He clapped a Pistol to my Breast, and punched me with it on the Breast, then he clapped it to my Throat, and said, - D - mn you, your Money and Watch, or I'll shoot you dead. Then he drew his Hanger, and gave me a Thrust with it on my Wrist; the Mark is here now: and after this, he pulled out a crooked Gardener's Knife, and cut my Horse's Bridle, and took from me 7 Shillings in Silver, a copper Piece, and one old Shilling, - I think it was a Peice of Queen Elizabeth's Coin. Moore, and the Man who robb'd me, were both on Horseback; and he who robb'd me was not disguised, - he had nothing upon his Face, but I can't swear positively that the Prisoner is the Man, for I was in such a surprize, that I did not mind his Face, so much as I ought to have done: but I can swear to the Copper-Piece, which the Constable found upon the Prisoner, and took from him. Moore robbed my Master at the same Time, and did not molest me at all. He was about half the Length of the Court distant from the Man who attacked me, and I had some Knowledge of him, for I had seen him before.</p>

I told him my Hat would do him no Service, and desired him not to take it: upon which, Moore ordered him to return me my Hat.</p>

            . On the 7th of March last, as my Master was coming from Colebrook to London, we met 2 Men on Horse, - back in the Road, a little before we got on Hounslow Heath : and I observed them to look wishfully at the Coach, as they rode by it. They rode about an Hundred Yards, and farther on, in the Road, and I turn'd back several Times to watch their Motions, and seeing them stop their Horses and turn about, I said to Austin, I fancy they are Highwaymen. They walk'd their Horses 'till they came upon the Heath; then they both gallop'd up to us, and one Man rode up to the Coach, and the other stopp'd Austin; I can't swear to the Prisoner, because his Back was towards me; but I saw the Man punch him first with the Pistol, and then he drew his Hanger and punch'd him with that, and I saw Austin put his Hand in his Pocket, and give him something. I did not see his Bridle cut, 'till he came up to the Coach, and then he was forced to borrow another. I cannot swear to the Prisoner's Face.</p>

            . I am a Constable: I know the Prisoner full well. I saw him and his Partner differ, - I can't say his Partner, - but I saw two Men quarrel, and the Prisoner was one of 'em The Prisoner was on Horseback, the other Man was on Foot, with his Horse's Bridle on his Arm. This was on Friday the 7th of March, in a Lane between Harlington-Town, and my Lord Bolinbroke's. The other Man said something to the Prisoner, - what it was I can't tell; but the Prisoner wrapp'd out a great Oath, and d - mn'd his Soul, and said he would go no farther with him, as he had used him so ill; and accordingly he clapp'd Spurs to his Horse, and rode on: and the other Man cry'd after him, - Go thy Ways Jack. The Prisoner, when he had left his Companion, rode off towards Harlington, and the other went towards Dawley. When the Prisoner came up to us, he asked to what Place that Road lead? I told him to Uxbridge. He said, he wanted a good Inn, for he had met with a Man who had robbed and abused him. I said, I believed it was no such Thing. and that I imagined the Man who was with him, and he, were Consederates; for I had heard the Words he spoke, and heard likewise a Pistol go off between them. Upon this the Prisoner pulled off his Wig, and shewed us his Head, which was broke, and said, - See how I have been beat and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160028"/> abused. The Blood ran down his Cheek, and he said he would follow the Man who had done him the Mischief. I told him, if he had been so served, it would be better for him not to go that Way, left he should meet with the Man again; and then, says I, perhaps he'll kill you. I bid him go to the Woolpack, near Dawley-Lodge, telling him, he there might have Entertainment for himself and his Horse. He went thither, (and told a most deplorable Story, as I afterwards heard;) and I went about my Business, after I had directed him to the House. But about one o'Clock, in the Morning Night of the same Day, that is, in the Morning of the eighth of March, I was sent for to take charge of the Prisoner; and accordingly I took him out of Bed at the Woolpack, about two o'Clock, and searched him. He had a Pistol, and a Hanger; these Slugs *, and some Money I took from him; among which I found that particular Piece, which Austin swears to. These Slugs he shot at another Man, that same Afternoon, and they dropp'd into his Sleeve. This is the Pistol, and this the Piece of Money of Austin's, and I have had the Custody of them ever since.</p>
               <p>* All the Slugs found on the Prisoner appeared to have been such Leads as Printers make use of in their Business.</p>
               <p>Austin. This Piece of Money is mine; it was taken from me when I was robbed of my Money, on the seventh of March.</p>
               <p>Hobbs. I took it out of the Prisoner's Pocket.</p>
               <p>Austin. After the Robbery was committed, Moore, and the Man who robbed me, rode off together. I saw no Quarrel between them then. They were upon sorrel Horses, and one of them had a Blaze down his Face.</p>
               <p>Hobbs. And when I directed the Prisoner to the Woolpack, he was on a bay Mare, with a Blaze down her Face.</p>
               <p>Austin. The Man who robbed me rode on a sorrel Horse, or a bright Bay; I can't speak to any other Marks, nor can I tell whether it was a Mare or Gelding: and one of the Horses had a Blaze down his Face, but I can't tell which; for I was very much surprized, and was afraid of being shot, or run through.</p>
               <p>Hobbs. This is the Hanger I took from the Prisoner. I took likewise an old Piece of Queen Elizabeth's Money from him, but that I have lost; and a Piece of sealing Wax, which I have not brought.</p>
               <p>Austin. Among the Money taken from me, was a Shilling above an hundred Years old, a very thin Piece; and a Piece of sealing Wax, and a Key, the Property of my Master, was took from me at the same Time.</p>
               <p>Hobbs. These three Keys I found upon the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Austin. The Key I lost is not among these. The Hanger with which I was wounded, was a strait one, with a sharp Point like this, but I can't swear to it; I did not see the Handle.</p>
               <p>Hobbs. This Hanger was bloody to the Point, when I saw it. Here is the Prisoner's Powder-horn, which I took from him. He threatened me, and two other Persons, who went with me to see him in Prison, that let him live or die, we and our Houses should all be rewarded. They heard him speak those Words, as well as I.</p>

On the seventh of March, between five and six o'Clock in the Afternoon, I was going along the Road-side about my Business, and the Prisoner and another Man came down Colebrook-Road, on the farther Side of Hounslow-Heath . Just as they came over against me, one of them made a Stop; I turned my self round, and before I had Time to speak, the Prisoner shot 3 Slugs into my Arm. Then he rode away, and his Hat flying off, he order'd me to take it up and give it to him: I did not do it; but a Woman, coming by, took it up and gave it him. I thought he was a Highwayman, but he did not rob me, and I gave him no Offence, so I don't know what he shot me for. I did not know the Prisoner before, but I am sure he was the Man that shot me. These are the 3 Slugs, and this is the Coat I had then on. These are the Holes the Slugs made in my Coat-sleeve: They went thro' my Coat, and wounded me, but did not lodge in my Flesh: I took them out of my Coat-sleeve.</p>

            . I keep the Woolpack, at Dawley Lodge, about a Mile, or a Mile and a Quarter from Hounslow Heath. The Prisoner came to my House the 7th of March about 6 in the Evening; he was very bloody, and said he had been robb'd of 5 l. and his Watch. His Head was broke in 2 Places, and the Blood ran down his Face, and upon his Coat. I never saw him before that Time, but I am sure he is the Man. After he had told me he had been robb'd, he described a Man, and asked me if I had not seen such a Highwayman go by? Mr Harvest was present, and told him, he had seen such a Man pass by, and he would go after him, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160029"/> endeavour to take him, as soon as he had put up his Horse into the Stable. But I let Mr Harvest know I did not like the Prisoner, and that I fear'd he had been robbing others himself, instead of having been robb'd: So instead of following the other Man, he dress'd the Prisoner's Head, and rubbed it with something I gave him. After this the Prisoner drank a Pint or two of Wine, and then pulled out this Hanger, and this Pistol: these are the same; I took particular Notice of the Pistol: the Stock and the Rammer are broken. I took them both, and laid them aside; but when he went to Bed, he insisted on having the Hanger to lay by him, so I fetch'd it, and laid it down by his Bedside: then I locked the Door, and kept the Key on the outside. Mr Harvest and Mr Timms being present, they were very uneasy about him; they said he was a Smuggler, (for he had offered to sell us Brandy and Rum,) and having told us, before he went to Bed, that he had borrowed a great Coat of one

This confirming us in our Suspicion, we sent for a Constable about 12 o'Clock at Night, and secured him. It was one

            . On the seventh of March last , I was at the Woolpack at Dawley-Lodge; the Prisoner came in almost fuddled, and his Horse was almost knocked up, he said, he had been wounded by a Highwayman, and had been robbed of 5 l. and a Watch. When his Horse was got into the Stable, I washed his Head; it was bloody in two Places, and he told me, he had been fighting with a Man, who had drawn his Hanger, and had cut him; I thought this was not true, because the Wounds in his Head did not appear to be Cuts, but rather to have been made by Blows with a Stick, and I imagined he had been robbing somebody himself: but wanting to draw something more out of him. I said to Hollison, - if you'll call for a Pint of Wine, I'll go and see if I can find the Highwayman. The Prisoner then said, - the Man who had robbed him had got two Pistols, and he knocked one of them out of his Hand, and if he (himself) had not been drunk, he should have killed him. I asked him, where he lived? He told me, he lived at one Wagstaff's , at the White Lion , at the Bank side , and he would make me amends for my Care of him; and that he was a great Dealer in Brandies and Rum: and pray, says he, whose Mills are they upon the Heath? I told him, they belonged to Mr Underhill . O, says he, I have a Bill for 50 l. upon him in my Pocket; pulling out some Papers at the same Time. I thought it was strange he should not know the Name of the Owner of the Mills, and yet have a Bill for 50 l. upon him in his Pocket: so I asked him, who he knew thereabouts? He mentioned

               <p>Mr Timms. I was not present when the Money and these Things were taken from the Prisoner; but I saw him that Evening in a narrow Lane, and his Head was in a very bloody Condition. He asked me, where there was a Publick-House, or an Inn, that he might be taken Care of; for he had been abused, he said, by a Man on a sorrel Horse, and a light coloured Coat. There was a Man had passed by, some Time before, on a sorrel Horse, but that Man had a dark colour'd Coat on, so I thought he could not be the Person. The Prisoner went to the Woolpack; I put his Horse into the Stable, and Mr Harvest talked with him. At last we found him in several different Stories, and imagined he had been robbing somebody himself; so after we had sent a Man to Reynolds, to enquire if he knew the Prisoner, a Constable was got, and he was taken into Custody: but I was not present at that Time.</p>

During the Time I have known the Prisoner, I never heard any Harm<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160030"/> of him . His Father lives at Reading, in Berkshire, and keeps a sort of a Publick-House, and a Farm besides, and bears a good Character in general.

I was a House-keeper in Aldermanbury ; but Business not answering, I left it off and worked Journey-work again.

Then he presented his Pistol into the Coach, and bid my Master deliver his Money. I am sure the Prisoner is the Man; I remembered his Face as soon as ever I saw him in New-Prison. There were my Master and his Lady, and two Maid-Servants in the Coach; and he swore he would shoot them, if they did not deliver their Money: Upon which I saw my Master hold out his Hand, and give him something, which the Prisoner put into his own Pocket. The first Money that was given him, he put into his Right-hand Pocket, and the next into his Left; but I could not see what Money it was, and when he had got what he could, he bid the Coachman drive on. There was another Man in Company with him, but he did not come up to the Coach; he stopped Austin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . I am in such Misery I cannot discourse. He said I was the Man (in New-Prison) before he well saw my Face; and the Reason my Arm was so cut was, because my Name was Moore, and therefore they apprehended I was the Man.</p>
               <p>Way. When he robbed the Coach he had a brown dark-coloured Coat on, a Wig over his Hair, and his Hair was pulled down on each Side of his Face. He presented a short Pistol into the Coach, but I can't swear this is the Pistol, nor to what Money was given him, but I am sure he is the Man.</p>

I took the Prisoner on Sunday the ninth of March: I first went to his House,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160031"/>(the Sign of the Jolly Sailor at Ratcliffe) with a young Man; but the Prisoner not being up, we waited till he came down, and then I bid the young Man go out to call the rest of our Assistants. While he was gone, I desired the Prisoner to drink with me, but he immediately went out, and we lost him. Upon this we went out to take a Turn, and returned again to the Prisoner's House, which we searched, and found a Hanger, some Powder, and two or three Wigs. We had not been a Quarter of an Hour in the House (this last Time) before a Man came in, and asked if Mr Moore was at home? I took him on one Side, and asked him if he knew Moore? He said, yes. I told him I had a Warrant against him, and that he was a Highwayman, and if he would tell us where he was, it might be of Service both to him and the Publick. He told us he was then at a Publick-house, the Waterman's-Arms; and hearing this I ran away thither, and forgot my Hanger; but the young Man who was with me, happened to have taken the Hanger with him, which we found in the House. We found the Prisoner at the Waterman's-Arms, with a Pint of Beer before him, and I immediately laid my Hands on his Shoulder, and said, I take you up for the Highway. He clapp'd his Hand in his Pocket, and I judged what he was going to do, so I called out to the young Man who was with me, - Cut away! He did so, and we got the Prisoner out of the Box, where he sat, and cut him, and laid him upon his Back. Then he said, he would surrender; and I took out of his Hand this Pistol ready cock'd, and loaded with five Slugs; and one of the Slugs was of the same Sort with those taken from Hide. (See the preceeding Trial.) This Pistol I took out of his Hand, and this I found in his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They chopp'd my Hand off, before I saw them.</p>
               <p>Harris. We had Information that he had a Brace of Pistols about him: but we took him, and carried him back to his own House, and sent for a Surgeon, to sow up his Arm. We were forced to use Violence to him, because he was so desperate; and upon searching him again at his own House, we found a Knife 15 Inches long upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took my wearing Cloaths out of the House, and all my Money from me.</p>
               <p>Harris. I took 39 s. and 6 d. from him; but I was wounded in the Contest, and have lost the Use of my Thumb. I could not work for a Fortnight, and have expended the Money, in paying my own Surgeon. My Thumb was almost cut off. - I have not the Money at present; I am a poor Man, and have not the Money at present. - I can't give him any of his Money now, for I have not a Farthing about me; and I have been out of Business a long Time.</p>
               <p>The Court reprimanded Harris for seizing and detaining the Prisoner's Money, and ordered him to restore it. <rs id="t17400416-36-verdict216" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Edward Wren. Last Saturday was 3 Weeks I lost all the things mentioned in the Indictment, (be named them all) from off the Horse in my Yard, and never met with them again. The Prisoner was seen in our Entry, after the things were gone, and was knock'd down by a Watchman as he was running away.

When the Prisoner was taken, he desired me to advertise the Goods, and told me if I would be at one Day's expence, he would be at another.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Swift. On the 22d of March, I wash'd some Linnen for Mr Wren, and hung the things up on the Horse in the Yard, near our Kitchen-door. At 11 in the Evening, I heard the Footsteps of somebody in the Entry, and taking up a Candle, I saw the Linnen was gone. I heard some Person treading down the Entry, but the Wind took my Candle, and I never saw the Prisoner, 'till he was knocked down by the Watchman.</p>

            . I serve Mr Wren as a Journeyman, and happened to be there on Saturday Night the 22d of March. About 11 o'Clock my Master and I were sitting by the Fireside, and as my Wife was washing the Dishes, she said she heard somebody trip along in the Yard; she ran and found the Cloaths gone; and I took a Candle and a Stick, and ran across the Yard into the Entry, where I found the Prisoner, and by the Light of my Candle, he found his Way into the Street. There is a Hatch at the End of the Entry without either Lock or Latch, which opens with pushing, or pulling, and shuts to of it self. The Prisoner pull'd open this Hatch, and shut it to, after him, which stopped me a little; but I saw him running, and cried stop Thief, - and the Prisoner cried stop Thief too, by which means he passed by a little Watchman, because he did not know who to knock down. But when the Watchman saw me, then he and I pursued the Prisoner into Bedford-street, Covent Garden, where another taller Watchman knocked him down, when I was not above 10 or 15 Yards from him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160032"/>I kept my Eye upon the Prisoner, from the Time he ran out of the Entry 'till he was knocked down by the tall Watchman: and I am sure the Man who was knocked down, was the same Man, who ran out of our Passage. I am positive the Prisoner is the Man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Cloaths had I on when I was knocked down?</p>
               <p>Swift. Not that Coat which he has on now. It was a caped Coat, but not so light as that which he has now on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Coat I had then on is now in Newgate I'll send for it - No; I won't give the Court so much Trouble. But pray did you see any thing in my Hands, when you pursued me?</p>
               <p>Swift. No nothing at all.</p>

            . I am a Watchman, and was at my stand, on Saturday, the 22d of March, a little after 11, and had just hung up my Lanthorn, when a great outcry was made, - stop Thief! So I took down my Lanthorn and ran into the Middle of the Street, where I stood to see who ran by. The Prisoner came running down the Street at a great Rate, and got past me, but I turned short about, and knocked him down. Swift came up to me directly upon the Prisoner's falling, and said he was the Man, and he had never been out of his sight. On Sunday he was carried before Colonel De Veil, and in the Colonel's Entry, in my hearing, the Prisoner offered to make Mr. Wren full satisfaction for the Goods. He made the same offer, before the Colonel; and the Prosecutor I believe would have made it up, if the Colonel would have suffered him to have so done.</p>
               <p>Wren The Prisoner asked me, what the Value of my Goods was? and I told him, I believed they were worth about a Guinea. He told me if I would not prosecute him, he would pay the Guinea with all his Heart: and because he had no Money, he offered to leave his Cloaths with me. When I was before Colonel De Veil, I would have made an End of it, if I could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, to Bellace. Had I any Goods upon me, when I was taken?</p>
               <p>Bellace. The Constable neglected to search him, 'till after he was put into the Hole, and then we found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Cloaths had I then on?</p>
               <p>Bellace. Not the Cloaths he has on now. He had then on him a large cap'd Coat, of a grey or drab Colour.</p>

The Prisoner was in the Mob, and cry'd, Stop Thief too; and I pursued, but did not know who was the right Thief; but my Brother-Watchman knocked him down because he would not stop; and Swift was running after him, the same Time, and said the Prisoner was the Man who had stole the Linnen.

            . I happened to be at one Mr Turner's, at the Mogul's Head, a Constable in Drury Lane, the 22d of March, and knowing the Prisoner to be an honest, just Man, I sent for him to go home with me, about half an Hour after 10 at Night. I live hard by Charing-Cross, and he saw me home thro' Bedford-Court, - quite to my own House. We did not pass thro' New-Street, where the Prosecutor lives. The Prisoner lives at one Mr Lyon's, I don't know where, - somewhere in Drury Lane, and he took his Leave of me, (to go home) about half an Hour after 10, or near 11 o'Clock. I have known him these six Years and better: he lived about a Year ago in the next Room to mine. I take in Washing, and have entrusted him in my Room, when I have had thirty or forty Pounds-worth of Linnen there, and he always behaved honestly. His Business is to carry a Chair, and during the Time of the Frost, he was ready to go on Errands, and has fetched me Water for my Work. I have seen him plying, and carrying a Chair about Charing-Cross; I saw him plying there last February, and the beginning of March.</p>

Which being ordered by the Court, the present Defendant, (Mr. Barton) appeared personally, and produced this Bond, (which the Indictment charges to be forged and counterfeit) instead of the true Bond, which the Prosecutors in this Cause, acknowledge had been given to Mr. Barton, and on the Back of which, (they say) there was an Indorsement of 20 £. which the two Collins's had paid off, and for which Mr. Barton had given a Receipt. That this Bond, without any such Indorsement on the Back, is what they now complained of, and tho' it is witnessed by Honour Luss, who was a subscribing Witness to the true Bond, and by the Son of Mr. Barton; yet, she says, she never subscribed as a Witness to any Bond, in which Mr. Barton the younger was a joint Witness with her, &amp;c.</p>

            , farther said, - you know I have paid 20 £. off that Bond, and have your Receipt for it; but Mr Barton said, he did not remember it; if he had, he did not know what to say to it; but if he had, it must be so. I know nothing about the Mark of Nicholas Collins. This Conversation passed between Collins and Mr Barton, at Mr Barton's Office in the Hop-Garden and there was no one but us three present. Mr Barton complained to Collins, that he owed him a great deal of Money, and that occasioned Collins to tell him of the Bond he had given him. I was at Mr Barton's Office once before this Time, and when I came away, he read a Paper to me, and told me, if I would get George Collins to sign it, he would make me a handsome Present for a Pair of Gloves. George Collins was not Present when Mr Barton said this to me, nor do I remember what were the Contents of the Paper.</p>
               <p>Couns. Let us know how this Conversation began?</p>
               <p>John Collins, jun. Mr Barton seemed in a stern Humour with Collins, and told him, he owed him a great deal of Money; and that he could not keep the Injunction on Foot; and if he did not, there would come out an Execution against him, and his Stock would be taken; and how, (says Mr Barton) shall I raise Money? Why, (says Collins) if you had paid Mrs Bailey's 200 £. off, as you have had the Money, that would have put a Stop to this Affair. Mr Barton told him, he owed him a great deal of Money himself. Sir, (says Collins) what would you have me do? You have got my All, - I have assigned every Thing to you. I have given you a Bond of 83 £. witnessed by two Persons; and an 80 £. Bond to make up the Money to pay Mrs Bailey off. Mr. Barton upon this agreed, that Collins had given him an 80 £. Bond to make up the Money which was to pay Mrs Bailey, and I think he told him, he had been Security to Mrs Bailey, for the Money he (Collins) owed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Was not that 80 £. Bond, to indemnify Mr Barton on account of that Security?</p>
               <p>Collins. I don't know that. - But Mr Barton was Security for George Collins, to get him out of Goal, I believe. I remember this Conversation passed in December, 1735. I made some Entries in my Day-Book, the beginning of December, concerning some Business I had done for the Collins's at the same Time. I am a Taylor, and live with my Father John Collins. The Entries I made in my Book, were Accounts of some Travels I had made for them in their Trouble, and the Charges I had been at.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was there any mention made of any other 83 £. Bond, beside that signed by Sister Luff, and Nicholas Luff?</p>
               <p>Collins. No.</p>
               <p>[The Counsel shew'd John Collins junior several Papers signed with the Name of George Collins: all which he believed were George's Handwriting, except one, which he believed was not.]</p>
               <p>Honoria Luff. I know both Mr Barton and the two Collins's, George and Nicholas: I remember their giving Mr Barton a Bond for 83 l.; I was one of the Witnesses to it, and Nicholas Luff was the other. and I never was a Witness to any other, but one: and in that one

             was a Witness with me. But I never witnessed a Bond for 83 l. in my Life, with Mr Barton the younger. When George and Nicholas Collins gave Mr Barton the 83 l. Bond, I made my Mark, as a Witness, and Nicholas Luff wrote his Name, to it: but I am very sure the Mark upon this Bond, is not mine, because here is not the other right Witness's Name, but young Mr Barton's: and therefore I apprehend 'tis not my Mark. If it had been mine, Nicholas Luff would have been the other Witness. That Bond which I was a Witness to, was dated the 9th of June 1729.</p>
               <p>Couns. Where was the Bond executed, which you set your Mark to.</p>
               <p>Honoria Luff. In George Collins's Brick-Kitchen; George and Nicholas Collins were present, and Mr Barton the Elder, my self, Nicholas Luff, and Ann Luff, my Mother. - I can't say how many Bonds (given by the Collins's) I have been a Witness to, but I am sure I never witnessed any Bond, when young Mr Barton was even in the same Room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Did you never say you could write, at the Time this Mark is supposed to have been made?</p>
               <p>Honoria Luff. No, I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Couns. Look on that Bill of Costs, in Consideration of which the 83 l. Bond was given.</p>
               <p>Honoria Luff. This Paper Mr Barton delivered to George Collins, at his House, the same Day the Bond was executed. I can't swear I saw Mr Barton write it, but I saw him write the Receipt. I do think I saw him write his Name to it, but I can't be positive to that. I have seen Mr Barton the younger write, tho' not very often, and I believe this Name of Edward Barton the younger was wrote by Mr Barton the elder. I can write my self now, and can read Writing, but I don't pretend to know Handwriting. The Bond (in Dispute) was read. It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160035"/>was for 83 l. signed Geo. Collins: and marked, Nicholas Collins. Attested by Honoria Luff, and Edward Barton, junior. The Bill of Costs amounting to 84 l. 16 s. 6 d. was read, at the Foot of which was the following Receipt. June the 9th 1729. Received then the Sum of 83 Pounds by Bond, for a security for the said Sum; which when paid will be in full of all Demands.

               <p>George Collins was called, but the Defendant's Counsel objecting that he was concerned in Point of Interest, the Counsel for the Prosecution called Mr Warren to prove that the Bond had been paid and that General Releases had been executed on both sides. He deposed that the Release produced in Court, he saw executed by Mr Barton the elder, as his Act and Deed; and that there had been one given by George Collins about a Month before, but none by Nicholas Collins. (The produced Release, was signed Edward Barton, senior; and dated, 11th of Feb. 1737.) And he farther deposed that the Release was given after the Matter had been before the Prothonotary. - He added that the 20 l. mentioned in the opening the Evidence, was never mentioned, or thought (in the former Proceedings) to be in discharge of any Part of the 83 l. Bond: But that Collins having had a suit with the Widow Oakingham; the 83 l. Bond was in Discharge of other Law Charges generally, and was not in Part of this Affair of Oakingham's. He was asked by the Prisoner's Counsel, if there was not a Demand made on Account of this Bond? He answered, that when the Bonds were before Mr Prothomotary Cook, Collins complited that they were given when the Money was not all due; upon which Mr Cook ordered a General Bill of Costs should be laid by Mr Barton before him, and that no Regard should be paid to the Bonds, therefore he could not say the Bonds were considered at all. Some farther Objections being made to George Collins's being called, the same were allowed, and he was not sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr Protary Cook gave an Account, that the Affair was before him about two Years ago, and that he intended to have stated what was due from Collins to Mr Barton, both on the Bonds, and on the Taxation of his Bills, and to have added the In-next due upon the Bonds, to the Account; and that when this Bond [which Mr Cook had mark'd] was before him, there was some Objection made, on Account of Mr Barton's having sworn that Honoria Luff had signed her Name thereto, when she had only made her Mark to it: but he did not remember that any other Objection was made to it at that Time.</p>
               <p>Mr Warren likewise deposed, that there was no Objection made to the Bond at that Time.</p>
               <p>Mr Cook farther deposed that the Bond was produced at his Office (which he deemed to be in London ) as a Demand for so much Money, by one Drury, for Mr Barton.</p>
               <p>Nicholas Luff, deposed that he set his Hand as a Witness, to a Bond for 83 l. on the 9th of June 1729; that Honour Luff was a Witness with him at the same Time; and that young Mr Barton was not a Witness to it, nor was he then in the House.

I have not seen Mr Barton the younger write, so as to be positive whether his Name is of his own Hand-writing: 'tis a great deal more like Mr Barton the elder's, than his Son's. I am unwilling to answer, because I can't speak positively, nor with certainty. It has the Likeness in all Respects to Mr Barton's the elder, and is not like the younger's. He is 22 or 23 Years of Age. - To be sure I am mistaken he must be more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. What is the Character of Nicholas Collins?</p>
               <p>Mr Read. He is looked upon to be a Man of an exceeding good Character. As to John Collins, senior and junior, and Honour Luff, I know nothing of them my self, but their general Character is, that they are very troublesome People. Honour Luff has been looked upon as one concerned in such Affairs, but I have not known her to forswear her self. I have great Reason to believe the contrary, for I never saw any body more cautious, than she was, when she made her Affidavit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Have you never had any Conversation, with one Hammond about them?</p>

               <p>Mr Read. I attended Sir George Cook at his Office, and remember this Bond's being produced by Mr Barton the elder. I remember his taking it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160036"/>out of a Bag of Papers, as a Voucher, on the Bills which were taxed, and to prove that he had such a Demand. I believe this was at the Prothonotary's Office.</p>

               <p>Mr. Barton, in his Defence, gave an Account of the several Affairs he had transacted for George and Nicholas Collins, from the 22d of April 1728; and that in June 1729, there was 80 odd Pounds due to him, for Business he had done, and Money he had expended for them. That they being lamentably Poor, and having another Cause depending in Chancery, invited him and his Son to come and dine with them, promising to give him some Security for his Debt. That they accordingly went; and the Bills being satisfactory, the Account between them was then adjusted, and amounted to 84 l. 16 s. and 6 d. That, at their Request, he abated 1 l. 16 s. and 6 d. and they gave him a Bond for the 83 l. to which Honour Luff made her Mark, and his Son signed his Name, as attesting Witnesses. He gave farther an Account of the Business he had done for them, after their having executed this Bond, and the counter Securities they had given him for the Expence and Trouble he had been at in the Management of their Causes; and of the several Transactions which passed between them till the Affair was adjusted, and settled by the Prothonotary.</p>

            . I was my Father's Clerk when the Bond for 83 £. was given by George and Nicholas Collins.</p>
               <p>Couns. How old are you!</p>
               <p>Mr Barton, jun. I shall be thirty Years old the sixth of November next. I had been Clerk with my Father better than a Year, at that Time; and was then almost nineteen. It was usual for me to go with him to execute Writings; and I am positive this is my Hand to this Bond: it was given at Exon, in the House of George Collins. My Father had been concerned for the two Collins's, in a great many Causes, and there was due, on several Bills, the Sum of 84 £. 16 s. and 6 d. He abated 1 £. 16 s. and 6 d. and this Bond was given for the remaining 83 £. - I saw George Collins write his Name to this Bond: He sealed and delivered it, and Honour Luff was present at the same Time; she made her Mark to it, and I wrote my Name to it, as Witnesses. This Name (Edward Barton) is my own Hand-writing, and the Writing (the Mark of Honour Luff) is my Father's. The Bond likewise was filled up by my Father.</p>
               <p>Couns. Who was present at the Time when this Bond was executed?</p>
               <p>Mr Barton, jun. George and Nicholas Collins, George Collins's Wife, Honoria Luff, Ann Luff, and a Person that came in and out, as a Servant, in a Carter's Surplice; who he was I cannot tell. I was a Witness to Writings two Years before this, - in the Year 27. This is my Hand on the Back of this Parchment; and the middle Name is my Hand, on the Back of this other. These Deeds I engrossed myself, and often went with my Father to attest Writings.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was this Bond filled up before you went to Collins's, or after you came to his House?</p>
               <p>Mr. Barton, jun. I believe my Father filled it up after we went there; and it was executed in the Kitchen?</p>
               <p>Couns. What Floor had the Kitchen?</p>
               <p>Mr Barton, jun. I cannot charge my Memory with that. We both dined there that Day, and I think we had some Fowls and a Piece of Bacon for Dinner.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you see Nicholas Luff there?</p>
               <p>Mr Barton, jun. I don't remember I did. If I did, he appeared as a Servant, in and out: I did not mind him as a Person concerned; and I don't know that I have ever seen him before, or since.</p>
               <p>Q. Look again upon your Name: Is the Word Junior your Hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Mr Barton, jun. Yes, I do believe it is.</p>
               <p>- Williamson, Esq; I don't know much of the Collins's myself: but by all Report, their general Character is very bad. I have heard they are very litigious People, and frequently concerned in Law-suits. They bear so very bad a Character, that I would not believe them, upon their Oaths; and I believe a great many others would not. I think their Characters are so very bad, that they ought not to be believed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. I think, Sir, you was High-Sheriff of the County last Year?</p>
               <p>Mr Williamson. Yes, I was. I live in Exon: the two John Collins's live in Hambleden Parish, three or four Miles distant. Honour Luff lives in my Parish; she bears a very bad Character, I am upon my Oath, - I should not care to believe her upon her Oath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bonbam. I know John Collins and Honour Luff. I formerly lived near them: but I now live seven or eight Miles distant from them. They never wronged me, but their general Character in the Neighbourhood is an evil one: 'tis generally bad. I should give no Credit to him, or her, tho' they were upon Oath. Mr. Barton I have known thirty Years; he is a Gentleman of a good paternal Estate, and married a Woman of a good Family.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160037"/>I don't believe he is capable of being guilty of Forgery; nor is there a Man in our Country who believes him guilty. His Character is a very good one?</p>
               <p>Couns. Have you seen Collins within these seven Years?</p>
               <p>Mr Bonham. I don't know whether I have or not. I saw Honour Luff some Months ago at Alresford. I knew her before that Time. I have an Estate within a Mile of the Place where they all live; and all People give them evil Character.</p>

            , Esq; I know Collins of Hambledon the elder. About 10 Years ago, his Son was indicted for setting the Moors on Fire: I did not know Collins the younger before that Time. And Honour Luff I have known twenty Years. The general Characters of them all three are bad, and I really believe none of them are to be credited. Mr Barton bears as good a Character as any Gentleman in the County: He's a Man of good Substance, and I believe would scorn to do what he's charged with, as much as any Man in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>- Penton, Esq; I have known Mr Barton, 15, 16, or 20 Years: He has a very good Character, and has always behaved well in his Profession. He is a Man of Fortune, not much less than 200 £. a Year; but I don't know his Circumstances particularly. His general Character is exceeding good, and I believe he would by no means do a thing of this Sort. I know nothing at all of the Collins's: I live about seven Miles from Mr Barton.</p>
               <p>Mr Clark. In 1704, I got Mr Barton sworn an Attorney: he has done Business for me; I never knew him do an unfair Thing: but he always behaved as well as ever I knew a Man in my Life, and I took him to be a very honest Man.</p>

I am Deputy-Register under the Bishop of Winchester, and he has an Office under the Bishop now.

I was at a Vestry with Mr Read and Mr Barton, junior, when they were rating the Parish-Books; and when they came to Mr Barton's Name, Mr Read raised it; [the Rate] Mr Barton said, he would not have his Father's House raised so by every Body: and Mr Read told him, he would humble him, and his Father too; and said, Don't you remember the Bond?</p>

            . I know Honour Luff, she bears a very bad Character. I happened to be in the House with her about four Years ago, last February, and a Man who was present, said to her, if you would do yourself any good, you must deny all, and swear any thing. She answered, - she would deny all, and swear any thing before she would come to the Parish.</p>
               <p>Mr Porter. I have known Mr Barton 18 Years. He bears as good a Character as any Man in Hampshire, and I believe this to be a malicious Prosecution, in order to extort Money from him. I am subpcena'd here with regard to Mr Barton: I am an Attorney, and am now concerned in a Cause for the Lady Boyce against the Collins's.</p>
               <p>Mr Read. I have known the two John Collins's and Honour Luff, 15 or 16 Years. As to Honour Luff, I never heard any thing amiss of her in my Life. As to old John Collins, I have: but young Collins, I believe he is an honest Man.</p>
               <p>Couns. Do you think old John Collins would forswear himself?</p>
               <p>Mr Read. I don't know. I believe Honour Luff would not: for she was very cautious in her Affidavit to ground the Suit in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire Mr Read may be asked, if he made no Declaration to Mr Hamman, that he believed the Collins's were People of an ill character?</p>
               <p>Mr Read. I have said old John Collins bears a bad character; I believe the young one is an honest Man, and I have no Reason to distrust Honour Luff. I don't recollect that I said she was a mad Girl. Mr Hamman wished they might not be troublesome to me; and I said, I had done nothing for them, but what I had done for People who I thought were resied: but (says I) if they have a Mind to quarrel with me, I don't know that I have given them any thing under my Hand. The Collins's indeed have not been very grateful to me, for after I had done them all the Service I could, they were pleased to tax all my Bills.</p>

            . I have known Honour Luff a pretty many Years; she bears a good Character as far as I have heard. She is a young Woman, and may be guilty of frisky things, but I never knew her guilty of any thing dishonourable. I believe she would not do wrong things, so much as many of the People who have been Evidences against her. I have known her and all the Collins's 20 Years. John Collins the younger I have known ever since he was christened, and he bears a good Character, as far as I have heard. I believe he would no more take a false Oath, to take away a Man's Life, than I would. I was born at Hambledon, in Hampshire, and was bred up a Surgeon, but I now keep a Publick Way, in London, and sell Wine, Brandy and Rum, wholesale and retale. I knew when old John Collins could be respected in the best of Company. He always behaved well in his youthful Days, and was well respected by 'Squires and Gentlemen, - the best in the Country, and was trusted by them. I never heard but that Mr Barton had a good Character; and I have heard the several Gentlemen examined who have spoke against the Collins's: but most of them who gave Evidence, never had any Dealings with them, then how should they give a Character of them truly? - I live now near Hanover-Square: I have lived up and down, these 14 or 15 Years, sometimes in the Country, and sometimes in London: and I have lived at Times in the Neighbourhood of Hanover-Square, about 5 Years, and have let Lodgings, but now I have been a settled Housekeeper about 12 Months. I came from Hambledon about 17 Years ago, but Collins has been a Taylor to our Family for many Years.</p>

             a Butcher, but both he and my Aunt are dead. We then sold Drams, and they had a Dram a-piece, and paid 3 d. in Copper. After this he came several Times, and I being a single Woman, and he a single Man, he frequently came to the House, to see me.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you ever see him at Wood's-Close.</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes; after he had been at our House, we grew intimate, and he fetched me there. I have been there several Times within this Year and a half. But after I had been there once or twice, I saw he had a Wife, and then I went to visit his Wife, and have seen him sell this false Money.</p>
               <p>Couns. Have you ever seen him do any thing to it?</p>
               <p>Harris. I saw him put a Shilling between a Piece of Paper into a Hand-vice, at Wood's-Close, and rub round the Edges, with a three-square-file; but I don't know what condition it was in, before he rubbed it with the File, nor what he did to it afterwards. The second Shilling I saw was one which he offered to my Aunt; but she looked at it, and gave it him again, telling him it was not a good one. He made a Laugh of it, and after he had rubbed it with some Powder, between his Finger and Thumb, he tossed it down on the counter and said, who would dispute that Shilling was not a good one. It looked like Lead before he had rubbed it, but afterwards it appeared like Silver. He afterwards told me, I might get a good Living, if I would dispose of such Shillings, and that he would give me 3 or 4 of them for a Shilling; but I never had any from him to dispose of. He said, if he could not get 100 £. a Year he could not live, and I might get a good Livelihood too if I would dispose of such Shillings. I never saw him rub or file them except once: but several Times when he has been at our House, he has appeared in a Hurry, and has said, he must go and put off his Tom Tits, and has thrown down a Piece of the Money on the counter, and said, - 'tis as good a King William and Queen Mary as ever was coined. He pretended to be Hog-Butcher, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160040"/>when I went to his House, I found very good Entertainment for Trades-people. He lodged up one Pair of Stairs, at a Widow's House, in Wood's-Close, but I don't know her Name.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you ever see him put off this Money to any Body?</p>
               <p>Harris. I have seen him give People three or four of these Pieces, as I have thought, and they have given him a Shilling for them. I have seen him three several Times give three for a Shilling: but I cannot tell who the Persons were that took them, nor did I mind what the Prisoner said, when he sold them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you was taken up you did not know your own Mother. Pray what House do I live in?</p>
               <p>Harris. Between the Alehouse and the Barber's Shop, in Wood's-Close.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Tell me whereabouts in the Room is the Fire-place: where my Bed stands, and what Sort of a Woman my Wife is?</p>
               <p>Harris. The Fire-place is on the farther Side of the Room; the Bed may have been moved since I saw it, but his Wife is a little Woman, shorter than I am, and has a young Child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How come you to be perswaded to come and give Evidence now, when last sessions you would not appear?</p>
               <p>Harris. I did not know the Consequence. - I have had no Perswasions, nor any Money?</p>
               <p>Couns. He would have it understood, that you don't know where he lodg'd: Did not you carry the Persons who have the Charge of the Prosecution to the House?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes; and I knocked at the Door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw her in my Life, before this Morning.</p>
               <p>Harris. I know him, and have been at his House several Times.</p>
               <p>Couns. Can you recollect what Time it was, when you saw the Prisoner put the Shilling into the Hand-vice?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; - it was about a Twelvemonth ago, at Wood's-Close: and it was about a Quarter of a Year before that Time, when I saw him rub the Shilling at my Aunt's in Tooley-street.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner between two and three Years, -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am informed that Man has been in the Pillory for Perjury, and a Conspiracy against Drinkwater. He was convicted here two or three Years ago.</p>
               <p>Brown. I became acquainted with the Prisoner, by drinking with him at a Publick-house in Wood's-Close. I once saw him sell three or four of those Pieces for a Shilling, and have heard him say, if he could not get a Hundred a Year, he could not maintain his Family. And when some of the Shillings have looked like Lead, I have seen him rub them over with something white, and make them look like Silver. I can't take on me to say they were such Pieces (before they were rubb'd) as are here in Court, but I have seen him rub them between his Finger and Thumb; after which he has shewn them upon the Table, and said they look'd like Silver. And they have looked like King William and Queen Mary's Shillings. Those which I have seen upon the Prisoner, have not been so rough as these I see now.</p>
               <p>Couns. What Business did he say he followed?</p>
               <p>Brown. He told me he was a Horse-Jockey; and afterwards he said he was a Dealer in Hogs, and another Time he was a Polisher of Glass. I have seen him have Horses in Ward's Rents, near Hockley in the Hole, where he had a House of his own, since Michaelmas last; after he removed from Wood's-Close. I can't say what Business he did in that House, but he said, - provided there were Molds, or Money found there, it could not be proved that he put them there.</p>

            . I live in Wood's-Close, and am a Carpenter. On the 21st of June, as I was pulling down the House of Office, where the Prisoner lodged, I found this Bag of counterfeit Money, under the Seat. There were fourscore and four Shillings concealed upon a Board; where they could not be seen, though searched for with a candle; and could only be found, by putting a Hand thro' the Hole, and turning it under the Seat. I know the Prisoner lodged in that House, and continued there a Quarter of a Year after this Thing was rumoured about, and talked of.</p>
               <p>Harris. The Piece I saw him rub with a File in the Hand-vice, was like these, but I can't swear to it.</p>

He lodged in my House when the Money was found; I suspected him, and gave him warning two or three Days after it was discovered, and I think he went away a Month before Michaelmas.</p>

            , I keep a Coffee-House in Well-Court, in Queen-Street. I have seen the Prisoner before; and believe he is the same Person who came twice to our House, and changed a Shilling each Time, to pay for what he had, and we found a bad Shilling both Times in the Drawer after he was gone. The third Time he came was last December was 12 Months, and he then changed a good Six-pence to pay for a Dish of Coffee, and went out! In half an Hour he returned again, and called for a Glass of Ale, and some Tobacco, after which he offered my Wife a bad Shilling; she told him, it was not a good one; but before I could get to the Bar, he had snatched it up, and had laid down a good one. I told him, he was a vile Fellow, and that this was the third Time he had served me so. The Gentlemen in the House said, I ought to secure him; upon which he fled for it, and got 100 Yards from the House, but I pursued him, and tho' he resisted, I took him, and asked him, what need had he to change a Shilling, when he had changed Six-pence but ++ of an Hour before? He said he had no Half-pence, but when the Constable came we searched him, and found fifteen or 16 good Shillings upon him; one bad one; and about three Shillings in Half-pence, more than he had received from us in change. He then offered to spend a Crown in the House, if I would let him go; I refused to discharge him, and carried him before Mr Alderman Perry, and produced the bad Shilling we found upon him, but not being able to swear it was the same identical Shilling, which he had offered in Payment, he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did the bad Shilling which you found upon him, tally with the other two you had taken before?</p>
               <p>Mr Blackwell. Yes; so very exactly and minutely, that several Gentlemen in the Room were of Opinion, they were all made in the same Mold. That which I found upon him was broke, that it might go no farther, - it was a King William's, and the Date was 1696.</p>
               <p>Couns. These now produced are King William's, 1696.</p>
               <p>Harris. I can't tell what Impression was on the Piece which I saw him put into the Hand-vice: nor can I tell whether the Edges were smooth before he filed them. He did not let me see that Piece. That which I saw him rub between his Fingers, he tossed down, and said, there's as good a King William's and Queen Mary's, as ever was coined: and I saw something of a Head upon that, I am certain: but it did not found like good Money.</p>

            . for uttering counterfeit Money. Brown, (a former Witness) sent for him to a Tavern, and told him, that the Prisoner (who had married Wood's Daughter) was one who counterfeited the Coin, and put it off. That he took the Prisoner upon this Information, and searched his House in Ward's Rout's, but found nothing, except some Powder in some little Holes and Corners of the House, which answered the Description of that which Brown said he had seen him rub the Shillings with. That the Prisoner had prevaricated in all the Answers to the Questions he put to him, and denied that he had ever been at Blackwell's Coffee-House in his Life.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner desired Mr North might be becaked, if he had not given Christopher Brown, otherwise Bawes, Money to appear against him? Mr North answered, that Brown was poor, and as he offered himself voluntarily, he had given a Shilling, now and then, - and sometimes 2 s. or half a Crown, once in a Week, or a Fortnight: and that he once gave Harris three Shillings.</p>

               <p>Mr Millar. On the 21st of March, about 10 o'clock at Night, I was laid hold of by a Girl in <placeName id="t17400416-44-crimeloc254">Fleet-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17400416-44-crimeloc254" type="placeName" value="Fleet-street"/>

I was sensible of it, and pulled her Hand immediately out of my Pocket, and told her to take Care of herself, for if she persisted in such Actions, she would come to the Gallows: and for Fear my Watch should be taken, I kept my Right-hand upon my Fob. The other Girl, who then stood on my left Side, picked my Handkerchief out of my Pocket, and told the Prisoner, she had got it. Hearing this, I took my Hand from my Fob, to feel whether my Handkerchief was gone, and, in the mean Time, the Prisoner picked my Watch out of my Fob. Upon this I seized<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160043"/>them both, by the Handkerchiefs which they had about their Necks: and the Woman who took my Handkerchief slipped away, and left her Handkerchief in my Hand, but the Prisoner, who took my Watch, I secured. I felt in my Fob, the Moment the other Girl fled, and my Watch was gone. I missed it in half a Minute after I had taken my Hand from my Fob. When I laid hold of the Prisoner, she would have got away, and her Handkerchief came off in my Hand, with a Piece of her Shift: but I held her, and called Watch! She then desired me to go with her up the Alley, to see for her Accomplice, who (she said) had got the Watch: and I went with her to a House in the Alley, but the Woman of the House would give us no Information, either of the Woman or the Watch. The Prisoner I am sure took my Watch, and I apprehend handed it to the other who got away: and the Reason of my certainty is, because the other Woman was at a Distance from me, and behind me, and the Prisoner was the sole Person that was nigh me, and her Hands were about me. The other Person, who took my Handkerchief, was towards my left side, behind the Prisoner, who stood right before me, and her Hands were constantly about my Pockets. When I had got the Prisoner to the House where she carried me to look for her Accomplice, she desired me to search her, but I knew it was to no Purpose, because I believed she had handed it away to the other Woman behind her: but I can't say I saw her hand it away. It was a Gold Watch, and worth upwards of 10 £.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I in company with the other Woman?</p>
               <p>Mr Millar. She was not standing with her at first. The other Woman was standing by her self, at the End of a court, and gave me a Pull by the Sleeve as I passed by; and after she had stopped me, the Prisoner came up immediately. She was carried that Night to the Gatehouse, and the next Morning before a Magistrate, who committed her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming down the court, I met this Gentleman, running after a Woman; he snatched hold of my Handkerchief and said I belonged to the Woman who had got his Gloves and Handkerchief. I told him I did not; and desired him not to take my Handkerchief, but go with me to the House, where I saw the other Woman go in.</p>

            , (13 Years of Age, the 21st of July next,) after having been asked some Questions about the Nature of an Oath, was admonish'd to speak nothing but what was Truth. The substance of the Account she gave was, that about Midsummer last she went to live with a Gentlewoman who then lodged in the House of Mr Henry in Mumford's-Court in Milk-Street. That one Morning her Mistress being gone to Market, and no one being left in the House but her, and the Prisoner, who was a Servant to Mr Henry; He came up Stairs, and would have tempted her to have gone down Stairs into the cellar with him, but she refusing, he took hold of her, and forcibly carried her thither, tho' she scratched his Face, and clung to the Bannisters of the Stairs. That when he had got her into the cellar he laid her down on the Ground; and held her down by keeping one of his Hands on her Forehead. [The Witness proceeded in her Account of the Prisoner's abusing her, and of his Behaviour to her, but our Regard to Decency obliges us to veil it.] She said, she cried out, Murder! but he kept her down, and almost stifled her. That after this, she was very ill, and could hardly walk; but was fearful to discover the Injury the Prisoner had done her left her Father and Mother should be at her. She was asked a Question, which in such unhappy cases the Law makes necessary, and she answered in the Negative. She farther deposed, that her Mother at last discovered her Illness, by her Linnen, and that upon her being examined by her Father, she told what the Prisoner had done,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160044"/>and that no one else but he had abused her: after which she was carried to the Hospital, where she continued three Weeks, in Order to be cured of the Foul Disease.</p>
               <p>Rochael Moreton, the Child's Mother, deposed, that she had observed her for some Time to walk comically, but she thought her Shoes might hurt her Feet. At last she [being frighted by the Appearance of her Linnen] got her Husband to examine her; and she then gave the same Account of the Cause of her Disorder, as she had now done. She added, that about a Fortnight before this Injury was found out, her youngest Child having been taken ill in the same Manner, she got Mr Markland, a Surgeon, to examine them both, and found they had got the Foul Disease upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr Markland depos'd that he examin'd the Children, and found the first Witness miserably clapp'd. His Answers to some Questions did not amount to a Proof of the Fact, as charged in the Indictment; but it was his Opinion, that a venereal Taint might be communicated by meer Contact, &amp;c. which would produce the Disorder the Witness laboured under, without infecting the Blood.</p>
