            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. On Saturday the 1st of October the prisoner, who had frequently called at my house to enquire for a relation of mine, came into the kitchen I remember about twenty minutes after four; the watch was hanging up on the mantle piece in the kitchen, and the prisoner was then in the room; I was called out by some person who enquired whether there were any lodgers in the house; I answered in the negative, and I staid only the time that might be spent in asking such a question and giving the answer to it; I then returned into the room, and then the prisoner took his leave; I went after him and fastened the batch; I turned into the kitchen and found the watch gone; I called after the prisoner but he was out of sight.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before where he lived?</p>
               <p>Innes. Yes. I followed him close and saw him put the pots down on the table; he did not see me; when he had put them down he returned to the house, and took another pot that stood, on the table by him, and three or four more. I acquainted the prosecutor of it, and he came and took him, and he dropped the pot under the table where he sat. The landlord and I went to the prisoner's house and found the other pots there.</p>

I was desired by the porter to go into the shop; when I came forward the porter said to him, You have stole some tea; he caught his pocket, and said here it is, and I saw it was loose in his pocket; the prisoner immediately took it out of his pocket and laid it upon the compter; my servant weighed it, and said it was fourteen ounces and a half. The porter said it was taken out of such a chest; it agreed with that tea.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Anstie. He said it was his own property; I believe I asked him then why he took it out on the compter, or wanted to go away after it was taken out of his pocket; for I had kept the door; he asked me if I would detain him upon these circumstances; I told him my servant was gone for a constable, and I would certainly detain him till such time as he returned, to clear up the affair. He had heard me give the orders to fetch an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of tea did he use generally to buy?</p>

            . I am porter to Mess. Anstie and Worstead. The prisoner walked backwards and forwards in the shop; I saw him stop at the chest and take a handful of tea out; the chest stood upon another chest about the middle of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of tea was it?</p>
               <p>Grover. Green tea. I saw him take several handfulls out of that chest that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120007"/>Q. How long was the second time after the first?</p>
               <p>Grover. About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop was you in?</p>
               <p>Grover. Putting up some currants in a bag at the end of the compter, between two and three yards from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not prevent it after you saw him once?</p>
               <p>Grover. I was willing to be certain. He put his hand open into the chest, and took it out full, and dropped some putting it into his pocket. I went into the compting house, and told my master that he had taken some tea out of such a chest; he took it out of his pocket and threw it out, and said it was not my master's; I said it was my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. It is common I believe when people buy tea to smell it?</p>
               <p>Grover. Yes, they may smell to it, and put it into the chest again. I had suspected him before, which induced me to watch him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On Saturday I went into their shop to buy some tea as usual. I bought a lump of sugar that came to 13 s. 1 d. on Saturday evening, two pound of Hyson tea at 9 s. 9 d. a pound, and a pound and a half of common tea at 5 s. 1 d. I happened to be short for a little more, and on Monday Miss Crawford desired I would change a pound of tea for her; accordingly I took her tea and put it from the cannister loose into my pocket. As I was going up Lombard-street I met Mrs. Jones, a custom-house officer's wife, that used to be a well-wisher of mine; I asked her if she wanted half a pound of tea against Christmas; she said she would; I gave her a little of it, perhaps an ounce or thereabouts; I desired her to stop while I went into Mr. Anstie's shop to buy some tea as usual; she would not stay; I said I would call in a day or two and make it up half a pound. I went into the shop and asked the shopman for some sugar; the man weighed and did it up for me, and put it into the window till the Monday, then I said I would call and pay for it. I asked him for some green tea; I did go to the chest and took a little tea out in my left hand, and at the same time I took some tea out of my own pocket with my right hand, and smelled to it; I returned my tea into my own pocket, and the other tea into the chest again; then the porter asked me if I had any tea; I said I had; he said it is in your pocket; I said you may take it, but claimed it to be mine; Mr. Anstie stopped me, and the constable was charged with me.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Crawford. On the 13th of December I exchanged about fourteen or fifteen ounces of tea with the prisoner; my tea was in a cannister; he emptied the cannister and put the tea loose into his pocket. I have known him three months; he has bore a good character.</p>
               <p>- Jones. I have dealt with the prisoner several times: I met him in Lombard-street between five and six o'clock; he asked me if I wanted any tea against Christmas, and gave me some out of his pocket loose; he said perhaps that is not good enough for you, but if you will stay a little while, I am going into this shop to get three pounds of tea as usual, and you will have some better; I could not stay; I went away. I have known him two years; he always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>- Sharpe. I am a taylor; he lodged with me three or four months; he always behaved well.</p>

This man met me, and gave them me, packed up, ready for us, by the Fox at Greenland-road; as I came to Shoreditch church he asked me if I could lodge them at my house, for he was just got into a new lodging, and did not care to disturb the man; I agreed to it; after that I took another turn, and then he said he would call his landlord up. As I was coming out of the lodging, between seven and eight, Blundell stopped me; I said I was going to set the copper up; I said I was no thief, if he would go with me I would shew him the man I had the copper from. He threatened to knock me down.</p>

            . My house was robbed lately, between one and two o'clock in the day time, while I was out. I left my wife at home when I went out, but I find she went out afterwards. I lost the things; the cloth coats, two pair of breeches, a black cloth waistcoat, a pair of thread stockings, and a pair of black rib stockings, the half guinea and quarter guinea, I gave my daughter to put in her box.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room?</p>
               <p>Hales. There is but one room to the house; it is a small garden house. I found them wanting as soon as I returned: my wife came back before me. These things I found in the prisoner's lodgings; I found a coat upon a little boy at the time the prisoner was apprehended; I found the coat upon the back of the prisoner. All these things have been in my possession ever since: the coat and waistcoat were upon his back; the other things in his lodgings. I am positive they are my property. The trunk has something singular in it that I can distinguish it by.</p>

I lay at the Rose in Cursitor-street that night; the next day (Friday) my wife came over with the money; I looked over the notes and money and saw they were right, and put them into a chest of drawers in my bed chamber. On Monday evening, the 20th of December, my wife and I went to the play; before we went to the play, at about four o'clock, my wife desired me to unlock the chest of drawers and see that every thing was safe; I did, and saw all was safe; I locked the drawers and the chamber door. When we came home my wife went up stairs; I heard her cry out; I went up to her; she said we are ruined! we are robbed! the chest of drawers was left open, and there was a new key left in it. (A bank note of 200 l. shewn the witness.) I believe this is one of the notes I lost; to the best of my knowledge this is the mark I observed upon it before; when I went to Mr. Hoare's I described it by that mark before I saw it; I did not look at the number of either of the notes. I suspected the prisoner from what had passed at the Eight Bells.

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the play who did you have in your house ?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Two plumbers were working in the front of the house; there were two carpenters in the front room, and a man and woman in the kitchen, who were not servants to me, but were people that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. The rose is a common through-fare from Cursitor-street into White's-alley ?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes; there are many cribby islands about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Which hand is the stair-case on as you go into White's-alley ?</p>
               <p>Corfield. On the right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is this room?</p>
               <p>Corfield. The one pair of stairs back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication with the fore room?</p>
               <p>Corfield. That floor has the bed room and the dining room; there is a partition with a wainscot and two bolts to take down occasionally to lay it into one room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you come out at the door of the bed room do you go directly upon the landing place?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes; the dining room door opens upon the same landing place as you come up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had at this time four men at work in the dining room?</p>
               <p>Corfield. No, that was below stairs; there was nobody above.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body might go up stairs coming from White's-alley?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes, but from Cursitor-street they could not. I have got a partition put up now, agreeable to the old proverb,</p>
               <p>"after the horse is stolen shut the stable door."</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it you left at the Rose?</p>
               <p>Corfield. A man that used to lodge at my old house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any hand bills published?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes, two thousand that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What description did you give of your notes?</p>
               <p>Corfield. A fifty, a forty, a hundred, and a two hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not able to specify the description of the notes?</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you went to some place of public entertainment?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes; the agreement was made on the Thursday before, at the Eight Bells, in the presence of the prisoner. I saw the notes and money were safe about four in the afternoon; when we returned from the play they were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing mentioned to him relative to a Bank note?</p>
               <p>Beamont. Yes; I asked him where he got the note that Mrs. Johnson changed for him, and whether he could produce the person he received it from; he said he received it of a soap boiler,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120014"/> at the Two Blue Posts in Duke's-street, St. James's; that he had breakfasted there that morning. There was such a house there two years ago, but it is shut up now. Afterwards, before the magistrate, he said he received it at a soap boiler's at Deptford.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross examination, he said, the prisoner said he received the note of a soap boiler that lived at Deptford.)</p>
               <p>- Smith. I live at the Ship the corner of Stones End, Blackman's street. I have known the prisoner about six months; I saw him Friday morning, St. Thomas's day; he came into my house between six and seven in the morning, and said he was cold and wet; he sat down at the fire in my tap room, and went to sleep; he came again on St. Thomas's day, in the afternoon; he went into my middle kitchen; he sat down and called for a pint of beer; then he called for me, and asked me to sit down; he asked me to drink: there was his brother with him; he asked me what he owed me; I said nine shillings and eight pence halfpenny; he bid me-sit down and he would pay me; he took out some silver and paid me. After that he said don't think I want money, Smith; I have got money enough; he pulled out a blue or red and white check handkerchief, with a quantity of guineas in it; I said this is very fine money; he said, aye, it is; by G - d, Smith, said he, I have been three years getting this money, but I insisted upon having it; I went to the gentleman and told him I would so and so if I had not my money, and so I got it now; had I got it in the King's Bench it would have done me some service, but it will do me none now; I said they are pretty things to play with. After that he pulled out a Bank note; I do not know for what sum, I only saw the back of it. He was going to put up the guineas; I said I have got a son-in-law has not seen so many guineas a good while; I called him, and said, did you ever see so pretty a fight before? he said, they are pretty chuckers: Currin said he had three in his pocket he could not make go; I said I would be bound they would go; I said I fancy there are a hundred of them; he said, yes, just.</p>
               <p>Q. A hundred what?</p>
               <p>Smith. A hundred guineas. Looking on one of the Bank notes, I said, I fancy that is a forty pound; he said it is; he put them up, and I left the room. He staid three hours after, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the guineas new or old?</p>
               <p>Smith. New.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Court to the prosecutor. You said you don't know the number of the Bank note?</p>
               <p>Corfield. I know it by a mark on the back of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know to whom it was made payable?</p>
               <p>Corfield. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recollect that mark upon the back of it?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always carry in your memory that there was that mark?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have omitted that out of your description in your hand bill?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to omit the only circumstance you knew it by?</p>
               <p>Corfield. I did not think that would be of any service in the hand bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have recollected that on the back of the note if you had not seen it?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Before I saw the note I described the mark to Mr. Hoare.</p>
               <p>The note was read, and corresponded exactly as set forth in the indictment at large.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I was concerned between four and five months ago for a man who kept a soap manufactory at Deptford. The same defence I make now, is the same I made when taken, and offered before the Justice. Upon the non-payment of duties he went out of the way, and a process, as I have been informed, issued against him for taking him; his goods were sold by the officers of excise. He thought to have the fine mitigated, and employed friends to purchase the goods, because they sold to great disadvantage, to take them off the premises. Several applications were made to withdraw the fine, to no purpose; he proposed then to let this manufactory, and employed me to let it. When I came to treat with people that came to me concerning it, they could not enter the premises if they made the purchase, by reason the entry was made in his name in the Excise Office, and without that entry being withdrawn, could do nothing on the premises, and he not being able to attend personally to do that, an entry was made in another person's name; I made an affidavit before the present mayor at the Mansion-house, and this man went and withdrew it. About the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120015"/> 13th of December last I was recommended to one Robinson; he viewed the premises, and came to an agreement to enter them between that time and last Christmas-day, on the forfeiture of five guineas: the condition money was one hundred and twenty pounds; a bill of sale was prepared, and executed. On Monday the 20th of December, Mr. Robinson called upon me to go to view the premises, and make his entry, the other entry being withdrawn by a letter of attorney; he went down to make an entry in the Excise Office, on the 20th of December last; my client went along with him, as I have been informed, and it will be proved by the excise officer that is here now; accordingly they returned; my clerk told me that Mr. Robinson had made his entry, had come to town, and would wait upon me that evening; that he would pay the money and take up the agreement, then in my hands. Mr. Robinson and Mr. Atkinson came to me between - I will not be positive to the time, pretty nigh to eleven o'clock I reckon; and Mr. Atkinson told me Mr. Robinson called upon him, had made his entries, and was coming to pay him, the money; he tendered me a two hundred pound Bank note, in order for me to take ten pound out of it: I was to have commission because I had a good deal of trouble on the business, as well to endeavour to withdraw the penalty as making this sale. I told him there was no getting cash at that time, it was so late, and advised him to call in the morning. I was very willing to get paid the ten pound because I wanted it. After some hesitation, they said they would call again, and accordingly took up the Bank note and went out, and returned soon again; I do not suppose they went outside the lower door; they came up, and said they were going a-cross the fields, and it would be necessary for me to keep the note for fear of any danger; I said you may use your own pleasure; Atkinson said it is not all mine, one hundred and twenty pounds of it is Mr. Robinson's, I had the note of him; I said I will give you an undertaking for the note; he said there was no necessity; they left the note, and appointed to call in the morning, and they called in the morning before it was time to get a note of that amount broke or changed; I said if you will wait till I have breakfasted, I will go out and endeavour to do it in the neighbourhood; Mr. Robinson said he had his horses coming to town, and desired me to do nothing with the note till he came to town on the morrow; he said he had to meet a friend at the Globe Tavern in the Strand, and would meet me there; he fixed the hour, betwixt four and five in the evening. I owed Mrs.

            , but I believe the property of the note was in Mr. Robinson; Mr. Lucas attended for me at the Justices, and set up that defence at that time; Mr. Currin says I was in the house when the notes were paid; true, I was; but I do not know what the sum was that was paid; I made an assignment of the lease; I was in his business as an attorney, and was present at the execution of this writing; I came home to his appointment on Wednesday evening; I went to the Globe Tavern, there I met Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Robinson; I told them what I had done; they wanted change for twenty five pound; their cook, Mr. Chaffley, keeps a public house, the Black Horse, at Charing-cross; I went there and paid them their money, and took what was due to myself; I did this in a public manner; my clerk is here, he will prove I did take this note of Mr. Atkinson; it would be rather hard for me to ask my client where he got it, that might hurt me; I have set up no other defence at the beginning; there is great danger if a man shall see another receive money for him to be called in question because he was there on such an occasion, if he should miss or lose his money; there has been a great deal in the news-papers, a vast deal, in order to abuse the public; I hope the gentlemen will take no notice of that, but will take the matter as it is given; I rest it with the Gentlemen of the Jury and your Lordship, and we shall call some witnesses.</p>

On his cross examination he twice repeated that he saw Currin write an acknowledgement for the two hundred pound Bank note, and that he heard him read it and give it to Atkinson, who looked at it, and put it in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Crouch. No. I was at the distance of twenty yards from him; it was light enough to discern him very well; we stood to see what he was doing; I said I supposed he was easing nature; Mr. Boyd said no, he believed he was after something else; I said we will step over the nails and see what he is about; we went over the rails; he ran off immediately; we pursued him; we caught him I believe in about a dozen yards from where we first saw him; then we went to see what he was about, and we saw a bag lying with a sheep in it, and the head lying by, and he had a knife in his hand all bloody, which he dropt down by our feet; we found the sheath of that knife in his pocket; we secured him and took him to Bridewell. Then we went up to Islington among the drovers, to enquire who had lost any sheep; I described the mark; two or three of them directly said it is Mr. Treasurer's, at Clare-market: it was a wether sheep.</p>

            . I am a small worker in gold and silver.

When I ran up to him he dropt this knife (producing it); it was all over bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it fit to kill a sheep with?</p>

               <p>Crouch. Yes; it was quite hot when we took him.</p>
               <p>Wood. It was bleeding. We took him to New Prison. Upon enquiry we were told it was Mr. Treasurer's mark; when we shewed them the skin, they said it was his sheep.</p>

               <p>There are two women live in the same house that I do, who saw me go out from home but a quarter before seven, and I was in New Prison before seven; I could not therefore have time to have killed this sheep and cut some of it up. I was going to the Bull in the Pound for a pint of beer; I saw this lying in the road; I stooped down and untied it; I saw it was cut and mangled about; I did not meddle with it. When I had got about twenty yards from the place, one of these men laid hold of me, and they hand cuffed me. Some of the sheep was carried away; I know nothing about the knife; I did not run. My witnesses are not here.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. Did you find the shoulder any where?</p>
               <p>Wood. No; the keeper of New Prison went and searched round the field but could not find it.</p>
               <p>Crouch. There was wool upon the prisoner's shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury to Wood. Did you see the prisoner drop that knife?</p>
               <p>Wood. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They found the sheath in my pocket, and then they searched after the knife; here is the young man that took me; he will prove they were thirty yards from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you chuse to call that young man?</p>

On the 16th of December, in the morning about nine o'clock, I went into the dining room and missed them. The glass of the window was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Which part of the house was that in?</p>
               <p>Hart. This little window was upon the stair case; the glass was almost broke out; it is but a very little frame.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they opened the casement?</p>
               <p>Hart. There was no casement; it was fixed in; the window was broke, but I do not think there was room enough for any body to get in; it was a sash window with four panes; there was a screen within side stood against the window; that was thrown down. The prisoners were taken up the same day; I found upon Dale the waistcoat; the coat was upon Boddin; I found the handkerchief, and some halfpence tied up in a handkerchief; Flanagan took them from Boddin; the coat was pawned at one Mr. Jones's. I saw the handkerchief and halfpence taken from Boddin; they both had lived in our family as boot catchers.</p>

            ). I recommended it to her to settle the affair amicably with the officer; she had at last two hours allowed her for that purpose. The prisoner, I presume, had heard of his maid being taken up, and, as my servant will inform you, he had been at my house to enquire for me, and she had informed him where I was - I was at the upper end of the dining room, and several gentlemen with me, when the prisoner came into the room; as soon as he came into the room I saw this pistol in his hand (producing a horse pistol); he looked on each side on the company, and said where is the justice that dare presume to commit my servant? or words to that effect, and he waved the pistol in his hand; then he came to the table where I was; he came up towards me, within two yards and a half of where I was; I heard the lock click as he came up; I threw myself on one side, and both the bullets went through my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to direct the pistol at you?</p>
               <p>Miller. Yes; and with an oath said, there you are. The bullets fell down behind, for there was not a sufficient quantity of powder to throw out the weight of metal; they went through my coat and dented the wainscot. Upon shaking the powder out of another pistol he had got, it appeared to me that there was not a sufficient quantity, though it was the best battle powder. He said immediately after he had fired, he was very sorry the pistol had not done its execution. He wanted to get his other pistol, after he had fired, to fire at me again, but the people there surrounded him, and got him on the ground, and then he wanted to get up to draw his cutlass. That other pistol that was found upon him, was loaded with two of the same balls; he had a flask of powder about him, and a fresh flint; he came towards me after he had fired the first pistol, as I imagine to shoot me with the other.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any dents upon the balls?</p>
               <p>Miller. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Counsel. You have given your evidence very fairly and humanely respecting the prisoner in two or three instances. - You, examined the powder of the other pistol, did you observe it so as to form any judgement of it?</p>
               <p>Miller. It appeared to me that there was not a quantity of powder to convey the balls with that velocity as if there was more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any experiment tried with the quantity of powder with the other halls ?</p>
               <p>Miller. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him you observed the pistol in his hand?</p>
               <p>Miller. When he entered the room, and began to express himself in that manner, I saw the pistol in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he had the pistol in his hand when he entered the room?</p>

               <p>Miller. I saw it soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. When he asked that improper question, where is the magistrate, was there any thing said by you in return?</p>
               <p>Miller. I believe I said I am the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how many persons were in the room at this time?</p>
               <p>Miller. I dare say ten or a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be in the room before you saw the pistol? did you see him at all before you saw the pistol?</p>
               <p>Miller. Just as he came in at the door I saw the pistol up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nobody kind enough to you to attempt to take the pistol from him?</p>
               <p>Miller. Every body was confused; I said I wonder you do not close in upon such a fellow as that; then they closed in upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned something about a public business, you was not then sitting on public business I believe?</p>
               <p>Miller. There was not then a bench: we had done business with some overseers and surveyors.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not then sitting in a court at the time?</p>
               <p>Miller. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to believe that this gentleman had any malice against you so as to attempt a thing of this sort?</p>
               <p>Miller. I should think he had.</p>
               <p>Q. But prior to this?</p>
               <p>Miller. I had seen him twice before. His servant maid had been treated ill by somebody coming from Knightsbridge; I granted a warrant, and the party was brought before me, and then the prisoner appeared; he seemed very rigid against the man; I said I believed he was a poor fellow, and he had mistook his mark,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120025"/> not knowing who she was; with much a-do he discharged the man. About a month after the prisoner was brought before me, by a man that lived at Kingsland; he had shoved a stick against the man's side, and he thought one of his ribs was broke; I recommended him to accommodate that matter; he was obstinate and would not, and I took his own recognizance.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe upon one of these occasions he returned you thanks for your polite behaviour to him?</p>
               <p>Miller. I believe he might. He came to me the next morning, went down on his knees, and asked my pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the ball any effect upon your body?</p>
               <p>Miller. My flesh was black for a week afterwards.</p>

            , Esq. I was on the 27th of November last at the house of Mr. Wilson, the Bell and Anchor, at Hammersmith; there was Mr. Miller, and I believe ten or a dozen more gentlemen; the prisoner came into the room in the evening, where we were altogether; he looked round, and said, Pray where is the Justice that dare commit my maid? or words to that effect, and takes out a pistol that he had concealed under his coat, came up to the head of the table, cocked it, and fired at Mr. Miller; he was within two or three yards, and I was within a foot of Mr. Miller; after that the people at the lower end of the table seized him, and got him on the floor. Upon searching him, they found another pistol loaded with a brace of balls, a horn half full of powder, a flint and a hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. His hanger was at his side I suppose?</p>
               <p>Scott. I am not sure of that; we were all frightened; I took a jump over four or five of them. What frightened us more than all was, the people below stairs cried out that the house was beset by more of them; we bolted the door, and some got pokers, and others sticks, to make the best defence we could.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he directed his pistol towards Mr. Miller, did you hear him say any thing?</p>
               <p>Scott. Not at that instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you to direct the pistol at Mr. Miller?</p>
               <p>Scott. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing after he had fired the first pistol?</p>

               <p>Scott. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Miller. At what time was it he said,</p>
               <p>"he was very sorry the pistol had not done its execution"; was that before he was seized, or afterwards?</p>
               <p>Miller. It must be afterwards; at the time he directed his pistol at me, he said,</p>
               <p>"you are the man"; I think it was something like that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Scott. Did you see him make any attempt to take out the second pistol?</p>
               <p>Scott. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At what part of the room was Mr. Miller and you standing?</p>
               <p>Scott. At the top of the room; the door the prisoner entered at was at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner a pistol in his hand at the time he entered the room?</p>
               <p>Scott. I did not see him in the room till he looked round; I saw the pistol in his hand before he fired it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he look round, stendily or wildly?</p>
               <p>Scott. As I look round now (steadily).</p>
               <p>Q. No agitation in his countenance?</p>
               <p>Scott. I perceived none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear any words that he said immediately after he had fired the pistol?</p>
               <p>Scott. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might be between the door he entered at and Mr. Miller?</p>
               <p>Scott. I cannot say that; there were about ten or twelve in the room.</p>
               <p>Scott. Do you think if he had had a pistol in his hand, and any of these men had seen him, they might not have prevented his firing?</p>
               <p>Scott. I should think they might.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. You say I looked round for the Justice, how do you know that?</p>
               <p>Scott. You are the best judge of that, you asked for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grey. I was in the room when the prisoner came in, about eight at night; whether he had the pistol in his hand then, or put his hand in his bosom to pull it out, I cannot tell; he held up the pistol, looked about, and said,</p>
               <p>"where is the Justice that dared to commit my maid?" he came up to the end of the table, and said</p>
               <p>"there you are," or something like that, and shot at him. The pistol was to be sure within seven or eight feet of Mr. Miller's body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it pointed at him?</p>
               <p>Grey. Yes; the company were sitting down;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120026"/> I ran to the fire-place, and took up a poker, and we secured him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live at his house at Hammersmith ?</p>
               <p>Bryant. Yes. Between seven and eight in the evening, of the 27th of November, the prisoner came to our house, and asked if Mr. Miller was at home; I told him, no, he was at the Crown and Anchor with some gentlemen; I observed he had his right hand under his coat; I did not perceive any thing in it; he asked me if a young woman had been there with a constable; I told him no; he asked me again if Mr. Miller was at home; I told him he was not; he staid about ten minutes, and then went away towards the Bell and Anchor, which is but a very little way from Mr. Miller's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner's house is?</p>

            . I keep the Bell and Anchor; I saw the prisoner come into the house; he looked into the parlour and tap room; he said he begged pardon, and believed he was wrong; then he came into the bar room where I was; Mr. Penny, a cheesemonger, who was there, knew him; he asked him to walk in; the prisoner turned the curtain on one side, and said, are you friends here? he turned round, and ran up stairs; I ran after him, and saw him rush in at the door of the room Mr. Miller was in, and take a pistol out, and as I was going to tell Mr. Miller he wanted to speak with him, the pistol went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you run up stairs after him?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I generally do when people want the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not apprehend he was going to do any mischief?</p>

            . I live in Salisbury-court, Fleet-street: I am a harpsichord maker and musick printer: I have known Mr. Frankland about seven months; I have been often in his company.</p>
               <p>Q. What observations did you make of his behaviour?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. I believe him to be an insane man, for he never went through any discourse regularly; he would behave very well for a minute or two, then he would vary to something else diametrically opposite to what he had been talking of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe this once or often?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in company with him any time immediately before this accident happened?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Less than a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find him then?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. As I have said now; if we entered into any discourse he generally went off, and went into something else: I judged him to be an insane man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in company with other people at the same time?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Yes; one of them made the same remark as I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make a remark before this accident happened?</p>

               <p>Faulkner. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What way did you keep company, did you drink wine together?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Sometimes we drank porter, some times rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean he drank to any degree of excess do you?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you saw him since his confinement?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was he then?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Very bad: I saw him in the Bail Dock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in Court last sessions?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his behaviour in Newgate like what you saw in Court?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Yes. I printed some musick for him; he sent the manuscript so bad, I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120027"/> not go on with the work; sometimes he would give me a fair copy, then contradict it and make it quite nonsense.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him at his house at Kensington?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a house and servants, and lived very regularly there?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But some of his musick was very incorrect that he sent for printing?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Yes; some correct, some incorrect.</p>
               <p>Q. If you looked upon him in the light of a man not in his senses, how came you to keep him company so often?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. I have done seventy pounds worth of business for him; I could not run away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. He paid you, and transacted all the business properly?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Yes, till lately; at first he went on regularly.</p>
               <p>Q. What alteration did you observe in him before this happened, what he said or did?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Only in his words.</p>
               <p>Q. You say his conversation was wild and incoherent, quite sensible I suppose?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any particular expressions, you rather seem to mean that his conversation was incoherent, wild and foolish?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. Our conversation was mostly respecting musick.</p>
               <p>Q. And his conversation was sometimes unconnected and incoherent, was that the only instance you know of his insanity?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. These are the only instances I know. I was forced to leave off the work.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of November was he less capable of explaining himself than before?</p>
               <p>Faulkner. A great deal.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fell. I knew him as a wine-merchant; he was a customer of mine, whom I made clothes for. I have not in the course of my business seen Mr. Frankland very much; having more business than I can do myself, it comes sometimes with my servants. I wrote Mr. Frankland a letter, and desired to see him; he came to me: our discourse ran upon trade and getting money; he said as to my part, I have been choused out of my fortune by a parcel of rascals, and he said as to going to any body to ask for my fortune, if a man owes me money, I would go to him, and challenge him to fight me; I do not know any other way of getting it; rather than fight me, he will pay me. My clerk was by, and made some little observations upon his behaviour; after he was gone, I said, Will, don't you think that man is mad? he certainly must be mad, says he.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that man here?</p>
               <p>Fell. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not mention what he said then.</p>
               <p>Fell. Said I, he appears to me to be so mad that if he orders any more clothes I will not make them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for that?</p>
               <p>Fell. I thought him not capable of taking care of his own affairs, and consequently that he would not pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he would not be liable to pay you?</p>
               <p>Fell. I thought he was not in a way fit to govern his affairs; I thought he would be ruined and I should not get my money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon his behaviour at any time before this month of November?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. I did a great deal: he used to walk out into the fields; I got the dinner, set it on the table, and used to go after him; he would be talking to himself when I came to him; I would hold up my hand; he would look at me, and turn to go away; he would turn round, and say go home, and I will follow you. In the morning when I cleaned his shoes and buckles, and put them by him, he would ask for them, and fly into passions; I said there they are; he would look up, and say, O well, and would talk to himself a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. That talking to himself did that happen once, or twice, or often?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. This was the month of July, down to what time was it?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. November; he was so in general.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his finding fault with you only in one instance?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. No, continually; I never saw a man in such passions that was in his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. What put him into such passions, was there any cause?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. No; I have left the room often-times upon such occasions.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the magistrate?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. Not till I was taken there; I saw that he was much the same I saw him before, not a man in his right senses, and was very ill used by the people at the house after he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or not believe him to be a man in his senses?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. He is not a man in his right senses, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. You may be asked perhaps by and by, how came you to continue with him if he was not a man in his senses?</p>

               <p>Whitewood. My master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever strike you when he was in these passions?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. No, but he did the housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever draw a pistol or his hanger to you?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. No; I always left the room when he flew into such passions; when I came into the room again afterwards, he was talking to himself.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he was used ill, what was done to him? do you know these pistols?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. Yes; they were my master's own pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he them?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. Ever since as with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep them charged?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. Yes, always, to defend the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him strike the housekeeper?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. No; I have heard her say so: she is very ill upon this account. She lives in Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. She is your sister?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why upon this account that makes her ill?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. Her being ill used and committed to prison; she got cold and ill used upon the account.</p>

             . The prisoner rented that house he lived in at Kensington of me, Midsummer last; I did not much approve of him when he came, to take the house, he seemed in such a strange sort of a manner; he said if I doubted the rent he would pay the year's rent before hand; he seemed so odd in his -</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by that?</p>
               <p>Walter. He seemed out of his mind I thought, or he might be in liquor, I did not know; he would give me a crown earnest; he gave me a crown piece. I was in company with him at his house; I never had much to do with him; for when I was at his house he did not speak right. He would walk up in my parlour, look up against the wall, and talk to himself. I looked upon him as a man insane; I never looked upon him as any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last make this observation?</p>
               <p>Walter. The very night this affair happened, the 27th of November. The constable, his opposite neighbour, came to me, and told me some officers wanted to take possession of his house; some distress, or something they were to make; he said I had better go down; I went with the constable and saw Mr. Frankland.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your observation upon him then?</p>
               <p>Walter. I looked upon him as a distracted man then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why what did he say?</p>
               <p>Walter. It was about the servants being taken before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might this be?</p>
               <p>Walter. About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120029"/>Walter. I asked him if I should seize; he said he did not owe me any rent; he said if you will depart for an hour or so, I will tell you what I am to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your rent to be paid half yearly or quarterly?</p>
               <p>Walter. Quarterly.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you thought it a matter of greater consequence than forty shillings, and asked if you should seize?</p>
               <p>Walter. Yes; when I went away he sent to let me know I had no occasion to stay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in a violent passion at that time?</p>
               <p>Walter. No, but looked very wild.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any physical people that ever attended this gentleman?</p>
               <p>Counsel. I do not know that there is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Greer. I live at Kensington: I am an attorney. I have been there almost fifty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Frankland prior to his living in the neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Greer. No. I have seen him frequently since; from the time I first saw him I perceived in my own opinion great signs of insanity. I saw him frequently. My wife keeps the Kensington coffee house; he used my house; I have seen him there frequently, and talked with, and always thought him disordered in his mind, from his odd expressions; sometimes he would start up in a surprising manner, run to the other end of the room, look out of the window for some time, and then turn back again. I have often seen him talk to himself; he would turn and look to the glass sometimes; his conversation was very incoherent.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of observing whether he grew better or worse?</p>
               <p>Greer. I went to see him in Newgate; he behaved so that he terrified me so that I durst not go again: I saw him in Newgate take a leap with his setters on very near the length of that table. He did not seem to know me.</p>
               <p>Court. You made an affidavit at the last sessions, was this before or after that?</p>
               <p>Greer. It was before; I saw him in the Bail Dock that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he left off the business of a wine merchant?</p>
               <p>Greer. I never knew that he was in the wine business.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any body to give an account of him in his former part of life?</p>
               <p>Counsel. We have some a-coming.</p>
               <p>Greer. There was one Mr. Johnson then in the same room, that is since convicted for forgery; one of the attendants went up with a candle; when I came, he asked me if I had brought the justice of peace to bail him; I said I came as his friend, and should be glad to see him in a better way; then he took a leap almost the length of the room, and then jumped down the well of the stair case seven or eight steps with his setters on.</p>
               <p>Court. Direction was given to prove the state of mind he was in at the time the attempt was made upon Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Walter. Did you see this gentleman after he was committed to Newgate or the Bail Dock ?</p>
               <p>Walter. I went to him three times in Newgate, and I do not believe he knew me the two last times, or he would not, or something; but he said, are you come to bail me; I said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he then or not in his senses?</p>
               <p>Walter. No. He went up to the wall and talked about bailiffs, and bailiffs followers; he said he had read Coke, and he had read Lyttleton, and all of them, and he ran down stairs with his fetters on.</p>

               <p>Q. You judged from his appearance and behaviour?</p>

               <p>Q. When did you live in the house first with him?</p>
               <p>Sefton. About a year and a half ago. I will tell you what excited my attention, it was fear of fire; for when he came looking with that distorted wild countenance he made me afraid of my valuable effects; that made me observe him more; I forced a conversation with him; he continued in a kind of incoherent manner during the whole time that he staid.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this house?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120030"/>Sefton. In Beaufort Buildings in the Strand; he had a first floor; I was on the floor above him; I used to swear that he was mad, that he would certainly fire the house, and I was under great concern for my papers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made it your business to study the practice of physic?</p>
               <p>Sefton. In the younger part of life I shilled physic; but on the war's breaking out, a military fancy took me, I was determined to go to serve my country, and then got a commission in the Royal

               <p>Q. Did you during this time suppose him out of his senses or not?</p>
               <p>Sefton. I did. I lived six years next door to one of the great private mad houses, and saw them frequently confined, and those they could let out they used to be chained to trees; I used to be asking them sometimes questions from curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of madness did you apprehend this gentleman's to be?</p>

               <p>Q. In what condition has he been?</p>
               <p>Whitewood. Very bad; he has continued much the same as before, talking about the bailiffs and the like.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Mr. Justice Blackstone thought him not in a fit state last sessions to be tried.</p>
               <p>Court. We thought the affidavit sufficient to put off the trial till further enquiry was made; at the same time we told Mr. Cox that we should expect proof of a much stronger kind than that upon which we put off the trial. I was in Court, I believe by myself, when he was brought up in order to be arraigned; he then appeared exceedingly wild when arraigned first of all, but was remanded, and came back in five or six hours time, with a very different kind of apparent insanity upon him: he was quite frantick at first, afterwards only talking beside the purpose.</p>

On Sunday the 1st of November, about two in the morning, myself and family were alarmed by fire; upon which I jumped up in the bed, and my chamber window looked direct to the house where the fire broke out, in Stanhope-street; the back part of the house looked to mine; I apprehended from the situation, my house was in imminent danger, and would soon be in flames. My wife being near the time of her delivery, I apprehended the consequence would be fatal to her, therefore I made her the principal object of my concern, more indeed than my property, and a young child, and a maid servant that went into fits; therefore I made my wife, child, and maid, the object of my whole concern; I took care to have them removed out of the house; I went to my bureau; I locked up what was necessary; I took my shop books, and that bureau, and wife and child, and went to the house of a neighbour. I afterwards received intelligence from the prisoner, that great part of my goods had been carried to his house; they were all brought back except the things mentioned in the indictment. I was so taken up in attending my wife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120031"/> that I did not return to my house till eight o'clock; before I returned to my own house, I went into a neighbour's shop, and there I saw Mr. Griffiths; though I had known him by sight some years, I never had spoke to him before. Mr. Griffiths told me he had been in my house several hours that morning, and had assisted in the preservation of my effects; I had not the least suspicion but what he spoke the truth; I thanked him therefore for his kindness. I went home; I found the key in the middle drawer, out of which these things were taken; I opened the drawer and found the contents were gone. The drawers stood upon a table in my bed chamber, in the two pair of stairs back room; all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) were taken away. Some time after this Mr. Shalmadine came to my house, and shewed me a gold cluster ring, and a pair of cluster ear-rings; my wife and I told him they were part of what we had lost at the fire; Mr. Shalmadine declined telling me then from whom he had them, but he came again in the evening, and told me he had them from Mr. Miller; we went there, and Mr. Miller said he bought them of Mr. Griffiths, and a clump stone ear-ring, and a hair pin, which he had made a present of to Mr. Sharpe, who was with him. I got a warrant, and had the prisoner taken before Sir

               <p>Mrs. Matravers. I am wife to the prosecutor. I used to keep all my rings and buckles in that drawer; there were in it all the articles mentioned in the indictment (repeating them ); I saw them all on the Thursday evening proceeding the fire, which happened on the Sunday morning, as I then put into the drawer some part of them which I had wore that day. I am positive that these ear-rings are my property; one of the locks is loose; I know the rings by their fitting my finger. On her cross examination she said she was perfectly satisfied that they were her property.</p>

            . I am a brewer, and live in Vere-street: I was just got to bed when I heard the alarm of fire; as I saw I was not in immediate danger, I went out to assist my neighbours; I went to Mr. Matravers's; they were carrying out leather; I went up stairs into the first, second, and third floor; there was no one there; I came down stairs, and then the prisoner came in; I told him there was no one up stairs, and the back of the house would soon be on fire; Mr. Griffiths went up with me; as other people were coming in, I desired a person I knew to stand at the bottom of the stairs, and let nobody come up; then the prisoner and I went up stairs together; in the back two pair of stairs room there stood a dressing glass or toilet with three drawers in it; the middle drawer had a key in it; he opened all the drawers, and he put his hand into the middle drawer and took something out, which he put in his pocket; I had not the least suspicion of his intending any thing dishonest. I went up with him to the third story; there stood a chest of drawers; they were all locked; he endeavoured to open them but could not; then he looked about the room for a poker or something to break them open; I said don't break any thing open, but let us remove any thing we can down stairs; another man came up, and we got them down stairs. I went over to Mr. Matravers about eleven or twelve o'clock, to enquire after the family; the maid told me her mistress was uneasy about some things that were lost out of a toilet in her master's bed room; I told her they were very safe, for I saw Mr. Griffiths take them.</p>

               <p>Bilbin. I saw Mr. Matravers afterwards, I told him the same. On his cross examination, he said he did not see what the prisoner took out of the drawer, but he saw him more than twice put his hand into the drawer, bring it out closed and put it into his pocket.</p>

            . Being in a coach with Miller and Griffiths, some time in November, Mr. Griffiths produced a box containing the ear-rings now in question, and likewise a hair pin, and a stone ear-ring; the hair pin and stone ear-ring were given to me as a present; the other things were sold to Mr. Miller, and they were given me by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I will make it appear to your lordship how I came by them, how I bought them, and what I gave for them: one Mr. Morris came to me about the 13th of November, and he told me he wanted a suit of clothes; he said he knew me very well, but I did not know him, and that he would pay me ready money for the clothes; that he was going down to Worcester; while measuring him, he said I shall pay you ready money, and I have a few things I make no use of, I will shew them to you; he pulled them out of his pocket and put them upon the table; I looked at them; I told him I was no judge at all; he said they were of no use to him; I said I would send and have them valued, and if he thought proper I would give him what they were worth. I sent my son to Ludgate-hill, and he brought me word back eighteen or nineteen shillings. When the man came for the clothes I deducted that money, and he paid me the remainder, tied up his clothes, took them under his arm, and said he was going to Worcester.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember in November last one Morris coming to Griffiths's house, and having a suit of clothes?</p>
               <p>Gaskill. I remember about the middle of November I was at work for Mr. Griffiths; he told me there was a suit of clothes to be made for a gentleman; I cannot recollect the name; they were to be done in a hurry; we got another man to come and assist us; soon after the gentleman called for the clothes; Mr. Griffiths rung the bell, and ordered me to bring the clothes down stairs; I brought them down stairs into the parlour and tried them on. I never saw the gentleman before in my life; I put the clothes on; he liked them very well; he said you have made out my bill; Mr. Griffiths said he had got his son, or Tommy, to write it out; he put his hand in his pocket, took out a canvas bag, and gave me six-pence; I asked for a handkerchief to tie the clothes up in it; he took his leave and I went up stairs, and said, I thank God the clothes fit, and I believe he will be paid for them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any person coming to him and buying a suit of clothes?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. About the beginning of November I met Mr. Griffiths in Cheapside; he bid me call for a pair of breeches to clean: I am a leather breeches maker; I had a pair of breeches to carry to a customer; he was not in a hurry; I went there; I have them at home. As he was going to look for them, somebody knocked at the door; a man came in and said, are my clothes done? he said yes, Mr. Morris, they are; he rung the bell and called to the man to bring the clothes down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought them down?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. A journeyman. He put them on, and said they fitted extremely well; he then enquired about his bill; he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a bit of a bag, and gave the man something to drink his health; what it was I cannot say. As soon as he had done that, he goes out to his bureau, and said, Mr. Morris, here are the things you left with me; he said well, Mr. Griffiths, have you had them valued? Mr. Griffiths answered, yes, Sir, I sent my son to have them valued, and they are valued at nineteen or twenty shillings, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the things?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Yes; there was a ring for a finger<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120033"/> and two pair of ear-rings, one with a white stone, the other red and white; the man said I think it is too little for them; Mr. Griffiths said that was what they were valued at, if he chose to take that, he would deduct it out of the bill; he said, well, I am going to Worcester, write me a receipt, and there are five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the clothes to come to?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Six pounds. Griffiths asked him if he would drink a glass of brandy; he fetched the bottle out, and gave me a glass of brandy with him; Griffiths said he would be obliged to him if he would tell him who was so kind to recommended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you know the things?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. That ring I believe was one of the rings; I cannot swear positively, but I remember the man's taking a ring up in his hand and turning it round; it was just such a one.</p>
               <p>Q. The ear-rings were they such kind of things as them?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the hair pin?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. I cannot say I observed it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Rose and Crown-court, in Broad-street-buildings, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a leather-breeches-maker?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was this you called?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. About the middle of the day, I believe eleven or twelve o'clock, I cannot particularly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Gilpin. I cannot positively say; it was the middle of the week, about the middle of November, about the 16th or 17th; if I had thought you would have been so particular I could have looked at my books.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the house before this man knocked at the door?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. I suppose about a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been standing?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Griffiths with you?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body sent for the breeches?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. He got up to look for them himself?</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Griffiths more than one parlour in his house?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Not that I know of, except the back parlour or bed room; I do not know which he calls it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the parlour door shut or open when he let this gentleman in?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. It stood upon the jar.</p>
               <p>Q. He recollected him immediately; he called him by his name?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. He said, yes, Mr. Morris, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain of the name?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect it very well?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Yes; but I did not expect to be called upon till yesterday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody applied to you before yesterday morning?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you never heard that Mr. Griffiths was in trouble about this?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. I read something of a paragraph in the papers, but not thinking it was him.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was as much at a loss about this as any man at Rome ?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. I was desired to recollect what passed about Mr. Griffiths and a gentleman that came for some clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first time you had ever mentioned it to any body?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this gentleman continue in the parlour?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was he?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. A tall man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a wig or his own hair?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. His own lank hair.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Half mourning or dark blueish clothes; I am not very clear about that.</p>
               <p>Q. How tall was he?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. He might be about as tall as myself; I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What complexion?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Dark complexion.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in the parlour?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. I might be very near half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not in a hurry to get this pair of breeches?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. I thought of asking for the breeches all the time: every tradesman knows he must wait for his customer.</p>
               <p>Q. When the gentleman went you got the breeches?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you carry them back again?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120034"/>Gilpin. I have not carried them back yet; Griffiths said he was not in a particular hurry.</p>
               <p>Court. You spoke to a ring and two pair of ear-rings.</p>
               <p>Gilpin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember nothing of a hair pin or stone ear-ring?</p>
               <p>Gilpin. No; I do not recollect them.</p>
               <p>- Thompson. I am a goldsmith and jeweller: I live on Ludgate hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things sent to you to value?</p>
               <p>Thompson. They were; these are such like things; they are the same make; this pin was not sent to me, the two pair of ear-rings and the ring; I did not give a great deal of attention to them, not having any suspicion I should be called upon about them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they valued at?</p>
               <p>Thompson. The first time he came to me I asked Mr. Griffith's son if they belonged to jewellers; he said no; because I said if they were I did not chuse to run down any man's work, but if your father is to buy them of any body I would assist; he might give half a guinea for the ring, and if he gave six shillings for these paste ear-rings it was as much as they were worth; those clasps I told him were good for nothing, that if he gave three shillings he gave more than the value for them.</p>

               <p>Q. What may the hair pin be worth?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I would not give above two shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not value the whole at more than twenty shillings?</p>
               <p>Thompson. One pound one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you value them?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I cannot say when; in the evening about six o'clock, Mr. Griffiths's son, Tommy, brought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular in them?</p>
               <p>Thompson. There are hundreds of such things made; it is an utter impossibility for a man to swear positive to such things as these.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you are not clear that these were the things that were brought to you?</p>
               <p>Thompson. They are the same sort of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps those were better than these?</p>
               <p>Thompson. They were the same quality and make.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you would have a little recollection at what day of the month this happened?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I have no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no notion about what time it was?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any thing of that sort brought to you to value before?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Not from Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Q. You know him very well?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I am acquainted with his son, and know him very well: I have been at his house many times.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Hartley. No, it was moon light; it was a little cloudy, but gave a great deal of light; as soon as the man that seized me by my collar demanded my money, another on the other side put a cutlass to my throat, and said he would cut my throat, or cut my head off, if I made any resistance; the third rifled my pocket of a half crown and sixpence, and took my buckles out of my shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of the men that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Hartley. The prisoners are two of them; I could see their faces very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Which put the pistol to your head?</p>
               <p>Hartley. I cannot be positive which did the particular acts, but I am positive to their persons; I think Simmonds held the pistol, and Bishop the cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you?</p>
               <p>Hartley. About four minutes; when they had robbed me, they said God bless you, get home; two of them were taken up the night following.</p>

             were concerned with me in robbing the prosecutor; we met together that night at the White-horse in Lamb-alley, Bishopsgate-street; we went from there about eight o'clock with intent to commit a robbery; we met the prosecutor in Hackney fields; we turned back and I put a pistol to him, and asked him for his money; Simmonds held a cutlass to him, and Bishop rifled his pockets; he took from him a pair of buckles, a pair of buttons, and a half crown and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you committing the robbery?</p>
               <p>Darley. About five or six minutes, or not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of you say any thing when you left him?</p>
               <p>Darley. I think I bid him go about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say bless him, or blast him, or any thing like that?</p>
               <p>Darley. I never said any such thing; we divided the money among us; when I was taken up they sent me word in Newgate that they had thrown the buckles and buttons away; Bishop and I were taken up together the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hartley. Was you sober at the time?</p>
               <p>Hartley. Yes, as sober as ever I was in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not the same surprize that prevented your knowing the part each of them took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120036"/> in robbing, prevent you from knowing their persons?</p>
               <p>Darley. No, I saw their faces distinctly; I challenged them the moment I saw them.</p>
               <p>Bishop's Defence.</p>
               <p>When Darley was first taken, the prosecutor swore that he rifled his pockets; after that he swore that he held the pistol to his head.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hartley. Did you swear differently?</p>
               <p>Hartley. I did not.</p>
               <p>Simmonds's Defence.</p>
               <p>I do not know the gentleman; I believe he does it for the sake of the reward; he went to Sir

On the 23d of December my wife missed a piece of muslin and a cloak; I missed four pair of stockings: the prisoner lodged in a garret in the house, and I suspected her; I got a search warrant and searched her room, but did not find any of my goods. I went to one Clarke, a pawnbroker over the way, and found a pair of my stockings pawned by the prisoner; upon this I took her up and she was sent to Bridewell: my wife and I went to Bridewell to her, there she confessed to two pair of stockings, and the cloak and muslin, and gave me the duplicate to get them out of pawn; I got the cloak and muslin but could not hear of the other pair of stockings. (One pair of stockings and the muslin produced and deposed to.) The muslin was found at one Mr. Carnaby's, a pawn-broker, the corner of Featherstone Buildings.</p>

About three weeks ago, coming thro' Turnstile, I saw some flutes to sell: I went in to enquire the price, and, upon looking at them, I knew them to be my own.

On Tuesday the 14th of December, about six in the evening, the window of my shop was broke; I was in the back room; one of my apprentices ran out, and I followed: when I came to the street, between Temple Bar and Butcher Row, I met with my apprentice and the prisoner; I took the prisoner home and sent for a constable, while he was gone for one, as I was searching him a large piece of cotton fell out of the bosom of his shirt: I missed four pair of buckles at that time. The method is to put the buckles upon the cotton in the show glasses; the cotton was gone with the buckles; I saw them there a quarter of an hour before; besides there was one odd buckle snatched at the same time, and not carried of, but dropped under the window. When the constable came I had him searched: he denied doing any thing of this kind himself, but said he saw another person do it.</p>

            . I was in the shop at the time the window was broke; I saw the buckles there just at that instant. I was cleaning a plated pair of spurs and did not see the window broke myself, but the moment I heard the noise I turned round and saw the prisoner with his hand in at the window taking the buckles in his grasp. I am very positive the prisoner is the man. I ran round the counter, and immediately pursued him, and searched him: I am positive to his person, there being three candles to the window; I could be quite positive to his features. The moment I opened the door to pursue him I heard a piece of glass gingle the way the prisoner ran off, when I came up with him he said, I saw the man take them, I am not the person that took them! I said nothing till my master came up, then I said that is the man. My master collared him, and brought him back into the shop. I went for the constable.</p>
