(<hi rend="italic">This requested a pound of coffee and change far a sovereign to be sent.</hi>) I took the note back with the goods to the shop, and received more goods and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Jenner—I then went towards the house again, but the female prisoner met me about 30 yards from the door, and said "Did not I tell you to be quick?"—I said "Yes"—she said I had not made as much haste as I could, and she said "Master is blowing me up" because she had not got the goods—I gave her the goods—she said "Have you got the change with you?"—I said "Yes," and gave it her—she gave me this coin, which I gave to Mr. Jenner at the shop—I afterwards went back with Mr. Jenner to 39, North Bank, but saw nothing of the prisoner there—a constable was afterwards called in, who marked the coin as it is now—I did not look particularly at the amount of money given to me to give to the prisoner.</p>

I am a surgeon, and live at 121, Bruns<lb/>wick Road, Poplar—on Monday, 23rd November, about a quarter past 11, the witness Harry Stillman fetched me to 1, Ettrick Street—I went immediately, and got into the room about half-past 11—the deceased was lying on her face in the bed, with the lower part of her body down to a little above the knees uncovered—I examined her—she was cold, and had been dead from an hour and a half to two hours—there was a great quantity of blood in the bed, and I saw some blood on her right hand, I think—I then sent for the police, and saw them find the blade of the dagger under the pillow—the handle was found, I think, on the floor—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—the wound in the neck was from left to right, cutting through the whole of the tissues down to the vertebrae; it was a stab first, and then the knife was drawn right across, nearly severing the head from the body—death must have been almost instantaneous.

I have done nothing; I have been with these here," referring to Plank and another man, "for the last two hours; I have been with them all the evening," and Plank and the other man said, "Yes, he has been with us all the evening"—Davis was taken into custody; Plank was not taken—I went with Davis and the constable to the station—as we were going Davis said, "Oh, I know what you want</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Philip Henry Holland, of Heath Rise, Hampstead; he is a great invalid—I keep a banking account of my own at Hampstead Brach of the London and South-Western Bank—the prisoner was constantly employed in the house doing odd jobs—there were no other workmen—he kept his tools in a cupboard under the kitchen stairs—when my pass-book came back from the bank if there was a fire, I tore the cheques up and put them in the fire—the waste paper was generally put by the servants in the cupboard where the prisoner kept his tools—I kept my cheque book in an unlocked desk in the drawing room—my pass-book was returned at the beginning of July, and among the cheques returned was one to my brother for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one to Mrs. Paterson—I received about the same time a letter from Mrs. Paterson, which I tore up and put in the waste paper basket—this</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of it—on 7th October I ordered the prisoner to put up a curtain bar in the drawing room, which he did, and I afterwards paid him for it—on 10th November I discovered by my pass-book that I had overdrawn, and I saw in it two cheques for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn to Paterson, and I said "Why, that is Parker's writing"—I had been accustomed for four years to seeing his writing—the endorsements are his, to the best of my belief—this is a very close imitation of one of my genuine cheques—on 12th November the prisoner was given in custody, on another charge—I was called down, and he said "You know I never took the value of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of your house"—I said "You have also forged my name"—I did not hear what he said—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has my name and other names on it; it is Parker's writing—this is a letter which was addressed to me and thrown in the waste paper basket; on the back of it here are some memoranda of accounts.</p>

A little after 5 o'clock on 7th November I was with Sharplin, and saw the two prisoners going together up Ludgate Hill and through St. Paul's Churchyard—just as they entered Cannon Street Reid handed something to Williams, who crossed the road and looked into a cafe at No. 3, Cannon Street, Reid remaining on the other side of the road—Williams did not enter there—Reid crossed and joined him; they walked farther up Cannon Street together—Williams left him and looked into the Red Lion public-house, but did not enter—he joined Reid again, and they walked as far as the Skinners' Arms public-house, where Williams left Reid and looked in the door, but did not enter—he spoke to Reid, crossed the road, and went into No. 40, the Aerated Bread Company's shop—he came out with a small paper bag in his hand—Sharplin immediately went in the shop—Williams turned to the right and walked to the corner of Queen Street; Reid walked down on the other side—Sharplin came out, and from what he said to me we watched the two prisoners—Williams crossed and joined Reid—we went up to them; I caught hold of Reid, and Sharplin caught hold of Williams—I said, "We are police officers; we shall take you in custody for being concerned together in uttering a counterfeit half-crown at a shop up the street"—Reid said, "I don't know what you mean"—he tried to get his hands into his pockets, but I pushed him into the road and called a con<lb/>stable on the opposite side to assist me to take him to the station, where I said, "Have you any more?"—he put his hand in his right-hand coat pocket and pulled out this piece of paper, and these four coins dropped on the floor—I put my hand in his right-hand coat pocket and found these two coins wrapped in this piece of paper—I said, "These are bad"—he made no reply—I also found on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze and a number of small articles—on Williams I found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, a number of small articles, two buns, and a silk handkerchief—when told the charge Reid made no reply—Williams said, "I met this man at Ludgate Circus," pointing to Reid, "I did not know him before; we walked together up Ludgate Hill to Cannon Street; when in Cannon Street I asked him to have a drink, and he said, 'No, I am going to</p>

I was with Outram on Ludgate Hill—I have heard his evidence, it is correct—I saw Williams enter No. 40, Cannon Street, and buy something from the young lady behind the counter—when he came out he had a small paper bag—I went in the shop and spoke to Miss Rowlands, who showed me this coin marked "G"—I bit and bent it, my teeth sank in it—I handed it back to her, went out, spoke to Outram, and we followed and took the prisoners—I said to Williams, "You will be charged with being concerned with this man (Reid) with uttering a bad half-crown in the shop over the way"—he said, "I don't know this man, I have never seen him before in my life"—I took him to the station, where he was searched—I went back and received this half-crown from Miss Rowlands.</p>

I am single, and live at 42, Collodion Street—I have been acquainted with the prisoner about two years—I have been living with him 10 weeks at Collodion Street and some weeks at another place, about six months altogether, not always sleeping with him; some<lb/>times I did, some weeks he would not sleep there at all, but generally on a Saturday night—he was barman with his brother, and lived at his place—he was in the habit of sleeping there, except on Saturdays, when he slept with me—he paid my rent—on Wednesday, 22nd October, he slept with me at Collodion Street—before that day we had had quarrels about a girl named Eva Walker; I was jealous of her—we had no quarrel on the Wednesday, we went to bed about half-past 9; we were on perfectly friendly terms then—I was awoke by a pain in my throat, and I saw blood coming down my night dress—the prisoner was lying with his face towards me—the bed was against the wall, he was lying next the wall; I was on the outside, lying on my side, with my face towards him—it was a double bed, a bed for two persons—I did not notice anything with regard to him then—I said "What is the matter?"—he said "I have cut your throat, you won't die; come back and let me cut it more"—I was in bed at that time—I told him I must call somebody, and I got out of bed and went to the door to call Mrs. Evans—I threw him a towel before I called her—he asked me to throw him something, but I never noticed that his throat was cut till after I had called Mrs. Evans—he threw the towel round his throat—I did not ask him what he wanted it for—I saw a knife in his hand as soon as I woke up, before I got out of bed; I can't say whether it was open or shut—I heard a click, as if it was being shut, because it was a new knife—I told him to throw it out of bed; I did not see what he did with it—I saw him throw it away after I got out of bed, before he asked for the towel—I was then sitting on the foot of the bed; it was during the time I was calling the landlady—she had been in the room once, and she had to go out again to get a light—it was while she had gone for the light that the prisoner threw it away—it was not able to see whether it was open or shut—he threw it out of his right hand; I could not say where it went—when the landlady came in without the light I said "I am dying"—she said "Nonsense, wait till I get a light"—when she came back with the light I was still sitting in the same position at the foot of the bed—the prisoner was lying in bed; he had not got out at all—when the light came I saw that the towel I had thrown to the prisoner was saturated with blood; it was round his throat—he said nothing—the policeman came—before he came Mrs. Evans said "What is the matter? whatever has he done?" and he said "I have done it, fetch the doctor"—Mrs. Evans then went to dress her<lb/>self, and her husband came into the room, and the man and woman in the front room next to us; their name is Pemberton—Mrs. Pemberton was taken in fits, and had to be taken back to her own room—I kept</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman in the London Central Meat Market, and live at 18, Enfield Road, Kingsland—in October last I saw an advertisement in a daily paper for a manager of a depot in the Commercial Road, and I applied to Messrs. Collins, Chancery Lane, who referred me to the prisoner—I wrote this letter of 30th April. (<hi rend="italic">Applying for the situation, giving references, and stating that he was prepared to deposit the required cash security.</hi>) The advertisement mentioned a cash security—in reply I received a letter dated 2nd May, signed "S.J. Hennis," written on the back of a circular. (<hi rend="italic">This said that he was willing to appoint him manager, as he personally knew one of his references; that he had agreements with two silica companies, the Imperial Silica Stone Company and the Silica Paint Company; and asking him to call on Messrs. Collins.</hi>) On 6th May I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Asking what arrangement he had made with Messrs. Collins.</hi>) On 7th May I went to Messrs. Collins, and I then sent this telegram: "Have seen Messrs. Collins this morning and completed arrangements; they will send you a letter"—the prisoner telegraphed a reply the same day—I received this letter of 8th May from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had specimens of silver ore in several museums, and that he would be in London on Saturday or Monday. Another letter, of the 9th made an appointment for Tuesday at Collins's.</hi>) On 12th May I met the prisoner at Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">In this agreement the prisoner was described as constituting the Globe Silica Company.</hi>) I told him I could not get 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that moment, but I would get a deposit on account—I gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the receipt was endorsed on the agreement—I believed the representations he made in his verbal statements and the prospectus, and that induced me to part with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 13th I went to the Commercial Road Basin and made inquiries—I found no office whatever belonging to the defendant or any trace of him—on 13th May I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had arranged at Chester for the storage at the Commercial Road branch up to 50 tons, and requested the prosecutor to meet him next day at Collins's, when other arrangements could be made.</hi>) I met him next day at Collins's, and a day or two after I went with him to Regent's Park Basin, where he introduced me to the dock officials as his manager—he showed me a shed where the silica was to be deposited, and suggested that I should live in the Commercial Road—we went to a public-house in the neighbourhood, where he showed me a copy of the lease of this hot lake, saying he had left the original behind him—I have never acted as manager, I have had no opportunity—I know</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Mentioning the 60l. deposit, and stating that someone else was seeking the situation, and enclosing a printer's proof of a circular.</hi>) Then I received another letter making an appointment for 4 p.m. on 31st August at Liverpool Street—I met the prisoner, and we adjourned to the Broad Street waiting-room—he showed me what he called vouchers, a lease of some property in Merioneth, a plan, several railway companies' invoices, printed extracts from a book describing the locality, and this document: "Produce and workings of Cwm Bychan"—I went through all the vouchers; they gave me a general idea of the work, but I came to no conclusion—he showed me these circulars—he said several times he had several offices—I wrote this post-card "H" to the effect that I was after a situation, and wished him to decide, after several interviews—on the afternoon of 2nd September I again saw the prisoner, and he repeated what he had said at former interviews as to the nature of the business—he showed me a copy of an agreement, which I agreed to, subject to certain letters being interpolated with it—at the next interview I told him I required my appointment in writing, and drafted one on this—he gave me this memorandum, which sets forth the advantages of the business—on 4th September I saw him at Broad Street Station when he brought the agreement, and a duplicate, in which he agrees to take me as manager at Commercial Road, and I am to pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a guarantee of fidelity—we then went to the King's Arms billiard-room, where the agreement was read over, and we each signed a part—I then gave him. this cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by my wife on the London and County Banking Company in his favour—it was crossed, and "and Co." written on it—when I gave it him I told him that as I had only his word to depend on, and as the money was in my wife's name, I should like it to remain for a month until I began to draw some money, and he agreed—he repeated that an office had been taken at 276, Commercial Street, and we were to have goods there—he gave me a promissory note for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this letter from him dated 5th September asking for another cheque, as the one he had was obliterated by the erasure "and Co."—I saw him on the 7th; he gave me back the cheque, and I gave him another, and arranged with him that it should not be cashed for a month—I asked him who his bankers were—he said the London and Scottish—I knew such a bank in London or Scotland, and remarked I was very glad—after that I went to 276, Commercial Road, and could not gain access; no one was there—it appeared uninhabited—it had the appearance of a private house—I wrote to the prisoner about my visit, and saw him on 8th September at 276, Commercial Road—when I explained I could not get in he said he would go with me to the house—I expected to go in with him, but as the door opened he pushed in, and the door closed, and I was left on the step—on coming out he appeared to be much surprised,</p>

               <p>I went past 125, Blenching Crescent, and was attracted by a light in the area window—I listened, and heard some one moving about inside—the window was open about two inches from the bottom—I knocked at the front door—Mr. Sabine answered it—I spoke to him—I left him in the area, and went down the stairs into the kitchen—when I opened the kitchen door I saw two men getting through the front kitchen window, one of those was Glare, the other got away—I was about to pursue them when I saw Boswell hiding behind the scullery door—I said "What are you doing here"—he said "All right; I will come quiet"—I took him upstairs, through the front door, into the front garden, where I saw Claire detained by Mr. Sabine—I held them till I got assistance; they struggled a little, not very much—I took them to the station—I blew my whistle; another policeman came, and we took them to the station—Boswell said at the station "I found the window open, and lifted it up, and got in; I said to my mate 'Come along,' because he did not want to"—I found on Boswell these two knives, this key, which the servant spoke to as belonging to the scullery door behind which he was, this piece of coal, which is carried by this class of people for luck, and two or three silent matches—nothing was found on Claire—I went back to the prosecutor's house and examined the window—I found marks on the sashes by the catches, which could be done by either of these knives—I found a hat in the garden; it did not belong to the prisoners—I had seen a third man go away, and a man has been taken since, and is under remand now.</p>

I am warehouseman in the employ of Mr. Sutton, of 10, Bow Churchyard—it is my duty to lock up the place when I leave it—on Saturday, the 28th November, a little after 3, I left the place safe, and on Monday morning I found that an entry had been made through a window at the back; it had been closed on the Saturday, first by a pair of catches and then two heavy shutters lined with iron, pulled together from the side, and then a bar falls into a catch securing the whole—I missed 65 1/2 dozen boxes of Beecham's pills, value rather more than 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am station sergeant at Thames Street Police-station—on the 28th November, between 11 and 12 p.m., Sutherland gave me information in consequence of which I went to Bow Churchyard and examined the premises—I found that the shutters had been forced, and the marks on them corresponded with this jemmy; the catch had also been forced from the window, and a ladder belonging to the warehouse had been placed on the outside of the window ledge on to a low roof—at that time I was unable to say whether the prisoner had been concealed there or had broken in, but I found marks on a well and on a water pipe leading from the low roof to the wall.</p>

I have done nothing"—on taking them back I saw this padlock, with this key in it, drop from underneath Phawsey's coat—it is about the same size as the other—I then took them to the station, and went back and examined the door, and found that the staple on one side where the padlock went through was wrenched round—there were two dents in the woodwork behind the hasp, and inside the lock were several marks where the poker had been used, and the brass scutcheon was bent—I found on Hilliard a box of silent matches and a pocket knife—nothing was found on Brown—this is the broken hasp (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this house projects 3 or 4 feet farther than the railway—I observed them loitering there for six or seven minutes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 331). On 11th December, about 7 p.m., I was watching, by Sergeant Wright's orders, Messrs. Lynch's premises (they are large druggists' sundry-men), and saw Chambers, who was employed there, leave—he had a parcel with him, and his pockets appeared to be bulky—I watched him—he went to Aldersgate Street Station and took a ticket to Bishopsgate—he there met Seagrave, with whom he shook hands and crossed into No. 199, a public-house—it was quite dark—they had something to drink, and talked for a few minutes—Chambers then in front of the bar took out of his pocket one of these boxes and gave it to Seagrave, who put it in his outside pocket—Chambers took out this box from another pocket, and Seagrave put that in his other pocket—after talking a few minutes they walked down</p>

               <p>to the picture shop; Chambers went in, leaving Seagrave outside—Chambers came out with this parcel containing 10 of these boxes, each containing a dozen toothbrushes, and after talking to Seagrave for a few minutes gave them to him—Seagrave put his hand in his pocket and gave him something in return—they then went into the same public-house again, had another drink, waited a few minutes there, then stopped talking a few minutes on the pavement, shook hands, and left each other—I was in plain clothes—I followed Seagrave into the North London Rail way-station, where I stopped him—I said, "lam a police officer, I want to know what you have got there"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "It is no use your telling me that, I have been watching you; where did you get it from?"—he said, "I got it from a man named Chambers"—I said, "Who is Chambers?"—he said, "A man that works for Lynch in Aldersgate Street"—I said, "What are they?"—he said, "Brushes"—I said, "Where is them two boxes you had in the public-house?"—he took these out of his pocket and said, "These are them"—I asked him what he paid for them—he said "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Chambers owed me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," making it 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he was to give for them—I said, "I shall have to take you to the station"—he said, "Don't you do that, for God's sake, if you do you will ruin me"—I said, "There is a mark on the brushes"—he said, "I said to Chambers 'There is a mark on them;' and he said 'That don't matter, that is all right' "—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nothing relating to the charge.</p>

I want to know what you have got there; I am a police officer"—the prisoner did not say "I don't know" before I said I was a police officer—I said "Where did you get it from?"—he said "Of a man named Chambers"—that is what I said at the police-court—he said he did not know from whom he got it, and the second time I asked him he said "From Chambers"—I had to ask him twice before he told me—my note of the conversation is at the office—he gave me Chambers's correct address on his own card at one when I asked him for it—he gave me his business card with his correct address—he is a dealer in all kinds of medical bottles and all sorts of things—I have never seen any tooth brushes there—he said he would give me anything not to take him to the station because his wife was about to be confined, and it might kill her—I went to his house and saw her that night; it was true; she was on the eve of confinement</p>

I am foreman at Martin and Sons, milk purveyors, and keep a book—prior to the 20th November I had com<lb/>plaints from my customers of the non-delivery of milk, and on the 28th November I was opposite the Wickham Arms in a shop, keeping a look out, at about 6.15 a.m.—I saw one of our men, named Pooley, leave a can marked "No. 5, J. Martin and Sons," at the Wickham Arms—he left it outside the side door on the step—it contained, according to my book, one quart—I saw the prisoner drive up in Crutcher's cart to within three doors of the Wickham Arms—I saw a boy named Richard Burke come to the Wickham Arms, where the can was, and pick it up—I followed him, and spoke to him—the prisoner was about one and a half yards off—I asked the boy where he got the milk from in the can, and he hesitated, and then said "The beershop"—I told him I should take im back to the place—he said "He sent me, Crutcher's man," point<lb/>ing to the prisoner in the cart—the man drove off—I afterwards went to 24, Brockley Road, and made inquiry there—this can (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), marked No. 8, is ours—this, as well as No. 6, were found at Crutchers place—this one was found amongst the prisoner's cans by Mr. Crutcher—he had no right to any cans of ours, or to take any milk from the boy.</p>

I am a hop-factor, carrying on business at the Hop Exchange Buildings, Borough—I have known Webster about 10 years, and lately as a member of the firm of Richardson and Webster, hop merchants, in the Borough—in May, 1884, I had a small transaction with them, which they paid for duly—from that time up to November, 1884, I had no dealings with them—on or about 18th or 19th November, 1884, Webster came and brought a hop sample, and said he wanted to buy about 20 bales of hops equal to that sample, and to match the colour as nearly as possible—he said that by that sample he had sold a quantity of hops to a brewer—they were of a yellowish tinge—the yellow are inferior to the green as a rule—I offered him green, which I considered better, but he would not have them—he selected some to the amount of 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he beat me down in price—he said he had had a certain price offered by the brewer, which would leave him only a very small profit on the price he paid me, which was 83<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believed his statement—he received delivery orders for the hops he selected, and they were ultimately delivered on those orders—I sent the invoice in the ordinary course—we are creditors on the estate for the amount, less the dividend which I have received, 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—if necessary I can give the marks of the hops by re<lb/>ferring to my books—I know Mr. Ashby, of the Borough—he is not a brewer, he is a hop-factor—in consequence of information I went to Ashby's, and made inquiries about some of the hops I had sold to Webster—I sold them at rather a low price; under the market price—I was pre<lb/>sent at a private meeting of creditors early in December—Webster was there—I did not see any statement of affairs presented by him as of 1st December, 1884—I saw Webster after the meeting, and asked him why he had given me to understand that those hops were for a brewer, when I learnt afterwards they were for Mr. Ashby—he said the brewer had</p>

I had known Webster some years, as a hard-working, respectable man—I remember the firm of Richardson and Webster being started on the death of Richardson's father—the business was in a great measure thrown upon Webster, Richardson was not much assistance—I cannot say anything about his driuking, I do not know—I have made myself conversant with the nature of the business carried on by Richardson and Webster—the indebtedness to me in 1882 was in my opinion the result of misfortune—I received bills from them in reference to hops bought from me—the particulars of the transactions with Kitchiner I know nothing of—I took the bills from Kitchiner in pay<lb/>ment of goods; they were accepted by Richardson and Webster—I did business with them for four years, to the amount of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, up to 1882—since then I have been on friendly terms with Webster—I sold them a few goods in 1884—they warehoused hops with me—I have from time to time discussed with Webster the state of his affairs—he said that in time he believed he would be able to pay me—he came to mo before the meeting of creditors, to speak to me about the matter—between 1882 and 1884 I sold them large parcels of hops—I knew that they were doing business with brewers in good position—the season of 1884 was a very lamentable one; there was a general depression of trade and a large fall in the value of hops—when the new hops come in the old ones get put aside, and would be very much depreciated and more difficult to sell—at the end of 1884 there was a great fall in the price of hops—when Webster came to me he told me he had been served with a writ for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think that I had hops warehoused for them then, I am not sure, there might have been some, at any rate a very small quantity—Herring and Co. may have been men<lb/>tioned as an asset—at the second meeting something was said about stock at Birmingham—I do not remember what value was put on it—Mr. Sendall was there—I think I saw a list of the stock at Birmingham—I do not remember an offer to transfer everything to the creditors—I think they offered to transfer all the assets to us, whatever they might be—there was some dispute about Steinberg's debt—the English creditors would have been willing to take what was offered properly secured, but the foreign creditors declined—no security was offered—I believe they offered to pay so much down, and the rest over an extended time—there was a suggestion that it would be secured by Mrs. Richardson, that we said we would take; that falling through the thing went into bank<lb/>ruptcy—I do not think he has conducted himself fairly and honestly to his creditors; I think he has been very irregular in his transactions in every shape and form, not only in the way the books were kept, but in every possible way—no books of any moment were kept—I have not ascertained that a great part of the business was Richardson's depart<lb/>ment—I should say Richardson was quite capable of keeping books, but</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stork's Hotel, Birmingham, and have an office at 33, Albert Street—I am a commercial traveller; I travelled for Richardson and Webster in England and Ireland in September, 1882—I received no salary, but half a share of profits on the orders I obtained—I acted so up to their failure in September, 1884—in February, 1883, with a knowledge of the firm, I started a small hop business in Union Street, Birmingham, in the name of my wife—the arrangement with the firm was that they were to supply the hops in my wife's name, and I might retail them in small quantities among brewers—the goods which I so received were to be paid for out of the commission I received on the larger orders—I carried on that business in my wife's name up to April, 1884—in the preceding March I had a conversation with Webster, in which I suggested I should have to give up the business, and it was ultimately arranged about May that the business should be carried on, and that I should add to it bottled beer, stout, and other articles required by publicans, and that the title should be the Midland Beer Company—I took a store at 33, Albert Street on 24th May—Richardson and Webster were to pay the rent—I was to manage the business and to receive half the profits, and to draw four guineas a week on account of it—I was first introduced to Herring about Whit Monday, 1884, as from Mr. Webster, and as a traveller for Waterlow and Sons, stationers, of London—Webster introduced me—paper was designed; I had this set of books in the business, I brought them from home—I can't say that this was one of the books I used in the Midland business, it was a similar book; they are certainly books I used—I saw Herring again about the end of June; he said he had come down to assist me in the business—I understood that he was bent by Webster; he did not say he had been sent by any one, he said Webster would be down in the course of a few days, and then would tell me all about it—Webster came, and it was then arranged that Herring was to keep the accounts, and I was to do all the buying and selling, and Herring to assist me as far as was in his power—he con<lb/>tinued to assist me till I went to Ireland on 21st September, leaving Herring behind—I returned on 6th October—I then noticed that Herring had sold some hops at under cost price—I asked him why he had done</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 6th September, 1884, and contained a statement of the business, showing a loss on the trading up to that time of 97l.</hi>) I was not in England at that time, but I received a letter from Webster telling me what the contents were—I saw Webster on 11th October at Birmingham; Herring and Richardson were present—then was an angry discussion about the way the business was going on, and the irregular way in which the accounts were kept, and different things, principally between Webster and myself; it lasted some time, and then Richardson and Webster went out together, and made an appointment to meet me at the Storks Hotel at 2 o'clock—I met them; Herring was not there—it was arranged at that meeting that for the future Herring should be called manager of the business, and keep the accounts, and I was to do the buying and selling—I had previously been manager—Herring came in as soon as the arrangement was made; we went to the railway station together; Richardson and Webster left for London—on 17th October I went to London and saw Webster at his house—on the 18th I saw Mr. Few, the solicitor, with Mr. Webster, with a view of getting an agreement drawn up—I returned with Webster that day to Birmingham, and his daughter, Herring's wife's sister—on the journey down I and Webster discussed the business—not a word was said then about transferring or selling the business to Herring—I left Webster at the station at 7.30, he saying he was going to Herring's house, and an appointment being made to meet early on Monday morning—next day, the 19th, I was writing a letter in the office at Albert Street when Herring came in and said he had just seen Webster off by the train—I expressed surprise, and was going on with my writing, when Herring said he had bought the business, stock, lot, and barrel; that an agreement had taken place on the previous night; that certain money had been paid, but no agreement drawn up, in the presence of Herring's wife and Webster's other daughter, Webster and Herring being also present—he also said Webster had written me to my house explaining what had occurred—I had a house in Herefordshire when off my journeys—I ultimately received this letter in Webster's handwriting.

I have scarcely seen you since my return from Birmingham, but I went down there and so sold the business to Herring"—he said to me, "You know, Morgan, the Birmingham business has been a heavy drag on us; it seemed to be all money going out one way; no doubt it will come in eventually, but we</p>

               <p>thought it would be best to sell the business to Herring, upon whom we can draw bills, which would assist us; it will, however, not make the slightest difference to you"—I continued to assist in the management of the business till I left for Ireland on 2nd November—I travelled for the firm in Dublin till I heard of the failure, and then came back—I drew my commission from London—the stock might have been increased after I left for Ireland; I cannot say—I should say the value of the goods and stock at the date of the transfer was very nearly the same as the valuation made by Mr. Howard—I heard of Webster being in custody in September, 1885—I saw Herring at his house in Birmingham—he brought down papers and gave them to me—amongst them were these books—there were a set of books kept at the Midland Beer Company—I cannot say if this is the cash book; it was similar to this—174 pages are torn out of this—a cash book was kept at the Midland Beer Com<lb/>pany up to the time I went away—it was labelled "cash-book" outside—he gave me a waste book to make up my commission in—I took the books to my solicitor, and they were given to the trustee—in the waste book, under date of October 10th, 1884, I see I sold on behalf of the Midland Beer Company ten pockets of hops to Mr.Evans, Letchfield Road—that was before the transfer—it came to rather more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Foster; there is no mention of that 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in any cash book or in any cash account filed in the Court—I was the petitioning creditor in Herring's estate as trustee of the estate of Richardson and Webster—the date of the petition is 10th September, 1885—he has been adjudicated bankrupt on that petition—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his statement of affairs signed by him—the liabilities are 15,088<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the assets 1,508<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—442<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the assets are book debts—there is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rough stock—the date is 23rd October, 1885—according to his statement 1,135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due to myself as trustee of Richardson and Webster—Herring's books are in my possession; they are the ordinary books—I have taken out the purchases made by Richard<lb/>son and Webster in September, October, and November—those goods are not all unpaid for; you will find each item is explained; that includes Needham and Crick.</p>

               <p>know that they had made an offer—I do not know that the only reason<lb/>able offer went off, on account of a question of security—I was not told that the creditors were offered the business at Birmingham and the stock and book debts—I know that Mr. Sendel, an accountant, had been employed, because I had to pay his charge—he prepared the statement of affairs at the private meeting; I knew nothing about it; I did not think it concerned me—I do not know what the nature of the affair was, or why it went off—I examined the books when I took control—a man named Gardner kept them, but Webster appeared to know more of their contents than anybody else—Richardson did not attend to matters in the office, I understand that he did the travelling, and Webster remained in town—Richardson solicited orders from the customers, and I believe Webster bought—I believe the business was originally Richardson's father's, and he came into it, and Webster was taken into partnership—I cannot swear to Richardson's writing in the books—I examined him on March 23rd and made a report—I gave my instructions to Mr. Lea, and he used his discretion under the guidance of Counsel as to the examining of Richardson further—I only ceased my examination because Webster seemed to know more about the business than Richardson—he had to refer to Webster, and I considered that Webster could give us more information; therefore it was considered better to examine Webster first—I made no proposal to either of them that their relations should find money to stop this, nor did any one by my instructions—I have got money from Richardson's relations—both Mr. Lea and myself advised the Committee that they should not accept the sum without submitting it to the Court, and having the sanction of the Court, and it was sub<lb/>mitted to the Court—Mr. Grain did not advise me to take 500<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> I got 500<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> I believe it came from Richardson's mother; that was not that he should not be examined—I think his examination had ceased then—the condition was that the payment of the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be held over till he got his discharge, and it was submitted to the Court—I made no report—I can't tell you when he got his discharge; the file of the Court will show—I was there and gave Mr. Woolf instructions in the absence of Mr. Lee—I left the matter entirely in the hands of the Court—I remember when Richardson came up for his examination and when he passed—no question was put about the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being paid—I prefer that you should look at the shorthand writer's notes—I made a report with a view to a prosecution, and got Counsel's opinion, upon the transcript which you nave in your hand—Mr. Grain gave his opinion, and Mr. Woolf also—the prosecution was taken up when the Registrar made the, order—the Registrar was present at all the public examinations and at some of the private ones—there was no stock in trade, but they put down the stock as worth 2,335<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not got possession of some of it—I have realised between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stock estimated to have cost 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was estimated to produce 6,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the stock was hops—what I have got passession of is estimated to produce 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took possession of the Birmingham stock; that is estimated to produce about 400<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> the estimated cost of it as set out in this statement is 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not ascertained that there has been an immense fall since December—the market was falling when I took possession of the hops, and I was advised not to force them on the market—I consider that matters got better—I hold some still, but I have sold the bulk of them</p>

               <p>—I can't swear to Richardson's writing or figures—I did not ascertain whether he exercised a supervision over the books, or ticked or checked the entries—I heard what the Registrar said about Mr. Webster being examined on the accounts—the Birmingham stock was estimated to cost 1,100<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> some of it was sold for 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I have some stil—when I became trustee I sent my partner down Birmingham, and he was refused possession by Mr. Herring—I do not know that Richardson, and Webster had offered to hand over the business to their creditiors in December—the accounts which they filed were all prepard by an accountant; the same accounts were signed by both partners—I asked for a further deficiency account, and it was furnished to me prepared by Mr. Sandell—Mr. Barton was acting for Richardson—between September 7th and December the amount of business shown is 9,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the deficiency account—I expressed myself satisfied with these accounts and papers, and Richardson was allowed to pass—I find that Webster put money in from time to time, and his account is debited with the sums during 1884 which he brought in—on September 2nd I find 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d.;</hi> September 16th, 347<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are large contra items on the other side about the same dates—Ionly knew of his borrowing money and paying heavy interest on it from the examination at the private meeting—he was asked the name of the man to whom he paid the 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said,"Sheldrake"—this 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is debited to the trade ex<lb/>penses account—there is and erasure, and "J.W."is put against the very next item—that goes to his private account, but this one does not—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is drawn to interest—I should say that is in Webster's writing—I believe these two cheques are his writing—75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has entered against it,"Furniture, J. W's expenses"—refers to the cash account—from information at my disposal I agree with Mr. Tucker that Herring's indebtedness was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., subject three or four items on the other side, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and three bills of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; that increased the cost to 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one has been dishonoured since—Mr. Tucker offered me the Birmingham business subject to my paying the liabilities—that was an insane propsition—after May, Herring assigned his business—I found that the assignment was prejudicial to the estate, I objected, but it was never offered to me to assign; the condition was that I should pay his liabilities, and take over the business for my debt, but I should have been worse off than I am now—Richardson told me that he went to Bir<lb/>mingham at the time Herring was left in possession of the business—I don't think he said that he went down to shut the doors of the place and stop the business, but he went down to see why they did not get money out of the business—I did not know that it had been a loss; Howard's report does not say so—it is not so disastrous a report as to expect no money from it—I understood that an arrangement had been made to leave Herring to carry on the business as long ago as March.</p>

I believe in addition to what I have quoted—300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Herring was to buy, and 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be Richardson and Webster's property, and the book debts—the Registrar ordered the prosecution on my report, based on Counsel's opinion and the shorthand notes—I believe Mr. Lee submitted a case—I did not take possession of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stock estimated to produce 600<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> nor did I sell part realising 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have taken a portion of the Birmingham stock, not the whole, but about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth; the date appears in the depositions—no particulars are given in the statement of affairs—I estimated that it would realise 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than I have already realised—I sold it on May 19th by public auction on the premises—I do not know whether hops had fallen considerably then—I put a reserve on—I should not have realised more by private contract, and I was quite satisfied with the prices realised—I had a long correspond<lb/>ence with Mr. Tucker, Mr. Herring's solicitor, and the offer was made in this letter.

I walked on down the hill when the police stopped us at the bottom. He asked what was up. He was out of wind. He said, "Hold on, there is a fire." I said, "I know nothing about it."</p>

I took two or three matches out of my pocket, struck them, lighted my pipe, threw the matches down, and walked on. When we got to the bottom the police made their appearance. We asked what was the matter. They said we had made a fire on the heath. We said we knew nothing about any fire. They asked us to go back. We did, and when we got back the sergeant knocked the fire out with a stick. We are quite innocent of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Buckland, Surrey—on Monday, 16th November last, about a quarter to five in the evening, I was finishing my tea when the prisoner came in to tea, and said "One of your haystacks is alight"—I went out immediately, and found some men there, and immediately sent for the prisoner—I saw that one of the stacks was alight at the corner end; that was the one that was farthest from my house—the pump is at the farther end of the yard, beyond the other stacks—after some two or three hours we managed to put out the fire—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the claim for damage allowed by the Insurance Company—after it was all finished I went into the kitchen—the prisoner brought in something for my cupper, and I then said to her "How did you know of it?"—she said "I heard some one calling, 'Fire!' down the garden"—I said "How did you know it was one of the haystacks?"—she said "I did not know; I did not say it was one of the haystacks"—I said "You did," and then I repeated to her the words she said as she gave the alarm—I sent and informed the police, and Inspector Gray came over the same night—nothing was said then in the presence of the prisoner that night—next day Superintendent Lambert came over from Dorking to see me on the matter, and then the prisoner was questioned in my presence—she was asked to account for what she was about at the time the fire took place—she admitted nothing—she was asked if she had been near the haystack—she said she had not been near the haystack—she afterwards said she had only been out for some wood for fire-lighting, and then I and Lambert said "You must have passed the stack to have gone to and fro to have fetched the wood"—she adhered to her statement; she would admit nothing, and there was an end of it as regards that day—on the 18th, in the evening, Inspector Gray came to make further inquiries—he had appointed the time 10 o'clock—he did not see her—on the 18th I was pawing through the</p>

I don't know how I came to do it; I never thought of it before; it came into my head all at once"—I had not said anything to her before she told me this—I had not referred to it since the inspector came—I had not asked her any questions—she was in my service at the time as a general servant—I kept but one—she was under notice to leave for misconduct—I had given her notice a week previous.</p>

I called on Phillips on 13th November, heard a communication from him, and followed him into Broad Street, Commercial Road—he went into the Glasshouse, and after a little while came out with the three prisoners; they went under a gas lamp, and I saw them examining something—I saw Phillips put something in his pocket; he came towards me, pointed to Hyett, and said "That is the man"—I seized Hyett, and Ellis and Scott ran away—Hyett struggled very much, took something from his pocket and tried to put it into his mouth—I snatched it from him, and put it in my pocket, and said "Where did you get that watch?"—he said "I shan't tell you"—they struggled, and used every effort in their power to get away—Scott was brought back by a uniform man, and when we had just entered the station Scott said "I bought it at Johnson and Dymond's; I deal in them"—Hyett said "I bought them at Johnson and Dymond's under the hammer; I am a jewellery dealer; I have plenty of such goods"—Scott said "I never came over here before to-night"—Sergeant Ward said "How much did you give for the watch?"—Hyett said "I decline to give you any information, I don't want to sell it"—I pulled from my pocket the paper he endeavoured to put into his mouth; it was two Bank of Engraving notes and a gilt farthing—he said "Oh, they are nothing, I would not give a penny for them"—I said "It will be necessary for me to make inquiry at Johnson and Dymond's; when did you buy this?"—he said "Last Friday, a week ago"—this was on a Thursday—I searched Hyett and found 14 pawn tickets, a metal chain, a pair of metal ear-rings, and several scraps of paper; and on Scott five pawn tickets—Hyett gave his address, 8, North Street, Cambridge Heath—I went there and searched and found this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has a silver bow—it is marked 18/18✗, and two marks which I don't understand—I took two pawn tickets which I found on Hyett and redeemed the property—I redeemed this ring; it is marked with an anchor—that is genuine; I have seen several rings like it—I have been round to several pawnbrokers, who produced rings with the same mark pawned for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—next day, as Hyett left the Court, he turned round to me and the prosecutor and said "I told him it was silver, and he knew it"—they were merely charged with unlawful possession of the watch—I did not think the marks were forged.</p>
