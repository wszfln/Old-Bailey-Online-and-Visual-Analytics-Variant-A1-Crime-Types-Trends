               <p>Hawkins. Yes, I have several times. - I am a baker by trade, I have been a master baker and lived within 5 miles of Bath but have had misfortunes in the world.</p>
               <p>Talbot. I believe his brother and he get their living by gaming and selling brass rings for gold ones. <rs id="t17440113-3-verdict15" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you remember what goods were in that truss?</p>
               <p>Hodges. I have a memorandum of them here.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that memorandum taken from?</p>
               <p>Hodges . This is a copy that was taken from my day book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver them with your own hands to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hodges . I delivered them to him with my own hands .</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the truss?</p>
               <p>Hodges. There were some ribbons, &amp;c. which are not in the indictment; five pieces of white Irish linen, 113 yards; one piece of long lawn, which is called 32 yards of German linen; two pieces of cambrick; two pieces of printed linen; and two pieces of printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these goods stitched up in?</p>
               <p>Hodges . They were stitched up in what we call hessen .</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Prisoner ordered to carry them?</p>
               <p>Hodges . He was to carry them to the Red Lion in Aldersgate-Street, they were directed to Robert Shepherd, of Donnington .</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you missed the goods?</p>
               <p>Hodges . It might be from a fortnight to a month, I cannot be certain, My correspondent wrote to me to know whether I had sent him the goods, and if I had, how he might come at them. I spoke to the Prisoner, and asked him concerning them: he said he had entered them in his book, (for I did not suffer him to scribble in my journal ) and that he had delivered them as I had ordered him; and I thought he was out of fault, and gave directions to sue the person he delivered them to; but having some farther information, I got a search warrant and went to Mr. Ferguson's in Barbican . and found some of my goods there, and Mr. Ferguson was so honest that he searched all his house, and sent me some goods that I could not have found.</p>
               <p>- [The goods were produced by Mr. Hodges , and proved to be his property.]</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the Prisoner's bringing any goods to you, packed up?</p>
               <p>Eales . Yes, - it was to the best of my knowledge stitched up, he left it in my kitchen, and desired it might be carried up stairs, and in a few days he came again and said he wanted to speak with me; he came up stairs and said I must do a thing for him or else he was ruined for ever - he belonged to the fire-office; he said he had pawned his coat and badge, and if I did not pawn some things for him, he should be ruined for ever; so he took a knife out of his pocket, cut open the parcel, and took out some things. - the first things he took, to the best of my knowledge, were two pieces of printed linen, he put them into my apron and I went and pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry them?</p>
               <p>Eales. I carried them into Barbican. I do not know the gentleman's name, it went by the name of Stone - I carried them at several times, one was a very beautiful piece, I can stand to that piece.</p>

               <p>Eales. Yes .</p>

               <p>Eales. I had two guineas the first time - I cannot tell how many times I went.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in the whole?</p>
               <p>Eales . I cannot tell - to the best of my knowledge it was about seven pounds .</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with all this money, be it more or less?</p>
               <p>Eales . He had it all. I pawned the things by his direction.</p>

            . December 22, the Prisoner came to my shop and asked me whether I would buy the lid of a tankard, I told him I could not tell, till I had seen it; he showed it me and said, it was his aunt's. I bid him fetch her, he said he would go and fetch her, he came back in about 5 minutes, and said his aunt would not come back with him; I told him I would not buy it without his aunt was present and bid him fetch her, he was gone the second time about six or seven minutes; when he returned, he said his aunt would not come back, but said there was a friend of his that would give him a character. I said I would send for his aunt, I called a porter and sent him to the Bear and Ragged-staff in St. Martin's lane, but she would not come; he sent me to one Mr. Gardner who lives in our neighbourhood, he said his aunt kept a publick house, and he said, that he believed him to be a very honest lad; when he came back again I belive he thought I was going to buy it of him, for he said it was very good of you to enquire into people's characters before you buy things; but said I, this does not satisfy me, I must go to your aunt and know from her own mouth whether it is her's or no. I enquired where his aunt lived, and he said she lived at the White Swan in Long-Acre, but she did not live there, so I secured him, but he would not tell me where he lived till he was in custody, and then he said he lived with Mrs. Stanhope ; I sent to her, she came and brought the other part of the tankard with her and owned it - it weighs 7 ounces and an half.</p>

               <p>Johnson. I cannot tell, I was below stairs, and heard something break; I came up directly, and caught a man's hand in the window, with the caps in his hand.</p>

               <p>Johnson. Burrough's hand; I saw his face through the window, I took hold of the caps while they were in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him and see if you are sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I believe it to be the same man, he in the blue gray, he was on the outside of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see his face then?</p>

               <p>Q. Had he hold of any more caps?</p>

               <p>Johnson. There were some caps drawn through, for my servant found one in the street under the window, and I took it from her; how many they got before I cannot tell, for the window was broke in two places.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was there between the panes that were broke?</p>
               <p>Johnson. There was one pane; there was a showglass with some silver ribbons in it, and they broke one pane to come at that, but they could not get at it for the glass in the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body run away?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I did not see any body run, for I had a great door to open, and before I could get it open they were all gone - I saw no other person but him that I saw through the window - I cried out stop thief, and Thorne was immediately apprehended.</p>

            . I work next door to the place where this robbery was committed, I am a cooper, at the Hoop and Adze, I happened to go out to the door between eight and nine in the evening, and the Prisoners were at Mrs. Johnson's window and about the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see them do?</p>
               <p>Shippey. I will tell you if you please to give me leave. I had no suspicion when I first saw them at all, and I suppose they thought that I should tout them, or hinder them in their design; says he in the blue coat, [Burroughs] Jack, shall we have a pint of beer, or can we have a dream of gin; I made a particular remark of all three of them for then I thought what they were; they went into an alehouse, the Hoop and Adze, and called for a quartern of gin - I looked at the clock, and it was then between eight and nine. Burroughs had his hat flapping over his eyes, that I should not see his face, for I looked very hard at them, and after they had drank their gin, Burroughs gave the accomplice (Thorne) three half-pence to pay for it; when Appleby had got the gin in his mouth he held down his head to spit it out, and the other stooped, and was complaining of his shoes being worn out; and standing pretty near the fire, somebody asked him what made him so cold? He said, If you went as near the ground as I, you would be cold too. After they were gone out of the house, I said, these three fellows look as if they would break their necks in going to Paddington. Mrs. Spriggs, the woman of the house, said she believed they had a mind to rob somebody; said I, I believed they are going to rob Mrs. Johnson . Mrs. Spriggs went out to look, and came in again, and said my heart is ready to burst, there is one of them against Mrs. Johnson's window now, and another on the other side of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174401130008"/> way; and presently Mrs. Johnson cried out, I am robbed . I run out in a hurry and saw the accomplice, I seized him directly, and said, d - n you I know you, and I'll keep you.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know him?</p>
               <p>Shippey . I knew him by the sear in his face - I did not see any of them run away, but I was very quick in catching of him; I carried him, back to the Hoop and Adze , and asked him if he was not ashamed to rob people who work hard for their living? He said he did not come to rob any body; he said that he was going to Smithfield, and came in to drink with the Prisoners , but never saw them before in his life. We secured him, and the next morning had him before a Justice, and hearing of Long Charles , as they call him, his name is

            . On the 4th of this month between 7 and 8 at night, I was sitting in a room joining to my shop, and I thought I heard a noise; I came out and found the shop window open, I thought somebody had been playing the rogue, not suspecting any thing of thieves, but looking down Plumber's-Court I saw a woman, said I, woman or mistress, I cannot tell which, why do you open my sash-window ? I laid hold of her, and found a canister<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174401130009"/> which I knew to be my own; said I, woman, why do you rob me? I took hold of her, brought her to my door, and then she dropped another canister , with a bladder of about 4 pound of snuff; I asked her how she came by them? she said she found them. The Prisoner was very much in liquor, I believe she did not know what she was doing - I knew her before.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take so little for them?</p>
               <p>Clay. Why, those that buy these things always buy good bargains - we divided the money between us in Mrs. Wilson's room, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Wilson ask you how you came by them, or any questions about them?</p>
               <p>Clay. She did not ask any questions, because she knew how we came by them - we told her we were going to get some more things; she said take the dark lanthorn, and see what you can find - she has often bought things of us.</p>

               <p>Pris. Bailey. Was I with you when this robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Clay. You went along with me, and was there all the time; we bought a half-penny-worth of small beer at the chandlers shop in the alley.</p>
               <p>Bailey. Can you bring any body to prove what you swear against me?</p>
               <p>Clay . How should I, there's nobody but Mrs. Wilson who bought the goods of us knows any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Meager. How came you to get knowledge of this Clay?</p>

               <p>Bailey. I never was concerned with him but in one robbery.</p>

               <p>Lyon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you hold it to be lawful to give evidence on your Sabbath?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Yes, we are at liberty to attend to tell the truth upon the Lord's day, as well as any day. I arrived at Amsterdam the 1st or 2d of Oct. and saw the Prisoner there - he was there before me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Not long - I have known him by seeing him in England about three years ago - in Duke's Place.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Prisoner's business.</p>
               <p>Lyon. I don't very well know; I know he had some leather breeches to sell in Holland - I came home with him from the Hague; we had a passport from the Ambassador to come in the packet boat.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you arrive here from the Hague ?</p>
               <p>Lyon. To the best of my knowledge it was the 14th of November at night - I cannot say to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak of Old Stile or New Stile?</p>
               <p>Lyon. It is the English reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Old Stile from the New?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I know there is 11 days difference - we came from the Hague the 4th of Nov. we were 10 days in coming from Holland to England; the Prisoner was sea-sick; I carried him to one Mr. Simpson's to lodge, and he lodged there, and being sick I lent him 8 s. - if I was to meet any body upon the road that was in distress I would do the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you visit him when he was sick?</p>
               <p>Lyon . I never visited him there, Mr. Simpson told me he paid him.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know the day?</p>
               <p>Simpson. Because I deal in money, and I happened to have a good bargain that day, and therefore I remember the day.</p>

               <p>Clavey. I found it the 29th of December.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to find it out?</p>
               <p>Clavey. I had an information from a person that the Prisoner at the bar was an accomplice with a servant of mine, who is indicted for the like offence , and suspected that he had pawned some of my goods: upon this information I desired my apprentice to go to Mr. Price's and enquire whether there was any such thing pawned to him; this Gentleman came to me very handsomly the next morning, and told me that he had such a thing, and the Prisoner was taken up directly; as to his character it is very notorious.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to give him his oath whether I ever pawned any thing to that gentleman.</p>

            , and whether he had at any time pawned any linen at our house. I had some company at my house then, it being in the Christmas week, so I sent my servant to acquaint him that I would let him know in the morning. I examined, and found that there was a parcel entered in my book in the name of Parker; a coat and a remnant of linen, which the Prisoner pledged in the month of September last; I went to him the next morning and told him there was a little remnant of a coarse piece of Irish linen, and that I apprehended it to be the fag end , and thought by that he might satisfy himself whether it was his, and desired him to come to our house to see it; he came to our house, looked upon, and saw some marks by which he knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pledged that to you?</p>
               <p>Price. This was pledged at our house by the Prisoner, he delivered it to me himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Price. I have known the man some time, he bought a watch of me within these twelve months and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I own I pawned the things about five months ago: Mr. Clavey's servant came to me with a coat and a piece of cloth, and he said Mr. Clavey gave him the coat; he said he was going out of town and wanted a little money, and if I could get him half a guinea upon them it would be of some service to him. I told him I would try, and I carried them to Mr. Price's, as I had pawned some things of my own there before, and I pawned them for him to this gentleman, and gave him the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Clavey. There's another material witness, but we think he is sent out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Clavey. Have you seen the Prisoner frequently about your shop?</p>
               <p>Clavey, Yes, he has been in the shop frequently, and I believe oftner than I knew of.</p>

            . About the 20th of December last, I had occasion to look out ten yards of Irish linen for a customer, and I first went to the cut pile as we call it, to see if there was any thing there that would do. I looked out this remnant, and thought it was about 10 yards, and that it would do; when I came to measure it was but eight yards three quarters, and finding the quantity not sufficient, I put it again into the pile: the next morning I looked out a whole piece of cloth, and had a mind to compare it with the remnant I had looked upon the day before, and when I came to look for it it was gone; (I had rebuked my man for carelessness in not puting it into a paper the day before) this being pretty early in the morning, I thought no shoplifter could have got it by any stratagem, and then my suspicion rested upon somebody in the house. I made an enquiry among the Gentlemen in the shop whether any of them had mislaid it, and they said no; then said I, this piece of cloth is absolutely stole, and I will be satisfied what is become of it; the middle apprentice said, Sir, don't be impatient about it, I may find it by and by: we went into the cellar to see if it was there, for my suspicion rested upon the Prisoner, and upon a thorough search we found it under some coolers, or brewing vessels. I took no notice that I had found it, but enquired after it in the family (for I was not fully satisfied that he was the thief though it was there) and in order to find it out I planted my apprentice at night in the dark to have an eye upon him, for if he came with a candle he could see what he did, and I desired a friend of mine to stay with me: the piece was rolled up when he took it, and when it was found it was tied up in a square form. The Prisoner went down into the cellar and moved it from the place where it was; my apprentice was coming up to tell me, and I believe his shoes might crack; says he, he has moved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174401130015"/> it, and I believe he has seen me; I said I must not let him go out of the shop with it, for if he does he will run away. Said I, do you go and get a Constable, and in the mean time Mr. Jupe and I will try if we can get him to confess; we went into the cellar and he had his soul linen about him: said I, what do you do with all this linen, I have a great suspicion that you are a rogue, don't you know that I have been making an enquiry after a piece of linen that is lost out of the shop to day? Do you know nothing of it? He said no, he knew nothing of it. Said I, did not you hide it in this part of the cellar, and take it out from the place where you hid it? He said, no; said I, I think you are a fellow of the most consummate impudence to deny this, for Ralph has seen you do it. My friend interposed and said, friend, I am very sorry for you, I wish you would confess the thing and see if your master will forgive you: I said, Will, if you do not now produce it I will make a thorough search; and if I find it I will send you to Newgate. By that time the Constable came, and then he began to whimper, and he put his hand into a prickle of straw, pulled it out and gave it to me in this flat form it is now. - It was not near the coolers then, it was in another part of the cellar. - I suspected him the more, because he had been a little tardy before: when I told him he must go to Newgate, he begged very hard that he might not be sent there, and said it was the first time he had ever wronged me or injured me in his life. I told him he must go there, and then I bid him pull off his clothes and put on his old frock.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words he said to you when he delivered the bundle to you?</p>
               <p>Clavey. He said it was the first time that ever he had injured me or robbed me in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he made use of the word rob?</p>
               <p>Clavey. Yes, I can safely say he made use of the word rob.</p>
               <p>- Jupe. On the 21st of December about six in the evening, I went to Mr. Clavey's (I had some business with him) and he desired me to go into the compting-house; he said he was about making a discovery of a robbery and desired me to stay; I heard him give directions to his servant to conceal himself and watch the Prisoner; some time afterwards the apprentice came and said, I saw him take it out from under the tubs or coolers, and I saw him take some clothes from under them; says he, I believe he is gone to some other part of the cellar , and has conveyed it away, and the reason he gave his master was, because he brought the candle to the lettice to see if he could see any body. Then Mr. Clavey sent his servant for a constable, and desired me to go down into the cellar with him; the Prisoner was in the cellar, and stood as if he was rolling up some soul linen. Mr. Clavey asked him what he was doing of; he said he was looking up his shirts or linen. Said he, I believe you are a rogue, what is become of the linen that was under the tubs or coolers, I can't tell whether he said tubs or coolers; the Prisoner said he knew nothing of it; said Mr. Clavey, we know you have removed it within these five minutes; a little while afterwards somebody knocked at the door, and Mr. Clavey said I will send you to Newgate as sure as you are alive if you don't give it me; upon that he went to a prickle or a basket of straw, and took it out in such a shape as it is now, and gave it to him; then he charged the Constable with him and ordered him to pull off his livery, and when he had done that, he cried and said he hoped his master would forgive him, for he had never wronged him before in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. This time that you speak of, was this the time that Mr. Clavey mentions.</p>
               <p>- Jupe. The very same time.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Clavey, on the 21st of December in the morning, he looked into the Irish pile, and said there was a remnant of Irish gone, and asked me if I knew any thing of it; I told him no, but I would look in the shop and endeavour to find it, but I could not; by my master's orders I watched the Prisoner, and about 12 o'clock, or between 12 and one, I saw him put it between two coolers or under the coolers in the cellar; about five o'clock in the afternoon, I went down to look if it was there, and I found it had been removed, in the evening I went by Mr. Clavey's order to watch in the cellar, and in a little time the Prisoner came down with a box of knives to clean; after he had cleaned 3 or 4 of them he went to the coolers and lifted one of them up, and took out a piece of linen (it was half in the paper and half out) and carried it to another part of the cellar. - It was then in a long form, I think he tied it up in this square form; then he went up stairs and came down in about 3 or 4 minutes. I went afterwards and stood upon another pair of stairs that went into the shop, and he put the candle through the lettice of the stairs where I was, and I believe he saw me, but he did not say any thing to me nor I to him. I went to Mr. Clavey to let him know what I had seen, and he ordered me to go for a Constable, and when I came back he fell down on his knees and begged Mr. Clavey to forgive him, and said, it was the first thing that ever he did in his life.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174401130016"/>Q. What were the words he spoke then?</p>
               <p>Hodgkins. I cannot remember the words, but he desired Mr. Clavey to forgive him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask the Prosecutor whether I have not lived with him two or three years, and have been entrusted with money from one part of the town to another?</p>
               <p>Clavey. It is true he has lived with me about two years, but I never entrusted him with money unless it was to go to market, and when the porter has been out of the way, I have sent him with a little parcel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him whether he has not trusted me with his portmanteau and his money?</p>
               <p>Clavey. That was when I was travelling the country and he went as my servant. Perhaps there might be 4 or 500 l. in the portmanteau, but then I was with him, and I don't apprehend that to be trusting him with the money.</p>

I asked him how he came by it ? he gave me but a very light account, such as I could not depend upon . I told him I must stop it till I could get farther information, upon which he was a little rude to me, so I sent for a constable and had him before Justice Hammond , and he committed him to Bridewell for further examination . I advertised the spoon in the daily advertiser, and on Monday Mr. Drake came to my house. I shewed him the spoon, and he owned it to be his property.</p>

               <p>Verney . I missed them about nine or ten weeks ago; I went to her in Clerkenwel Bridewell, and she said she hoped I was not come to trouble her there: I told her, I only desired I might have my things . She said, she had given them to her sister (who is a good honest woman) to pawn them. I found some at Mr Granger's, and the saucepan at another place. I catched her in bed with my servant on Monday last, which frightened me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope it was a maid servant?</p>

            . The Prisoner married my own brother; she brought me this sheet and two plates to pawn about ten weeks ago, and I pawned them to Mr. Granger, the sheet for a shilling, and a groat a piece the two plates. Mrs. Verney came and told me my sister had brought me a sheet and two plates which she had stole; I went and fetched the sheet and throwed it into Mrs. Verney's House; I never was in such a concern in my life.</p>
               <p>Verney. I was abroad, and the sheet was thrown into my shop; the plates I had last night from Mr. Granger.</p>
               <p>Daniel . This is the sheet she brought to me, there was this mark upon it then, Mrs Verney owned it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you pawn a sheet for the use of your brother?</p>
               <p>Daniel. No, indeed; my brother knows nothing of it; my brother is an honest man, he is at sea, I would scorn to say a false thing for my child's sake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They were pawned for the use of my husband when he broke his arm, before he went to sea. <rs id="t17440113-23-verdict121" type="verdictDescription">

            . The beginning of November the Prisoner came to lodge in my house, I lost these things which she had the use of, she went away on a Sunday morning about 5 or 6 weeks ago, she took these goods and the key of the lodging along with her; she sent the key back in a penny post letter, and said she would come and make all things easy, but she did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after she went away that she sent the key?</p>
               <p>Smith. About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know but somebody else had been in the room?</p>
               <p>Smith. The door was locked when I received the key, and when I went in I missed the things. - I never spoke to her till last Thursday was sev'nnight, and then she owned she had pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things let to her as part of the furniture of her lodging?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The pot never was in the room, and she said as I was out of business and was put to some difficulties, that if I could lie without sheets I might make use of them till I could get into business.</p>
               <p>Smith. The pot was in the room when I let it her, I never gave her leave to pawn them. I could have lent her five shillings or a guinea if I had thought proper, without lending her things to pawn. <rs id="t17440113-25-verdict131" type="verdictDescription">

            . On Tuesday the 27th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, there came one to our house to know whether Mrs. Wild lodged in our house, and if I said she lodged in my house, he was to desire my wife or I to come directly to him. He shewed me some clogs that he had bought, he asked me if they were mine, I told him yes. I asked Mr. Pardue whether he had any more, and this young man Matthews went up and brought down what he could find, which was five or six pair more - The Prisoner was afterwards stopped.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Pardue, the Prisoner brought these clogs to my master's shop, my master asked her several questions, and among the rest he asked her where she lived; she said she lived in the country, and that she brought these clogs to town with her to sell. She brought two or three pair one day, and another pair at night, and the next day more, and my master thought by her bringing so many, that she did not come honestly by them, and I went after her to the place where she said she lived, so we came to find it out.</p>

            . On Wednesday morning last my house was broke open, and robbed of goods to a considerable value. I suspected some houses of ill repute that lie on the backside of my workshop, and I got a search warrant to try if I could find any of my goods: I searched the house of Mrs. Beane who is a person of a very ill character, and when I came to search her room there was a sack which was tied up at the mouth. I untied it, and in it there were several pewter pots wrapped up in rags, I suppose to prevent them from rattling; there was a chest of drawers which had pewter pots in each of the drawers, there were a dozen pots in all, there was one in a child's cradle under the things. I asked her how she came by them, and told her she did not come honestly by them, for I saw by the inscription whose property they were; then I sent to the last Witness, and he came and owned them.

            . About the 6th of December, 1742, I bought about 12 tons of hemp of him - to the best of my knowledge it might be to the value of about 330 l. - there was an attachment in the Mayor's Court, about the 10th or 11th of Dec.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body offer themselves to be bail?</p>

             was recommended to me by Mr. Satchel, about the 11th of Dec. - I don't know that I ever saw Moravia's face before that time in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he willing and ready to be bail?</p>
               <p>Bedell. He was very willing; at the instigation of Mr. Satchel, Mr. Moravia went to be bail - about the 17th or 18th of Dec. and was rejected.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you get any other bail?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Moravia apply to you to buy this parcel of hemp?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I think it was the afternoon before Christmas-day, he said he would give me 200 l. for the hemp, and laid down a moidore, but we did not make any agreement then; we met again the 3 d of January at Peele's Coffee-house in Fleet-street, I did not go to meet Mr. Moravia, I went to meet Mr. Robinson, but Mr. Moravia and I finished the agreement then.</p>

               <p>Bedell. I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell the hemp for?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I sold it to the best of my knowledge for a note of 105 l. - payable in 8 days, and a note for 100 lb. weight of India rhubarb, to be delivered upon demand - the major part of the hemp lay at Warner's warehouses in Mincing-lane, they are kept by one Clark, the rest lay at the White-horse in Purpool-lane; that part I sold him lay at Warner's warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. What bill of parcels did you produce at that time?</p>
               <p>Bedell. To the best of my knowledge I delivered a bill of parcels given me by Mr. Owen with his receipt at the bottom of it, we had been drinking of rack punch pretty plentifully, that I cannot very well tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver Mr. Moravia any bill of parcels?</p>
               <p>Bedell. Yes, I delivered a bill of parcels of Mr. Owen's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for you to make a bill of parcels then?</p>
               <p>Bedell. It was not possible for me to make a bill of parcels then, because I could not tell the weight of the hemp. - We went away about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go then?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I went directly home to Grays-Inn-Lane. - I staid there the whole night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Houndsditch that night?</p>
               <p>Bedell. To the best of my knowledge I have not been in Hounsditch these three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Moravia that night after you parted at Peele's Coffee-house?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I saw him no more that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw him again?</p>
               <p>Bedell. The note was made payable in 8 Days, I saw him before the 8 days were out in order to remind him of it, as I wanted money. - I never had a farthing of him, for he said he could not well pay me till he got the hemp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever borrow any notes of him?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I never borrowed one note of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you arrested?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I was arrested the 18th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was you carried to the Fleet?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I believe it was about the 22d.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first time Mr. Moravia came to you?</p>
               <p>Bedell. The 22d was on a Saturday, and then I went to the Fleet, and he came to me the Sunday following - I think it was the 22d of January, I cannot be positive to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you notice of the commission being taken out?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I think the commission was sealed the 24th, and I had notice of it the 27th.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174401130023"/>Q. When was Mr. Moravia so kind as to come to see you again?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I believe it was on Friday the 28th, he might come after my goods, and the notes and every thing I had was seized on.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the two notes then, the note of 105 l. and the note to deliver the 100 lb. weight of rhubarb?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I think they were at my lodging in Gray's-Inn-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of Moravia's waiting on you then?</p>
               <p>Bedell. He said he understood there was a commission out against me, and that all my effects were seized; he said, be of good heart, and I will take your part, for I believe the commission will not stand, and if you will take my advice, I will allow you 2 guineas a week, and put a 1000 guineas in your pocket - he said, he thought it was not a good commission.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did he say he would put in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I cannot tell justly, it was a large sum, I am sure it was 500 l. and he laid down a great deal of gold upon the table; Mr. Ravenscroft, Mr. Robinson's clerk came, and we went into Mr. Helbutt's room, and he took some instructions for an answer in Chancery, but very short; he went away, and came again about four o'clock; Moravia said, he had a summons left him to attend the Commissioners at the Crown-Tavern on Ludgate-Hill, but he could not tell what they wanted with him; there was one Mrs. Burrell a relation of Mr. Helbutt's there, and he desired her to go out of the room; and he wanted me to enter into an agreement with him, and desired me to write down (I think it was) January 3, 1742.

               <p>Bedell. I was like a bird in a cage, and wanted to get my liberty - he would not suffer any body to be by then, he said he was going to the Commissioners; on Sunday morning he came again and said, he had been 7 or 8 hours before the Commissioners, that they had harassed him very much, and that he was obliged to sign the deposition.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what the contents of that deposition were?</p>
               <p>Bedell. He said, if I did not keep up to the contents of that deposition, he and his family would be ruined; and if I did it would be a great deal in my way.</p>

               <p>Bedell. Yes - I believe he was several times with Mr. Moravia and me - I can't tell what he said.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Council produced some papers which they said were a bill of parcels, and orders to the warehouse-keepers to deliver the hemp.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor then?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I was to be sure intoxicated then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in company?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I came into company about 7 o'clock, and parted about 11.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things signed the 1st part of the evening or the latter?</p>
               <p>Bedell I believe they were signed about the middle of the time that we were in company - after we had been there about two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Mr. Robinson then, was not he your attorney?</p>
               <p>Bedell. He had been my attorney: I believe he was every body's attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. You have taken upon you to say that you never was at Mr. Moravia's, is that true?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I was not there during my whole life.</p>
