This robbery took place in the two pair front—I was in the room underneath—I heard no struggle—I saw the prosecutor go up stairs with a policeman—I had been at the house for some time before—I did not see the prisoners run out—the house is a lodging-house—one part is let out to single men, and the other is let out to couples—it is called a brothel—I have seen the prison<lb/>ers go in and out of the house—they are in the habit of going into all the rooms—I let the room in question to two men named Wynn and Squires—I do not know whether one of them is called <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, or whether the pri<lb/>soners are acquainted with those men—I see the prisoners go past the window to go into the house—I do not know which room they go to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman in the service of Messrs. Taylor and Bell, of Bermondsey. On the 27th of September I was in St. Kathe<lb/>rine's Dock, passing through the lock with a barge a little after eight o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner in a ship's boat under the head of a vessel, very unnecessarily in my way—I said to him, "Old <hi rend="italic">Buffey</hi>, shove round the other side of the barge, will you?"—I did not know him before—<hi rend="italic">"Buffey"</hi> is a word we use, and does not mean anything offensive, just the same as "Old fellow"—he told me to take a b----y carrot—I said, "You are a nice man, to be sure"—he said, "So are you a b----y nice man"—I said, "It would not do for you to be a fellow-servant of mine"—he said, "No, so help me God, it would not"—I said, "Well, there is as good a bit of flesh here as there is there, I know"—he then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270023"/>
               <p>said, "I will come and drown you, you b——r"—he came out of the ship's long-boat over my barge cabin-top—I was halfway across the boat—he took hold of me and threw me overboard in a moment, headforemost—I did not expect he was going to do it, or I should have laid down in the boat—I can swim, and came up nearly where I went down, and saw the prisoner a foot or two from where he had been, still in my barge—there was a long staff in my barge, right alongside of him, at his feet—if he had put that out, it would have assisted me in recovering from the water—I went down headforemost, with my mouth wide open—it was very low tide when the fresh water could not come in, and the water is stagoated by the copper bottoms of the vessels—it was very nauseous—I got a good deal of it, and was struggling a great deal for breath when I came up—a number of people called out, "Pick the man up—the man will be drowned—there is the staff"—the prisoner did not give me any assistance at that time—I made off to the boat which he had come out of—a gentleman had got into it, and he rendered me assistance—I got into that boat—when I had got out of danger I had my hand on the boat's gunwale—another witness got hold of me, and I was pulled into the boat—the prisoner had then got into his own boat, and put his hand down to assist me; and said, "Why don't you take hold here?"—I said, "I have had enough of your hand"—he offered his hand again afterward, and I did take hold of it—he helped me into the boat—I did not know the prisoner before, and never had any quarrel with him—he was sober—he is a labourer, and may have seen me often and I not see him—the water was about six fathoms deep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old next month—I live with my father, at No. 3, Victoria-cottages, Hawley-road, Kentish-town. On the afternoon of the 1st of Oct. I went with M'Cane to Highgate wood, to get blackberries—in the field adjoining the wood we met four boys—the prisoners are two of them—they were together—Monk asked us if we would buy some blackberries of him—he had some in his cap—I said we had no money—we went on into the wood—the four boys came after us—. Monk asked us if we had got any money—I said no, we had not—he said, "What have you got in your pockets? let me look what you have got in your pockets?"—I had a stick in my hand—I offered it to him—he said that would not do—I had got a basket, and offered him that—he said that would not do—I had a top and string in my pocket, which I offered him—he said that would not do—I had a knife in my waistcoat pocket—he said, "What is that sticking out of your waistcoat pocket?"—I said, "A knife"—he said, "Let us look at it, or else I will hit you over the head with this stick"—he had a stick in his hand, which he held up—I took the knife out of my pocket, and gave it to him—he looked at it, and then passed it to one of the others—after they had all looked at it, Monk gave it to me again—Monk then said to Day, "You want a pair of boots, don't you?."—Day said, "Yes, and a jacket too"—Monk then went to M'Cane, and said, "We must have your boots, your fathers can buy more, but he has got no parents;"—I said, "I cannot let you have these, my father has something else to do with his money"—Monk then said to the others, "Suppose we have the knife, shall we?"—they said, "Yes"—Monk then said, "Come, give it out;" and I then gave it to him—he had the stick in his hand—he did not hold it over me then, or say anything about it—when I gave him the knife they went away—they did not take M'Cane's boots—they were all standing round me at the time—when they were gone we ran out of the wood—we then turned round, and saw they were running after us, about half-way up the field, or rather more—I saw a lady and gentleman, and told them what had happened—the boys on that ran into a field at the side of the wood, in a different direction—we went on to the Archway-road, and saw a policeman—I told him what had happened—he went with me—we saw the prisoners run past the Woodman—I pointed them out to the policeman—we followed them to Highgate and Hampstead—we</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Spital-street, Spitalfields. On the morning of the 24th of Sept., I was taking a walk round Pocock's-gardens, Bethnal-green, and saw the prisoner beating his wife—I stopped and looked over the fence at them—after that he came out to me, and asked if I knew his wife—I said, "No, I neither know you nor your wife;" upon that he struck me a blow—I struck him again, and we had a struggle together—I at last threw him, and fell on the top of him—he caught hold of my throat, and said, "You b——r, I will choke you"—some man pulled me off him—he felt in his pockets, apparently for a knife—he asked a pot-boy, who stood by, for a knife—the pot-boy said. "It is time for me to cut," and ran away—the prisoner then ran into his garden, and into his cottage at the back of the garden, and came out with a knife, came up to me and said, "Where is the thief?"—he jumped up at me with the knife, and struck me—we had a struggle together—he struck me in the breast with his fist, and cut me on the head—I bled for an hour and a half—one or two people laid bold of him—I told them to hold him while I went for a policeman—the knife was not in the bent condition it is now before he stabbed me—Young got behind the prisoner, who threw the knife out of his hand, and Young picked it up—I got to the station, and they sent for a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Woolwich, and was formerly an officer in the marines. I am now on half-pay—I am owner of a farm called Woodlands, at Hawley, near Reigate, in Surrey—that farm was about to become vacant on the 29th of Sept.—it is rather more than fifty acres—I spoke to Mr. Tanton, a veterinary surgeon, who was attending a horse of mine, about finding a tenant for the farm, and he introduced the defendant to me as a person likely to take it—I first saw him on the 27th of March—Tanton brought him down to me at Woolwich—Tanton introduced him to me as Captain Hamilton—we had a conversation on the analysis of some poison; and I said to him,"Are you a doctor or captain?"—he replied "I am Captain Hamilton, of her Majesty's 5th dragoon-guards"—he staid and took dinner with me—I saw him several times afterwards on the subject of the farm, and while these communications were going on I mytelf made inquiry at Cox and Greenwood's, the army agents, on the 1st of May, respecting the character of Captain Hamilton, who I thought I was dealing with—after that inquiry I continued to receive him as Captain Hamilton of the dragoon-guards—I considered him a <hi rend="italic">trump card</hi>—I introduced him to my family during his visits to me—I eventually agreed to let him have the farm—Mr. Nokes, of Woolwich, acted as my solicitor in that trans<lb/>action—this</p>

               <p>agreement, which is dated 14th May, 1845, is the bargain that was made for taking the farm—there is some brick earth on land of mine adjoining the farm, and both on the 27th of March, and the 3rd of April, the defendant spoke to me about making bricks—he said, the very first day he came, that he thought my earth was very fine for making bricks—he proposed, that if I advanced 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would begin to make the bricks forme—he said he should be satisfied with fifteen per cent. for his trouble—I was to have the remainder—he said he thought I should make 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year by it—I advanced him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that purpose, on the evening of the 14th of May—I dated the check the 15th, on my banker's, Sir Claude Scott—this is the check—it has since been returned to me as paid—about three weeks after, he applied to me for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, for making bricks—he said he wanted more capital, and pressed me very much; and on the 3rd of June, after a great deal of pressing, I gave him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—before I advanced the first 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said he was on leave of absence from his regi<lb/>ment for that time—he said so both in April and May, that he could get as much leave of absence as he liked, because he had got the Colonel under his thumb, he had assisted him out of a <hi rend="italic">scrape</hi> with a lady—I think he mentioned the colonel's name as Scarlet, but will not be certain—my induce<lb/>ment to part with the first check, was because I thought I was dealing with a man of the highest honour and integrity, and a captain of the 5th dragoon-guards—no other consideration would have induced me to do so—I believed that representation of his to be true—I would most decidedly not have parted with the check if I had not believed his repre<lb/>sentation, that he was Captain Hamilton, of the 5th dragoon-guards—he said on the 3rd of April that he had been abroad in India, at Cabul, and had been severely wounded there—he said nothing about the Welsh riots at that time—while he visited at my house, I had a Miss Douglas, of Glasgow, staying at my house, a distant relation of mine—the defendant got a tenant for a furnished house of mine in the north, a Captain Barclay—he said he had got a very eligible tenant for me, and sent me down there to prepare it for his friend—when I returned, I found Miss Douglas had left my house, and the prisoner also—he came down again afterwards—he re<lb/>turned tome afterwards—I saw him myself at Mr. Douglas's, the father of a young lady, at Glasgow, in uniform, with spurs, trousers, and a sabre—I went down on the 16th or 17th of June, and ordered the house to be repaired, and then went to Glasgow—Captain Barclay declined taking the house afterwards—it was in July I saw the prisoner in Scotland in uniform, after I had advanced both these sums—he took possession of the farm, and began brick making.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make any charge against the defendant at Bow-street, or did Mr. Keene, by your direction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left it all to Mr. Keene—I did not go there to charge the defendant with obtaining a watch from Miss Douglas, by false pretences—I went wherever my solicitor told me—I might have accompanied Mr. Keene when he went about that business—I know nothing about the watch—I accompanied him several times, and did not know what he was doing—I know there was something about a watch—I think I went with Mr. Keene to get a warrant on this charge, but they would not give us one—I gave no notice to the defendant, I left it to my attorney—I have not given evidence be<lb/>fore a Magistrate on this charge—I preferred a bill before the Grand Jury in Aug.—I suppose Mr. Keene gave the defendant notice of it—I left it all to him—I preferred two bills, one in reference to the agreement for the farm, which is dated 14th of May, 1845—the bricks were talked about the very first day he came to my house—the first 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on the evening of the 14th, after the agreement was entered into—I do not know that he has been sued in a civil Court to recover the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left it all to Mr. Keene—I never received a card from the defendant, nor ever had one of his cards in my possession—he never paid me anything for the land—he got it from ray tenant—he was to pay me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year for the farm, for fifty acres—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the back of a card</hi>)—I will not swear this is not my writing here—if I was obliged to swear, I should swear it is not—I will swear it is not my writing—I do not remember the memorandum that is on it—it is not like my writing—this "J. Wood" on it is not my writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at an affidavit</hi>)—this is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at several letters</hi>)—part of the third of these, dated 14th of May, is not my writing—the letter is my writing, but not this part—two lines, with my name signed to them, is all a forgery—here is a memorandum on the same letter which is not my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any conversation with the prisoner on the subject of your being a partner in this brick-making? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I said I never would be a partner—I never proposed to him to be a partner, and never agreed to be so at any time—I would allow nobody to be a partner with me—there was a conversation about partnership—he wished to become a partner—he wanted to make me a partner, for he said it would be "Wood and Hamilton"—I said, "No, it must be in your name, and in the bank too; I never will be a partner"—I meant the funds in the bank were to be in his name—he told me he had made bricks before—the money was obtained to turn part of this field into a brick-field—it was to be used for that purpose alone—I never would have entered into the speculation if I had not considered him a responsible person—he had previously represented he was perfectly acquainted with brick-making—I went to Sir Claude Scott, with whom I had just cleared off a debt by the sale of some timber, and borrowed the money of him at 5 per cent. to meet the check—I never went to see the field till I returned from Scotland, on the 5th of Aug.—I had trusted entirely to the defendant's honour—I knew nothing of it, nor what was necessary to be spent on it—there were not half so many bricks as I supposed on the field—I cannot say whether there were 100,000—if they had been burnt properly, I dare say they would have fetched 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I go by other people's opinion—I know nothing of it—I have not seized</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270032"/>
               <p>the bricks—after he was apprehended there was a seizure for duty, which was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe there were four or live horses on the premises—I took steps, by the suggestion of my solicitor, to prevent the money being withdrawn from Sir Claude Scott's—there is about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—I have no memorandum given me by the defendant in reference to the money at the banker's, nor have I destroyed any memorandum—I knew the defendant had letters in his possession from Miss Douglas—the last time I went to Woolwich I told him he ought to restore them—I think that was about the 5th of August—he said he would never part with them as long as he lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since this charge has been preferred, have you over and over again offered to withdraw from it, if the letters were returned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never once, nor instructed my solicitor to do so—I have not applied for their return—they were offered to be returned once—I never directed anybody to apply for them—I am positive—I was introduced to a Miss Tanton, who pro<lb/>posed something about the letters—Mr. Tanton was not present—I be<lb/>lieve I mentioned to Mr. Tanton that if everything was given up I did not wish to bring him into Court—I had no wish to expose him, and be put to the enormous expense I have—I have not got the letters—I know nothing of the prisoner's having an engagement with Miss Douglas—I had a conver<lb/>sation with the prisoner about her fortune—I never told him I had found a nice little wife for him, or anything to that effect—I think I may venture to swear I did not—I never said I had ascertained the amount of her fortune—I do not recollect saying she was a girl of large for<lb/>tune—I do not. know that we had any conversation about the amount of her fortune—I did not say it was 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor anything of the kind—I never said if he married her, what was to be done with part of her fortune—I deliber<lb/>ately swear that—nor that it was to be made available for the brick-field.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell him, "If you marry this girl you will be able to throw so much more into the brick-field?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know; I do not reco<lb/>llect anything of the kind—I never did say so, I am positive—I did not tell him I had considerable influence with her father, nothing of the kind that I am aware of—I think I may safely swear it—I do not recollect saying I would use my influence with her father on his behalf—it may have happened—I do not recollect his saying he did not care a farthing for my influence, he could get the lady without it—I remember no con<lb/>versation that could lead to such a thing—I am to pay the expense of this prosecution, and not Mr. Douglas—I employed Mr. Keene—the prisoner collected some rent for me, and paid some bills out of it—he collected twice as much as he paid—he paid Collards' six guineas for the hire of a piano—he asked for power to collect my rents—he saw Collards' bill, and said he would pay it—he said he had rente, and I told him to pay it out of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

R. Hamilton, brick-maker, was on the brick-carts, and nothing else—I made an estimate of the expenditure on the brick-field, and if the bills had all been paid it would have amounted to 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but none of them are paid; they have all been sent to me—I have been put to the deepest dis<lb/>tiess, and a bailiff sent down to seize my furniture—when Miss Douglas was staying at my house I believed the prisoner was a captain of the 5th dragoon-guards—I always considered him a brother officer, and wrote to him as such.</p>

About four o'clock, on the morning of the 20th of Oct., Davis was brought to my house by Barker—he had a punctured wound upon the upper lip, extending to the teeth, and a cut upon the left hand—the wound was inflicted by external violence—I examined Isaacs, he had a punctured wound against the nostril—the wounds could not possibly have been produced by the ring—they wire done by some very small sharp-pointed instrument—it must have been sharper than the end of a tobacco-pipe.</p>

The prisoner Garratt lodged there for six weeks, and left on the 12th of Aug.—I have seen Maynard there—he used to inquire for Mr. Garratt when he came—he saw Garratt there—I do not remember the last time he came there—it might be about a fortnight before Garratt left—I have seen them together.</p>

I have known Garratt since last Christmas, and Maynard for some time before that, I cannot say exactly how long—I have been in the habit of seeing them together at my house from last Christmas down to the time of their being taken into custody—I cannot speak to seeing them in June and July—I saw them in May—they used not to come very often—Gar<lb/>ratt lodged at my house somewhere about three months—he left about the last week in June or the first week in July, I cannot tell which—I have not seen them together since Garratt left my house—I saw Garratt and Maynard together at my house on the 17th of May—I might have seen them together afterwards, but I do not recollect any particular day—they appeared to be quite intimate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman carpenter, and live at No. 2, Wood-street. On the 17th of Oct., about a quarter to five o'clock in the evening, I was passing along a lane near Temple Mills, by the Eastern Counties Railway, and saw the prisoner with a gun—he was beating the bushes—I told him he was carrying the gun in a very unlawful manner—some words passed between us—he told me to go and be b----, it was no business of mine—I said I knew it was no business of mine, I was only giving him a little advice—he said, "Go and be b——"—I said, "I think the best thing I can do is to take you to Mr. Mole, to see if he has autho<lb/>rized</p>

               <p>you to carry a gun about the premises in that kind of manner"—I thought Mr. Mole was the owner of the land—he said, "Very well"—he uncocked the gun, and walked alongside of me about ten yards—he then made a sudden start, and ran off, and I after him; and when I was about ten yards from him, he turned round, and fired the gun at me, the shot hit me on the right side of the head, which bled—it knocked me down—I got up and followed him as soon as I could—I got hold of him—he threw me down—we both went down together, and he got from me—I caught him again, and he was taken into custody—I was ill from the wound about a week or ten days—I went to a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Queen-street, Brompton, in the parish of St. Mary Abbots, Kensington. I have an aunt named Sarah Walton, residing in the house—on Saturday, 26th of July, the prisoner came to look at apartments which were to let on the drawing-room floor—I said I had another apartment on the second floor, he said that would do—I asked him for a reference—he gave me one to Mr. John Lee, his uncle, at the Travellers' Club, Pall-mall—I said I could not take him in until Monday—he said he should not want to come in then, if so soon—he wrote his name down, I have not got it—I afterwards received two letters, one on Monday evening—I afterwards spoke to him respecting that one—this is it—before I received it I had made inquiry at the Travellers' Club—I told him the result of my inquiries, that his uncle's name was spelt differently at the club, as the porter at the club told me—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"Monday morning—Not knowing whether you have inquired respecting my uncle, as I should with you to, inquire about the name as Legh—Lee, our name, is distinguished from the Cheshire family, as for Stoneleigh, which by inquiry of the porter you will find")—I ascertained that there was a gentleman at the club from Cheshire, whose name was Legh—I said, "They say the name is spelt differently, but they know nothing of the younger branches"—he said it was reversionary property which caused his uncle to change his name—I thought that a sufficient explanation, and took him—he occupied the apartment for three weeks—on Sunday morning, 17th of Aug., my aunt went to church about eleven o'clock, leaving me in the house—about a quarter after eleven o'clock, the prisoner came down stairs, and asked the servant, "Ann, can Miss Rice give me change for a sovereign?"—I said, "No, I could not"—he called out, and said, "Perhaps, Miss Rice, you would like to see the newspaper?"—I said, "Yes"—he brought me down the paper, and then sent the girl out for change for a sovereign—she returned soon after—the prisoner was in the passage when she came in—he gave her seven shillings for herself, and went out—he had taken his writing-desk to be repaired the week before, and he told her, as he went out, to take it in if it was brought back—he paid fifteen shillings a week for his lodging, and extra for breakfast—he paid me a sovereign and sixpence that morning, for one week—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note Co take the rent out of—that was before the robbery—there was no one in the house from the time my aunt went out and came home, except myself and the servant—when my aunt came home she complained of losing her money—I went into her room—herdesk was in the back top room—the prisoner's apartment was the room under it—I saw her desk after she came home—the papers were pushed away from the drawer of the desk where the motley had been—the drawer was open, it does not lock—the desk had been locked, it was forced open, and the money gone—I saw none there—the desk was locked again, and my aunt opened it with another key—sne could not open it with her own key—I tried it—the prisoner wore purple spectacles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Charteris-buildings, Green-wich. On Monday night, the 18th of Aug., about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner run out of the corner house and up the court—he asked if there was a way out—I told him the way he got in he must get out, it was no thoroughfare—he said there was a man jealous of him going to cut bis throat, and asked if he could remain with me—he did so until the morning—I occupy a room there—I am an unfortunate woman—he slept with me—next morning he stood against the table, took a purse from hit pocket, and shook the money out into his hand several times—I saw from eighteen to twenty sovereigns in the purse—he gave me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he shook the sovereigns out of the purse several times into his hand after he had done washing himself—I asked him what made his hair so short—he said he had been to prison, got false bail, and came out—before he went away he asked me to go and see if all was clear—I asked him his reason—he said it was no person going to cut his throat, that the police were after him—I asked what the police were after him for—he would not say—he went away, and I saw no more of him.</p>

From information I received I searched for the prisoner at Greenwich—I could not find him there—I went to the prosecutor's house and saw the desk now produced—I found several impressions on the wood, marks of something having been placed in to wrench it open, similar to this chisel produced by Weston—I have examined it with these marks, and find it exactly corresponds—the hasp is loose—I did not make the marks—the chisel has never been so close to it as it is now, while in my hands—the edge of the chisel is not injured at all.</p>

When bad you these things to pay you? A. I do not know when. Q. Will you swear it was a fortnight prior to the fiat issuing? A. No, I will not. Q. Will you swear it was not within a week of the fiat? A. Yes, I will, but not within a fortnight. Q. Why did your brother give you these things at that time? A. To clear me off. Q. Do you know that your brother had been served with two writs at that time? A. I did not—I know it now—I see them now in your hands. Q. Why were you to be cleared off at that time? A. I do not know. Q. Had your brother told you at that time he was going to petition the Court? A. He had not—I had no idea whatever of it. Q. How soon after you got those things from your brother did you send them to Gough's? A. I cannot. tell—it might be two days before the messenger came into possession? Q. Where is the book out of which your brother wrote out a list into his book? A. I do not know. Q. Have you any book from which your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270062"/>
               <p>brother wrote out the list, and where is it? A. I have it at my house—it belongs to my brother, I suppose—I gave it him—it is not my book, Q. What coloured book? A. A black book. Q. Is it a large book? A. It is not—it is a small book."</p>
               <p>On the 9th of July he was further examined as follows:—"Q. Have you brought with you the black book which you spoke of in your former exami<lb/>nation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why have you not brought it with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I have not got it. Q. Where is it? A. I do not know. Q. Do you remember on your former examination stating respecting that book, 'I have it at my house, it belongs to my brother, I suppose?' A. I do. Q. Where is the book you so referred to in that examination? A. I do not know. Q. What has become of it since that examination? A. I do not know. Q. Was it true, as you then stated on your former examination, that you had the book then at your house? A. Yes. Q. Where is that book to which you so referred? A. I do not know. Q. Have you seen it since that last examination? A. No. Q. Have you not been summoned to produce it? A. Yes. Q. Why do you not produce it? A. Because I have not looked for it—I do not know where to look for it. Q. What house did you allude to on your former examin<lb/>ation, when you said you had the book at your house? A. No. 14, Elizabeth-terrace, Ball's Pond-road, the same which I live in still, and from which I came this morning. Q. Does your brother, the bankrupt, live in the same house? A. He did live there—he does not live there now, and I do not know where he lives. Q. When did he leave that house? A. About a fortnight since. Q. Why did he leave it? A. I do not know, upon my oath, why he left it. Q. Did he give any reason why he should leave you?—had you any quarrel? A. He did not give any reason, and we had no quarrel. Q. Have you seen him since he left your house? A. Yes, Sir. Q. When did you see him last? A. On Saturday last—I did not then ask him where he was then living, and he did not tell me—I do not know where he resides now, nor where he has resided at any time during the last fortnight, except that I know that lie slept at a coffee-shop in Bishopsgate-street for one or two nights—I do not know the name of the coffee-shop, or who keeps it—it is near Sun-street, as I have heard from my brother. Q. Did you see him go away when he left your house? A. I did not see him. Q. Do you knour whether he took any book or account from your house? A. I cannot say. Q. Do you suspect that he took away any book of account? A. I do not know what to answer—the messenger of this Court has looked for the book—I know it is not there now—I have not seen it since I was last examined, but it used to be in my brother's room, the bankrupt's—I wish to add that I do suspect that my brother the bankrupt has taken it away. Q. Do you keep a banker's account? A. I do not now, but I did so, down to about a fortnight or ten days ago, at the bank of Sir William Lub<lb/>bock. Q. Did you then withdraw your balance? A. Yes. Q. why did you do so? A. Because I could get no person to serve me on the arket, and I wanted to make use of the money in buying goods in my trade. Q. Had your brother handed any money over to you at any time to put into that banking-house? A. No. Q. Had he advanced any sum of money to you to dispose of anywhere for him? A. No. Q. I believe Mr. Ash lord had had some money of jours? A. Yes. Q. Had any portion of that money come from your brother the bankrupt? A. No. Q.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270063"/>
               <p>Do you know whether there is any sum of money lying anywhere be<lb/>longing to your brother the bankrupt? A. I do not, upon my oath, nor do I know of any property belonging to him anywhere. Q. Do you know a person of the name of James Gammon? A. I do know him—he is a saddler. Q. Was any harness belonging to your brother, the bankrupt, sent to Gammon's? A. I do not know of any being sent—I have heard of some being sold to him by my brother, but I know nothing of it of my own knowledge. Q. Did not you hear from your brother, the bankrupt, that the harness was sent to Gammon's to take care of? A. No. Q. Did you know of any hops being sold by your brother, the bankrupt, to George Chalkley? A. Yes—I know some were sold to him, but I know nothing about their not having been paid for, or that the sale had been withholden from the knowledge of the creditors. Q,. Did you make any claim to the hops that had been sold to Mr. George Chalkley? A. No, I knew nothing of the affair. Q. Did the messenger of this Court seize any property in your possession which had been your brother's, the bankrupt? A. Yes, it had been my brother's until I bought it. Q. Does the purchase of that property appear in any book of yours? A. It did, but I cannot find the book—I have mislaid it—I wish to find it. Q. Describe the book? A. It is a little small book with a pencil in it, a pocket-book about eight inches in length—a bluish-black cover. Q. When did you see it last? A. I have not seen it since my last examination. Q. Is this a book distinct from the other black book of which you have already been speaking of in this examination, and referred to in your former examination? A. It is the very same book which I suppose my brother, the bankrupt, has taken. Q. Is the entry in that book respecting the sale of this property to you in your handwriting? A. No, in my brother's, the bankrupt. Q. What was the amount of the property so sold to you? A. About 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Q. Did any money pass on that occasion? A. Yes, about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the rest was in payment of a debt which he owed me. Q. Was there any account of that debt in any book of the bankrupt's? A. Yes, I believe it was in his ledger—I also had an account of it in a little penny memorandum-book of mine, which I looked for this morning and could not find, but I think I can produce it on some future occasion. Q. When was it you deposited the money with Mr. Ashford? A. About the middle of March last? Q. How much did you deposit with him? A. 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave me an I O U, and which I showed to Francis Gough. Q. When you showed it to Gough, did you not tell him that that money belonged to your brother, the bankrupt? A. I did not."</p>

                  </hi>. In the beginning of last March I was in the service of the bankrupt, Thomas Adlington; I know the prisoner; he is his brother; the bankrupt lived with him up to the time of his bankruptcy. I remember things being moved to my house several times, a short time prior to the bankruptcy, in March—I cannot tell the dates; it was about the middle of March—sometimes there was a quantity of groats moved, at other times ground rice—he was a corn and coal-dealer—the articles moved were arti<lb/>cles in his own trade—he sold ground rice and groats, corn and oats—they were moved by me and by the men on the premises—there were</p>

               <p>utensils moved, such as a chaff-machine, a hand-truck, and coal-sacks—the fiat issued on the 7th of April—a cart was moved to Glover's about two days prior to the bankruptcy; I think it went empty—it was worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw it removed from the premises, I think, by Moses Gammon—I saw the bankrupt at the time it was removed—he and the prisoner gave orders for it—I do not think either of them were present at the time it was removed—both of them had given orders for its re<lb/>moval, in my hearing—it was to be removed to Mr. Glover's, at Totten-ham—previous to the bankruptcy, on Good Friday, I was requested to come round to help them with the books, to go through the ac<lb/>counts, and see which were bad debts and which were good—the bank<lb/>rupt and I went through one set of books commonly used by the bankrupt, and the prisoner went through another set, and we found by the books gone through by the bankrupt and myself that he could offer 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—the prisoner was present—something was said as to the propriety of offering anything in the pound, or becoming a bankrupt—the goods were moved about the middle of March, at several times—several goods were removed before Good Friday—I knew of my master being put on his examination at the Bankruptcy Court—he requested me to go there—I did not know what for, till I got there; I then found it was to sign a paper—some goods were removed on the day the Bankruptcy Court took possession of the things—I had several conversations with the pri<lb/>soner after that about the articles which had been previously removed to my premises—he told me they were his, and I was to say they were his if I was examined—I can give no certain account where those goods were at "that time—I was first at the Court of Bankruptcy on the 8th of April—the last public examination was on the 31st of May—I was still in their employ at that time—I had left their house, and lived at my own house-up to the time of the prisoner purchasing the business of the assignees, part of the goods which had been removed were at my place, and part at the prisoner's place—the books were removed—the cart was at Glover's—before any articles had been removed they had both together told me that I was to have the groats, over there, because they should not be able to pass any groats while the messenger held possession of the place—I told the Com<lb/>missioner that I had the articles at my house, at my examination on the 31st of May—I had not been examined before—the messenger had left the premises before the 31st of May—after he had left, the goods at my house were moved back again—both the pri<lb/>soner and the bankrupt helped to move them back—the bankrupt's name had been on the cart—I painted it out by his orders in the prisoner's presence—I fetched the cart home from Glover's—the articles that had gone to the prisoner's were not brought back, only just a few labels for present use—the books were kept under lock and key—the prisoner then started in the business, and the bankrupt travelled for his brother—that was the place the prisoner had held for him—I made no communication to the messenger about the goods I bad in my possession, because I was ordered not, both by the bankrupt and the prisoner, and I was not to let any of the neighbours see me move them, but I did not attend to those orders strictly, because I moved them in broad daylight—I was told not to let it be known—part of the goods were then at my place, and part at the prisoner's, and the cart was at Tot<lb/>tenham—some of the goods were seized at my house, in Fleet-row—that was alter the 31st, after I had given evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray what are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am nothing—I have been out of employment since the 31st of May—I certainly travel—I was out of employment three months before I went into Thomas Adlington's employment, during which time I got my living by selling goods—of course I did not consider it was altogether the thing of Thomas Adlington to remove goods when he was going to be a bankrupt; but I did not know the extent of the wrong—I had it in my heart</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270066"/>
               <p>to serve him if I could—I had my opinion about it, but I was told they were Robert's—I knew they were not—Robert told were his—I believe he also said he had taken them of Thomas, in dis<lb/>charge of the debt due to him, because he knew Thomas would be a bank<lb/>rupt—he said he had bought them—he said so at the time—Thomas did not say they were Robert's, and that he gave them to him to secure him in case of his bankruptcy—he gave me instructions to take such things over, and I was to say they were his brother Robert's, and Robert said the same—I was to say they were his—Thomas did not tell me Robert was to have them for what he owed him—I did not say they were Robert's—I did not take them with that view—I took them by his request to his place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> For what purpose did you take them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were to remain there—he hired the room of me—he was looking over, and saw I had a paper up to let my apartments, and he said to me, "Frank, you have not let your apartment yet?"—I said, "No, I have not"—he said, "I don't mind taking the room of you to put some groats in, because, when the messenger comes to take possession of the place, we shan't be able to serve our customers with rice, or pack the groats, as the machine it not movable; and therefore you had better take over the packets of groats so that we may be able to serve our customers all the same, and not ruin our trade; "and then in taking over the groats, he said, "Take some rice over, and you had better take the coal-sacks over; and if you want help, you must have it."</p>

I would not go—nor anything of the kind—not a word of the sort ever passed—I went three times before the Commissioners—I went the first day, when the fiat was issued—I was not examined then—a question was put to me whether I knew he had been a trader, and I said, "Yes;" and they asked me my name—I was examined the second time—I was summoned then—I was not summoned the first time—I went at the request of the bankrupts—the second time I told all about where these goods were—that was on the 31st of May—that was the first time I was examined—I should say the goods were on the premises six or seven weeks before they were removed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a house, No. 13, Amp<lb/>ton-street, in the parish of St. Pancras—on the 16th of Sept. I was sleeping in the kitchen under the back parlour—about two o'clock in the morning of the 17th I was awoke by a sound like the falling of a bunch of keys—I got up, went to the stairs, and called—I went up two or three of the kitchen stairs—I had no light—I called to the young person who slept at the top of the house, and asked her if she wanted anything, or whether anything was the matter—there was no answer, and on looking round I discovered that a light which was in the back parlour was put out—I had seen a light in looking up as I came up stairs, I then asked the question, and then the light was put out—I entered the parlour, and saw the prisoner standing at the table; about two yards from the parlour door, and about the same distance from the window, which was wide open—he went out at the window directly he saw me—I called out, "Robbers! thieves!"—I stood at the window and continued calling out—he got over the wall into Frederick-place—there is a washhouse, the tiles of which come up under the window of the parlour I was in, and they would enable a person to get in at that window—there are gardens in the rear of the houses in Frederick-place, and I saw him go along the walls of those gardens—he slipped down from the wall into Frederick-place, and there I lost sight of him—the police then called out, "We are on the look out," and in about five minutes I heard a whistle, and another police-man said, "We have caught him"—the policeman came to my house with a lantern—I shut the window down, and went to the street door and let them in, but previous to that two other policemen had come in at the window which the thief had left open—they looked round, and I saw them find some plate in a handkerchief on the table—there was another handkerchief of mine lying there, but the plate was in one that was not mine—there were two table-spoons, seven tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, five gold rings, a silver medal, a buckle, and a pair of tweezers, and a parasol was lying near the handkerchief—the plate had been in a box on the drawers in the same room—the value of the things that had been removed was from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they belonged to me—I picked up the bunch of keys under the table where they had fallen, which had awoke me—I had left the drawers unlocked the night before, but the box in the spoons had been was locked—every drawer had been opened and</p>

               <p>overhauled, and the dress which I have was on the floor—I had left that bunch of keys on the dresser in the front kitchen, and one of the keys opened the box which contained the plate—I had gone to bed about ten o'clock—no one slept in the front kitchen—I found a piece of candle on the mantle-shelf in the back parlour which had not been lighted, and there was another piece produced by the policeman which had been lighted—every room that was not occupied had been entered, and every drawer opened—I was last in the back parlour about seven o'clock the evening before—the sashes were both down, but the shutters were not fastened—I was the last person up in the house—the back parlour is exclusively occupied by me—I have no knowledge of the prisoner—I did not know the piece of candle—a few days after the robbery I found missing a stone, a magnifying-glass, a silk handkerchief, a black handkerchief, and a knife—they have been shown to me since, and I know them to be mine—I could not swear to the prisoner's face—in turning round to look at me his shadow darkened the moonlight, but the height of his figure and his person were the same as the prisoner's.</p>

I was in Ampton-street, on the morning of the 17th Sept., at half-past two o'clock—I heard a noise as if it was a scraping up against the wall of the back garden of a house in Ampton-street—in a minute or two I observed the prisoner come over the wall, and as he dropped down his boots fell from him—he had them in his hand, and none on his feet—from the place where he came you could get along the walls and over the roof to the prosecutrix's house—I tried that—when he came over the wall, I heard the prosecutrix call out "Thieves! Robbers!"—the prisoner dropped the boots and ran off, and I after him—another officer came up and he took him to the station—I re<lb/>turned and answered the prosecutrix's call, that we were looking out for him—I went over the walls, and through the window, and saw the plate in the handkerchief on the table, near the back window.</p>

I live in Ratcliffe Highway, and am an optician—the prisoner lived with me about four years—on the 29th of Sept. he applied to me for half-a-crown—he said he wanted it for a material we use in our trade to polish glass—I gave him a sovereign to get change, and saw no more of him till he was in custody—he never brought me the sovereign or change.</p>

My seat was next to the prisoner's—on the 26th of Sept., about noon, I saw the prisoner sweep up the gold filings in his skin with a hare's-foot, put it into a tin box, and put it into his bottom drawer—I thought fit to watch him—after he had done that he went on with his work—I knew that what he had done was against the rules altogether—Garratt went to communicate it to my master, and in a few minutes Taylor and my master came, and the drawer was taken out—I did not go into the counting-house—I afterwards saw the filings—they were filings of such gold as the prisoner was at work on—there is a pin comes to the table, and a skin under it, and as the man files the filings fall into the skin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Sarah Cord well, a pawn-broker, in Exmouth-street, Clerkenwell. About half-past nine o'clock, on the morning of the 4th of Oct., I received information from a boy out<lb/>side the shop, in consequence of which I looked and missed two pairs of boots from a stall in front of the shop—I saw the prisoner with the boots in his possession, about fifty yards off, running down a street—I ran after him, and saw him throw them over the garden-wall of a house in Wilming<lb/>ton-square—he was stopped by Mr. Miller—when I came up, he said "I have not been doing anything"—I went to the front door of the house in the square, and the servant gave me the boots—these are them—I had seen them safe two minutes before.</p>

I was employed by Broadley with a cart to take these things—f delivered them, except these two bags, and when I got to the door they were taken out and put into a truck—the prisoners were by at the time, and one more with them—I went into the house, and when I came back I missed the two bags—I do not know what became of them after that.</p>

About five o'clock in the afternoon, on the 1st of Oct., the prisoner came to the shop and asked if I had a pair of shoes I could sell him which would do for waiting—I said I had, and I gave him a chair—while I was getting the shoes I heard a noise of some women's shoes which hung behind where he sat—I took no notice, but found some shoes to fit him—I then went on the stairs, and observed him take a pair of shoes from a rail behind where he sat, and put them under his jacket—I found a pair of shoes to fit him, and asked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I refused—he went out—I followed him, and, not finding an officer, I persuaded him to come back, to see if we could not come to some terms—I then offered him the shoes for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said they were not the same shoes—he went to the same chair where he had been sitting, and, fell down, and these shoes dropped from him—I swear they dropped from him.</p>

               <p>live in Bishopsgate-street. The prisoner was in my service as town-tra<lb/>veller and collector—his duties were to go round and take orders, to receive money for goods already sold, and to come in the evening to the counting-house, to enter them in a book, and obtain my initials to them—he was to enter the orders and the payments in a book, and to hand the money to me, or to any one there for me—my clerk was authorised to receive the money—supposing he paid the money to any one else, he ought to have made the entry in the book—if he had paid Mrs. Millington, she would have received it, and he ought to have entered it—this is the book—here is an entry in it, "Cash from J. Hasted, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," on the 28th of August, in the prisoner's writing—I should say I did not personally receive that money, but I have had it—I do not find any entry of Mr. Cooper's or Mr. Cable's accounts in August, nor any entry of those amounts paid by them after August.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has he been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three or four years—I had a large business without him—it happens that these three customers have been obtained by him—they have been very small customers—the prisoner was paid by commission—the rate of commission varied—it was ten per cent, on varnish, and five per cent, on dry colours—there was no time fixed for the payment of the commission—we usually settled every Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you made the agreement about the commission, was any time fixed for settling that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell—we had no agreement—I paid him as other servants, every Saturday night—there was no agreement that I should pay him every Saturday night—I do not recollect whether I took him without any agreement as to the time he should be paid—the first entry that I have of paying him is the first week after he was with me, and I have continued to pay him every Saturday night, as far as I was able—I paid him by calculating the amount of goods sold or paid for—he had commission on the goods told, whether paid for or not—I paid him the commission on the goods sold regularly till lately—he has lately been so irregular in his attendance that I have had no opportunity of settling with him—I should say that I did not get in arrears for his commission in consequence of that—I paid him what I considered was due to him every Saturday night—his calculation and mine did not disagree—he has not applied to me for a considerable sum that he says I owe him for commis<lb/>sion—he did not apply for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not before he left ray ser<lb/>vice apply for wages that I owed him—he applied for a settlement, and I told him to produce his account—he did not, to my recollection, say that by a settlement I should have to pay him money—he applied for a settle<lb/>ment, without knowing whether he owed me or I him—a settlement has been mentioned between us more than once, but mostly by myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you charged him with drunkenness, and in consequence of that he left your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I discharged him a great many times, and afterwards took him again when he promised to amend—the last time he left me he absented himself on the 29th of Sept.—if that was on Saturday I paid him a sum of money—I believe it to have been on a Saturday—it was about the 29th of Sept.—I did not know that he went to another person and got employ in the same trade—I know it now—I cannot re<lb/>collect</p>

Hasted, on account"—I very frequently put "on account," when it is not a settlement—this is not copied from the entry in the other book—I find no entry in the cash-book of these other two sums—I think the last time the prisoner left me was in July—I frequently sent after him, to know if he was coming to business I discharged him several times, and took him on again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Isaac Kersey, of Leyton, in Essex, and am a dress-maker. I had some black satin sent to me to make up into a dress, the latter end of September—there ought to have been fifteen yards of it—it came at five o'clock one evening, and I measured it at nine the following morning—it then measured barely thirteen yards and a half—I mentioned it to the lady who had sent it—I afterwards went to Turner and Budd's, and had some conversation there—the prisoner was living servant with me—some days afterwards, after finding some lawn, I requested to look in her box—that was on the last day of Sept.—she emptied her box before me—I found in it some black satin, mousseline-de-laine, and cashmere—I put the satin into a drawer—the lady called in the afternoon, and I compared it with the dress—it corresponded in colour and quality.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the prisoner been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six months—she was not a work-woman—she had no right to meddle with these articles—I received this satin at five one evening—I cannot say what evening—I do not enter my dresses till I send them home—I might have two or three pieces of black satin sent in Sept., to make dresses—this piece came the latter end of Sept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure it was not the first week in Sept.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not sure of that—my husband brought it into the house—he is not here—I first saw it next morning about nine, in the work-room, brought to me by one of the apprentices—I saw my husband bring in the parcel at five, the preceding evening—it was to make up for Miss Wragg, of Walthamstow—she is not here—I expected fifteen yards—she said she should send the same quantity as she did before—after having measured it the next morn<lb/>ing, and found only thirteen yards and a half, I communicated it to the lady at eleven the same day.</p>
               <p>

               <p>and Budd's—I did not make the dress with the thirteen yards and a half—I tried the body of it on before any other part was made, and then I told her there was not enough to make it up, and only thirteen yards and a half had been sent—I bought some more at Turner and Budd's, sufficient to make it up—I am quite sure the prisoner was present when I searched her box—there was no person present when her first box was searched—the satin and cashmere and mousselin-de-laine were found in that—she was pre<lb/>sent when her second box was opened—I am sure about that—my forewoman and the policeman were present—that was on the following day, and there were other articles found by the policeman—I have dismissed several of my servants before on suspicion of charges of this kind—I do not exactly know how many—it was about trivial things—this black satin was left in the show-room, which the prisoner is obliged to go through—the work-room is oc<lb/>cupied by persons who call—I do not know which of the young people left it there—my husband had brought it in, and it was delivered into the hand of the forewoman—she is not here—I did not see what she did with it, hut it was brought out of the show-room into the work-room the following morning by one of the apprentices—it ought to have been put in the show-room—at the time it was brought to me the string was off it, but when I saw the parcel in my husband's hand the string was on it—somebody must have taken it off—I do not know who did—my forewoman has been in my employ about four years—she was not in my employ all the time the other young persons were dismissed for little thefts—she left me fora short time, but there was no fault against her—I gave her warning to leave because I wished to have a milliner instead of a dress-maker for a short time—I have two other persons in my employ—neither of them are here—they, in common with the prisoner, have access to the show-room—the prisoner's boxes were in her bedroom—I believe no one else ever goes into it—I mentioned to my apprentices and forewoman that this satin was missed—the reason I had the prisoner's boxes searched was my finding a piece of lawn in her bedroom, amongst the dirty things—I usually sort out the things there if I am not busy, if I am the prisoner does it herself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am incumbent of the parish of Mortlake—the prisoner was in my service as cook for a year. On the 25th of Sept., in consequence of what I heard, I went to the house of Thomas Neale, a labourer, living near me—I found a box in the possession of Mrs. Neale—I directed her not to part with it—on the 1st of Oct., I went again, took possession of the box, and took it down with me to Brighton—my family had gone down to Brighton on Thursday the 20th of Aug.—the prisoner went the day before, Wednesday, the 19th—when I got down to Brighton, I went to the Lord Nelson public house, kept by Mr. Cotterell—I found the prisoner staying there—I pro<lb/>duced the box to her—it was precisely in the same state as when I took it from Neale's—I told her I was exceedingly sorry to suspect that she should take any of our articles, but as I did suspect her, I desired her to open that box before I paid her her wages, which were due to her—she protested that the box contained nothing whatever of mine, only articles belonging to herself, preparatory to her own house-keeping—I said, "Never mind, I must see the inside of the box, because it was taken to Mrs. Neale's under certain very suspicious circumstances"—the box was sewed up in a bag and sacking, and also corded quite securely—I gave her my pen-knife and told her to uncut the sacking and open it—she again protested that it contained nothing of ours—she took the cover off, and I saw it was my own box, a square packing-case, about a foot or fifteen inches square, without a wooden lid to it—I said, "That is my box"—she said, "The box is yours"—this now produced is the box and bag and the articles in it—the first articles found, which were at the top, were some pieces of sheeting which had been cut up, and which I claim—this is part of the sheet which has been cut—here is the remains of a mark—the lower mark, R., is very distinct indeed—the up<lb/>per mark is not so distinct—it has evidently been erased—I believe this upper mark has been F. C. R. or F. S. R.—I will not be quite certain which—if it was F. C. R. it belonged to my father, whose property I am now in possession of—the R. is most distinctly mine, and I recognised it immediately—here is ano<lb/>ther part of the same sheet with no mark on it—this is another part of the same sheet hemmed in one part and cut in another—this other is part of. the same sheet, cut up and hemmed, and this other is part of the same—it is a sheet cut up—the next articles found some towels—here is one marked F. R. 12, very distinctly—she said she bought the towels and the sheeting at Shoreditch, and she could bring her mother to prove it—there were two or three other towels, one of which Mrs. Reeves recognised, but I did not put them into the indictment, because</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270167"/>
               <p>the mark had been cut out—here are some old table-napkins which Mrs. Reeves can identify better than I can, but from their general appearance I should say they were mine—here is my mark, F. J. H. R.—it is an old napkin, burnt and in holes—here is a table-cloth, a common one certainly, probably a nursery table-cloth—it is marked F. J. H. R. indistinctly, but still sufficient for me to speak to—this is a good table-cloth, a superior one—I cannot trace the mark in this, but I can swear to it—she took it hastily out of the box and said, "That if yours, but how it came there I don't know"—these silk socks are mine—there is no mark, but I can swear to them from having worn them frequently—they are the same kind I wear of an evening—she acknowledged they were mine, but said she thought perhaps they might have been put into the box by mistake for her own—here are some pieces of carpeting, the remains of the drawing-room carpet which had been fitted to another room—I can swear to them from the pattern—they were kept in a room up stairs with other things—I immediately gave the prisoner into custody, and told her "I shall now proceed to exa-mine the other box which you left with the other servants' boxes in the store-room, of which you took the key"—she had put a box in the store-room at East Sheen, as my house was occupied by another gentleman—I then went to East Sheen and found the other box—it was locked—there was no key in it—I put a cord round it to prevent its being opened, and took it down to Brighton, locked as it was—it was opened before the po<lb/>lice at Brighton, and in the prisoner's presence—she was at first asked for the key—she said she had not got the key, but she had lent it to a sister of Mrs. Reeves, at Brighton—we then had the box broken open—no application was made to Mrs. Reeves's sister for the key—she was at Brighton, but not staying at our house—it was done all in a moment, just before we went in before the Justice—I did not find the key afterwards—on the box being broken open these two books of mine, and some other articles, which are not in the indictment, were found—I mention that to show these were not the only things stolen from me, and to show that I am not prosecuting a person for nothing—I have lost a number of things which I could certainly claim, but I wish to make the indictment as small as I can—I can swear to this book—my name is in it from my own plate, and this other I can swear to from having been in my family—I believe the articles are valued at the lowest minimum of value I could possibly put in the indictment.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270168"/>
               <p>in her as we had formerly done—I had heard of that for three or four months—it was before that she was placed in charge of the house-linen—I do not know how long before, it might have been five or six months ago—this sheet has been worn—the value of the articles is not the point in question—it has been mended, and here is a hole—I do not know the value of the sheet—it may be worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or half-a-crown—I gave a value to the officer to put in the indictment, but it is a mere nominal value; I forget what it was—I do not choose to answer any of those questions which do not affect the charge at all—this table-cloth is damask—I see there are holes in it, and it has been darned—I have, perhaps, va<lb/>lued it at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is an old one—I can see through it in half-a-dozen places—this other table-cloth is diaper—it is full of holes—there are holes in the socks—I may have left them off, but I never gave them away—I have valued them at half-a-crown—these napkins I have valued at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece, this towel at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and these three yards of carpet 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the carpet has not been cut up and distributed to the poor people in the village—a servant whom I can produce saw the pri<lb/>soner selling some of that carpet to a man who came into the yard to buy grease of her—that is not in the indictment, it only shows what a pilferer I had in my house—I gave none of the carpet away—I will not swear none has been given away, but I think not—I know this piece of sacking—I have seen it in the lumber-room—it came with other things, but I do not put any value on it—the prisoner gave warning to leave to Mrs. Reeves, at Brighton, while I was at Mortlake—the notice to leave came from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, though from four to five months before you had been told she was drunken, you kept her the whole of that time, and parted with her on her giving you notice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were told she was drunken, but we were very unwilling to believe it; but the circumstance of her going away was not connected with her drunkenness—we had not discharged thirty-four servants in the twelve months the prisoner lived with us—there was one servant who came, a very respectable woman, who, I believe, went away in consequence of the prisoner's drunken habits—I do not know how many servants we turned away in the twelve months—perhaps three or four changes have taken place within the last year, not more; not half a dozen—I do not see what that has to do with the case—one of these volumes, "The Heiress of Bruges" I missed the day before I left Sheen—the other was in the use of the children; it is one of Hannah More's tracts—they are odd volumes—they were found at the top of the box—that box contained articles of the prisoner's—the articles have been restored to her, but the box was kept, and is now at my house—we were not ordered to bring it here—I did not take it before the Magistrate—it was an old leathern trunk—it belonged to me—I had lent it to her to put her things in, pre<lb/>vious to our going to Brighton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that the key of that box was left behind her when she went to Brighton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath, I believe she took the key with her, and she said she had lent the key to Mrs. Reeves's sister—I never sent the key to her by Taylor—I knew nothing about the key—I never sent the key of that box to her by Taylor—the prisoner went to Brighton on the 20th of Aug., and on the 21st we followed—I had no key of any box that I sent to her by Taylor at any time—the box was locked, and from the time of my finding it in the store-room I never saw the key of it, nor have I to this moment, and I should not know the key if I was to see it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270169"/>
               <p>now—the box I found at Neale's was not an old candle-box—it was a box sent to me, containing a lamp—I do not know whether it was used as an old candle-box—I certainly should not have prosecuted her for taking the box alone—there was no confusion in the packing, no more than ordinary when a large family moves—I do not know that these napkins had been sent down into the kitchen to be used as dusters—the prisoner had not lent me a box—she may have lent one to some of my family, or some of the servants—both the boxes were in the store-room before either was sent to Mrs. Neale's—it was about six weeks after she had been at Brighton that I fetched the box from Sheen—I knew she was at the Lord Nelson—she left word she was staying there—there was no secret about that, because we were to hear from her again—I was at Sheen when she left, and her wages were not paid till I returned—they were paid on the 10th of Oct., the day after she was admitted to bail—I did not oppose her being admitted to bail—I particularly wished it, and requested she might not be kept in custody—I did not want to put her to more pain than was necessary—I gave her in charge on the 25th of Sept.—it was on Saturday, the 27th, that I saw the first box at Mrs. Neale's—I went with Finlayson, the policeman, and saw it—I told them not to part with it till either myself or a proper authority should come for it—that was the first time I saw it—I had known of its being there very soon after I got to Brighton—I knew it about a month previous to the 25th of Sept.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you look after it a month previously, instead of waiting till she had given notice to quit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did not wish to be<lb/>lieve there was anything in that box belonging to us, and therefore we determined, as she was still in our service, to let the thing remain till we got back to Sheen, and then satisfy ourselves as to its contents—we knew from the report of the other servants that she bad sent the box to Neale's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you send any key of any box by Ann Taylor to the prisoner, saying you had locked the box, and desiring her to give the key to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—was it likely I should lock a servant's box for her?—the misunderstanding between the prisoner and Mrs. Reeves took place on the 25th of Sept., the day before she left—when I first gave charge of her, I made no charge of anything contained in the second box I made the charge before Major Willard—she was sent in custody to Surrey—a Surrey sergeant came down and took her into custody from there—the Magistrate did not remark that he thought my conduct was very strange; but Mr. Bennett, an attorney employed to protect her, took mitting every opportunity of insulting me in a very unbecoming manner—the Magistrate said, "It is a painful thing, but you are very right, and don't be afraid of being abused by this person"—Mr. Penryn, one of the com<lb/>mitting Magistrates, is a friend of mine—I was staying at his house at the time I took the box—I went with Mr. Penryn's warrant with the officer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270170"/>
               <p>from Sheen to apprehend her—Major Willard sent me for the warrant—he told me I could get one—it was necessary for me to go and make a deposition, and then I came with the officer and the box—Major Willard did not send me for the warrant, but he said, "If you want this thing gone into, you must go before a Surrey Magistrate and get a warrant"—I went and got Mr. Penryn's warrant, and returned to Brighton to take her into custody—Major Willard and Major Allen backed the warrant, and we went to the police station and waited for her—I had nothing to do with it then—it was out of my hands altogether—I do not know that it was the pri<lb/>soner's duty to keep an inventory of the things that were worn out, as they got worn out—I do not think it was by any means her duty to throw them aside as they were worn out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—our family went to Brighton on the 19th or 20th of Aug.—the prisoner went the day before I did—she went in the morning, the governesses and the children in the afternoon, and I went next day—while there, I heard of the box having been left at Mrs. Neale's, but I said nothing to the prisoner about it, until about a month after we had been at Brighton—I was speaking to her about something in her bills which I was not satisfied with, and she gave me warning to go that day month—I then said I had also something to say to her, and I spoke to her about her habits of drinking, which had reached my ears very much from all her fellow-servants and others—this she denied in the most strenuous way—I then said, "I understand that you sent a box to Mrs. Neale's cottage the day before we left for Brighton; and I wish to know why you did so, and what that box contains?"—she looked rather confused, and said, it contained a collection of things, towards her own housekeeping, but nothing whatever of mine, the could assure me, over and over again—she said, "There are towels, now, ma'am, you might think are yours, but when I was in such a place, I was on board wages, and was obliged to buy things of my own; but there is nothing of yours, I can assure you"—I said, "I do not understand, then, why you did not leave it openly in the store-room with the other ser<lb/>vants' boxes," for which she gave the most extraordinary foolish reason, that it was a very unpleasant thing to leave boxes in a store-room with the other servants' boxes, when in the spring another girl's boxes had been looked into—I said, "I do not know what you mean, Ann, but it is very unpleasant for masters and mistresses to be robbed; and if we find it out we shall follow it up"—she said, "Certainly"—I said, "I think it right to tell you, when I go back to Sheen, I shall examine the contents of that box which has given rise to suspicion among your fellow-servants; and as I have lost so much linen lately I shall look into all the servants' boxes, what is due to one servant is due to another"—she said I might, for there was nothing of mine in it—the result of our interview almost was that she would stay, for she explained everything away so, and I said I did not wish to part with her if she did not drink, and I said she had better go down to her fellow-servants and speak with them—in the meantime I had several things to convince me it was true—next morning she came and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270171"/>
               <p>told me she should not stay—I said, "Very well"—she said she should go because she saw I did believe all this, or something about it, and she should leave me—she went down and came up again in about half an hour, and said she should go that very day—I said, "To-day?"—the said, yes, she felt so unhappy in her mind, she should go that very day—I said then of course I should not give her a character—she went that day—Mr. Reeves was then absent at Sheen, and I desired her to come next week and have her wages paid—I did not ask her where she was going to stay at Brighton, but I knew from the servants—I knew she had friends at Brighton, and that she was going to some of them—her wages were twenty guineas a year—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles</hi>)—here is but one here that I can see a mark upon—this has been cut out—I can hardly tell whether these pieces form part of the same sheet, but I miss three pairs of these sheets—there were fourteen pairs when the list was made, and there are now but eleven pairs of sheets of this quality, servants' linen sheets—here I can see the letter "R" quite plainly—it has been rubbed evidently, but I can see it—it is done with marking-ink—the ink washes out very much, and it is rubbed, too, evidently—anybody can see that—this is quite plain, "F. R. 12" on this towel—I can hardly say whether we have missed towels, for we have bought many lately, and the list is not correctly made out—indeed I did not miss the sheets until I made out the list again yes<lb/>terday, at least the housemaid did—I intrusted the prisoner with the key of the linen closet at one time, when we were changing housemaids, till the new one came—I can swear to this table-cloth—the mark may have washed out, but I am perfectly certain it is ours—this other is an old common nursery one—it is mine—the prisoner at once admitted it was mine—the marks may have worn out, for they are very old—I have never missed them, for I trusted her with the key—this carpet is ours—there were some old dinner napkins, and a great many other things, but we only put aside such as we could identify—I thought everything that had been put by was marked, because there was a selection made—I cannot give a notion what these things are worth—I suppose if this sheet were whole it would be worth from 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never expressed a wish that the fact of the box being at Neale's should not be talked about by the servant.</p>

Q.</hi> Select from these articles those you can swear to, and put aside those you cannot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This piece of sheet, and this towel I can swear to, and these table-cloths—I swear to this table-cloth—it is exactly like ours—I do not see a mark on it—it is an old one—probably it would have been cut up for fish napkins or something of that sort—it is worn out for use in the dining-room probably—the sheet is certainly not worn out—I have not seen any holes or darns in it—I do not know whether some of the servants' sheets may not have holes in them—I hardly know how many servants were discharged while the prisoner was there—we had three or four housemaids, and two or three girls came on jobs for nursery-maids, and did not answer—we had a new footman while she was there, and my maid was changed—there were certainly not twenty changes—there may have been nine, ten, or twelve, but not regular servants—three new housemaids and a laundrymaid came—my own maid married and went away—the footman was new, and two or three nursery-girls—the prisoner was not cook and housekeeper—she was a sort of housekeeper—she kept the key of the store-room, and was the upper servant—her own sister was</p>

               <p>One of the servants who left—she persuaded me to take her as kitchen-girl, and she was turned away—I do not know whether this old dinner napkin is marked—I do not think it is, and I do not wish to swear to it—the others are all marked, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray did you ask the prisoner to stay with you, after she had given you notice to leave? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—she explained away her conduct, and got herself into good humour again—she said she should leave, because I suspected her dishonesty about her bills—I had complained of there being much more sugar used than was necessary, and of her saying there was some had up in the nursery, when there was not—5lbs. was gone in a very short time, and I said I should keep it henceforth, which affronted her, and she gave me warning—I do not think she kept an inventory during the time she had charge of the linen—I was ill shortly after she came—I looked very little to the linen—I paid the weekly bills, and always ex<lb/>amined them—she ordered in things occasionally, not entirely what she thought necessary, subject to me—I certainly exercised a discretion on the subject—I took the management of the household affairs to a degree—she ordered in sugar, and what was necessary for consumption in the house—I never sent any napkins down stairs to be used as dusters—nothing of the kind, and I should very much have disapproved of her doing so—I was not examined before the Grand Jury—I was at the court at Brighton, but was not examined.</p>

Iam kitchen-maid to Mr. Reeves—the day before we went to Brighton, the prisoner told me to take a box over to Mrs. Neale's cottage, and she would take care of it till she came from Brighton—it was a box covered with canvas, and fastened up—I took it over, and gave it to Mrs. Neale—I saw a box brought down to Brighton by Mr. Reeves sometime after—it appeared to be the same box that I carried to Neale's—the day before the prisoner left, when she came down from Mrs. Reeves, she said I was not to go up-stairs and say anything about that box, she did not want it named.</p>

I was at the Surrey theatre, and left about a quarter after twelve—Esworthy was with me—we left the theatre together, and went to a cigar shop two or three doors from the theatre—we afterwards went into the Bridge-house public-house in our way home, between the theatre and the Queen's bench prison—I went to the bar and saw both the prisoners in front of the bar, not standing together at first—there might be nearly twenty persons in the house altogether—there were two or three women, and the rest men—I afterwards observed the prisoners standing together—the first thing that occurred to me was, I was struck a severe blow on the left cheek by the prisoner Lyons—I had not spoken to either of them—I turned my head round to my left, where Lyons was, and said, "What is that for?"—I thought something might have occurred, and that it was an accidental blow—Esworthy tried to come to my assistance, but was prevented by Hodnott, who struck him a blow which knocked him back towards the corner—I did not see other persons prevent him—I then received another blow from Lyons, which knocked off my hat, and from that a silk hand<lb/>kerchief vanished—I was then struck another blow on the breast, and knocked on one side near the tap of the bar—Lyons then turned round, and, with his left hand, snatched my stock and pin—I had a watch in my left pocket, with a silver guard round my neck—I lost that, but do not know who took it—it went at the first blow I was struck—Lyons turned to the left, and escaped by the side door—I followed him as quick at I could out at the side door; but before I could get quite to the door, it was closed against me for about a minute—I got out, saw a constable outside, and gave him information—I saw Lyons running when I got out at the door, but lost sight of him—he was apprehended about twenty minutes or half an hour after—I have not seen my watch or handkerchief since—I have seen my stock and a portion of the pin in the hands of the constable—it was a union pin—the chain is gone from it, except three or four links—I have no doubt whatever of the prisoners being the men.</p>

I have known Dolby three years—I was in his company on the evening of the 14th of Oct. at the Surrey theatre—we left at about a quarter past twelve o'clock—we went into a cigar shop, and afterwards into the Bridge-house public-house, Borough-road, in our way home—there were fifteen or twenty persons standing at the bar—a girl spoke to us—I did not treat her—she drank out of the half-and-half which we had—while standing at the bar, Hodnott and one who is not in custody came up to me, and asked if I knew a young man named George, who, the person not in custody told me, was in the detec<lb/>tive force, and he went on telling me he would give any money to find him—I asked him what his other name was—he said Townsend, and I told him I did not know the name (he said he himself belonged to the detec<lb/>tive force, and was under the Forresters, and said he was stationed round the Bank) I then heard Dolby say, "What is that for?" and I saw him and Lyons scuffling together—as I was going to Dolby's assistance I received a severe blow from Hodnott, and fell down—on getting up Hodnott knocked me down again—I got up, and saw Lyons rush out of the house, and Dolby after him—there was one man at the door, who prevented Dolby going out—others surrounded and struck me—I got up, and put my hands up to my eyes to save them from being blackened, but I had a black eye the next morning—after receiving several severe blows for five or six minutes, I managed to get out of the house, and on going up the street I saw Dolby and the policeman talking together—I afterwards saw Lyons in custody (about one o'clock, or ten minutes after)—Hodnott remained behind—I saw him taken about one o'clock the same morning—I afterwards saw Dolby's pin, without the chain, found on the</p>

I had to search the prisoner in the cell one night last month—I do not remember what night it was—I think it was the 5th of Sept.—I think it was in the early part of the month—she took something from her bosom—I asked what it was—she said, "It is the money you are looking for,"(giving me two half-crowns,)" put it into your pocket, and say nothing about it, and I will never tell"—she repeated that several times, and said she was quite sure, if I told of it, it would transport her—I produce the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I solemnly swear I never said such a thing; I said it was what the gentleman gave me, and it was a hard thing to be locked up for nothing; she knows it is false, neither did she mention it to the inspector, or say a word of what she states now till she went before the Magistrate in the morning; the gentleman gave me the money, and he wanted it back again, after he had taken indecent liberties with me; I was with him from eleven o'clock; I met him against St. Thomas's-street, as the clock facing the hospital was striking eleven.</p>

               <p>the men going to dinner—I remained outside to have an eye to the bricklayers' tools—the prisoner was not employed there, but I saw him come round to the corner of the building where I sat having my dinner—I merely saw his face—I did not see whether he had anything or not—he said to me, "Where are the carpenters gone to dinner who work at this building?"—I said, "I do not know"—he walked off to the front of the building—in a few minutes I thought he had no business round there, as it was not a public thoroughfare, and I jumped up, took my dinner in my hand, and went round to the front of the building—in consequence of what a woman told me I followed the prisoner, and overtook him with the basket of tools on his back—I said, "Where are you going with these tools, mate?"—he said, "I am going to a fresh job"—I said, "I am Yery much mistaken if you have not taken these from our building"—he laid, "God bless you! I will go back with you"—he did so—I unlocked the back door—he went into the building and put the tools down—Mr. Ashworth said to me, "Is it the men's tools he has got?"—I said, "I do not know, he seems to say they are his own"—"They are my own," the prisoner said—I said to Mr. Ashworth, "Do you know how many baskets the carpenters have got?"—he said, "Three large ones, and one small one"—I went into every room, and could only find two large ones and one small one—I said to the prisoner, "You had better stop till the men come from dinner"—he said, "I shall lose my job; I know where the men go to dinner; I will go and make it all right that they are mine"—he then left the tools in the building and said to Mr. Ashworth, "I will leave my tools in your charge while I go to the men, to satisfy them that the tools are mine"—the prisoner and I then walked off to the Com<lb/>passes, where the men dine—when we got nearly there he said, "You go in and tell the men to come out"—I said, "You had better come in with me"—he went with me. very near to the door, and took a pipe out of his pocket—he said, "Go in and tell them to come out"—I left him out<lb/>side and went in, tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and said, "I want you"—I then went out, and the prisoner was gone—I am quite cer<lb/>tain he is the man—he was dressed in a white flannel jacket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Shaw, linen-draper, High-street, Southwark—the prisoner was his cook. On the 18th of Oct., about ten o'clock at night, I went to the room occupied by myself—there is a spare bed in that room—as I went up stairs, I heard a rustling noise—I went into my room—there was no candle there, but I had one in my hand—I looked under the spare bed and saw the prisoner, and under the other bed I saw two parcels—I asked the prisoner who the first parcel belonged to—she said, to herself, and the other to Mrs. Cornelius—I opened the first parcel, and in it were three blankets, the property of my employer—I separated one of them from the other—it was one of a pair, of which I had sold one the day previous—in the other bundle I found fifty-three yards of calico, which was my employer's, and had his mark on—I then, with the officer, searched the prisoner's box, and found five cambric handkerchiefs, a length of lawn, and a piece or two of calico, which were my employer's, and had our private mark on them—these articles had not been sold—the prisoner was to have left on the Monday following.</p>

               <p>I was in Waterloo-road—the prisoner came up to me two or three times—I told her to be gone—she went on, and made a stand still—the officer came, and said, "You will lose your watch and your guard"—I went on down Webber-street, and the prisoner knocked off my hat—I went to get it, and she gave me a sudden thrust, and took my watch off,' whether over my head or what, I do not know—I went and got the officer, and told him—I saw the prisoner again the next night at a public-house—she asked me to have some gin—I said, "No, I want to talk to you—what have you done with that property of mine?"—she said, "What property?"—I said, "That watch and things"—she made dreadful oaths, and said she was in bed by half-past ten that night—I said the best thing she could do was to come with me—I told her if she had pawned it to give me the duplicate, and I would say no more—she then said she wished she might be struck blind if the was the person—she ran off—I went and caught her, and brought her back to Oakley-street till an officer came, and she was brought to the station—I am sure she is the person.</p>
