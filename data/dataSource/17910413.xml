I kept it that night, and on the morrow morning I presented it for payment, and it was refused; I did not see the prisoner for half a year or more, until he was taken up and at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner at the bar ever tell you where he lived, and what he was? - He informed me he was a cheesemonger in Covent Garden, and dealt in the wholesale way.</p>
               <p>Did he say what part? - He did not, but he gave me this written direction as his address.</p>
               <p>(The direction produced.)</p>
               <p>What else did he say at that time he bought the horse? - He said he had nothing to take the horse home with, on which I lent him a pair of spurs and a bridle.</p>
               <p>After you found the note was refused at Mess. Prescotts and Co. what did you do in consequence of that? - I went immediately to New-street, but could not find any such person there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You had a conversation of some length with the prisoner at Waltham-abbey fair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He bargained very hard about this horse? - Not very hard.</p>
               <p>He offered at first twenty pounds? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>What was the price? - I informed you before.</p>
               <p>You asked him twenty-five pounds, and he said it was too much? - He did.</p>
               <p>How long might you be settling, or endeavouring to settle at the fair? - When he came to Enfield we settled in a very short time.</p>
               <p>First of all answer my question; you did not agree at all at Waltham-abbey fair? - We did not.</p>
               <p>Did not he offer you as low as twenty pounds at that fair? - He did not.</p>
               <p>He did offer you something less? - He did.</p>
               <p>You gave him your address at Enfield, and he came to you? - He asked me for it.</p>
               <p>You was some time before you could agree at Enfield? - No, very little time.</p>
               <p>You know there was something, you did not agree, and he went over to the inn? - Yes, but he soon returned.</p>
               <p>So, in point of fact, there were three conversations about the horse, before you agreed together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, at the time he gave you this draft, did not he tell you he could not be able to make up the price unless you would take a draft he received at the fair? - I am certain he said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not say he received it at the fair? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not he tell you he had not cash enough to pay for it? - I cannot say whether he said that, I understood that I was to have had money for it; but appearing to be a creditable person, I thought the note would be equally the same.</p>
               <p>He said he had not got money enough, and he gave you the draft? - He did.</p>
               <p>You say he told you that he lived in Covent Garden, and you went to New-street, how came you to go there? - From the directions he gave, which said New-street, Covent Garden.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130007"/>Mr. Prescott has a considerable seat in your neighbourhood? - He has, and therefore I did not doubt the credit of that note.</p>
               <p>You heard afterwards of your saddle and bridle, that it had been burnt in the stable where the horse was lodged? - There was such a thing mentioned.</p>
               <p>Did not you learn it from the prisoner himself? - He told me so.</p>

               <p>Then, in point of fact, there had been a fire in some stable where the prisoner had deposited this horse? - I cannot learn that as a fact, he said so at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did not you learn there had been a fire at the stable where he had deposited the horse? - I never heard of the horse.</p>
               <p>Did not you learn, in point of fact, that the stable where the prisoner had deposited the horse had been burned? - I never learned it, I knew there was a fire in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. How long after the sale of the horse at Enfield, did the fire happen in Long-lane? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. This trial was put off last sessions on account of his witnesses not being ready, and he was ordered to be ready by eight o'clock this morning.</p>

               <p>I was in the house at the same time, in the kitchen, and heard the door opened, I just let my young mistress out, and shut the door immediately, it opens with a spring latch inside and out; I called out, who is there? nobody answered; I met the last witness coming from the gate, who said we had been robbed; I then went to the gate, and saw the man standing by the goods in the field, with his apron in his hand; and we both cried stop thief! I picked up one bundle, and the last witness picked up the other, and he run away; he had his apron in his hand just going to tie up the bundles in it; he was pursued and taken, and brought back to the house. There was no other person in the field but himself and us two women.</p>

               <p>How do you know it is Yostus's house? - Because some of my men lodge there; Yostus came out with them, and the carmen walked in the middle of the road, and Yostus on the pavement, up as far as Bond-street, and then they joined in company together; when they came out of the house, the two men went back to the waggon, and put both the empty sacks into the waggon, where they took them from; they were both taken from the first waggon; I took my horse, went to Mr. Wylde in Thames-street, and informed him, and went back to Tyburn-turnpike to Mr. Kinloth's, and I saw the men there, and the coals all shot.</p>

               <p>How is it you happened to know he took a different direction when he saw you? - Because he had the appearance of being confused.</p>

               <p>They joined again a little distance after that? - They did.</p>
               <p>And then Yostus went about his business, whatever it might be? - I know nothing about that.</p>

               <p>Did you order coals to be brought to you on the 7th of April? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any coals on that day? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any brought into your house? - I cannot positively say; I saw nothing, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me put you in mind of your situation: a man lodges with you, and stands charged here with receiving stolen goods, and these goods, evidently the property of Mr. Wylde; remember you stand here in a very intricate situation yourself? - I heard somebody go down stairs, I was ill in bed, in the morning early, I cannot positively say what time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You have a good many lodgers in your house? - I have, about eleven.</p>
               <p>They have not all separate places for their coals? - They generally keep them in their own rooms; there is a vault in the cellar for the first floor, and one for the second floor.</p>
               <p>Court to Levi. When was you first informed of this? - Not till Mr. Sharpe informed me.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the coals? - I did not see the coals at all.</p>
               <p>When you heard of this, had not you the curiosity to go and look if any coals had been brought in or no? - I did not, I did not like to bring myself into trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you went the only way to bring yourself into trouble; is this man a lodger at your house? - He is, and finds his own goods.</p>
               <p>What part of the house does he lodge in? - In the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court to Sharp. Have you seen whether there had been any coals fresh put down into that cellar? - Between eleven and twelve o'clock the same day, when the two Mr. Wyldes came up to my house, we went down to the cellar, and there was the appearance of two sacks of coals fresh shot.</p>
               <p>Did you see the landlord of the house? - I did, I told him particularly of it; but I believe he did not go down to see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How do you know it was Yostus's apartments where the coals were seen? - His wife told me they were his coals.</p>
               <p>Now if they had been carried into that house, and you had been shewn a quantity of coals, without this information, should you have known there were two sacks? - I should, I am very well used to them.</p>

               <p>Where did you see her with the things? - It was in the back court, behind the house; she had then Susannah York's silk in her hand, and the black silk in her bosom, and the silk handkerchief in her hand; I stopped her, and took her by her arm, and led her to my own room, and took the silk and the handkerchief from the prisoner, and the officer has them now.</p>

On the 8th of January last, in the present year, about seven in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came to the house of Mr. Swainson, and was shewn into my office; he said he wanted a quantity of vegetable syrup, and begged to know what was the price of the medicine for exportation; I told him the allowance of the medicine, when exported, reduced it to eight shillings a bottle; he then demanded what would be the amount of two dozen when packed up? I told him, nine pounds, eighteen shillings; he then paused a moment, and said as it was to go abroad, at least a considerable part of it, he would have twice tha quantity, and asked what would be the amount of that? I answered, nineteen pounds, sixteen shillings; he then said that he wanted two bottles left out for the use of a lady who had received a paralytic stroke; and desired it might be sent to his house on the following morning, before nine o'clock; he was going out of town, he said, precisely at nine o'clock, and he would take them in his carriage; I then asked him his address? his reply was, Captain

               <p>"It does not signify, I am going to spend the evening at the Cocoa-tree, and shall get change directly." From the mention of that house, and knowing none but real gentlemen could resort there, it removed in some measure the doubts of my mind, which I had previously entertained, but to farther convince myself, I stepped out to a neighbour's house, to ask his advice; but he not being at home, I returned in a minute, and gave him the change for the note, first desiring him to put his name on the back of the bill, which he did, by the name of

               <p>Mr. Schoen, Prisoner's Counsel. This transaction happened on the 8th of January, at about eight in the evening. Where did you happen to be when the person who first called on this business came? - In the compting-house.</p>
               <p>How does that happen to be situated? - On the right hand passage.</p>
               <p>Was you called out of this compting-house at this time? - No; it is the practice of the house, to shew any one that comes, in to me.</p>
               <p>This person came then in to you? - He did.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He had on a drab-coloured coat, boots, and a round hat.</p>
               <p>How many candles do you usually sit with in this compting-house? - I should imagine I had two; sometimes I have one, and sometimes I have two.</p>
               <p>This transaction could not have taken up a long space of time? - It might take up five or ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Then, in course, the person, whoever he was, could not have been above seven or eight minutes in the room with you; and now, can you be sure from this transient view you had of this man, and by candlelight, you can swear to his person? - I could wish I had the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>It was not a long view? - No, it was not; but I must do it in point of conscience.</p>

               <p>I am one of the officers of Bow-street: I assisted in the apprehension of the prisoner, on Saturday, the 19th of March, in company with Mr. Clarke, Macmanus, and Jealous; we went to a house in the City Road, Islington, No. 45; Jealous and I went up two pair of stairs, and there we saw the prisoner at the bar; Jealous and I looked at him; says I, Charles, seize his hands; he did, and I searched him; in his breeches-pocket, in his purse, I found these seven notes: (produced.) Five of Plymouth bank, two of Worcester, and one of Birmingham; I found a watch, which was delivered to him at Bow-street; but I took a key off from it, which was hanging to the chain of the watch; and that key opened two trunks which are here.</p>

               <p>Have you ever been in the prison with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed respecting this note? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>When did you go to the prisoner? - Two days before I received this paper.</p>
               <p>What passed? - He wanted me to put a padlock on the door of the two pair of stairs, which a gentlewoman had taken.</p>
               <p>Was that gentleman with the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>At the time you went into the prison, what passed between you and Mr. Kelsey? - Mr. Kelsey desired me to put a padlock on the door; and I told him I had the plainest objection in the world to the doing of that, as he had not taken the room, nor had I ever seen him in the house.</p>
               <p>On what door did he want you to put the padlock? - The door of the room which the gentlewoman had taken.</p>
               <p>Who was this gentlewoman? - She was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Never enquired her name? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see her at Bow-street? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never see the prisoner after you had received this paper? - Never, only at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Clarke at any time come to your house? - He might, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Did any body come to your house after you had seen the prisoner in prison? - Not afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had you then before this, seen any thing taken away from his room? - They took away something in a coach, but I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Look at the trunk that stands before you: did you never see that trunk? - No, never; I was not at home when they took it away.</p>
               <p>At Bow-street, these papers were delivered to you; was any thing said about these papers; what passed about them? - I was asked if I had received these papers from Mr. Kelsey? I said I received these papers, and understood that they came from him, but I could not swear it.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner, or did he not, make any answer or observation on your saying it? - On my oath, I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>What became of your papers? - On that, Mr. Clarke took them.</p>
               <p>Were they read? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>In the presence of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner make any observations? - I cannot recollect he did.</p>
               <p>What has become of the rest of the goods at your apartments? - The person who took the apartments, came and slept in the house; and since that, I believe she has disposed of the goods to some broker; and they were moved the last week.</p>
               <p>You do not know where the lady lived? - No; she paid me, and removed the goods.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Clarke. Was you there at the last time the witness was speaking? - I was.</p>
               <p>Was this paper produced, we have been speaking of, at Bow-street? - It was, and

               <p>Was this notice read in the presence of the prisoner? - It was, but I do not know he said any thing.</p>
               <p>Court to E. Saunders. When you was before the magistrate, at Bow-street, you was examined, and your examination taken in writing, and signed by you; now be careful what you are about. Did you at any time say when you was at Bow-street, that the prisoner at the bar had told you that the woman who had brought the goods, was an imprudent woman, and that he wished to take care of the goods for himself and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130019"/>her? - If she was his wife, she did not tell me so.</p>
               <p>You said some woman left goods at your lodgings; did that observation apply to the woman that left the goods? - I should imagine it applied to her.</p>

               <p>Was you talking about any body else, or to any body else? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen to Mr. Clarke. I think you said, that as to that note, when it was read in Bow-street, you did not recollect the prisoner said any thing about it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Schoen to Mr. Clarke. That trunk was found in Warner-street, not at his lodgings? - In Warner-street, where his wife took us to the lodgings.</p>

I went out into the yard between eight and ten in the evening, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130021"/>heard a monstrous beating, which appeared to me to be in Mr. Pritchard's room; I staid, and continued some time listening, about a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts; and I heard Mrs. Pritchard's voice, crying out, O dear! O dear! I know I deserve it, several times; I heard him say something, and am certain it was the prisoner's voice, but do not recollect what he said; I was out in the yard also on the Friday night, and heard him quarrelling with her; it might be six or seven o'clock; I did not see him, but I heard him, and I did suppose that it was in the shop; I went round into the yard and I saw Mrs. Pritchard lay at the bottom of the stairs; the prisoner was behind her; she lay with her head up the stairs, and seemed very near spent; I saw her gasp a little; on which some assistance came, and I went away.</p>

             called me into the yard, and told me Pritchard was beating his wife; and I went into an apartment, a two pair of stairs room, and looked out of window, and heard Mrs. Pritchard say, I know I deserve my beating, pray have mercy upon me, and do not beat me so; I went out of that room into the shuffle-board room, which window was nigher to the prisoner's apartment, and there I heard her say so several times, and heard the beating, and heard the prisoner swear very much.</p>
               <p>How long might this continue? - I cannot positively say; I thought it was near half an hour; it ceased for some time in the course of the half hour, and then it began again.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. These unfortunate people had a child? - Yes. At last her voice grew so faint I could not distinguish what she said; on the ceasing of the beating I saw the prisoner come down into the one pair of stairs room, and stand at the window with the candle in his hand; this was between nine and ten at night; and the upper room was left dark.</p>
               <p>What more past? - I do not know, I declare, I was so frightened; I went down to the bar, and waited a bit, and looked out, and saw no light, and they were quiet, so I thought all was over. I never saw her past Thursday morning: I know nothing of Friday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In answer to what he said, you heard the woman say she deserved it? - I did.</p>

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner. On Thursday night, between nine and ten, I heard a noise, as though it was a person beating another with a stick; I stopped and listened a bit, and heard the sound as though it came from Mr. Pritchard's back window; I opened my window, and called out Mr. Pritchard several times, but nobody answered me; this was from my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130022"/>back window, up one pair of stairs; I shut my window and went up two pair of stairs, and called out Mr. Pritchard again; and I heard Mr. Pritchard say, do not you deserve it? I heard no more that night. On Friday evening, about seven o'clock, I heard Mr. Pritchard swearing at his wife; they were then down stairs on the floor where they shoe the horses, damning and swearing that he could not help her up; I opened my back window, and called out, Mr. Pritchard, what are you doing to your wife? he answered me, that she was in liquor, and asked me if I would come round; I went round to his house, and saw Mrs. Pritchard lay all along on the bottom of the ground where they shoe their horses; I did not see her face till they began to move her: when I first came in he was trying to lift her up; when I saw her face, I said, Mr. Pritchard, if she has been a drinking, it is not that that has made her so, she is a dying; he told me, that she might die and be damned; I told him that was a very sad situation; that she was not to lie there in that manner, that she was to be taken, or something to be done with her, up stairs; after that some other people came in, and he brought down a pillow; she had an handkerchief about her head, which was stuffed with hard dry blood; the pillow likewise was stained with dry blood. I came away and saw no more.</p>
               <p>You told us that you expressed yourself to the prisoner, that she was a dying; did she appear to be in that state at that time? - She appeared in that state; as though she was well nigh dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never went into the house on Thursday evening? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor did you hear the answer that the wife made when he told her she deserved it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>It was on his request you came into his house; the prisoner calling you? - It was on his calling me.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, else you would not have gone in? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a lodger to Mrs. Axtell. On Friday evening I heard the prisoner swear very much at his wife, about eight o'clock, damning her eyes that she was drunk; I went into the house, I saw the deceased lying on the bottom of the stairs, on the ground, and her husband over her with a candle; and when I saw her I thought she was dead; I called Mr. Bush and the neighbours in, and I went away, and came back again in less than a quarter of an hour; Mr. Purcell, the surgeon, was there then; he was there at the time she spoke; when I came the second time she was carried up stairs, and on her bed, and the prisoner there too.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did she die? - It did not exceed half an hour from that time.</p>
               <p>At the time that the conversation passed between her and Mr. Purcell had any observations been made on the state of her bruises? - All her side was of one blackness, up to her arm pits, one of her fingers broke, the back of her hand bruised, a cut over her eye, on her head, and her eye black: Mr. Purcell asked her who made her in that manner? she said, her husband; he asked her who gave her that cut in her head? she said, her husband.</p>
               <p>How near was the prisoner at the bar to the bed, at the time this conversation passed? - Standing over the bed with a candle, assisting the doctor while he bled her arm.</p>
               <p>Could he hear the questions and answers? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Did he make any answer or observations on it? - He went and sat down in a chair, and I cannot tell what he said.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - Yes; I told him, if he did not run away he would be hanged; he said, if he was, he would not run away.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him about the condition his wife was in? - I believe I did; but I cannot recollect it, I was in such a fright; he went out of the room, and I did not know what became of him, and I continued with the poor woman till she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130023"/>died, and that was within fifteen minutes after she spoke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The time you saw the prisoner assisting at the bed, he was holding a candle, seemingly assisting the surgeon as much as he could? - Yes; he was.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon and apothecary: I am an assistant to Mr. Thistle on Snow-hill. On Friday evening, the 18th of March, I was called upon to assist this poor woman; I saw her lying on the bed in a languid state, apparently dying: when I first went into the room, and seeing her in that situation, I administered something to her, and she seemed to come to herself very much; on which I thought bleeding might be of some service to her; I turned up her gown, and perceived a little blood on the shift sleeve; on that I turned to the prisoner, and asked him what was the cause of that? he said, in a whisper, that she had her courses on her a day or two before; the words he used was, that she had got her months; I ordered all the men in the room out, and had her stripped, and found all her side and her arm very much contused and black, and lifting up her petticoats I perceived her thigh to be in the same situation, very black, and also her arm, and all round entirely from her breast round to her back all the way the same; I did not observe the condition her belly was in till the next day; one of the women said, she had received a wound on her head, that led me to take off her head clothes and examine, on which I observed a contuse wound on the side of the head, the back part: I will not take upon me to say whether it was done by a blow with a blunt instrument, or by a fall.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long did you suppose that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130024"/>bruise might have been given? - Not that evening.</p>
               <p>I observed the scull; the scull laid perfectly bare about a quarter of an inch, the inner membrane that covers it being divided.</p>
               <p>You put some questions to the woman? - I did.</p>
               <p>At the time you put these questions was the prisoner at the bar in a condition to hear? - He was, certainly.</p>
               <p>At the time you put these questions did it appear to you the woman was in a dying state? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to be sensible at the time? - As much as a dying person possibly could be so; I saw no symptoms of derangement.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - I knelt down by her bed side, and said, in the name of God, my good woman, if it is possible for you to speak, tell me who it was that bruised you in this manner? she said, my husband; I asked her again, who gave her the wound on the head? she said, my husband: on that the prisoner at the bar got off from the bed, and went towards the fire, and sat down, and said, he wished she had been dead seven years ago; I gave her some more stuff, and each time I gave her the stuff the husband procured me the water; I shortly after went, and when I was going I said, my good man, do not be under any apprehension, she will do very well; I told him so because I was afraid, after the confession of the woman, that he would make off; but I told the women she would not live above ten minutes. The next day on taking off the cap of the brain I found a small quantity of extravasated blood lodged in the brain; externally there was a very slight fracture; internally there was no fracture, but a rupture of one of the blood vessels by a fall, and this rupture was just immediately under the part where the membrane had been divided; I also then observed that the bottom of her belly was very black, by a lodgement of blood; the middle finger of her hand likewise broke, and her hand very much bruised.</p>

               <p>I would ask you, though that cannot be necessary, could all this complication of bruises be occasioned by a fall? - No; certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Purcell, by your judgment what occasioned the death of this woman? - I believe the blow on the head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. From the appearance you was not capable of saying whether that fracture on the head arose from a blow or a fall? - I could not, only as she told me.</p>

               <p>What occasioned the death of this woman? - No doubt from the external violence of these bruises, the situation of her body, without the fracture on her scull, must have so affected the internal parts, particularly the thigh and groin, that I should judge she could not survive; but more particularly by the fracture on the scull.</p>

None of these keys unlocking the door, how could I open it and lock it again; I had no instrument to open it with.

               <p>Did you see whether it was joined to the lead that was left, or separated? - Intirely separated; it came away without the least obstruction; my servant came and took it up.</p>
               <p>Court. What light had you? - The watchman put his candle up by the help of a stick, and my servant took it, and delivered it to the watchman.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a patrole of St. James's parish. My partner and I was going along on Thursday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130040"/>morning, we made a halt, and saw a man within two doors of Mrs. Morgan's; we made a run, and seized him by the collar, and the other two came off the house; they jumped down, I saw them; and they ran from the house; Swinney was the man I came up to in the street, and stopped him, and he never got out of my hands; the others ran; my partner took one half way down the street; and he called to the watchman, and he stopped the other; I lost sight of them when they turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough for you to know the same men, and are you sure that they are the same men you saw in the house? - I can, from their dress; I saw them in custody in less than a minute.</p>
               <p>How did they get down? - Down by the spout and rail; we took all three to the watch-house, and came back again to Mrs. Morgan, when we found there was a piece gone, and a piece rolled up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You have told his lordship that you saw them coming down by laying hold of the spout, then you did not see the rope that was hanging down? - There was no rope there.</p>
               <p>How high was it from the ground? - About ten feet.</p>
               <p>Did not one let himself down by his hands? - They came nearly down both together, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Swinney. Did you see me near the place? - I did.</p>
               <p>I would wish to ask whether you saw me run or no? - I cannot tell that particularly.</p>
               <p>Peatt to Crutchford. What distance from Mrs. Morgan's house might you be when you took Swinney? - About eight or ten yards.</p>
               <p>He is a young man, rather strong? - He is rather strongish.</p>
               <p>You was using your hands very attentively with reference to him, and your eyes with reference to the other two? - I did.</p>
               <p>What sort of a light did you use at this time? - We carry no light.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About half past two.</p>
               <p>Then the lights in the street were almost out? - No; there were people about to light them.</p>
               <p>However that might be, you say that the two men, that were ten yards from you, you could know them again? - I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>No; I do not doubt that; but you may be mistaken of men that you did not see come back for a pretty length of time? - I am certain they are the men.</p>
               <p>What circumstance has led you to suppose they are the men? had they round hats or cocked ones? - Round ones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watson. Please you, my lord, I had a cocked one all the time.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole. About half past two in the morning my partner told me he saw a man standing down the street; we went down, and Swinney made towards us; I stopped him, and asked him what business he had there? he said, he was a gentleman's servant out of place, and lived in Tottenham-street; just as I had said the word I heard a rush, and saw two men come down the wall of Mrs. Morgan's house, and run down Queen-street; I ran after, and caught them about the middle; I stopped Watson, and called out to the watchman to stop Pybus; I saw him take him; we carried them to St. James's watch-house; we found two knives on them; and we made a charge of them on suspicion, and came back to Mrs. Morgan's house, and called her up.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, the 26th of February last, I was with Mr. Young, and coming to his house I saw a parcel of people at his door. When I went in I was told I had been robbed of a watch; my sister said, I have got the watch, she shewed me it immediately; I said, this is Mr. Young's watch which I had to repair: I had repaired the same watch for Mr. Young, about a year ago; the watch was delivered to Mr. Young in my presence, and Mr. Young produced it at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130042"/>Sir Sampson Wright's office. I found the box and case much bruised, and the glass broke. The prisoner was taken to Bow-street that same night.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the man when you came home? - In my sister's shop, in the same place where I work.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me where the watch was before you went? - It was in my drawer, and there was another watch in the same drawer, separated, which I had not repaired.</p>
               <p>What time did you go out? - About a quarter before six.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that when you went out, that watch was in that drawer, and that the watch given you when you came home, was the same left in that drawer? - I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Was any body present in the shop that see this watch delivered to you? - Yes, the two witnesses, the man that took the prisoner, and the man that picked up the watch, were both in the shop at the same time.</p>

On going into the house, I asked Mrs. Beadle if she had got a screw-driver to send to her brother; without any hesitation, or looking at the drawer, she told me she had lost a watch; I immediately ran after the man, and a gentleman who is a patrole came and seized me, and detained me.

               <p>I am a plumber and glazier; on the 21st of January I was at work on the top of the Ship at Stepney, facing the church; I saw two men on the top of the church pulling at something, as though it was the lead; the church parapet raises about four feet, I saw their backs, and when they saw me, they appeared to use a rule as if measuring the lead; I went down, and said, there are two men on the top of the top of the church, doing something they should not do, it is fit somebody should go to them, and the grave-digger went to them, and brought them into the public-house; I am sure the prisoner is one; they said they worked for Mr. Meadows. Whilst these two was there, my iron was in the fire; observation was made that they were going to prayers; one of them said, that makes no difference, we can go to work; so they went on the top of the church again.</p>

When I came back to do my work, he was out, and was gone from twelve to one; the prisoner came to my door and asked me for that key to go out; I told him I would not. From curiosity I went up to see what way the church was made; and I saw a chopper like a sugar chopper, and looked about for the prisoner, but could not see him there; on Sunday week following I heard there was four hundred pounds weight of lead gone.</p>

There was a pane of glass broke of the factory; I did not see it the night before, nor the pane taken out, till after I returned from the City magistrates at Guild-hall: the room is a stoving room, where the goods are dried, and that room has glass windows, small panes; and one small pane was taken out, by which they could take away the piece of gauze.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did the prisoner make any resistance? - No.</p>
               <p>- ELDEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable of the night; I received the gauze of the last witness, who brought it to the watch-house, and have kept it ever since; I am sure that is the man he brought in with the gauze.</p>

I told him I had not so much money in my pocket, I had but 5 s. I gave it him, and went to Grub-street; my wife was not there; I wanted to get a lodging, but could not; I saw an opening where I thought I might lie down there, where I went to sleep, and these people took me.</p>

               <p>I keep a tavern in Goodman's-fields. On Thursday, the 24th of February, the prisoner at the bar, in company with another man, came into my house; after they had been about two hours, they asked the waiter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130054"/>to send in the master of the house; I went to them and asked them their business; the prisoner told me he had got some property to deliver into my hands, to take care of for him until morning; he gave me two twenty pound notes, and two tens: I know the name subscribed to the ten pound note, I know is Gethen; on the morning of the 25th, I delivered them to him again; they both stopped in my house that night; in the morning, upon their asking what was to pay, the waiter took in the bill, and they sent out one of the bank notes, which I changed, and took for the reckoning; in the course of the day they returned again, and they delivered me three notes and six guineas in cash, to keep for them until the morning; they staid in the house that night also; in the morning, a man who dresses my hair sent up to me, that he had something to communicate particularly; and he told me he had seen some handbills in the city, that gave a description of the person he had seen in the yard; I desired him to go and tear down one of the bills, and bring it to me, that I might compare it with the notes; while he was gone I fetched a constable and secured him. When the hair-dresser came back, we compared the numbers of the notes, and found them to be the same.</p>

               <p>When I had these notes, I chanced to drop them going along, a man picked them up; I asked him for them, and he gave them to me, and looking at them I found one short, and I was afraid to go home.</p>

The first thing I saw was a razor laying on the bed; I says there is the instrument that hath done it; where is the woman. Frank turned round to the right-hand, to the bed, and says here she is; she was laying at the head of that bed on the floor. I went to her, and says, Mrs. Taylor, are you dead? my dear; she said no: I said I shall take a pillow, and put it under your head; she said, hold my head, Mrs. Junor; the people rushed into the room; she said hush, let me die easy and quiet; I repeated these words to the people, and said go fetch a surgeon for her; I lifted up her shift, and saw her bowels laying on the floor. Immediately one Surgeon Price came; as soon as he came in, he said, O the woman is a dead woman, there can be nothing done: says I, Mr. Price the woman is in a dismal situation; cannot she be moved off the floor? At this time her bowels were laying on the floor, her right arm almost cut off, and the other arm cut about the wrist, and the other parts of her body cut, and her thighs violently cut to the bone, about the middle: I said, you that have a good heart, stay in the room, and let the rest walk out, and let other assistance come in to help the woman on the bed. We got her on the bed, instantly Surgeon Cook came; he said, my dear Mrs. Taylor, as long as there is life there is hopes.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did she die? - She lived all night sensible.</p>
               <p>Do you think, from that appearance, that she was in a dying state? - Yes, she told us that she was sensible she was dying: I says to the deceased, would you have Mr. Baxter to pray over you? I sent for him, and the gates were shut, it was so late. I looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130057"/>round the room and found a bible, and read to her, that I might be of as much service as I possibly could to her. A gentlewoman, one Mrs. Man, came into the room, and said to her, how did it happen Mrs. Taylor? she said, we had a little drop of something hot, and went to bed, and there was agreeable together; and she said that she did all that lay in her power to please him in bed, when they were connected together; and he said that she could do nothing for him, for on the Friday night she had slipt out of the house, and she had lain with Mr. Walker; he turned his back to her, and she turned her back to him, and prayed that he might go to sleep, and thought that he was asleep: instantly he turned again, and what she told me his words were, I cannot remember; but she got out of bed, to jump out of the window.</p>
               <p>Did she say why? - She might say why; but I cannot repeat the words she said; that he came with a penknife and cut her so; I said, my dear, it was a razor; no, she instantly said, it was a penknife. During the reading, I asked her if she would have a little drop of wine; she said, if my wounds were as found as my heart, I should live yet; give me a little drop. When Surgeon Cook came she said the same as she had said before to me. I staid with her till she died, she was sensible from that time till six in the morning, and about half after six she died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. You have been neighbours with the prisoner and the deceased some time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you been intimate with them for some time? - Never very intimate, any more than good morning or good evening.</p>
               <p>You visited much? - Never, as I know of.</p>
               <p>She said that her husband had accused with sleeping with

               <p>When they went to bed they were in very good friendship, they bid one another good night, and then turned round: how long do you understand it was that she laid between the time of his turning about, and the time that she got out of bed? - I cannot tell, I did not ask that question.</p>
               <p>When you came first to the house, at the threshold of the door, without being asked, he said that his wife was dead, and that he would surrender himself? - He said, here I am, Mr. Thompson.</p>
               <p>You do not know, as you have not visited the prisoner and his wife, what sort of a man he was before? - I have seen her with violent bruises.</p>
               <p>Are you able to state, from what you know, whether the prisoner had been at all deranged in his senses? - Never, since he came into the parish, or into London.</p>
               <p>Now the poor woman said, and you are sure she said, the wounds were made with a penknife; and when she spoke to Mr. Cooke, the surgeon, she likewise continued in the same story, and said it was done with a penknife? - She did.</p>

               <p>I am a widow woman living in St. Catharine's; I have known the prisoner and his deceased wife five or six years. The deceased was a very sober, honest, industrious woman, worked very hard, was a good wife, and tender mother; I was setting up up with her the night she died: about one or two o'clock, while a person was reading by her, and she did not know I was in the room, she called out to me, Mrs. Francis, rub my feet, I am troubled with the cramp; after that we joined in prayer, and praying for the family, she desired me to stop, and wished me to come to her head, and told me, mind what I am going to say to you: I am crossing the water to Jordan, I am not crossing the water in a boat, but taking my steps minutely; I then asked her how the misfortune happened; then she began and told me how they had some words on Friday, that he beat her most cruelly, and she went out, and staid out all night; that she returned on Saturday to make it up, and in the afternoon he wanted to be agreeable, but she told him she could not yield directly to do as man and wife did, in the afternoon, but every thing was very agreeable, nothing passed amiss, they had their diet and tea together,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130058"/>and they supped at night, and they had a pint of two-penny, and made it hot; after that they read together, and went to bed, and had that together, which man and wife have together; and he grumbled because she was not altogether agreeable to his mind; afterward they turned back to back: she lay still for some minutes, he was grumbling; this while she said nothing: he put his hand outside the bed, and took a knife out of his pocket, and began to cut; after he had cut her, she got out of bed, to the foot of the children's bed, where they lay, to get them to cry out for assistance, and he followed her, and knocked her down; she got up, and got to the window to help herself, and then he knocked her down again, and cut those dismal wounds. After that he turned to go down stairs, and came down three stairs, and went back again to her, and asked her whether she was dead; she said she was not quite dead; he asked her if she would forgive him; she said she would forgive him, but there was a higher power to ask forgiveness of. He then said, as he had had his will of her, he would go down stairs and kill Walker, who lived next door, a man who is a very honest sober man, a good husband, and a tender father; she then desired on her death bed, that as her husband had taken her blood of her, some good Christian might see and take his.</p>
               <p>How long after this conversation was it that the poor creature died? - She died at half after six, and this was about half after four; at a quarter before six the doctor came, and she said that she thought the doctor might give her a comfortable draught, as she seemed to want to go to sleep,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When she talked about Jordan, did you think she was then in her perfect senses? - I did.</p>
               <p>There had been some words, and the difference between them was perfectly settled? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They had been as man and wife, and she had not given him satisfaction, and the prisoner grumbled, and then he put his hand out of bed, and took a knife and cut her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After he cut her he went out, and then returned again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that there could not a moment elapse before he returned, and then he came round, and then he knocked her down? - No, Sir, you are wrong, he did all his execution before, and returned, and asked her if she would forgive him.</p>
               <p>And then he said he would kill Mr. Walker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She mentioned all this to you after she had complained of a pain in her head? - She did.</p>
               <p>There had been some ground of jealousy? I believe not.</p>
               <p>At least the said he had charged her with it? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with these neighbours? - Some time.</p>
               <p>Have you visited together much? - No, only as a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Francis, I suppose this woman used to go to meeting? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>I suppose so, by this language of talking of going over the river Jordan? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. Between nine and ten, on the 20th of March, at night, I entered the room, and found the woman laying on the floor, with a blanket over her, and a pillow under her head. I turned the blanket aside, and the first thing that came to my view, was three-fourths of her bowels lay on the floor; on this, with the assistance of a couple of women I got her on the bed; I examined further, and found two wounds on the neck, about three or four inches long, and one on the wrist of the right arm, a mortal wound, because it had divided some of the arteries, and a large wound on the fleshy part of the left thigh, pretty near the body, six or seven inches long, and several other wounds, about nineteen in all: after I had been in the room about twenty minutes, I went home, as there was no prospect of my rendering her any assistance, so I gave it up as a forlorn case.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the woman?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130059"/>- She informed me that she and her husband had had a pint of hot before they went to bed, and they went to bed together, and had connection with each other; and after they had been in bed a few minutes, he began to be in a passion, and to curse and swear that he would be her butcher, and told her that such a person gave her more pleasure than he did: she informed him his suspicions were groundless, for she had been serving her maker all the day, for she had been bred to that from her cradle.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you how she came by her wounds? - She did not.</p>
               <p>- COOKE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon, I live in St. Catharine-street. I came into the room (being fetched by the person who took the man) to this woman, who I found laying on the bed. After the other person, Mr. Price, had left her, I examined her wounds, found her in a very bloody state from head to foot; I asked what was the cause of it; they told me it was done by the husband Taylor; the woman's bowels were laying out, I endeavoured to put them in; I was at least an hour employed in this; I found it ineffectual, and she begged she might die in peace. I saw it was to no purpose, for the wounds were such that she must die; I let her alone, from the wounds the abdominal large blood vessels were divided, which was the cause of her death. On her wrist I saw a large artery cut, which would have killed her; I then examined her from head to foot, and found upwards of twenty wounds; I then administered some wine to her, in order to preserve her life, to get from her the cause why this happened; I asked her particularly this, whether she provoked her husband to do this; she said by no means in the world, he was a base man, and had often threatened to do it. I said, Mrs. Taylor, I should have supposed the man to have been mad or insane, to commit such an outrage as he has on you: she said, now believe me, he is not any more insane or mad, no more than you. I told her she must die, and I was very sure her husband Taylor would be brought to justice; she said she hoped so: she said they had had something hot, and went to bed on Sunday evening, and when they were in bed, she turned her back, as was usual, to go to sleep, and thought he was asleep, and said that he took a penknife (which proved afterwards to be a razor) and cut her across the belly; that she got out of bed, in order to go to the children's bed, which was in the same room, to alarm them, but he got out after her, and knocked her down.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the magistrate's? - I was, the last time he was examined.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing he said there? - I heard him say that he had taken from God Almighty what he could not restore; he was guilty of the fact, and must die; and he did not care how soon.</p>
               <p>Was any thing reduced to writing that he said before the magistrate? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you either at that time, or any other, discover any derangement about the man? - I never did; I went down to the watch-house after I had left the woman; he had not then gone to prison, I had the curiosity to see if he was or not insane. I saw no symptoms of insanity about him; he seemed very much distressed in his mind, but never uttered any thing that led me to suspect he was insane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. At the time you addressed yourself to the woman, you certainly entertained some idea that he was insane? - Before I saw him, I did; I said I should suppose within myself, that he should be insane to commit such an outrage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it was your comment on such a violent act? - That is all.</p>

I immediately took hold of him; he says, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130060"/>need not take hold of me, I will not hurt any one; I ordered two men to lay hold of his hands; both his hands were all over blood; they took hold of him; I took a candle in my hand, and went up stairs, and there I saw his wife lying down on her right side, between the bed and the window.</p>
               <p>Did you see any instrument? - Yes (two razors produced bloody), I found these two razors: I took him into custody, and took him to the watch-house; I thought his wife was dead: we had a surgeon there in about five or six minutes, and he said she was not fit to be moved: I took the prisoner in a coach to New-Prison: before we got to the watch-house, I asked him how he could do such a thing; he said, it would have vexed any man to have his wife out all night, and sleep with another man; and he said he was sorry she was not quite dead. After he was inside New-Prison, I told him I fancied he would never see his wife alive any more: he asked for some water; the keeper said, there was a water-cock, he might get some: we turned the cock, and he washed his hands, but did not drink any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mrs. Francis. Where did you find that razor? - I went to stoop to take some things away, and it fell plump on me out of the window, close by the bed where the prisoner and his wife used to lay.</p>

               <p>Then you cannot tell whether this agitation was from the hurry she was in or from liquor? - No.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 3d of March last, in the morning, Mr. Lackington told me that he had very just cause to suspect that he had a thief or thieves in his shop, and desired that I would give a sharp look-out. In the afternoon I saw some books in the pocket of the prisoner at the bar, he was an assistant of Mr. Lackington's; I did not just then detect him, but endeavoured to satisfy myself more fully, whether they were books or no: I then informed one of my shopmates, says I,

               <p>Do you know them to be Mr. Lackington's books? - I do; here is Mr. Lackington's marks.</p>
               <p>Do you know where these books were taken from? - These were in that division of the shop where David was employed, for the purpose of sticking the papers on, as I think.</p>
               <p>What did he say on all this? - That he took them to read, and would bring them again the next morning; but that is a practice entirely contrary to Mr. Lackington's shop, unless they inform me of it.</p>

Knowing that I had bought them much under the value, the next morning I carried them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130066"/>to Justice Triquett's, and told him that I believed them to be Mr. Lackington's; on that information he was taken up.</p>

The prisoner came for some men's black on the 14th of last March, between six and seven in the evening; I shewed him about two dozen; he said he wanted some men's black, meaning men's black worsted stockings: he then pitched upon one dozen; I went to make out a bill, and I asked him whether they were for Mess. Holland, and Co. he said yes. I then made out a bill of parcels in that name: he asked for some other articles which I had not got. He has lived at Mess.

After they had called for a pot of beer, they sent out for some meat; after they had some more beer and some gin, the reckoning came to one shilling and eight-pence: when they called for their reckoning to be settled, Prosser said Basnet should pay; Basnet said he should pay: says Prosser I have no silver; says Basnet, I have none; then how shall we pay the reckoning? You must change one of these guineas: says he, I will. Basnet says to me, give the change for this guinea: Prosser starts up and says, no, Mr. Blaker shall not give change, I will give change: I gave the guinea to Prosser, and Prosser gave Basnet all shillings, except half a crown; and Basnet looks at them in his hand, and says, I think there are some here not very good, and hands two of them to me: says he, do you like those shillings for the reckoning? I said they are not good, and returned them. He turns to Prosser again, and says, the landlord will not take this money. Basnet says, here is more bad, I dare say, look at it; and he gave them to me to look at; and there was ten bad, all strait together; and then he gave me the rest of the change together, among which was two more bad shillings, and a bad half crown: says Prosser, do not make any words, give me my money back. Basnet gave it him all back, and Prosser gave me eighteen-pence in good silver for the reckoning: says I, there is two-pence more to pay, which they paid after a little dispute; a gentleman sitting by followed me, and says, Mr. Blaker, those are bad people; I sent for a constable, and told my wife to get change for half a guinea.</p>

The prisoner struck me with a large bludgeon on the head, and I was covered with blood, I had my leg smashed all to pieces, the bones were obliged to be taken out: I had known this man, the prisoner, some years, he had been employed as a porter, and I am quite certain he is one of the persons.</p>

               <p>I was the waterman that brought over all the smugglers, the prisoner was one, he was provided with a bludgeon the same as the rest. After they went up with the kegs, the officers pursued them; I stood by Mr. Kingsford, they took hold of some of the kegs, and some went up James-street, and some round Highland House. I heard Mr. Kingsford cry out, my leg is broke; and afterwards I heard some of them say, we will murder some of you. I went then towards home after that: I am sure Salisbury was there, I saw him the next day about ten o'clock, and he advised me to go home with him, and said, if in case I was taken up they would allow me subsistence, and I went with them to Guernsey.</p>
