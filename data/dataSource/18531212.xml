                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Jones Burton; I was married to him in Feb., 1853; before that my name was Onslow. I reside in Gloucester-place, Portman-square—early in 1852 I was introduced by a person of the name of Stanborough to Frederick Crutchley—about that time there was a loan from me of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to either Crutchley or Stanborough; I lent 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to receive 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was either to Crutchley or Stanborough; it was a joint concern—a bill was given to me for the amount—previously to that bill becoming due, I saw Crutchley on the subject; that was very shortly after the loan of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on that occasion Crutchley produced to me another bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was accepted by a Mrs. Nash—(<hi rend="italic">The witness being asked what Crutchley said on that occasion</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to any thing that passed between Crutchley and the witness, until the prisoner was shown to be in some way connected with the transaction. The objection was allowed</hi>)—after the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill there was an offer of another bill to me by Crutchley; that bill was for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was made by one Rawson, in favour of a Mr. Wright—it was a promissory note—Crutchley referred me to a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185312120002"/>
               <p>person who was well acquainted with Wright—upon that I went with Crutchley to see that person; I said I could not advance so large a sum without knowing that Mr. Wright was a man of property, and able to pay so large a sum—when I got to the place, I was introduced to the prisoner by Crutchley—I had some conversation with the prisoner with reference to Wright.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now then, you may tell us what Crutchley said to you about that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and what he said about Wright before you went to the place to see Morton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I certainly could not lend so large a sum without knowing that Mr. Wright was a respectable man, and a man of fortune and able to pay it; and he said, You had better see a friend of his—he said that Mr. Wright's property was in Northumberland; that it was a very fine property; he told me the name of the place, but I forget it; it was some court in Northumberland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is that in your hand (<hi rend="italic">The witness was referring to a paper</hi>)? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I wrote down myself; I wrote it before I appeared before the Magistrate—I shall remember perfectly well without it, only I get agitated, this pains me very much—(<hi rend="italic">The witness was directed to put the paper aside</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Crutchley said he would introduce you to a friend of Wright's, what took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and Stanborough in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; it was to a large hotel; I cannot exactly say where—I believe it was either in Holborn or Berners-street, but I really did not look out; I was in conversation all the time—when we got to the hotel, Mr. Crutchley asked whether Mr. Gray or Grake was there; it was one of those names, I cannot tell which; I am quite sure it was not Morton—the answer was that he was there—I was shown up stairs into a very good room, and was there introduced to Mr. Gray or Grake; that was the prisoner Morton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who were you introduced by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Crutchley did not go up stairs with me; he said, You had better go alone, and then you can ask whatever questions you please.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> so you did go into the room alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was shown up by a waiter into the room, where Mr. Morton was seated at a table, with a bag before him full of papers, as if it was a lawyer's bag—I said that I had come to inquire about a Mr. Wright, who lived in North<lb/>umberland; whether he was a man of fortune, and a respectable man—he replied that he was a highly respectable man, a man of large fortune and large landed property; that he was a near neighbour of his, and he knew him well—he told me the name of the place he lived at, but I could not at this time tell you the name if I was to die for it; I am apt to forget names, but if you will mention a number of names I will tell you which it was—it was the same name that had been mentioned to me by Crutchley—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">did not object to the name being suggested to the witness</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it Whitley-Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the name; I frequently forget names—I told the prisoner the reason why I was making these inquiries—I told him I held a promissory note to the amount of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that I did not wish to lend so large a sum; I had never been in the habit of doing anything of the kind, and I should be very sorry to do it unless I was quit sure it was safe—he said, You may depend upon it, your money is quite safe; because he is a man of large fortune, and a highly respectable man—while I was talking to Morton, Crutchley came in; he said, "Are you satisfied with what you have heard?—I said, Certainly; this gentleman speaks very highly of him; it appears to be all right, he gives a very good account of him; he says he is a very respectable man, and a man of large property."</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185312120003"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that to Crutchley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said, This gentleman has spoken very highly of Mr. Wright; he has said he is a very respectable man, and a man of large landed property, and that my 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ill be quite safe—the prisoner repeated before Mr. Crutchley all that he had said to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon that did you discount this 1,00021 bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had previously discounted a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill for Mr. Crutchley; that was a bill of Mrs. Nash's—when I had the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill I gave back the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill that I had received before, and I gave, as near as I can recollect, about 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—I gave that to Crutchley—for the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill I gave back the 300£ bill and about 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—I went with Crutchley in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Childs; the bankers, and drew out money that was there of mine to the amount of 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had, I should say, as nearly all as possible of that; I have Child's paper to say that that was on 13th May—I received no discount, it was deducted from the amount; in fact, they were to pay me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did not give to the amount of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill and the money I drew from Child's—I have told you that was 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I gave money besides; that was not all that I paid for the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I cannot tell how much altogether I paid for the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, I am so puzzled and agitated—I have got it written down, and you will not let me look at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make a memorandum at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I wrote it in a little account book; I have not got that here, but I have a I paper that I copied from it—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">did not object to the witness refer<lb/>ring to the paper</hi>)—I see the money I paid for the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was 670<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was besides the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—there was a deduction of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to advance that money; what induced you to discount that bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was told it would be very profitable for me that I should do it; and I was told that I should certainly have back the money in Oct. from Wright—I believed the statements that were made to me by Crutchley and Morton, respecting Wright; it was on the faith of those representations that I parted with the money—I had asked to see Mr. I Wright, and Crutchley told me that Mr. Wright did not like to have any busi<lb/>ness with ladies—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was paid in May, it was on 13th May that I went to Childs to get the money out—about June, Crutchley came to me respecting a bill for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I perfectly recollect all about that, because I have got it written down on a piece of paper—lie said that I had better change the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I did—Col Bulkeley's name was to that bill—I said I knew something of Col. Bulkeley, that I believed he was a gentle<lb/>manlike man, but that I never heard he was a man of fortune; upon which Crutchley said, Oh, yes! he is a man of very good fortune—Wright's name was also on that bill; I believe Mr. Wright was the drawer, and Col Bulkeley the acceptor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was said about Wright by Crutchley on this occasion <hi rend="italic">% A.</hi> Only the same as was said before; I had received satisfactory information about Mr. Wright from his friend and neighbour in Northumberland; it was that induced me to take the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I advanced 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on that 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; that was in cash, and I gave up the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—about the end of Aug. Crutchley came to me again, and proposed that I should have all these bills back, and that they should be converted into a bond—he said it was much more secure because it would be upon Mr. Wright's landed property, this large property in Northumberland—the amount of the bond was to be 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be added, because I was to advance 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were to retain 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discount, then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have not got one penny.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185312120004"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the habit of discounting bills before you knew Crutchley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never in my whole life, and to nobody else but to him and Stanborough, though Mr. Parry wad kind enough to say that I was—when I say I have never done it, allow me to say that I have occa<lb/>sionally lent sums of money to friends, and they have given me a bill to acknowledge it, but without any interest whatever; I never attempted to make my fortune by it—a bond was shown to me—that was at Mr. Boucher's. a solicitor, in Guildhall Chambers—Mr. Crutchley desired I would meet him there to see this bond—I did meet him there—this is the bond (pro<lb/>duced)—it is a bond from Wright to Crutchley—upon hearing it read, objected to that—I said, How extraordinary that it should not be to me—Crutchley said it was of no consequence, it was equally safe, and that Mr. Wright did not like to have anything to do with ladies in his business—Mr. Boucher was present at this time—I was to give a part of that additional 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I cannot say the exact sum I gave, but it was somewhere about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was to be advanced in addition—I was of course to give up the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; I could not make up the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Crutch<lb/>ley took the remainder upon himself—it might not be quite so much as I say, but I advanced a large sum, and Mr. Crutchley was to make up the remainder to 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would advance the rest to Mr. Wright.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By this bond it appears that the money is to be repaid in 1855; was anything said by you to Crutchley, or by Crutchley to you upon that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said it was extremely inconvenient to me to wait beyond Oct.—he said, well, he hoped it might be paid in Oct., but at all events it would not remain till 1855, and that I was to receive five per cent, interest upon it; and on my urging him very much to say when I should receive it, he did fix that I should be paid on 18th Feb., at least a day in Feb. in 1853; so upon my marriage I said to him before I left, I hope the money will be ready for me by that time, because I shall want it; I shall want money, we are going to furnish a house—he then said I should have it on 18th Feb., 1853—the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was given up to Crutchley—some time after that Crutchley came to me and wished me to purchase his share in this bond—I could not pay him the money, I had not got it; but he said if I would give him a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should have his share of it, which was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I gave him a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that has been met since my marriage—there was also another bill given which does not relate to this affair—I have made frequent application to Crutchley for the money that I advanced—he told me the last thing before we went to Paris, that I should be sure to have my money when I came back, that it should be all paid on 18th Feb., 1853—after my return from abroad, when I asked him for the money, he said he had not got it for me, but he had done what was better for me, he had got a fresh bond to me which was for 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, What for?—he said, Why, because you don't receive your money at the time—the extra 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was as interest for that, as I must wait till 1855, when the bond stated—I came back from Paris before 18th Feb.—I was married on 7th Feb.—we Were gone about ten days or a fortnight; we returned, it might be, on 18th or 20th—the fresh bond was in the charge of Mr. Boucher, who gave it up some time ago—Crutchley said it was in Mr. Boucher's charge—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is a bond from Mr. Wright to me; I received this bond from Mr. Boucher, he states that I did not pay him his charges for it, but that I do not know anything about, Mr. Burton settled that—I have not got one farthing for what I advanced, nothing but these two bits of parchment.</p>

               <p>when it wasyousaw the prisoner at this hotel wherever it may hare been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was the beginning of May—I know I saw him, but I cannot swear what day it was—I think it was not in June or July—I know I made an error before in saying I went to him relating to the bond, but upon consideration and looking over my accounts I find that I went to him when I was to receive the first bill of Wright—I own that I made mistake, but I cannot make a mistake that I saw this man, that is the principal thing, that I saw him, and that he verified Mr. Wright being a respectable man; whether I saw him in May, June, July, or Aug., I think can make no difference in a court of justice—I say positively now that it was in May, because I have Childs' paper showing that I received my money from them on 13th May—I have seen him since, when I went to identify him—I did not see him on any other occasion during the negotiation' for these bills—I only saw him for a particular purpose, that he should say Mr. Wright was a highly respectable man, and a person of large fortune—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—the interview lasted perhaps a quarter of an hour, I cannot say exactly—I was with him a short time, and then Mr. Crutchley came in—I knew Crutchley in the beginning of 1852—I have negotiated several other bills for him besides these bills of Mr. Wright's; I gave him money for them in the same way—I discounted them—they were bills drawn and accepted by other parties, to some considerable amount—I have lost several thousand pounds, to my shame be it spoken; I have never received one farthing back for all; at least, I think I had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a promissory note for 202., which was the commence ment of these transactions—that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lent to Mr. Stanborough; he told me he was going to take it down to Brighton, to Mr. Crutchley—I gave Mr. Stanborough 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., taking 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discounts—he told me he was going to take the money to Mr. Crutchley; that was some time before I saw the prisoner, it was not some months before—I think it was in April, and I saw the prisoner in May—I think it was not much earlier in the year; I believe it was about the middle of April—I cannot say how long it was after the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced that Crutchley came to me about the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; I cannot tax my memory; I have only told what I believe to be the truth, a plain, unvarnished tale—I have nothing to say against the prisoner, except that I saw him, as I have stated, for a quarter of an hour; that is all I have to say against Mr. Morton; I know nothing of him—it was perhaps a fort night or three weeks after the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill that Mr. Crutchley came to me about the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, but I really do not think that has anything to do with Mr. Morton—if you will allow me to look at my memorandum, I can see the dates; I cannot carry them in my head—(<hi rend="italic">referring to her memorandum</hi>) I have not put it down here; I cannot fix the date—when I received the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill I gave back the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money; that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill Woh a bill of Mrs. Nash's; I can tell you all about that, because that was the first bill of any consequence—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was more of a loan than anything else—Mr. Wright's name was not on the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, as far as I can recollect; it was a Mrs. Nash—I was desired to go and see a Miss Bowles, the sister of Admiral Bowles, of Berkeley-square; I went there, and saw her, and she spoke very highly of Mrs. Nash; I found it quite satisfactory—that bill has not been paid; I have received nothing—that bill was given back—it had not expired when I gave it back—I think it was about a three months' bill; I believe it is in existence now; I gave it to Crutchley—I cannot tell what time elapsed between the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill and the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it might have been a week, or a fortnight, or a month; I cannot say whether it was a month—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185312120006"/>
               <p>know I had it, and that is all; I have not written it down, and, therefore, cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you undertake positively to swear that you saw the prisoner before you discounted the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say that, to the best of my recollection, I did; that was the reason for seeing him, to know about Mr. Wright; because it was for so large a sum, I did not like to do it before I had seen him—I am quite certain I did not see him at the time of the bond, because I very much objected to its being changed into a bond; I could not understand it, and I asked Crutchley, and Stanborough too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you undertake to swear that it was not on the occasion of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill that you saw the prisoner for the first time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was before the first bill, but I will not swear it; when I discounted the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, I gave Crutchley back the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and 670<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—I believe I had only 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discount; I believe so, but, as I said before, to all these things I cannot swear—I thought I was in the hands of a highly respectable young man—Mr. Crutchley always assured me it was all right; that he would not cheat me of a penny; and therefore I was not so parti<lb/>cular as I ought to have been—of course I have been very silly and very foolish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said before that you thought you paid the whole, or nearly the whole, of the money that you drew out of Childs'?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I will swear that for the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill I gave altogether 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I drew out 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Childs' on the occasion of taking the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. In fact, I believe you got nothing from Crutchley at all, on any account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing, but 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in all these transactions I should think I am a loser to the extent of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the faith of the representations about Mr. Wright I have lost this 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as near as possible, I advanced to Mr. Crutchley, in connection with Mr. Wright 2,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but he had more since, because he had the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, which has been paid—if I had not supposed Mr. Wright to be the person he was represented to me I should not have advanced that sum of money—if these persons had not told me he was a highly respectable man I should not have advanced the money—I cannot tell the month or the day upon which I saw Morton—I believe I got the money from Childs' to pay the bill for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say I had seen Morton before I drew the money from Childs'; I believe so; at all events, it was in my own power; I did not give it away until after I had seen him—I mean to say that when I drew it I need not have given it to Mr. Crutchley, unless I had believed, which I did, from the representations of Morton, that it was all right.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I gather your account of the transaction aright, all these bills that were produced to you by Crutchley were taken up before they arrived at maturity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, every one with respect to Wright; one bill purported to be accepted by Mrs. Nash; I never saw her—I believe there is such a person from what Miss Bowles told me—I did not learn from Crutchley whether there was a Mrs. Nash.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since the postponement of this case from last Session, did Mr. Hawke, the person acting as solicitor for Crutchley, come to you; I do not want to know what took place 1 A. Yes, I saw him.</p>

Have you any intention of coming to London for the winter? for perhaps if you were on the spot some good might be done There will be no money from the old quarter for some short time I am very sorry to hear of Mrs. W.'illness, and trust she will soon recover, please give my kind respects: I hope to hear from you, and please let me know ifyouintend to winter at Great Yarmouth.

Be true to me and not afraid.

               <p>25th June, 1852. My dear Sir,—I see we have made a mistake; therefore please write to Mr. C. another letter, the copy of the first, except RN. to the captain's name; merely say Captain B.; for I find he is a captain in the army, and his agents are Messrs. Colliers, of No. 9, Park-place, St. James's, army agents. Also please, in your letter, name T. Sheed, Esq., of No. 41, Robert-street, Hampstead-road, a gentleman that has known Captain B. for many years, and can give every satisfaction respecting him. Do this, and send the letter up to C., and he will post it on Tuesday, and we shall have the money next week. I would send you some to go on with, but I am hard up, and very ill. W. M.—W. C. Wright, Esq., Post-office, Bury St. Edmunds; <hi rend="italic">over which was written</hi>, Yarmouth, Tuesday, 2nd July, 1852. Dear W.,—I have only seen C. this morning, for the first time since he returned from the country. He requested me to write you by this post, and get you to write him a letter, which is to be dated about 12th June, merely stating that in your letter you had made a mistake; that Captain B. was a captain in the army, and that his agents are Messrs. Collier, of Park-place. Also refer for Captain B. to Shed, Esq., of No. 41, Robert-street, Hampstead-road, for believing him to be a gentleman that will give any satisfaction respecting Captain B. I also wish to make it appear that you will faithfully meet the bill yourself, when due, and that the cash, to be of use, must be had at once. Do this by return of post, and rest assured all will come off to our satisfaction, and will soon be in funds. C. would send you some money, but at present is quite without, and I am also. I shall call at the Boar and Castle on Monday, when I shall expect to hear from yon. W. M.—W. C. Wright, Esq., Post-office, Great Yarmouth, Saturday, 3rd July, 1852. Dear W.,—I sent a letter to the Post-office, Bury, yesterday, telling you what I requested you to do. I have only this moment received yours of the 30th June. C. at present is quite without cash. I am the same, but I may say, for certain, all will be right next week; in fact, I am confident; therefore you must get on for a day or two longer. I think you may calculate on seeing myself and C. at Great Yarmouth on Thursday next, for he intends taking a trip with the Pin. Am I in future to address my letters Great Yarmouth? Yours faithfully, W. M. P. S. Mr. C. has not been in town before yesterday, therefore could not answer your letters.—W. C. Wright, Esq., Post office, Great Yarmouth. Boar and Castle, 5th July, 1852. Dear W.,—I received yours this morning, and I think you may for certain calculate upon having the money by Thursday. I shall pay you a visit, if C. is not able to come with me; for I wish to see you respecting other business, for which I think a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each can be made in a week or two. Rest assured I will act right to you. Mind, our business is kept to ourselves; much good can be I done. Faithfully yours, W. M.—W. C. Wright, Esq., 14, Windsor-terrace, Tower road. 13, Lower Belgrave place, 5th Nov., 1852. My dear Wright,—I saw Fred yesterday, and he requested me to write to you to get you to I write a letter to Mr. Boucher, 5, Guildhall Chambers, stating that you are sorry you cannot pay the bond, as agreed on 31st Oct., in consequence of your affairs not being settled; but that he shall hear from you again shortly. Do this by return of post, for Fred thinks there is a chance of <hi rend="italic">drawing</hi> some more money soon, but just now wishes to make all right with I Mrs. O. I think it is not unlikely that I shall be in Yarmouth next I Wednesday for a few days, that is if I draw some money, which I expect, when we can talk matters over, and see about laying in a stock for the winter. Give my kind regards to Mrs. W. and the little boy, not</p>

My dear Wright,—I have not either seen or heard from Crutchley, therefore it is impossible for me to say if the money has been sent or not. I enclose a copy of your letter to him to advance the money. I wish to God I was out of this place, and I would put them all to rights. I have not had one shilling upon the bills, but the instant I do you shall have some; but I trust this will not prevent your serving me. Fray write by return of post, and if possible get up to town.

He was with me to-day, but I could not get any money from him; but he assured me if you would be in London on Saturday he would complete the transaction with you. If you cannot come up to London, get some person at Yarmouth to witness the bond, and send it to me; and I give you my word I will not part with it until I get the money from him, which I will, without taking one halfpenny, remit you by Saturday's post. Do not neglect, for we can get money from him after this transaction in a bill. Faithfully yours, W. M. P. S. Surely Hudson would lend you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a day or two.

I received a note, and I went to Mr. Ehrenberg's house—he is a tailor, in the same street—he showed me a piece of cloth—I examined it—I knew it was mine—it had no business to be at Mr. Ehrenberg's premises—I never sell cloth, except cut out in coats, and that I do myself; I will not allow any one to cut but myself—I went to the station, and got an officer</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter at his Lordship's larder, 111, Cheapside. On Wednesday, 30th Nov., in the latter part of the day, the prisoner came there and took some refreshment in one of the boxes—I do not recollect whether he had a great coat on—he sat reading the newspapers for about two hours in the same box—he then asked one of the waiters if it was raining still, and got up, went outside into the street, and came back again in a moment, but did not go into the box in which he had been sitting before, he took a</p>

               <p>seat in the middle of the room, and remained there about ten minutes reading the paper, he then deliberately got up, took a great coat off a peg where he was sitting—he then walked up to the desk where money is received, and as I suppose, settled; he then bade Mr. Jones, the proprietor, who was in the desk with the cashier, good night, and went away with the coat—I afterwards heard Mr. Hutchings making inquiries respecting his coat; he pointed out to me the nail on which he said he had hung it—that was the same nail from which I had seen the coat taken; there was no other coat on that nail—I know the prisoner by his being in the habit of coming to the house, and have no doubt he is the person who took the coat—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of His Lordship's Larder, dining rooms for the middling classes. On Wednesday afternoon, 30th Nov. about 4 o'clock, the prisoner came in—he had no great coat on; he never were one—I had seen him two or three times a week for the three months preceding—I swear distinctly that he had no great coat; he had on the under coat which he has on now; I never saw him with a top coat—I did not take any notice of him while he was there; nothing occurred between the time of his coming in and the time he left—when he went away he simply bade me good night—he had a great coat thrown across his arm—he had, on a previous occasion, introduced himself to me as an author, and asked me to subscribe to a work of his, which I did, and on the Saturday evening after this matter happened I went to the printer of the book, Hodson, of Castle-street, Finsbury, who referred me to the binder, and he accompanied the prosecutor and me to the lodging of the prisoner, in Cavendish-street,</p>

               <p>New North-road, and found him there (I took the poem I had purchased, in my pocket; it is called "The Lost Chief; an Epic Poem on the late Duke of Wellington")—I told him he had stolen a great coat from the larder, and he must go with me to the station house—he said he had not stolen it, and he would not go; but in a few minutes he consented to go with me—the prosecutor was waiting outside, and gave him into custody of a policeman, who was waiting also—on the road to the station he threw the duplicate for a waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) into the road—I afterwards returned to his lodgings with the prosecutor and two officers, a search was made, and we found this pair of gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) between the bed and the bedstead—at the time the prisoner left I had just relieved the cashier; it would have been his duty to take the money—the cashier went away instantly—the prisoner did not pay me the money for his dinner.</p>

On Wednesday, evening, 30th Nov., he came home, and I let him in; he had a great coat on, and looked very warm—he had not been in the habit of wearing a great coat; I had never seen him with one before, and have never seen it since—it was not the coat he has on now.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here ready as follows</hi>: I have one thing to state, that Mr. Jones is decidedly wrong in saying he saw me enter the room that day without a great coat; Mr. Jones is very seldom in the room in the daytime, and was not there when I entered it; Mr. Jones states also that I did not pay him; very natural, Mr. Jones had just come from above, and I had previously paid his clerk at the desk, which is his office; I went out to see if it rained, and I found it did, and returned; I sat there a few minutes; I took down my coat, and went to the desk; seeing Mr. Jones there, I said,' I have paid; I do not think it rains so much; I shall bid you good night;' he bade me good night, as also the clerk; with respect to the gloves which have been sworn to, they are my own property; I can prove where I purchased them, three years ago, in my native town; as to their being under the bed, it is a matter of very little moment; if one has a room he can put his things where it is convenient; I have nothing more to say than that the charge made against me is decidedly wrong.)</p>

I sent him out at a quarter or ten minutes to 10 o'clock in the morning—he was going to the East India Docks, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he returned from that journey about 1 o'clock—on the Monday morning he handed me his book, with these two toll tickets in it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the entry is 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid at the Bull and Mouth, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the cloak room of the Shoreditch station—the toll tickets are one for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that made altogether 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took the sum</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police of the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> division. On 25th Oct., in consequence of instructions I went to William's Rents, Angel alley—I went to the first floor room of a house; there is only one room on a floor—I found the door locked, I believe—I broke it open with a sledge hammer—I saw the three prisoners standing at a table, on which was a galvanic battery charged, and apparently at work—there was a fire there—on our entrance, the male prisoner kicked the table over, and kicked the battery out of the jar, and scattered the solution all about; part of it went over my great coat and burnt it, and part of it burnt my hands; and at that time a dog sprang at me; he was hissed on by the male prisoner—I pushed the dog back with the sledge hammer, and he seized the constable Neville, and tore his trowsers, and then he seized Evans, and tore his trowsers—they succeeded in beating him off—I saw a number of sixpences on the table; some were scattered on the floor—I found this battery, and this is a small portion of the fluid which I took from the table; it was spilt—I found this file on the table; it had at that time white metal in it, but in consequence of the solution, it is rusty—in the corner of the room, near the bed, I found two moulds, one for casting sixpences, and the other for shillings—I found four counterfeit sixpences—there were seventeen sixpences in the whole produced by the various officers; they are all finished.</p>

               <p>half past 9 o'clock on Friday morning, with a small basket, which contained pay my rent; the landlord threatened to seize, and about three minutes after Brannan, the broker, entered; if I had not expected the broker, I should not have had the door locked; when Pike brought these things, he said to me,. Fred, you are badly off if you will comply with my wishes, I will relieve you; allow me to leave these things, and I will call at half past 7 o'clock; if I don't call, you bring them down to me at the <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi> public house, and I will put you in a good way; when he was gone, I said to Sarah, Bring me these things, let me see what he has brought me; I had the jars on the table, I looked in, and there were these counterfeit sixpences; I said, Sarah, here is some money; she said, You don't say that! I said, Yes, but they were bad; I had scarcely replaced them in the jar, when the door opened, and the door opening, upset the table, and threw the things off; I can produce the little dog; it would not fly at anybody, it is too harmless.</p>

               <p>a little property in the country that I wished to dispose of, and I placed that conditionally in your hand, that if there was any discrepancy in the account it might be made straight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you did not say that; you said you had at Leeds left in charge with a gentleman, who advanced you 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a diamond ring, two mourning rings, and dessert knives and forks, which this gentleman advanced 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on, and you wished me to send down a check to that gentleman and get the property, and sell it to pay myself 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I advanced you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I acknowledge having received the check from Mr. Woolf; I put it in this book, with a great many more papers; I went round to six or eight houses with my samples, and having lists of different goods to show them the prices, and by so doing I imagine I lost the check in one of those places; for on the following morning, when arranging my papers, and preparing to pay the check over to Mr. Bate, I found it was not there; I immediately went round to every place where I had been, and made inquiries, and I went to the Bank of England to see if it had been paid; I found it had been paid the afternoon previous; of course I was in a very awkward predicament; I did not mention it to Mr. Bate, because I knew that he is of such a very irritable temper, therefore I tried to get the money from a friend to replace the value of the check, and not to mention the circumstance to him, and if I had got the money I should have mentioned it to Mr. Bate; I used every exertion to pay it; he never mentioned it to me; I never heard a word of it till I was taken into custody; the Lord Mayor remanded me on my own recognizance of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was taken again, and committed by Mr. Alderman Moon; I never appropriated one penny to myself; I never knew the check was crossed; I think you cannot look at this in any other light than as a trivial, frivolous prosecution; there is not a particle of proof that Mr. Bate ever told me not to receive money, and I solemnly declare, before Almighty God, he never did; there was one small account I handed to him after his return, and he never found fault with me—on the contrary, he thanked me; I had one class of customers, and he another; mine were confined to the East end, and amongst the Jews; and the parties with whom I did business all looked to me to receive the accounts, and he never told me not to receive them; the whole proceeding hinges on this simple feet, whether in this individual case I have lost this check, and not repaid it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, G</hi>). In consequence of information which I received on Thursday, 24th Nov., I watched outside the house of Mr. Fowler, a furnishing ironmonger, in Barbican—About 12 o'clock in the day I saw the prisoner Cox leave the premises; he was alone; I followed him—the witness Bartram was with me, and pointed him out to me—I followed him into White Hart-court, Long-lane; I saw him knock at the door of No. 4 in that court—he turned round and saw me, and put his hand into his left hand breeches pocket—I said, "I belong to the police, what have you got there?"—I took from his hand four steel rings for keys, which I produce—I told him he was suspected of robbing his master, Mr. Fowler, an ironmonger, in Barbican—he said, "I know nothing about it, Sir"—we were standing at the house door at this time—we then proceeded up stairs, and in a room on the first floor I saw the two female prisoners—I addressed myself to Mrs. Johnson, and said, "I belong <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the police; I have got this man in custody, and I come to search this place; you answer the description which I received from a pawnbroker, as having pledged a quantity of brass taps—she said, "I am sure I don't know what you mean, Sir; I know nothing about it"—at that time I was searching Cox, and Mrs. Johnson went to a box which stood close to the fire, took from the box a paper parcel, made a hole in the top of the fire with the poker, and placed the parcel in it—at that time I had locked the door, and put the key in my pocket—I rushed to the fire—I was much obstructed by Smith—I took from the fire thirty-one duplicates; they were on the fire, and part of them blazing; Mrs. Johnson also attempted to prevent my getting them, and I believe Cox, but I cannot say, in consequence of the struggle which took place; I felt myself overpowered among the three—after taking the duplicates from the fire, I rose the window up, and called the assistance of an officer; a female went and procured the officer Fancett—the prisoners were very violent—on Fancett's arrival we found it necessary to send for another constable—we then placed the prisoners in a part of the room, and <hi rend="italic">commenced</hi> making a search—before that I said to Mrs. Johnson, "You are very active—she said, "They were left with me by a person to burn"—I said, "Pray, who might that person me?—she said, "I don't know"—at that time I saw Smith with her hand in the split of her dress; I got her hand out, and in it was this ring, and this little instrument called an eylet hole borer (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—the ring is of the same description as those I found on Cox—I also observed Mrs. Johnson with something in her hand</p>

               <p>in the fold of her dress; I found it was a glove, which contained sixty-three pawnbroker's duplicates—she said, "They all relate to my own things"—on a shelf in a cupboard in the same room I found this brown paper parcel, which contains a dozen plane-irons, without handles—I also found a table bell, with a spring (an alarum bell), and a paper parcel containing brass nails—that was all I found—we took the three prisoners into custody.</p>

On Monday morning, 5th Dec., about 10 o'clock, I came into my warehouse to open it—I occupy the upper part of the house—in consequence of information, I went up into a bed room on the third floor, where I had left everything safe an hour before, and missed two coats, two waistcoats, a pair of trowsers, a silk gown of my wife's, a mantle, and a pair of kid boots—these articles produced are all my property, and were in my room—the prisoner had no business in the house, but about ten days or a fortnight before the robbery I met him on the staircase, and asked him his business, seeing he was a stranger—he spoke in broken English, and said he was looking for a German warehouse—my street door is kept open, the lower part of the house being a warehouse—the value of the things I missed is 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is my dwelling house, and is in the parish of Christ Church.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in New-street, Lambeth; it is my dwelling house. I was there on the 17th July—between 3 and 4 o'clock that morning, I heard a noise at the street door—I looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner going down the street with my clothes on—I knew him, he had lodged with me previously—he was going in a direction from my house—he was about fifteen houses off—the houses lie very close, they I are small houses—when I looked out he looked round, and I saw his face—he had a bundle under his arm, and an umbrella in his right hand—I put on my trowsers, and ran down the street—I did not see the prisoner, but I saw a constable—it was quite light, broad day light on Sunday morning—my house is a corner house—there is a fence to it, about nine feet high—when I came down, I found the street door wide open—the drawers in the front parlour were wide open, and the back door wide open which leads into the yard—any one could get over the fence into the yard—I found a mark on the fence where some one had got over, but nothing was broken—I had gone to bed last on the night before, a little after 12 o'clock—I fastened the street door myself—I am positive the back door was latched, but I cannot say whether it was bolted—the street door must have been opened from the inside, because the bolts were undone—I missed a black coat, a pair of trowsers, and the other articles mentioned—they had been in the drawers in the front room on the night before—I have a very sharp dog who would bark at a stranger, but he knew the prisoner well—I afterwards heard that the prisoner was loitering about the workhouse—I got an officer, and gave him in charge—I charged him with stealing the clothes, he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
