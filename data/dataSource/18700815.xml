I am the prisoner's wife, he is a cigar maker, at 28, Bridgewater Gardens—we have been married about twenty-three years—on Monday, 20th June, I got up about 8.30, and my husband just before 9—he lit the fire and made the breakfast, but neither of us had any—after I got the children to school I finished dressing myself—my husband stopped by the fireplace, and I asked him if he was going into the Park, in the afternoon, with my little girl—he said "The flowers will last a long while yet"—I had no more conversation after that time—I turned to pull the blind up, and received a blow on the side of my head—before that he said he was going to work on the morrow—I thought it was a stranger in the</p>

               <p>room, I did not think it was my husband—I turned round to try and get the stick from him—I screamed, and after that I had two more blows—he laid me on the ground, put a pillow under my head, and stabbed me on my throat and on my face, with a penknife—this is the stick and this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he has had them for years—it was after he stabbed me that he put the pillow under my head—he then went straight across to the fireplace, took a razor from a bird cage in the cupboard, and cut his own throat—he had locked the door—I heard footsteps coming up stairs, and when the knocking was at the door he told them they could come in now—I had called out when he first hit me, or it would never have been known—a policeman came in.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>and negotiations took place with reference to the liquidation of the debts, and it was finally arranged that the execution should be held over, provided 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week was paid on account of the accounts and book debts and the judgment, until the whole was liquidated, and on 12th April both the prisoner and his wife came to me to sign a letter, and brought with them the receipts for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also for the last quarter's rent—next day, the 13th April, the prisoner called by himself, and signed this letter at my request—previous to that I asked him for the receipts—he stated that he had forgotten the one for the rent, but he produced a receipt signed "Mary Ann Tenant"—he told me he must take it away again, and I made a copy of it.</p>

I am a bank-note printer, and live at 1, Meredith Street, Clerkenwell—on 12th June, about 2.15 a.m., I was returning home, and when in Farringdon Street, I became aware that there was someone behind me—just at that time a young man came along the middle of the road, walking at a sharp pace, some remarks were made by those behind me as to where he was going—he took no notice, but walked on to the corner of Charles Street, where he turned and stood under the light of a gas lamp—by that time those behind me, who were the prisoner and two others, had got to the front of me, they surrounded me, and I felt a tug at my watch chain; I distinctly saw the prisoner do that—I caught hold of the chain, which, being slight, broke, leaving a small portion of it in my hand, and the prisoner took the other portion, and my watch, and ran off with them up Charles Street—I tried to follow him, and was struck by one of the others—the blow was intended for my face, but I received it on my arm—it staggered me very much, and they all four ran away—I described them to the police, and on 13th July, a month afterwards, I went to the station, and picked the prisoner out from six or seven other young men about the same size, build, and age—I had no difficulty in identifying him as I had such facilities of observing him.</p>

Crosse &amp; Black<lb/>well's, and had left about a fortnight—I asked him when he saw Gibson last—he said "Last Tuesday"—I then went with Newnham to Crown Street, Soho, where I saw Gibson—I said I was a detective officer, and had a man named Ham in custody—I said "He has been examined before the Lord Mayor to-day, charged with stealing cigars, and remanded; I have been to Ham's address with another officer, and searched it, and found a large quantity of essence of coffee, sauces, and other goods, bearing the name of Crosse &amp; Black well; Ham accounts for the possession of them by saying that you left them at his house to be taken care of; how do you account for them?"—he hesitated for a minute or two, and then said "I sold them to Ham"—I said "Where did you get them from?"—he said "From Messrs. Crosse &amp; Black well's, I bought them over the counter"—I said "How did he pay you?"—he said "Principally in cigars; he still owes me a little money"—I said "He says that you called there last Tuesday, at his house, and you left two bottles of Madeira jelly; was he to pay you for those?"—he said "Yes, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he has not paid me"—I took him to Bow Lane station, and showed him all the goods mentioned in the indictment—directly he saw them he said "Why, he has kept all the things he had from me; he should not have had them if I had known this; he told me he had a customer for them"—Mr. Bell, manager to Messrs.

You are charged with attempting to kill yourself, and also with stab<lb/>bing Selina Ford"—he then made this statement, which I wrote down—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, William Dash, aged 29, now an inmate of the London Hospital, state as follows:—That at about 2 a.m., of the 12th instant, a quarrel took place between Selina Ford and me. She threatened when I came home from work about a quarter past 11 p.m. We then had some words; she was in a beer-shop with a man. I asked her to come home, but she would not. I pushed her. Got home about 2 a.m.; had more words. She left the house, I fetched her back; she was then nearly drunk, and said she would get drunk when she liked. She was going to leap out of the window. I pulled her back. She took my pocket-knife, which was on the table; I took it from her. She was about to leave the house again, and in the struggle I saw she was wounded, and I then stabbed myself three times."—I took that and read it to Selina Ford, who was in another part of the hospital—she made a state<lb/>ment</p>

               <p>to me, which I also took down—I then went to the prisoner's bedside and read over to him what Sclina Ford said; this is the statement—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, Selina Ford, aged 29, lived with William Dash as man and wife about nine months. About 11 p.m. on the 9th instant I was in the Clyde public-house, Commercial Road. Dash was passing, when he saw me in there; he said 'Come home.' I said 'All right, wait a minute.' He said 'If you don't I will make you.' I said 'I sha'n't go at all for you.' He pushed and hit me in the mouth. A policeman was near, I said 'I will give him in charge;' he said 'I shall not take him, I will take you if you don't go home; never mind him.' I went down to the beer-shop at the corner of Star Street; both entered with other persons known to us. At 12 at night we took a pot of beer and went home. We then had a quarrel. I left the room; he ran after me into the landlady's back room, where he stabbed me. I said 'Bill, you have killed me.' He said, 'You have made me do it; kiss me.' I did. I ran into the street. I saw him plunge the knife into himself I fell, and two men picked me up. I did not see any knife until I was stabbed. Selina Ford, + her mark."—She afterwards said "I hope he will not be punished."—I read that to Dash, and he said Ford did see the knife previous to his stabbing her—when he was charged at the station, he said that he did it, that he deserved punishment, and he wished the case to be got over—that was what made him come out of the hospital before he was ordered—he came out on the Sunday instead of the Tuesday.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187008150036"/>
               <p>produced—I believe this to be it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one of the officers of the prison was there at the time—these other two signatures were put to it at his office, next day—(<hi rend="italic">This was a consent to the plaintiff, Henry Banks, signing judgment for</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">debt, and</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">costs, signed John Hill, Henry Teece, and M.

(<hi rend="italic">The petition of John Hill, dated</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th November</hi>, 1869, <hi rend="italic">a prisoner in Whitecross Street, to be allowed to file a petition in Bankruptcy, was here put in, signed by John Hill, in the presence of J.

Mark Beckett and Henry Teece were in the room with me, and I saw them sign papers—I heard no explanation given to them of what they were signing—next day I went before the Bankruptcy Court, before Registrar Bacon—I do not know Henry Brooks, of Chatham, who was mentioned as my detaining creditor—I owed no one the sum of 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; my largest debt was 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to Bassett &amp; Co., of Sheffield.

(<hi rend="italic">In the list of creditors appeared the name "Brooks, H., Chatham</hi>, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."). I did not tell Harris that Henry Brooks was to be put into the list, I did not know the name; I gave him the list of my creditors, but not that one—after I had been before Mr. Registrar Roche, I got out of prison the same day, as no one opposed me—I saw no one there but Mr. Banks; he answered the questions which the Registrar, I suppose it was, asked—my bankruptcy proceeded, and I got my final discharge—Beckett, and Teece, and myself, were taken before the deputy-governor, and none of us knew who our detaining creditor was—after my first hearing, I think it was in December, Banks told me that there was a society for the relief of debtors, and he believed I should get a donation of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and would try and get it for me—after my dis<lb/>charge two petitions were drawn up in Banks' office, one by him and one by the boy—it was obliged to be presented in duplicate—this is it (<hi rend="italic">This was dated February</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>, 1870, <hi rend="italic">to the President and Governors of the Society for the Discharge and Relief of Persons in Prison for Debt, signed John Hill</hi>,</p>

At the time I was examined at the Police Court I lived at 11, Agar Street, Strand—I come from Melbourne, Australia—I am a native of England—on 10th February, this year, before I left Melbourne, I saw Mrs. Counsel hand a cheque for 925<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to her husband, to be applied to the purchase of a house on the Ballarat gold diggings—I went with Mr. Counsel to his bank to have it changed—it was changed first into 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and after into gold—I can't say when that was, I was not present—about three weeks before I met the prisoner, I was with Counsel when the prisoner was present—he proposed that the three of us should go to England</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187008150050"/>
               <p>—he said he was a very clever wizard; but that he would never perform in Australia, as he wanted to perform in the best parts of the world, if he only had the money to buy his apparatus—he mentioned England and the Con<lb/>tinent—he said he could do tricks that no man ever did before, that he could cut a man's leg off, and throw it to the audience—Counsel said that he would go; but he would not go without me, and that we could all three go together—Counsel then took two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes out of his pocket-book, and banded them to the prisoner, to take the passage—I was present—the cost of the passage was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, total 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the ship was the <hi rend="italic">Kent</hi>—the pas<lb/>sages were taken, and I Counsel, and the prisoner went on board on the evening of 16th February—all the money was placed in this box—it was changed into Australian sovereigns—the prisoner opened the boxes and showed us the gold, and said "It is all safe"—the money was placed in a large nest of boxes, one within another, I believe there were nine altogether—we put it in the innermost box—it was in either three or four chamois leather bags—this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the smallest of the nest—it is the box the gold was in, and this is how it was broken open—it is still locked—I saw the money counted on the ship—I could not swear exactly how many sovereigns there were—I should think there were about 850 at that time—the box was deposited in our cabin—all three of us were in the same cabin, which was confined by a door—after we had been on the ship some little tune the prisoner said that he wanted to say "Good-bye" to his friends—he was going to tell them he was going to Queensland, and Counsel agreed with him to go up in the town—I said "Don't go, let us stay on board while we are safe"—the prisoner then called in the storekeeper, and he said "Ned, what time will the ship sail?"—he said "She won't go away until to-morrow, I am sure, and very likely not till Friday, because the captain won't go away until he gets the mails"—Counsel, the prisoner, and myself then went to Melbourne, about four miles from where the ship lay—the prisoner left us at our hotel, where we went to have tea—he said he was going round to see his friends, to say "Good-bye," and he appointed to meet us at the corner of the Charlton Gardens, at 9 o'clock—we went at 9, and waited till 11.30, and he did not come, and we then walked to a place called Sandrich, and there slept—when we woke the next morning we found that the ship had cleared that very night—we went to the telegraph office, and afterwards took a special steamer, and reached the ship at the Heads—we found the prisoner on board—we counted the money, I think, on the follow<lb/>ing day, and it was all right—we were all three present—we counted it, I believe three times before 29th March, at intervals, and found it safe—on the afternoon of the 29th we counted it, and missed fifty-one sovereigns out of the bulk—we did not mention it at the time, we thought we might possibly have made a mistake in the counting—in June two of the crew of the ship were tried here for stealing the money, and we re<lb/>covered back 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—their names were Chalk, Daley, and Randall—one was acquitted, and two pleaded guilty. (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 135). On 30th March I had a dream—I dreamt that the gold was stolen, and that I saw a portion of it in a certain man's hands, the one that received the twelve months last Session—I awoke at daylight, and the dream was so impressed on my mind that I felt for the box with the gold in it, and it was gone—I felt for the prisoner and he was out—he was gone and the money too—the box had become smaller—some of the larger boxes had been taken off to put clothes into, and there were only the smal<lb/>lest</p>

               <p>three or four remaining, and they were deposited in a large clothes box, and I felt in that box to see if the smaller ones were there—I then woke Counsel, and asked him a question—at this time the prisoner made his ap<lb/>pearance, from the direction of the storekeeper's room, from the ladder, and shouted out, "Arthur! Joe! get up, we are robbed!"—(Arthur is me; Joe is Mr. Counsel)—we went outside the cabin—the boxes were lying on the table outside our door, broken open—there were six sovereigns lying in the bottom of the box, and two others were afterwards found on the ladder leading up to the deck—nothing further occurred during the voyage—we searched the ship and posted a notice—we arranged to watch the ship every night in turns, to see if we could observe anything—we made out nothing, and we eventually landed in England—we were somewhere about the Cape of Good Hope when this robbery took place, I can't say exactly where—on reaching England the prisoner Counsel and myself lodged at the same house, 10 and 12, East Road, City Road, up to the trial of those men—we con<lb/>tinued in England until we had spent all the money that we recovered out of the first robbery, 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after that I and Counsel took shipping at Gravesend, in order to return to Australia—it was about 16th of June, I think—the prisoner told me that he would be able to borrow some money from a rich uncle of his to take us out—he suggested our going out, not for any purpose, only that Australia was our home, and we had no means of subsistence in England—he went with us as far as Gravestnd, and returned back to London—Counsel and I went to Plymouth, and on the vessel reach<lb/>ing Plymouth Mrs. Counsel came to us—Mrs. Counsel and I came up to London by ourselves; we left Counsel' behind, as he was ill—we went to the prisoner's uncle, Mr. Underwood—I watched at the house all night, because, by the way his uncle spoke to me, we believed the prisoner was in the house—he would give us no information at all—the following morning I saw the prisoner at his lodgings, and Mrs. Counsel came in after me—I did not hear what she said—she charged him with the robbery—the prisoner came in and said to me, "Oh, my God I she is going to arrest me; what shall I do, Arthur? I can't stand it, I'll bolt!"—he said that to me, in his uncle's presence—he was jumping out through the window—I said "It is no use your bolting, for she will have you"—he jumped over the fence and hedge and went away.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Smith, 2, Wrotham Villas, Camden Town—these forks and spoons (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his property—they were safe on the evening of 13th July, in a box in the kitchen cupboard—these earrings and ring are mine—they were safe also, in a small box on the kitchen table—me and my mistress locked up the house about 10.30—the things were then safe in the places I have mentioned—I went to bed, and was awoke next morning, about 4.30, by the police coming—I went down, and found the kitchen window broken open—the drawers were all turned out—the box where I kept my earrings and ring was broken open, and the things gone—the kitchen door was burst open, and the breakfast-room door, too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am undergoing a sentence in the House of Correc<lb/>tion, Clerkenwell—I was in the service of Mr. Bidgood, of 6, Vigo Street, Regent Street, ten years—I have known Musgrove about twenty years, and Isaacs rather more than three years—Musgrove was in the habit of calling at Mr. Bidgood's twice a day, from 12 to 2 o'clock, and from 6 to 7 o'clock, for goods to damp, for Joseph Sparrow—he introduced me to Isaacs at Mr. Bidgood's—in March, this year, I took forty-eight yards of cloth from Mr. Bidgood's to take to Isaacs—I stole it, and gave it to Musgrove, from 1.30 to 2 o'clock—I gave him a largo sheet of brown paper to wrap it in—this was at the back door, where the vans come—he had Sparrow's van with him, and I told him to take it down to Isaacs—he had taken goods before to Isaacs—he had other goods for his master there—Isaacs knew I was a warehouseman there—I went next day to Isaacs' house, 10, Commercial Street, Whitechapel, a little dirty tailor's shop—I told him I had sent him a piece of cloth, and he found fault with it being so thin, he also found fault with Musgrove for driving right up to his door with the van, and said he ought to have sent it by Parcels' Delivery Company, or carrier—we went out and had something to drink—he told me to meet him two nights after<lb/>wards in Finabury Square—I did so, and took him two vesting lengths, and two lengths of trowsering, which I had stolen from my master, for which he gave me a little parcel with eight sovereigns in it; that was for the piece of goods and the trowsering and vesting—he told me to give Musgrove 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and next day, when Musgrove came to Mr. Bidgood's, I gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the evening—he said "All right"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the doth I took, and these other articles are the same pattern and colour—I was taken in custody on 16th May, and charged at Marlborough Street with stealing six yards of cloth from my master—I was sent to prison for six months with hard labour—I took the cloth to a little public-house where</p>

               <p>I used to dine, and in the evening I took it down to Isaacs, and told him what length there was, and he promised to meet me on Sunday morning, but I could not because I was in custody—I informed the police where the six yards of cloth was—I was fint introduced to Isaacs in the King's Arms public-house three years ago—Musgrove came into Mr. Bidgood's, and asked me how I was—I said I was hard up—he told me to let him have a piece of cloth, he knew where he could get rid of it—I refused, but on being asked two or three times more, I consented, and gave him 15 yards or 20 yards of cloth at 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he came in the evening, he said there was a man in Warwick Street, Regent Street, at a public-house, waiting to see me—I went over there, and saw Musgrove come outside the door; he met me before I went inside, and told me he was not there but at the King's Arms, Glasshouse Street, as there were two or three people in the public-house in Warwick Street who knew me and knew Sampson, and he thought we had better not be seen together, somebody in our trade—I went to a public-house in Glasshouse Street, and saw Isaacs standing in the bar; Musgrove drove up with Sparrow's cart, pointed me out to Isaacs, told him I was the man, and drove away—Isaacs asked me to take a walk—we walked round the back streets in the neighbourhood, and I looked round to see if anybody was coming—he told me not to be afraid, as I was perfectly safe in his hands—we went and had something to drink, and he said that anything I could get he could do with—he told me to meet him two nights afterwards, in Jermyn Street, Piccadilly, about 7.30—I did so, and he gave me a little parcel containing 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told me to give Musgrove a sovereign, and said he had given him one, or would give him one himself—I gave Musgrove I next day, at Sackville Street—there were never any bills in these transactions between us—I do not suppose that Isaacs knew that my name was Walker, at the first transaction—I also took 11/2 yards of figured velvet from my master, and gave it to Isaacs myself—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—no inducement whatever has been made to me to make this statement; I am telling the truth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—I carry on business at Marsh Street, Walthamstow—the prisoner was my landlord—on 24th June I left my shop at 6.30 in the evening, fastened up as usual, all the doors secured—I went to my shop at Forest Hill, and afterwards went back to Walthamstow, and got there about 9 o'clock in the morning, and went to my shop—I entered by the back door—as soon as I entered the parlour leading to the shop, I discovered the parlour window thrown up, and saw the prisoner helping himself to my goods, and putting them into a bag—I said "Mr. Bofiee, this is too bad; I have often been robbed, now I have caught you in the very act"—he looked confused, and said "Come let me out"—I unlocked the door leading from the parlour into the shop, and he came into the room—he came from the shop into the parlour—he said "We can settle this matter"—I told him I could not accept of any settlement at all—I looked into the shop again, and saw all the things about in disorder—I returned—he was still pleading for me to let him go—I said I could not do any more, but that I intended putting the matter in my solicitor's hands—he then seized me by the back of the neck, clutched his fingers under my throat, caught my beard, pulled me to the ground, and hit me a blow on the head with the door-keeper or some hard instru<lb/>ment—he said "You b——y b——r, I will do for you"—I said "Pray don't"—he said "You b——r, I will do for you"—he then hit me on the head once or twice, and put his hand into my mouth, caught me with his nails under the tongue, and loosened all my teeth—I screamed out "Murder!"—he gave me another blow on the nose and lip—I called till ex<lb/>hausted—my next door neighbour, Mr. Judd, came to the front door, a glass door—he could not get in there, and went round to the back premises, and just as he entered the prisoner made a violent blow at my temple—he disabled my left-hand, separated the ligaments of two fingers, and rendered them useless—he ran off when Mr. Judd came—I raised myself, and asked him to go for aisiatance.</p>

I am assistant engineer to the Brighton Railway—I made these plans of the line at the point in question—they are correct—the line is practically level at Croydon—the red is the Croydon line—these are the signals, and here are the signals on the green line—all the signals shown on this plan are worked from the Sydenham station signal-box—we call the signals at the box the "home" signals; the next, towards Syden<lb/>ham, are the "stop" signals, and the next, going towards Penge, is the "distance" signal—when the signal is at "all right" on the green, or Crystal Palace line, it is necessarily at "danger" on the red line, from the mechanism—these signals have been at work for three years before the accident—I examined them after the accident, and they were working per<lb/>fectly—I am acquainted with the line—when a train is pulled up at the Penge station, the driver can see the distance signal—a train of ten vehicles, engine, tender, and two break vans, going at the rate of twenty miles an hour, on a gradient of 1 in 600, could be pulled up, in ordinary weather, in about 350 yards; it depends upon the break power—the distance signal is 700 yards from the point of collision, and if the break power was applied, there would be 400 yards to spare—the stop signal is 126 yards from the point of collision—when the driver is alongside the distance signal, he sees the stop signal, and if by any accident he overlooks the distance signal, he would still have 600 yards or 700 yards to pull up in—a driver coming up from Penge would see the home signal, if at "danger," quite as soon as he saw the stop signal, if not before, from the Croydon line—the home Signal is the highest from the ground, and is visible as the driver passes the</p>

               <p>distance signal—with regard to the Crystal Palace, the green line, the same rules apply—the distance signal on the Crystal Palace line is 700 yards from the home signal, and it is 126 yards from the stop signal to the fouling point—the gradient there, on the Crystal Palace line, is 1 in 60 for a certain distance, and 1 in 100 at the point of collision—the driver of 10 vehicles, with two breaks, could pull up his train in about 500 yards, when travelling at twenty miles an hour on a gradient of 1 in 100.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a signalman in the employ of the Brighton Railway—I have been in their service fourteen years, at Sydenham—our telegraph lad, Smith, was with me in the signal-box, and I was to be relieved by another signalman—a Crystal Palace train was timed to run through Sydenham Station without stopping; it was given out to me at 1.31, but it was a little late—we expected it to run under our signals about 1.28, and the Croydon stopping train at 1.32, about four minutes later—before the trains come we receive notice of their, approach from the Crystal Palace bank top, and from Penge—before the departure of the trains from the Crystal Palace they indicate it by four rings from the Crystal Palace, and one ring from Croydon, both which signals indicate that a train is coming—I received a signal on this day from the Crystal Palace at 1.31 to indicate that a Crystal Palace train was coming—that was three minutes after the time that it should have been with us—I also received, at 1.31, a signal from Penge of the starting of the Croydon train—at that time all the sig<lb/>nals on both lines were at danger, and, on both trains being signalled at the same moment, I opened the Crystal Palace road and put all the signals for the train to run through—I dropped the home signal, the auxiliary signal, and the junction signal, and put them at "all right" for the Crystal Palace train to come through—all the Croydon signals stood at "danger," I could not alter them—I watched for the Crystal Palace train, so that when he came in sight I could put the distance signal on to protect her behind—I saw both trains coming—they were inside the distance signal when I saw them first—I did not alter the signals, I never touched them; but when I saw that there would be a collision, I threw the auxiliary up on the Crystal Palace line—I threw the arm up to "danger"—that would not affect the sig<lb/>nals on the Crystal Palace side at all, they stood at "danger" still—"danger" was up on both auxiliaries—I threw up the home signal as well on the Crystal Palace line, the Croydon one was already at "danger"—that left both the home signals at "danger"—I do not think the Crystal Palace train could have stopped after I gave the signal—while this was doing, the Croydon train was coming on—I could hear the beat of the engine, and that was when I threw the auxiliary up—I saw the collision—it took place, as near as I could sec, below the auxiliaries, nearer the points—at the time of the colli<lb/>sion the Croydon engine was leading by five or six carriage lengths, from</p>

               <p>what I could see—the Croydon train was due to stop at Sydenham at 1.32—it was due to leave Penge at 1.29—both trains were late, the Croydon train was three minutes late—three minutes was the allotted time between Penge and Sydenham for the stopping train—if the Croydon train was lead<lb/>ing, the Crystal Palace train would run into it—I saw nothing of the deceased man Cooper—the prisoner was the driver of the Croydon train.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a signalman in the employ of the Brighton Rail-way Company—on 8th July I was going to relieve Judge at his signal<lb/>box, and I was walking along the line from Penge towards the signal<lb/>box—the Croydon train was not at Penge when I left at 1.23 or 1.24—the distance signal was against the Croydon driver, and the auxiliary and the home signals were also at "danger"—when I was about twenty yards on the Penge side of the stop signal and before I got to it, the Croydon train passed me at, I should think, fourteen miles an hour, but I am not a judge of the pace—the steam was on when it passed me until I called the driver's attention to the signal being against him by halloaing to him, and likewise to the fireman who was on the engine—the prisoner was the driver—I saw the signals pulled off on the Crystal Palace line, for "all right"—the fireman of the Croydon train ran to the break directly and put it on, and the steam was shut off for about half a minute and then it was put on again, and it whistled—the Croydon train had not passed the stop signal before the steam was shut off—the steam was shut off first, and it ran some twenty or thirty yards past the signal before the steam was put on again, but I don't know whether the engine had been reversed before the steam was put on again—I did not notice any alteration made in the home signals after I called attention to it—I saw the collision, I was close to it—the driver was almost foul of the junction when the steam was put on again, and the Palace train ran into the Croydon train—I did not see the deceased jump out—the front break of the Croydon train was off, and the wheels were free; but I don't know anything about the hinder break—at the time I saw the fireman go to the tender break the engine whistled, to call his attention to the break—both trains whistled about the same time.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the service of the Brighton Railway Company twenty-seven years, and eighteen years a driver—on 8th July I was driving the Crystal Palace train—I had eleven vehicles, besides the engine and tender, of which two were breaks, one at each end—I got to the Crystal Palace at 1.27, and left at 1.29—the proper time for arriving was 1.23, and for leaving, 1.25—I can see the distance signal soon after I leave the Crystal Palace signals—it was at "all right" when I first saw it—I lost sight of the distance signal for a little time, on account of the trees, and when I saw it again it was "all right," as before—when I got opposite the distance signal I saw the Croydon train going up to the auxiliary signals, which were at "stop"—they were against him—he had no steam on, and he seemed to be going to pull up—my signals</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187008150075"/>
               <p>were "all right," for me to go through—I shut my steam off when I passed the Crystal Palace box, on account of the decline, and I ran down at eighteen miles an hour—I was going at about fourteen miles an hour when I shut off the steam; but the train would have a speed of eighteen miles, on account of the incline—the home signal was "all right," for me—I then saw the Croydon train going up to the signals; but it had no steam on; and when I was going close towards the signals I saw that he had steam on, as if he was going to pull into the station—the driving wheels were going ahead—I could tell that by the rods—directly I saw that he had steam on I reversed my engine, and gave the alarm to the guard to put on the breaks—if I had seen that he had steam on before, I could have pulled up sooner—I thought he had mistaken my signals for his—I had not passed my auxiliary signal—I could have done so before any alteration was made in it; but it was altered to "danger" just as I came to it; and I could not do anything more—the Crystal Palace trains are very heavy upon an incline, and it takes a greater distance to pull them up than on the level ground—I went on, I daresay, for 100 or 130 yards after the wheels were reversed, before the collision took place—by what I had done I had reduced the speed of my train very much, and I expected we should have stopped before we got to the Croydon train—we were going about three miles an hour at the time of the collision—as soon as my engine touched the train it threw it off the road, into an embankment—Coomber, who was killed, was riding in the break nearest to the engine, the first break, which has a glass front to it—the Croydon carriages and the Crystal Palace carriages came fide by side—they were thrown off the line; but no carriages were upset, and no one was injured, only pressed together—the steps of the carriages and the handles of the doors were broken—I made a great alarm, and the first guard put on his break, and immediately he had done so he went to the door and jumped out of the carriage—that was before the collision, about 100 yards before it, I should think—at that time I could do nothing to prevent the collision.</p>

I went on towards it, and when I got about ten yards from it, it was raised up, showing 'danger.' I then went on. I saw that mine was lifted up, and the Palace signal lowered. The Palace signal had been at 'danger' before that. I then saw the Crystal Palace train coming; Naylor, who was on my engine, said 'For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, get on, that train will not stop.' I shut the steam off to stop at the station, but seeing the Crystal Palace train I put the steam on again in order to go through the station, ahead of the Crystal Palace train. The home signal was at 'danger;' I could not stop between the auxiliary signal and the points; I was going from sixteen to twenty miles an hour; I was never going less than sixteen miles an hour; I knew that I could not stop between that signal and the points, and I thought that all would be killed, so I put the steam on as the safest way of trying to avoid the mis<lb/>chief. It is not right to run against the signals. I had nobody in the hinder part of the train. I had five empty carriages behind. I had just pulled the engine up and let her go again. I have been on railways thirty years; if I had not gone on as I did the mischief would have been much worse."</p>

I went to Goddard's assistance—there were from 300 to 400 people there—the prosecutor was bleeding—I was told he had been stabbed—I assisted in taking Connor to the station—I afterwards searched and found this knife in a pool of dirt, ten or fifteen yards from where the fight had taken place.</p>
