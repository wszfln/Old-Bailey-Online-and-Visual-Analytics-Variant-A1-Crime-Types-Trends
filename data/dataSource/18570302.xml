                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I was tried and convicted at the last session of stealing this heifer—I do not know how I originally became possessed of that heifer—I saw it at Kingston on Wednesday, 12th Nov., about 10 o'clock in the morning, in the meadow, along with the other beasts—Mr. Beauchamp let me into the meadow—I first saw the other beasts that the heifer was with, in the meadow; I saw them all in the meadow together that morning—I recollect seeing Mr. Beauchamp on the 13th; we were then getting them out of the field to take them to the fair—that was on the Thursday; I was acting for Missenden—I saw Missenden that Wednesday morning, he was along with me; there were five or six of us together—I had come from Kingsbury on the Tuesday morning, the 11th—I went to meet some beasts at the Harrow station; they were Missenden's beasts—I did not see Missenden on the Tuesday; he sent his man down to me from London to tell me to go to Harrow to meet the beasts; that was a drover of his, Joseph Hosier—on the Tuesday I drove those beasts from the Harrow Station to Hampton Wick—a gentleman they called Mr. Beau<lb/>champ took them away from me on the bridge, some of them; there were</p>

               <p>four more persons besides me with them—I expect he put them into the field; they were there on the Wednesday morning when I went there—to my knowledge that was the first time I saw that heifer—I do not believe I ever saw it before, I do not recollect; it might have been among the rest, without my noticing it—I saw Missenden on the morning of the fair, and the beasts were driven to the fair—the heifer was left in the field, and Missenden said, he should not take it into the fair, because it had had the bull, and was not fit to go into the fair; and the bull, he said, was not trimmed, and he should not have that in—the beasts that were taken to the fair, and were unsold, were brought back in the evening, and put into the field again, where the heifer and the bull were—they went out again next morning, the heifer and the bull were still left—the beasts were all sold on the second day—the bull and heifer were still left there—I did not hear any conversation between Missenden and Beauchamp about the bull and heifer being left—I left Kingston after the fair—I believe Missenden left also—I saw Missen<lb/>den again about a fortnight afterwards; nothing was then said about the beasts; it was about a week after that that he spoke about the bull and heifer, he then ordered me to fetch them away and sell them—I then went down to Mr. Beauchamp, and got them away—it was in Smithfield that I saw Missenden—he said, "I think you had better go down to Kingston, and get the bull and heifer, and sell them, for it has been very sharp weather, and they will want a bit of hay; they will get worse if they lay there any longer, perhaps"—I said, "Very well," and I went and did it—he did not say anything further; he did not say anything about what I was to do with the money; he owed me some money, and he said I was to see him after they were sold, and then we would square up our accounts—I do not know what it was that he owed me; it was for work done for him, and keep and money I had paid his men, and one thing or another—there was an account between us—I did get both the bull and heifer, and sold them; I did not see Missenden afterwards until I saw him at Edgware after I was in custody.</p>

               <p>person named Goodchild helped me to drive the first lot, and helped me to put them into the field—the two lots were not put into the same field—I believe the second lot was put into the field where I counted the fifty next morning—the first lot arrived at Harrow station about 2 o'clock—they got to my place about 4 o'clock, I believe—I was abed when the second lot arrived; I believe it was about 11 o'clock when they called up at my window—I went into the field next morning where the fifty beasts were, but the boy never went with me, I will swear that—the boy was not in the field with me—I did not ask the boy next day how many he had brought—James Barton helped bring the second lot, I believe—I am sure the boy did not say to me, "Why, here are fifty, and only forty-nine are my master's; that bull is not ours"—I believe that was the only bull among that lot—I saw the heifer at Kingston, but I did not know but it belonged to Mis<lb/>senden—I know the description of heifer—I cannot undertake to say whether she was among the fifty that morning; I will not say one way or the other—there were Borne of all sorts among the fifty—I think there were some half—bred heifers—the first I saw of the heifer was at Kingston—Barton, and Hosier, and Mark Richardson drove one lot; Barton and Hosier drove the fifty, among which was the bull; Mark Richardson drove the thirty-four—I went to the Harrow station, to meet his man with some more; that was on the Tuesday—I do not know what number I received on the Tuesday—there were some bullocks and some heifers, some of all sorts—we took them straight from the station to Kingston; the other two lots had started from my place at 8 o'clock, and this lot did not arrive from the Harrow station till 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon—the first lot started between 7 and 8 o'clock, and the other about 8 o'clock or a little after—I saw them; they were counted; I counted thirty—four in one lot, and fifty in another, and then I went to the station for the others—I had not seen Missenden since the Friday before—he had made arrangements that whatever number of cattle there was, they should stop at my place, and that I was to assist in driving them to the fair——I arrived at Kingston on the Tuesday night—there were three lots put into Mr. Beauchamp's field—the two lots that started from my place were put into the same field—there were some cattle of Mr. Beauchamp's in the field, I believe, I do not know how many there were of them j the rest were taken to a field, some of them were bulls—the bulls were separated from the rest—we divided them on Kingston bridge—I separated all the bulls that were in that lot—we took them on, I helped to drive them; there was myself and three or four more—Mr. Beauchamp took the oxen and heifers away from me, and drove them into his field, I suppose—I do not know what he did with them, they were there in the morning—that was on the Tuesday—I did not see Missenden on the Wednesday—I was trimming bulls on the Wednesday—I went to Mr. Beauchamp's on the Wednesday, to see if there was a dead one among them, or anything the matter—Mr. Beauchamp and I had no conversation about the number—I mean to say, that although I was driving Mr. Missenden's cattle, I did not know what the exact number was, because his own men came up with them by rail; they knew the number, I did not—I saw Mr. Beauchamp on the Thursday morning in the field, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I saw Missenden—that was before the cattle were driven out of the field—he had got more men there to attend to the bulls; there were eleven or twelve men alto<lb/>gether.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and reside at Sudbury. I had a heifer at Mr. Wilson's, at Greenford, and saw it there on 9th Nov.—I missed it on the 11th—I did not see it again until Sunday, 21st Dec; it was then in Mr. Vickers's field—that was the day Tomkins was apprehended—that was my heifer—I saw Tomkins, and bad some communication with him—I went down to Missenden's place on Saturday, the 19th, with Mr. Kench, to whom the bull belonged—I had previously seen him on the Friday in Smithfield; I then said to him, "Did you leave a bull and heifer at Hampton paddock?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "It is my heifer, not the least doubt"—he said, "What can you tell it by?"—I said, "There is a man in the market here now that has seen them there"—I went and fetched the man to him, and said, "That is the man that told me about my heifer being in Hampton paddock"—it was Mr. Monk's man; he was not called last time; I forget his name; he is. here now—he said, "You keep quiet till Monday, and I will see about it"—I then went and told Mr. Kench—I had some conversation with him, and next morning we went down to Mr. Missenden's, at Water Eaton; we saw him, and I said to him, "I seem. very uneasy about this heifer Mr. Missenden"—he said, "I pro<lb/>mised to meet you on Monday, but I cannot, for I have got to go to Newport Pagnel fair;" and he begged of us to leave it over till Tuesday; he said, "Leave it by, I can't say where it is"—I said, "You know where it is now"—he said, "I can't tell you where it is now, but you shall have your bull and heifer at Harrow station, between 9 and 10 o'clock, on Tuesday morning"—I said to Mr. Kench, "I am not very easy about them; I think Mr. Missenden knows a great deal more about this"—I said that in Missenden's hearing—Mr. Kench said we had better go home, and we did; and as soon as I had got home, a person came and told me where the heifer was—I went to Kingsbury, and saw it on the Sunday—on Monday I went down again, and saw Missenden; I said, "Halloo! who would have thought of seeing you here?"—he found out that the policeman was there, and said, "I suppose you mean about this heifer then; I don't know anything of it I remained there with him all that night, but he did not say anything else—he did not give me any account whatever as to how he had become pos<lb/>sessed of the animals—we then brought him to Edgware, and there he saw Tomkins—he said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, what have you done with the bull?—Tomkins said, "What did you tell me to do with it?"—he said, "What did I?"—Tomkins said, "Did you not tell me to take it to the Ram yard, Smithfield, to <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Fairey's, and have it killed?"—he said, "I don't know anything of it"—they then shut the door, and would not allow him to say any more; the policeman was present—I believe I had told the prisoner on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman of Hampton Wick; I let out my field to persons having cattle for the fair.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 100, Chancery-lane. On 13th Jan. the prisoner Spurgeon called on me, and asked me if I knew Mr. Woodmass—I said, "Yes"—he said that he was very ill, and he had come into some property under a will, some thousands of pounds, and that he was about to raise money on it in some Insurance-office, and had been doing some busi<lb/>ness for Mr. Emas, I think he said in a Chancery suit, who had given him this promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and is drawn by Thomas Henry Emas—he said that Woodmass being very ill, he required a little money for present use, he being in a very bad state, wholly out of order, would I advance 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it merely for a temporary purpose—he said Mr. Emas did not wish the bill to be discounted, and, as Woodmass owed me a little money, he wished me to take that and the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the note when it became due—I said, "The better plan will be for you to get from Woodmass a note to that effect, stating what he really wants, and call on me to-morrow"—he went away, and took the note with him—on the morrow Spurgeon came again, about 12 o'clock—he said that he had left me a note in the morning, which I had not received, but I looked about, and saw it lying on the desk—I opened it in his presence, and said, "Here it is then"—I read a portion of it—he said that was his note, and he then handed me this memorandum—I said to him, "Where is Woodmass?"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020010"/>
               <p>did not answer—I said again, "Is he at Islington now?" as I knew he did live there—he said, "No, he is staying at a coffee house"—I know Mr. Emas's writing, and it occurred to me that this note was not his writing—this memorandum is signed by Woodmass—I desired <hi rend="italic">my</hi> son to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave him a sovereign and a half sovereign—the prisoners were taken between 4 and 5 o'clock on the same afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the King's Head, in Church-street. On Sun<lb/>day night, 11th Jan., I saw the prosecutor at my door—I was then going out—he was coming out—I went to the other door, the bottle depart<lb/>ment, and stood there—I saw two young men about ten yards from the door—the prisoner Chiverall was one; they were together—the prosecutor wan passing, and they turned round immediately behind him, and Chiverall attempted to put his hand into his pocket—the prosecutor turned round and seized Chiverall by the collar, and as soon as he had done that the other person struck the prosecutor in the face, and knocked him against a door—the door flew open, and he fell in the passage—I ran up immediately, and the other one ran away—I took hold of Chiverall by the collar, and pulled him off the prosecutor—the prosecutor got up, took hold of Chiverall by his collar, and called out "Police!"—a policeman came and took him—the other man ran up Boundary—street, the direction the policeman was coming down—I saw the second person, and from M'Cormick's stature and appear<lb/>ance, I believe him to be the man.</p>

               <p>two persons stood with their backs towards the window—they turned, and the hand of one, I could see distinctly, attempted to put in the pocket—they were standing ten yards off and when they did this they had not gone, I should think, more than one yard further—they were at that time between the prosecutor and me—I saw Chiverall's hand going from him in a direc<lb/>tion to the prosecutor's pocket—I am certain of it—he touched him, and directly the prosecutor turned round and seized him—that appeared to me to be in consequence of his feeling something done to him; and directly on that M'Cormick knocked him down—I cannot say whether the prosecutor had hold of Chiverall till he fell—when I got up Chiverall was upon the prosecutor in the passage, whether he pulled him down I cannot tell—I staid till the policeman came, which was in half a minute—I did not see the policeman till he came up—there were other persons round after this was done—a great many persons were about, but whether they had been with the prisoners, I cannot tell—the prosecutor had a black eye, and his nose was hurt; I believe he had a scratch on his neck; I did not notice his lip—I did not see any conversation with the prosecutor and these men before this happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper's assistant, at No. 70, St. Paul's—churchyard. On 20th Feb. I met the prisoner near Savage-gardens, Tower-hill, about a quarter to 9 o'clock in the evening; she said something about the weather, and asked me in what direction I was going; I continued to walk on, and turned down a street which was in my road—she followed me; I stopped immediately, and while I was standing there, which was about two minutes, I felt her fingers or my purse go from my pocket; two men came round to prevent my securing her, and asked me the way to some place—I ran round them, and pursued her, having missed my purse, which was safe when I left St. Paul's-churchyard, 20 minutes previously, and I had not taken it out—it contained two half crowns, one shilling, one sixpence, two receipt stamps, I think, and one postage stamp, and two or three cards—I overtook the prisoner rather more than 200 yards off; I kept by her side, and demanded my purse; she gave it me empty as I thought, but I found a sixpence in it, and the stamps—I am sure it was the same purse, it has my name on it—two men from the crowd tried to prevent my keeping with her; I believe they were the same men, but cannot swear to them—the prisoner got away from me some 12 yards in consequence, but I called a constable, and she was taken in my presence.</p>

Edgcumbe's employment, was introduced into the counting house, and I asked him if he had seen any quantity of gloves in Hulme's possession during the time he had been living with him—he said that he had seen some, and that Hulme had made him a present of three pairs, one pair of which he had worn, and the other two he gave me on the following day—I then went with Haydon and Hulme to Dixey's lodgings—he was not at home, but we waited a short time, and be came in—I pointed to Hulme, and said, "You see this young man, you have disposed of various lots of gloves to him; how did you become pos<lb/>sessed <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them?"—he sank on a chair, and remained probably for five minutes without uttering a word—I said, "You must not put off our time in this way; you must account for the goods you have disposed of to him"—he then said, "I stole them"—we then searched his lodgings; some articles were found, which Haydon took possession of, and he was given into custody—this was about 7 o'clock in the evening—Hulme was not taken, but was desired to attend Dixey's examination before the Magis<lb/>trate on the following day, which he did; and Dixey was remanded till 7th Feb., when Hulme was desired to attend again; he did so, and was given into custody by the Magistrate's direction—the trade price of the gloves was, at that time, 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I saw him again at Croy<lb/>don; he brought 'down twenty dozen more, and I think I paid him for them—he spoke to me again, about 2nd Oct., and on the next day he brought twenty dozen and a half at the same price—they were all French gloves of various makers; there were some of Dumond's, and Caldesar's, and Serrusier's—there were none of Courvoisier's there, but they were all Courvoisier's on the first occasion—I afterwards spoke to Mr. Johnson, who is in the employment of Hitchcock and Co., and spoke to him about the gloves; I also saw Mr. Gilbert, who is in the employ of Alcroft and Co., on the same day; that was about 4th or 5th Feb.—on the next day, I gave eighteen dozen pairs of gloves to Mr. Gilbert; those brought on 1st Nov. were also taken; they were all received from Hulme—I believe this letter to be in Hulme's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Feb. 2nd, signed C. Hulme, and requested to know when the witness would let him have some more money on the account</hi>)—I received that on 2nd Feb.—soon after I had given those goods to Gilbert, I saw Hulme at my house; he asked me what I intended to do about Dixey's case—I asked him what he was doing; he said that he had not been back to his employment yet—it was on Friday, 6th Feb.; I told him he had better go back; he said, "I suppose we shall be all right in the matter"—I asked him who he meant; he said, "You, Mr. Harris, and myself;" I said, "The best thing you can do will be to appear to-morrow"—he said at that time that Dixey had bought them at a sale in Oxford-street; that was the first time that Dixey's name had ever been mentioned to me—I knew at that time that Dixey was in custody, I had been present at his examination on the 5th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the conversation take place on 6th Feb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I mean to state that—he did not say at that conversation that they were bought at a Custom House sale; he said that when I first bought the gloves—he said that Dixey had bought them at a sale in Oxford-street,</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the glove department in the house of Dent, Alcroft, and Co., of No. 97, Wood-street, Cheapside. I have examined these two dozen pairs of gloves produced, from Hitchcock's—they are of three different makes; we are the only persons who receive those of Dumont's and those marked "L. N. C."—all the gloves that come to London from those houses are consigned to us, by contract with the manu<lb/>facturers; we contract with them for the whole of their produce—I have not seen any of these gloves in London through any house but ours—I have been fifteen years in the trade—of these two dozen there is only one pair of Courvoisier's, the others are Dumont's and L. N. C.'s—the value of these gloves at the time in question was 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—that was the price we charged to the trade, to sell again—here are sixteen dozen other gloves from Messent's; they are the make of Dumont, L.

I was standing at the shop, by our front window—I heard a smash of the glass, immediately ran out, and saw the prisoner running at full speed towards the Broadway—at the same time he was pointed out to me by a lad—I followed him for about a quarter of a mile—I did not lose sight of him—I cried out, "Stop thief!"—he stopped when I got within about two yards of him, and asked what I wanted of him—I told him he had broken my employers' window, and I suspected he had stolen something—he said he had not stolen anything, and if he had broken the window he would pay for it—I gave him into custody—I went to the station, and afterwards returned to the shop, and found that a diamond ring, marked twenty guineas, was missing—it had been in the front window, directly opposite where the pane of glass was broken—the ring has not been found; here is the box in which it was; that was left in the window, with the card—I did not see anybody else near there at the time; I did not see anybody to whom the ring could have been handed—I rushed out immediately, the window having been smashed on a previous occasion, and the prisoner was not above a yard from the window.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020033"/>
               <p>that he would return and give me his address—I declined that—an officer came, and the prisoner gave his address, No. 15, Exeter-street, Strand, and his name, 0.

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Jones, an attorney. In May, 1856, I took a house at the corner of Finsbury-square—I entered into an agreement with Dr. Winn; it was in writing—I was to live in the house, and he was to have two rooms on the ground floor, one back bed room on the second floor, and a small room in the basement—he was to carry on his profession there as a physician, but his family was not to reside there—the bed room that he occupied was on the same floor as my bed room—previous to 29th Sept. there had been a great many disputes between us—Tinley is his servant, and lives in the house—on 29th Dec., at near a quarter to 12 o'clock at night, I was going up to my bed room—I had reached the landing of my bed room, and was about a foot or eighteen inches in my room; the door was open, and I was just in the act of entering—I had a wrapper hanging on my left arm, and my hat and a chamber candlestick, with a lighted candle, in my right hand—when I was about twelve or eighteen inches in my room, Dr. Winn ran after me, and struck me twice or thrice on the back of the neck—that was whilst my back was towards him—they were violent blows, struck with the fist—he then caught hold of me by the stock and shirt, and pulled me round, and kept beating me about the shoulders and head—at the time he struck me,</p>

               <p>I dropped all that I had on my arms; there was a gas light over my bed room door—at this time my wife was on the next flight of stairs—my daughters were also on the stairs, going up with my wife to see the younger children—when he dragged me round, he caught hold of me by the back of the hair; I struck up, and tried to get away from him; he held me by the back of the hair, and held my head down, and called out, "Tinley, Tinley!"—Tinley replied, "I am coming, I will give him a <hi rend="italic">pill</hi>, I will give him a <hi rend="italic">pill</hi>"—he said it twice—Tinley came and struck me with something on the head three or four times, such as I never felt in my life before—I said, "My God, Sarah, they are murdering me; they have either got a life preserver or some deadly weapon, for it is not the hand of a man that I have been struck with"—the blows stunned me, and an immense quantity of blood began to flow; I was saturated with blood in a few minutes—I lost my senses for some time, not very long; I found myself in the middle of the bed room a minute or two after—I was taken in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Mr. Jenkins, my medical man; he lives in Great Prescott—street, and has attended my family ten or twelve years—I had my wounds dressed.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My friend Serjeant Ballantine said that you had been convicted some years ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, fourteen years ago; it was for conspiracy to defraud—the sentence was eighteen calendar months, from which I subsequently received a free pardon—I did not serve more than a year—after that I received Her Majesty's free pardon; I have not got it; it was shown to me when I was discharged, but not given to me—I swear that—if I am not mistaken, it had the signature of Her Majesty to it, but I am not sure of it, it is so many years ago—it was shown to me by the Governor, Captain Groves—I never saw Her Majesty write, but it was a signature I believe to be hers—I occupy as tenant under Dr. Winn; I believe Dr. Winn has a lease of the house for thirteen years—there has been some discussion about it—there has been no anxiety on my part, not the least—I wanted to purchase his lease when I first entered the house, but when he said he did not want to dispose of it I gave up all idea of it—I never ordered my family to do anything in order to drive Dr. Winn out of the house; I have expended too much money upon the house to make things uncomfortable; I have never given any directions to my family or my servants to do everything to drive Dr. Winn out of the house; I did not do so up to Christmas Day last, or three or four days before this matter occurred; I have been very unhappy in the house, in consequence of his not paying his rent, and my goods being liable to be distrained—I paid 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; the whole rent is about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid my rent—my father's name was Mark Benjamin, my name is Mark Benjamin Benham; I will swear that; I was married in that name nineteen years ago, by the late Dr. Herschell—I am thirty-nine years of age—up to the age of about fifteen I went by the name of Mark Benjamin; I then adopted the name of Benham—I have never been bankrupt—I was insolvent years ago; I took the benefit of the Act for 5, 084<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have got a release in my pocket for 5, 050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I have paid my creditors; there is 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now outstanding, and allow me to explain why I cannot pay that, because I cannot find the persons, and it is my intention to pay the money into court, and obtain a re-vesting order—it has cost me about 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get released—I was remanded for six months, under the 76th section, what is called a discretionary clause; it was not for any fraud; the Commissioner said I had been living at too expensive a rate, but my detaining creditor sent my discharge two or three days after I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020036"/>
               <p>remanded; it may have been fourteen days, it was a short period after, I will swear it was within a month—I was but twenty-two years of age then—I owed 5, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I carried on the business of an army and navy tailor at Greenwich.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever used any abusive language to Dr. Winn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None, to my knowledge—on the night in question Dr. Winn was in his bed room as I passed the door—I do not recollect ever having called him a swindler—I will not swear I did not, but I have no recollection of having used any such words—I may have said that he was a swindler as I was passing his door, but I have no recollection of having said it—I will not swear that I did not say it, for I had been that day to the Comptroller's office, and found that a distress was about to come in for three quarters rent—I may, as I passed the door, have called him a swindler—there was nobody in the house but my family, and Dr. Winn and Tinley—I had never called him a swindler before to my knowledge—I do not know that I have—I think I may safely swear it—I do not think I have, I will not swear it; but I do not believe that I have—I have not repeatedly called him a swindler—I do not recollect having called him a swindler at all, but I was much annoyed when I found that my things were likely to go away for rent which I had paid—I will swear that I have not repeatedly called him so—I do not remember ever having called him so; I may have said so, but not often certainly, for I had not spoken to him for a month before this happened—I have not repeatedly said to other persons that he was a swindler—I may have said that he got up two bubble companies, or was a party to them; he told me so himself of one, the Caxton—he did not use the word "bubble," but he talked of it to me—I have not told his patients when they came to the door that he was a swindler—Dr. Conquest lives next door; I do not know him particularly; I knew him by sight before this matter, as I might know any gentleman of the bar, but never to speak to him—I have never been to his house except ten years ago, when I went to consult him; never since I have been at Dr. Winn's;—my family are not on visiting terms with him—Dr. Conquest has called upon me once or twice at Mr. Jones's office since this affair; he is practising next door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether Dr. Winn purchased the practice from Dr. Conquest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not present, but I have heard very different—I will swear that Dr. Winn has told me himself, that he did not purchase it of him; he bought his furniture of him and fixtures—Dr. Conquest formerly lived in that house—I swear solemnly that I had not had several interviews with Dr. Conquest before this matter occurred; I am not on intimate terms with Dr. Conquest—I never prevented Dr. Winn from coming home, or barred the outer door; he had a key in his pocket—I did not when he came home late one night in Nov., call out to him from the top of the stairs that he had been out to pawn his trowsers, or his coat, or anything—I might have said he had been to a pawnbroker's—I do not think I called out anything else—I was in bed when he rang at the bell—I got out of bed—I believe I called out to him from the top of the stairs, that he had been to a pawnbroker's—I do not believe I said he was a swindler—I will not swear it, but I do not believe I did—I have not directed my children to make noises over Dr. Winn's head, I will swear that—Dr. Winn has not complained of their making noises, and disturbing him; that was what I complained of to him—he lives down stairs—I have not told my children to make noises above his head to annoy him—to my knowledge they have not repeatedly done so—I am managing clerk to Mr. William Jones, a solicitor—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020037"/>
               <p>am also a discounter, and have been so seven or eight years—on the night in question, Dr. Winn came out of his bed room in his shirt, trowsers, and boots—I mean to represent that I have told the truth in all that I have stated about his holding me, and that he overpowered me—he had not any weapon in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, as Dr. Winn came out of his room, turn round and deli<lb/>berately strike him a blow on the eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I could not have done so—I did not—he ran down stairs when he heard my family cry "Murder!" and he heard the police breaking in, and I am told that he said to the police<lb/>man that he would charge me—what he said was, "I will charge him"—they both ran away after they had assaulted me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he cried out to his servant, "Tilney! Tilney!" were you not holding him on the ground and strangling him, or attempting to do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my solemn oath he was standing as upright as I am now, and he was hold<lb/>ing me down by the back of my hair—I represent that solemnly—Dr. Winn had a black eye, but he has always discolored eyes, you must understand; I do not mean it offensively—(Dr. <hi rend="italic">Winn, who wore coloured spectacles, was here requested to remove them</hi>)—I do not mean that his eyes were only like that; his left eye was black—I saw that next morning at the police court, I can explain how it happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We may as well know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt I struck up in order to get away from him, and I must have struck him in the eye—I have no doubt at all of it—the conviction for conspiracy took place more than fourteen years ago—it was a prosecution by my stepfather, mother, and sister; I have never spoken to them since—I brought the facts to the attention of the Crown, and received a free pardon—I had an uncle named Benham; he carried on business in Jermyn-street, St. James's—I did not carry on that business after him; he died before I went to Greenwich—after the remand in the Insolvent Court, the peti<lb/>tioning creditor withdrew his opposition, and discharged me, and since that time I have paid l, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and obtained a release from all my creditors—when I went up stairs on the night in question, Dr. Winn was in his room—I did not see him as I passed—his bed room is on the same flight as mine—I believe his door was shut—my last quarter's rent was due on Christmas day; this occurred on the 29th Dec.; I had paid my rent on the morning of the 26th—Dr. Winn holds a lease from the City of London—I have a good deal of furniture and seizable property in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is this about the pawnbroker and the breeches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have repeatedly applied to Dr. Winn after 12 o'clock to allow' the street door to be fastened by the bolts, for I do not deem it safe to go to bed leaving it on the mere latch; he has refused time after time to allow it—one night, I did not know that he was out, we went to bed soon after 12 o'clock, and by the merest accident we bolted the door; when he came home he rang the bell violently; I was in bed at the time, it caused me to jump out of bed, my servants, and my little babes; I desired my son to run down stairs, and he opened the door; but Dr. Winn had broken the bell before he could arrive—I was angry, because I thought it was a fire—it was on that occasion that I said something about the pawnbroker's—we were all dreadfully excited; we thought the house was on fire, in consequence of the violent ringing—it was a very large night bell, and he rang it incessantly for several minutes until it broke.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the night this assault occurred upon my husband, I was going upstairs to bed with him—I was behind him—my two daughters and my son were also going up with us—we were all behind my husband—we were going up the nursery stairs—we passed Dr. Winn's bed room door—it was closed—I was at that time behind my husband—my son sleeps up stairs—he is sixteen years old—my daughters sleep in the next room to mine, on the same floor—my husband was going into his room as we were going up the nursery stairs to see the younger children—I was close behind my husband at the time he passed Dr. Winn's door—he did not use the word "swindler," or anything of that sort; I never heard him utter a word—as I was going up the nursery stairs, I heard the doctor open his door, and he rushed out, and fairly jumped upon my husband's back—he struck him several blows on the back of his neck; and with that, my husband let the articles fall that he had in his hands—Dr. Winn then pulled him round, and struck him in front, and in dragging him round, he tore the wristband of his shirt off, and threw it on the ground—by some means he caught hold of the back of his neck, and my husband hit him up in this manner to beat him off—the doctor then called out, "Tinley, Tinley, come and help me fight this man!"—Tinley immediately answered, "I am coming, I will give him a <hi rend="italic">pill</hi>;" and I saw him come up the stairs—I saw something shine, I thought he had a gun in his hand—when he came up to my husband, the doctor had my husband's head down in this position, by the back of his head, holding his head back—Tinley came up, and struck him immediately two or three times on the back of his head, and I then perceived that it was a poker—my husband called out to me to come immediately—I did not call out, I ran away to cry for assistance—I did not see my husband again until he came down into the hall—during the whole of this proceeding, neither my husband nor Dr. Winn were on the ground—when I saw him in the hall the police had come in—he was then bleeding dreadfully; his face and neck were covered with blood—he was taken off in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the police station, and afterwards to Mr. Jenkins—he was in a dreadful state when he came back—I could scarcely keep life in him, he was swooning continually—I wanted to per<lb/>suade him to lie down, but he would not; I was obliged to bathe his hands and face with vinegar—that lasted till we went to the police court—two or three days before this, Dr. Winn put his fist in my face, and called me a very improper word, and said, "I know something of your husband, and I will do for him"—he called me a common prostitute.</p>

On the night of 29th Dec, I was going up to bed at the same time as my father and mother—when we got on the floor of the bedrooms, my father was behind me—I sleep on the third floor; as I was going up, Dr. Winn rushed upon my father without any provocation whatever; he took hold of him sideways, in the front, took hold of him by the back of the head, and drew him down in that manner, and held him down for a time, and called Tinley; he drew him out of his room, he was about two or three feet in his room—Tinley came; as he wag coming up, he said, "I am coming, I will give him a <hi rend="italic">pill</hi>"—he repeated those words twice; he came up with some weapon and struck my father on the head, and blood flowed; I could not tell exactly what he had in his hand—I directly ran to mamma's bedroom, smashed a couple <hi rend="italic">of</hi> windows, and made an alarm; I called out, "Police!"—the police came; but before that I asked mamma for the rattle, and went into my sister's room and sprang it—on the afternoon of that day, I was in the library with young Somellera, and my two sisters; I was getting up a few sentences of poetry with master Somellera, and rose from my seat to recite them, when Dr. Winn, and his servant, Tinley, suddenly rushed up and opened the door—Dr. Winn told Tinley to come in, and made use of a bad expression, and said, "Take hold of the young vagabond by the throat; they are making a noise, and I will not allow a parcel of strangers in my house"—Tinley came and took hold of me by the throat—my sisters went down and told papa that Dr. Winn and Tinley were fighting me, and papa came up; Dr. Winn asked him to fight, and papa replied, "I am not a fighting man"—as they were going down stairs I heard Tinley say, "You shall suffer before the night is out," that meant my <hi rend="italic">pa</hi>, because it was said to him—Dr. Winn replied, "Yes, he shall."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I was walking with him on the evening of Saturday fortnight; when we got under an archway, near Goswell-street, the prisoner and her sister came up, and accosted my husband—the prisoner asked me to stand on one side, and she went about four yards distance from me with my husband—I heard her ask him for money, or else to allow her so much a week—I did not hear what else she said—she said a great deal, but I did not hear it—I was about four yards away—she said if he did not give her money she would do something to him; it was some threatening language—I do not remember exactly what it was—he said he would not give her half a farthing, and I saw her lift her right hand, and hit my husband; I then saw him run away—I went towards home, and the prisoner accosted me—I was about five doors from the house where I live; a struggle ensued between us, and T felt the knife with her, I got a cut on the wrist with it—I do not exactly know in whose hand the, knife was then, whether hers or her sister's, for I was struggling with them both—I got it away in the struggle, I believe from the prisoner, but I was so faint, I do not know whether I dropped it, or what became of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go to meet your husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not know I was coming—the knife has never been found—I do not know how I got rid of it—the prisoner's sister was with her—my husband and the prisoner went aside about three yards from me at first; he wanted to go away, but she would not let him—I did not have any struggle with the prisoner until after my husband was struck—she <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me away at first—I did not slap either of their faces—I was going after my husband when they accosted me—there was a fight afterwards; I believe a young man, named Hodd, came up and parted us—I am not bound to answer whether I have ever been under sentence—whatever struggle occurred between the prisoner and me, was after my husband had run away—I did not know that he was wounded; I thought he had run away to save a disturbance.</p>

On the Sunday morning on which the prosecutor's house was robbed, I was standing at the top of the court, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, waiting for my father and mother—I saw the prisoner turn round the corner; he had some bread under his arm—he had more than one loaf—I knew him before; he lives in the next court to me—he turned down his own court—there is a gas light in the middle of the court—I am sure it was him—I saw two policeman at the time drinking some coffee.</p>

On the morning of 1st Feb., I was on duty in Mile End Road, about a quarter before 6 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and three other men standing at the doors of Mr. Avila, a pawn<lb/>broker, in Park-place—the prisoner was at the door of No. 16, there was a man at the door of No. 17, a man at the door of No. 18, and a man at the shutters of No. 16, where the prisoner was at the door—I was then about fifty yards from him—I went within ten or twelve yards of him, and I law him moving his arm as if boring something into the door; and to my belief the other men were doing the same as he was—the prisoner turned round, and came towards me—I went up to the door to see what he had been doing, and I saw this gimlet made fast into the door, and, to the best of my belief, the prisoner had been working with it—I took hold of him by the collar and sprung my rattle for assistance—as soon as I did that, the other three men ran down the Mile End Road, towards Bow—the prisoner said, "You need not make that noise"—assistance came, and we took him to the station, and found this gimlet and knife on him.</p>

I said, "Yes," and broke it before her, and threw the best part of it into a punch bowl, and afterwards gave it to a policeman—I took the rum from her, and told her not to come for any more, or I should lock her up—on the 18th she came again with a bottle for half a quartern of rum—I suspected that she was the same woman when she first came in—she offered me a bad half crown, and I told her it was bad, and that she had been there before, which she denied—I said that I was sure of her, and should give her in charge;</p>

               <p>she said that she hoped I should not, for her sight was so bad; I told her it was her heart that was so bad, and gave her in charge, with the half crown and the broken pieces—I am certain she is the same person who came on the 7th.</p>

On Friday, 20th Feb., the prisoner was in Bishopsgate—street, and purchased some stamps, for which she tendered a half crown, which the shopkeeper said was bad, and she afterwards paid with a sixpence; she was afterwards seen to enter a linendraper's; she tendered another half crown, and was given into custody; it is submitted to the Court that there is no direct evidence to show that the first half crown was bad (<hi rend="italic">The particulars of a similar case at Southwark were then related</hi>); in reference to the second half crown, it is not likely she believed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020061"/>
               <p>it to be bad; she took it the same day for services rendered; there was nothing found on the prisoner to show that she was engaged in the pursuit of passing bad money; it may he said that she threw the stamps and half crown away, but she lost them; it is not likely that she would throw them away after paying for them; a person not being aware that she had got any bad money, might utter it without guilty knowledge; the Court is therefore reasonably called upon to give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt, as no case is made out as to the first being bad, or of her being possessed of the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at present a prisoner in Newgate, under sen<lb/>tence of transportation for life—I was convicted here a few Sessions since of the crime of forgery, with a person of the name of Hardwicke—I know Saward and Anderson—I became acquainted with Saward first—I was intro<lb/>duced to him by a person of the name of Saunders, a scalemaker and smith, in the Old-street road—it is now turned twelve months back since that introduction took place—it was in the year 1855—it is now about thirteen months back, I think—I had at that time in my possession three cancelled cheques, and two blank cheques—I received them from a person; I believe they came from a burglary—they were afterwards torn up—they were drawn on Barclay's bank by a person in Brick-lane, of the name of Doe, I think—I had some conversation with Saunders on the subject of those cheques, in consequence of which I appointed to meet him again, and did meet him again soon afterwards at his own house—Saward was present when I met him the second time—I had never seen Saward before—Saunders gave me the cheques that I had left with him, and then I showed them to Saward; Saunders said, "That is the person I mentioned to you"—Saward and I had some very trifling conversation inside; I came out with him from Saunders's, and he asked me then if I knew where they came from; I told him I believed they came from a burglary at a person's of the name of Doe, in Spitalfields; he said he should like to know where the person was, and who he was; and if I would go with him he should feel obliged—I went with him as far as Doe's place—before we went there Saward said that the two cheques that were not cancelled were to be filled up, to be forged—he said he had a man who he called his <hi rend="italic">sender</hi>, who would send them to the bank when they were filled up—Mr. Doe's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020062"/>
               <p>premises are in Brick-lane, Spitalfields—on seeing the premises he said that it was a very small place; he did not think he should be able to get much money from them—I then left him—I gave the cheques to Saward—he took them all five—I had an appointment to meet him a short time afterwards, and he met me, and told me that he had them all ready on a certain day—on the day that we went to see Doe's premises I made an appointment to meet him another time, I met him, to the best of my belief, a little above Old—street road first, that was the time before, before the cheques were sent, and I then had an appointment to meet him in the New-road, Spitalfields, to the best of my belief, where he then introduced the two cheques that I had given him in blank, filled up—it was on the second occasion that be brought the cheques—I believe those (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the two cheques that were in blank, and which he brought to me on the second occasion that I met him—when he produced them he said he had filled them up, and he showed me the three that were cancelled, to compare with the two that he had filled up; he asked me if I thought they were a very good imitation—I said "Yes," to the best of my belief; I looked at them all—after I had examined and compared the three cancelled cheques with the other two, he said these were of no use, and we tore them up.</p>
               <p>(The two cheques were here ready they were dated 9th and 10th Jan., and were for 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and were signed J. B. Doe, jun.; payable at Barclay's)—after the other cheques had been destroyed I went into the neighbourhood of Leman-street, Whitechapel, with Saward; three other persons were with him—one of them was Anderson, whom he called his <hi rend="italic">sender</hi>, and two other persons not in custody—we then went into a house near Leman-street, where Anderson bad taken lodgings, and wrote a letter to some person—I did not go into the house—Anderson went in, no one else—he told me he had written a letter for a person to come—this was on the day that the cheque was sent to the bankers—the lodging was taken, and the letter was written <hi rend="italic">unbeknown</hi> to me—he told me that be bad done it before; it was not done that day—he did not say where he had written it to; he said he had written it to a man who advertises generally in the papers for a situation—whilst we were in Leman-street a young man came to the same house were the lodgings were taken—I do not know his name; I should know the young man—(<hi rend="italic">The witness Draper was here called in</hi>)—I believe that is the young man that came there that morning—when he came Anderson was to give him this cheque to go to the bankers; I was to follow him there to see whether the money was paid; I did so, and saw the money paid—it was the smallest cheque of the two, for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I saw him receive the money at Barclay's—when he had received the money he came straight down to Leman-street—I followed him back to the lodging—the arrangement made by Anderson was, that a man who went with me to know whether the money was paid, was to run back and tell him; Anderson would not be in the lodging at the time, be would come out after he had given the man the cheque, and he was to go back and tell him whether the money was paid—I sent a message through that man that the money was paid—when I got back to Leman-street I found Anderson in the house—the money was given to Anderson; I believe he brought it out with him—the young man then went away—I did not hear anything said to him by Anderson—I and Anderson then went to a public house in the neighbourhood of Spitalfields, and stopped some little time, and had a glass of something to drink; and from there we went to the Eastern Counties Railway, where he proposed to meet another person to take the other cheque—that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020063"/>
               <p>was the same day—Saward was with us all day—when I returned on the cheque being paid, Saward was in Leman-street, not with Anderson, Anderson was inside, and Saward outside—we all joined, and went together to the Eastern Counties—the money was given to Saward by Anderson before we went to the Eastern Counties—the gold was shared, and the notes were given to Saward—there were five of us there; Anderson, Saward, and two other persons—one man they commonly called <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>; I do not know them by any other names—the notes were given to Saward—he said he would keep them until the other cheque was sent, to see if it was paid—we then went to the Eastern Counties Railway—I there saw another young man—I do not know his name—I should know him—(<hi rend="italic">Edward Brown was here called in</hi>)—that is the young man—Anderson spoke to him, took him into a sort of public house, and there gave him a cheque for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he was to take it to the bankers and get it cashed as the other man had done—at this time Saward was waiting outside, in the neighbourhood; I followed this young man to the banking house, as I had done the other—the cheque was paid, and I followed the young man back—at first he was going over London Bridge instead of going back to the Eastern Counties—I went and tapped him on the shoulder, and told him I thought he was going the, wrong way—he said that he was only going over to his master to inquire about his character; he did not mean anything dishonest—he turned round and came the right way, and gave the money to Anderson, right opposite Spital-square—I can hardly say whether it was in the street, or whether Anderson took him into a house; if it was in a house it was just round the corner—I think he did take him into a house, but I saw him give him the money—I saw Saward there; he was on the opposite side of the way—as Anderson was coming down one side Saward was coming down on the other—I had sent a message this time, the same as before, to say that it was all right—we then went into the neighbourhood of the Hackney-road—we went into a public house, and Saward took the notes to try and dispose of them for gold; to sell them; I mean the last notes as well as the first—he said he would go and try and sell them to a person that he knew—he mentioned a person of the name of Hall, to the best of my belief—I do not recollect Hall's Christian name being mentioned—Saward left us for that purpose, and took the notes with him—he was gone about an hour, or an hour and a quarter—when he came back he brought us so much gold for the notes—I believe the cost of them was about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—we then shared the money—it was put up in sixes—there were five of us there—I took a share for bringing the papers, and that I gave the person of the name of Saunders a part of, for the introduction—I had somewhere about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—I had two shares, because I had the papers—we then separated—Saward told me if I should ever have anything of that kind I was to let him know, and he said he would let me know—I gave him my address where I lived in Cottage-lane, and he said he would write to me, or I might always find him through Mr. Saunders—he did not give me his address at the time—I was then living in Cottage-lane—I went by the name of Hawkes—a female was living with me as my wife—her name is Eliza<lb/>beth Evans, I believe—I lived with her a little better than two years, I think—I have an aunt of the name of Elizabeth Haydon—she occa<lb/>sionally used to visit me at Cottage-lane—Saward came to me in Cottage-lane about two months after the transaction at Barclay's, I think, or it might be less; I cannot speak to the time—I saw him more than once there, I believe—I saw him twice in Cottage-lane—I</p>

               <p>remember the presentation of the cheque at Smith, Payne, and Smith's—he called at my place on that day—he said that he had some business on hand, and if I wished to join in, as I had done before, I could come; which I agreed to do—he showed me some cheques—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>) these are them—they are nine cancelled cheques—they are signed by a person of the name of Ash—he also showed me this one (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is a cheque for 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the same bankers, and in the same name of Ash—he said that was to be sent to the bankers, in the same way of business as the one to Barclay's—I compared this with the cancelled cheques, and said I thought it appeared very perfect—he did not tell me then how he had got these cheques, but I believe I heard afterwards how they were got; they were the produce of a burglary—he told me that there was a place taken in Oakley-crescent, City-road, I think—he said the same person as before was going to present this cheque; Anderson, the sender; and I was to follow the man to the bankers in the same way—he left the cancelled cheques at my place for me to take care of—I then met Anderson out in the road—Saward was with me—we all went to a public house in the neighbourhood of the City-road, and then Anderson dressed up for the occasion, as he used to do—he wore a wig; sometimes he would wear whiskers, and sometimes not—I did not go with him to Oakley<lb/>crescent—I was waiting in the neighbourhood—I saw a young man come there—(<hi rend="italic">The witness Humphreys was here called in</hi>)—I believe he looks something like the young man—he went to the lodging in Oakley-crescent, where Anderson was—he was sent at first on some errand to the railway at Camden Town—I waited in the neighbourhood until lie came back—Anderson went into the lodging before he returned—the young man then came out, and went in the direction of the City—I followed him—I saw him present the cheque at Smith, Payne, and Smith's—it was not paid—on that, I came back, and met the other persons, who were outside—I sent them on, and then I came on myself, and told them it was stopped—(<hi rend="italic">The cheque was here read, dated</hi> 21 <hi rend="italic">Feb.</hi>, 1856, for 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">drawn by Charles F. Ash, on Smith, Payne, and Smith</hi>)—at the time these nine cancelled cheques were deposited with me by Saward, I was in the front room of my house, in Cottage-lane—I then had the whole of that house—Elizabeth Evans came into the room whilst this was being done—a sheet of paper was left at the same time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I received it from Saward, at the same time—(<hi rend="italic">This was stated to be a sheet of blank cheques upon the North Western Bank of England</hi>)—they all continued in my custody for some time—Saward asked me to take care of them; they would come in very useful—I gave the cancelled cheques and this sheet of paper to Eliza<lb/>beth Evans, to take care of them for me; to put them where I might know where to find them at any time—they continued under her care until I was taken into custody—after this, Saward left a letter with my brother one evening, stating that I was to meet him—I did meet him—I believe he called at my place the next morning, and told me that he had received a book of cheques from a banker's at the corner of the Haymarket, which they had sent for, that they had taken some lodgings, and they wished me to go and follow the young man to the banker's, as I had done before, with some of the cheques out of that book; I agreed to that—I followed three young men, each with a separate cheque—one was sent from the neighbourhood of Park-street, Camden Town, and the other two from the neighbourhood of St. John's Wood-lodgings were taken for the purpose, in the same way as before—(<hi rend="italic">The witness Bowells was here called in</hi>)—I cannot say that that is</p>

               <p>the young man that went from Park-street—I have no doubt he is, but I cannot swear it; I cannot call his features to mind—soon after this, I saw Saward about a bill of exchange—I remember a lodging being taken in Cumberland-street, Hackney-road—Saward said that he had a bill ready filled up, which he wished to try upon the bankers, and I was to go with them and get a lodging—I met them against Shoreditch Church; Saward, Anderson, and another person—Anderson went and took a lodging in Cumberland-street—I waited in the neighbourhood—Saward did not show me the bill that day—he did the next day—I believe this to be the bill—(<hi rend="italic">This was a bill for</hi> 386<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated Jan.</hi> 15, 1856, <hi rend="italic">at three months, pay<lb/>able to W. F. Jennings and Co., addressed, "Samuel Dobree, 6, Tokenhouse-yard, London;" accepted at Hankers, for Samuel Dobree and Sons, Thomas Gray</hi>)—this bill was sent from Cumberland-street by Anderson—he was then dressed the same as he usually was, with a wig—I do not know whether he had false whiskers then or not—the young man was despatched from there with that bill—that is the young man (<hi rend="italic">looking at Wigzell</hi>)—I followed him to Hankey's bank, and saw him present the bill—it was not paid—upon that I went to a coffee house, in Shoreditch, where I found Saward and Anderson—I told them the bill was not paid, and we separated—I had seen something written on the back of the bill that day, in the coffee house, by Saward, before it was sent—the bill was detained, it did not come back—I do not know exactly what it was that Saward wrote; it was some little trifling thing—the date of the month was generally put to them on the day they were dated, making them due that day; otherwise, if they were dated before, I have heard him say they would not be payable at all, provided they were negligent as to the date—I believe he wrote nothing except the day of the month—In April last I went to the office of Mr. Turner, a solicitor, in Bed lion-square—that was in consequence of an arrangement made by Saward, myself, Anderson, and another person—Saward gave me an I O U, which I was to take to Mr. Turner, and give him instructions to write for payment, for the purpose of getting a cheque of Mr. Turner's, after the money was paid—I went to the office with the I O U, and instructed Mr. Turner, or his clerk, to proceed to recover the payment of that money—I described myself to Mr. Turner as Mr. Hunter—Saward suggested that name to me—he said, as the debt I applied for was under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I might give the name of Hunter; that Mr. Turner should write the letters "Hun," which would be half of the word "Hundred," and so get the cheque from him in order to forge others—Mr. Hesp was the name of the supposed debtor—I do not recollect the address; I know the place very well; it is in the neighbourhood of the New-road—Anderson took a lodging there, for the purpose of having the letters to Mr. Hesp addressed there—I advanced, I think, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money for the payment of this debt—my brother took it to Mr. Turner's—I gave it to him—a few days afterwards I called at Mr. Turner's, and his clerk paid me the money in cash—I saw Saward afterwards, and told him—he said, "We cannot help it; it must stand over till another time; we must try it again"—About this time I became acquainted with Hardwicke—Saward first mentioned Hard-wicke to me—he told me that he had an old friend of his that he had known many years; that he was going to meet him, and he would intro<lb/>duce me to him; that he had come from Australia, and had some business to do—I went with Saward and Anderson to Farringdon-market, and met Hardwicke—we went into a public house, and had a glass of something to drink, and some little conversation passed between us</p>

               <p>about having some papers—we met again that same evening, at a house in the Southwark-bridge-road, Hardwicke, Saward, Anderson, and myself—we had something to drink, and we had something to eat that evening—they had no cooked victuals in the house—we asked the landlord whether he had anything cooked; he said, "No," but he would send out and get us something; he did so, and got some boiled beef ready cooked; in conse<lb/>quence of that we always called that house "The beef house"—we met several times afterwards at that house, Hardwicke being one of the party—on one occasion of our being there Hardwicke produced this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) with some others; all the other persons were present when he produced it; he had some blank forms that he had brought from Australia, and a for<lb/>gery was to be committed by copying this; the bill and the other papers were given to Saward; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the blank forms, this one was in blank—the whole of the papers were given to Saward—Saward afterwards told me that he had the bills ready to present at the bankers; we were then at the same house, the beef house—we were all present—he did not produce any that evening; he told me there were two bills, one for 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I believe the other was to be for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I saw nothing of them on that occasion—I saw the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on the morning it was pre<lb/>sented at the bank—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—(The 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bill was here read; it was dated Hobart Town, Feb.</hi> 16, 1856, <hi rend="italic">payable to the order of Mr. William Crosby and Co.</hi>, at Messrs.

Riley, No. 2, De Beauvoir-place, Kingsland-road"—that was the place where the lodgings were taken by Anderson in the name of Riley—Cle<lb/>mence was to go into the City to get the note cashed; it was a sort of trial, to see whether he was capable of going right for the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he was sent to get the note changed, and to bring two 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill stamps from the City—Clemence came there and was dispatched with the note—I saw him</p>

               <p>return, he brought the two stamps with him—Anderson sent Clemence out, I believe to go and get some refreshment, while he brought the stamps to Saward—we were still at the public house; Saward took one of the stamps and placed it on the back of the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and wrote the address across the stamp—the change for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was given to Anderson, and he gave it to Hardwicke, it was Hardwicke's note; the other 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp was given to me to take care of—I kept it, it was in my pocket book; this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—when the stamp was put on, and the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was ready, Ander<lb/>son took it from the public house—he was then dressed, and had his wig on—Clemence was sent with the bill—I followed him, I rode down on the same <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> with him to the City—Hardwicke and Saward also went in the neighbourhood of the banking house, not to the bank—Anderson was to wait at a public house in Bishopsgate churchyard, or passage, whilst the bill was being presented—Clemence went to Heywood's bank, I do not know whether it is in Lombard-street, it is on the same side of the way as the Mansion House, in King William-street, I think—I saw him go in with the bill—Saward was at that time waiting under the clock, right opposite, not the clock that sticks out, but the one under the archway, in King William-street, near the old Post-office—Hardwicke followed the young man into the banking house—soon after, Hardwicke came out and gave me a sort of signal, and I went in directly after him—I saw that the money was stopped; it had been paid to the young man by the appearance, but I could see by the finish of it that the money was being taken back—I then came out and went away with Saward and Hardwicke—I saw Saward outside in the passage—I went to him and told him that the money was not paid, and we all went to Anderson at the public house in Biahopsgate Churchyard, where he was supposed to be waiting till our return—we waited there some little time, and then separated—after this I employed Mr. Turner again, in the same way as before—I think T went there on the Monday as the bill foiled on the Saturday—we met at a public house, I believe in Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, to arrange the second applica<lb/>tion to Mr. Turner—Anderson, myself Saward, and Hardwicke were there, and another person who had the blanks, those that were written out, forged—an I O U was then written—I cannot call to my recollection now the name of the supposed debtor in that case, there have been so many different names—I believe Hart was the name—I went to Mr. Turner's and gave instructions in the same way; the debt was 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, I cannot tell exactly—a lodging was taken by Anderson for the supposed Mr. Hart, in the New-road, near St. Pancras Churc—a few days after the 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced by Hardwicke—he sent it to Mr. Turner by some person—a few days after it had been sent, I called at Mr. Turner's—I still kept the name of Hunter—they told me that the debt had been paid, but Mr. Turner was not within when I called in the morning—on calling again, I got a cheque, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the receipt I signed—(<hi rend="italic">The cheque teas dated, June</hi>, 24th, 1856, <hi rend="italic">on Gosling and Sharp</hi>, for 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">signed Alfred Turner.

               <p>returned me the cheque that I had received from Mr. Turner; I took it to the banker's, and got the money; I received a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I gave it to Havdwicke, it was his money—About this time several letters were written to persons who advertised for situations; among them was one near Moruington-crescent—I saw the young man that came there—Anderson had taken a lodging there, I do not remember in what name just now; he was to meet him at the University Hotel, in Tottenham Court Road; I do not remember the day—I, and Anderson, and Saward, met together the first thing that morning, at a public house in the neighbourhood of the New-road, Hardwicke waiting in the neighbourhood of the banking house to see whether the young man came, because it was some distance—Saward produced a cheque—I believe this to be the one—(<hi rend="italic">This was a cheque for</hi> 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 28th June, 1856, <hi rend="italic">on Gosling and Sharp, signed Alfred Turner</hi>)—the cheque was given to Anderson, to give to the young man, to take to the bank—I was to watch the young man to the bank—I saw the young man leave the University Hotel, and go to the bank—I followed him—(<hi rend="italic">the witness Hardy was called in</hi>)—I believe that to be the young man—Hardwicke went inside the banking house whilst the young man was there; I did not go in—it had been arranged that if the young man came out, I was to follow him—I followed him back to Mornington-crescent; as he was going along, he was stopped by Anderson, and I saw him hand the money to Anderson; I did not hear what passed—we subsequently met at a public house near the Haymarket Theatre, I, Anderson, and Saward, and the other man that was with us; Hardwicke was not there—we waited some time for Hardwicke, but he did not come; we then went to a coffee house in the neighbourhood of the Blackfriars-road, I do not remember the sign; it was leading up the Elephant and Castle way, in the same road; Saward said he knew where he could find Hardwicke if he was at home, and he went and fetched him—eight 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were then produced, and some gold, the difference of the cheque for 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Hardwicke had the notes; he gave cash for them at the time; he gave 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the money was divided into five parts, for me, Saward, Anderson, Hardwicke, and the other person not in custody; he had a share because he found the three blank cheques; he had produced them, and given them to Saward; he had them from Mr. Turner; he picked his pocket, I believe; he was considered entitled to a fifth share—Hardwicke and I then went to Ham<lb/>burg with the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and got them changed there—In Aug. last I remember a transaction of the same kind at Hankey's bank; Hardwicke received a check from some one who I do not know, for a small amount of money; he showed it to Saward, Saward said that he had some blanks which would fit it—we met by appointment at the house in Bishopsgate-churchyard, where we had met before; I Saward, Hardwicke, and Anderson, attended that meeting; it was on a Saturday—Saward then produced some cheques (<hi rend="italic">looking at three cheques, one for</hi> 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">signed Daniel Baldwin</hi>)—these are what he produced—he said that Anderson was to take them, one of them which he gave him first, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the White Hart, in Bishopsgate street, and send the boots from there with it—the did so—Saward was to be at the Magpie, in Bishopsgate-street—we all four went to the Magpie, and there arranged our business, in the back parlour—I was to watch the man to the banker's, as I did before; I do not know his name—I should know the young man; that is him (<hi rend="italic">looking at Mitchenton</hi>)—I went to the banker's after him—I did not see the cheque paid, Hardwicke saw the first cheque paid; I was outside the</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a prisoner in Newgate, under sentence of transportation for life. Many years ago I was sentenced to a term of transportation for felony from Brecon; I expiated a crime that I never committed; I was transported to Van Diemen's Land—I established myself in business at Hobart Town—after the expiration of my term of transpor<lb/>tation I returned to England, and continued to return about every three years—I have known Saward from twenty-four to twenty-six years, perhaps a little longer, I cannot confine myself to a year or two—I had known him some years previous to my first conviction for felony—on my occasional visits to this country from Van Diemen's Land, I used to see Saward from time to time—this day twelve months I took my passage at Melbourne, and arrived here on 26th May last—I and my wife took lodgings in Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road—shortly afterwards I met Saward in Suffolk-street, Borough—he met me with astonishment, and asked me how long I had been in England—I said some time; I did not satisfy him at first how long I had been here—he said, "How is it you have never called upon me?"—I said, "I never intended to call, from the manner in which you have treated me, I never intend to call upon you again"—he said, "Oh! never mind, old fellow, we will pay up all arrears, and we will go together, and get some money; I will put your passage money into your pocket again"—we drank together, and next day, or a few days after, I met him by appoint<lb/>ment in Farringdon Market—he said that he would introduce me to the parties that he was then working with; I did not know their names at that time—I was introduced to them in June, in Farringdon Market, and we afterwards drank together at the Coach and Horses; I was introduced to Anderson and Atwell—Atwell was known by the name of Hawkes at that time; he was called <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, Anderson was called <hi rend="italic">Bob.</hi>—I subsequently met Anderson and Atwell at a house in Guildford-street, Southwark, which we called the beef house—when I came from Australia, I brought with me a bill of exchange for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and others; this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had about l, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Treasury bills; and I had some blank forms of bills with me—I had to draw on a house for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and took the blank forms with me, but when I arrived there they had got the bills already drawn to accommodate me, so that I should not be delayed in going on board the ship, so I brought the blank bills to England with me—I met Saward at the beef house, and showed him what I had, and he said he thought some business might be done with them; we could go into business—I gave him the bill to take a copy from it for the purpose of taking Stephen's name off—I saw him on the following day, and he returned me the bill, saying he had done what ho wanted—I then paid the bill into Coutts's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of conversation between you, Saward, and Anderson, what plan was to be adopted for the purpose of making use of the accept<lb/>ances which he forged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was to find the money for out of pocket expenses, and Anderson was to be the sender, that is, the sender of the forged bills, and Atwell was to be implicated to watch what took place—that was the plan arranged upon between us—shortly after this plan was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020071"/>
               <p>arranged I went with Anderson and Atwell to Townsend, the hatter's, in the neighbourhood of Cheapside, to purchase a large sized hat—Anderson was trying on the hat—Saward was not there, he was not in our company that morning—a young man named, Clemence came into the shop, to inquire for employment—after seeing that young man, I told Saward that a very likely young man had been into the hatter's shop, seeking for employ<lb/>ment, and that I had got his address—Saward and I arranged that when the bill was ready, and we were to go into the transaction on the Saturday following, this young man was to be written to, to be engaged by Anderson—the taking the apartment was left to Anderson and Atwell—Saward had arranged with them to go and take the lodging for the purpose—I believe a lodging was taken, for that special purpose, somewhere by the De Beauvoir-road; I never went there—Saward met me in the Borough, and we went to the Kingsland-road—I think that was on a Saturday morning, 14th June—we went into a public house on that occasion, it was an old fashioned public house, for Anderson to change his dress; that was to put on his wig and whiskers—I do not remember the name of that public house—I had never been there before; I am speaking of where we first met, that was at the Sussex Arms in the house where we went afterwards in the Inglefield-road—I am confounding myself—previous to his taking the lodging, he had dressed at a public house in Kiogsland-road, but on this occasion he dressed at the Sussex Arms in the Inglefield-road—that was about 9 o'clock in the morning—we had some brandy and milk there—the landlady apologised for the room not being ready, having had company the evening previous; but I got the newspaper from her, and I held the newspaper, and pen and ink was called for—I had a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note with me—I gave it, I think, into Ander<lb/>son's hands, but Saward put the name and address upon it, across the nice of the note—I believe this is the note (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—that note was given to Clemeuce, its I understand, but I did not see it given—the change was handed over to me when he came back; 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamps—Ander<lb/>son gave the stamps to Saward; he pasted one on the back of the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and filled up the date on the bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) this is the portion, written by Saward—that bill was afterwards given to Clemence for the purpose of being taken to Heywood's—I went to Hey wood's, and saw Clemence go in—I saw the money paid, and the last of the sovereigns put into the bag—after the sovereigns were put in, it was taken from Clemence's hand, and put on one side of the counter—in consequence of that I came out, and made a signal, and motioned Atwell to go in—Saward was waiting under the old Post Office-passage, in Lombard-street, by the clock—he was made aware of what had occurred, and he went off directly to tell Anderson that it had failed—we afterwards went into a public house in Bishopsgate-churchyard, and dined—upon a Monday soon afterwards, I, Saward, Ander<lb/>son, and Atwell, met in reference to another transaction; that was about Mr. Turner's matter—Saward said that they had failed in the first instance in getting Mr. Turner's signature, not having sufficient money, but would I advance a further sum, say 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so, for another application to be made to Mr. Turner; and let the money remain a few days in his hands, so that it should be paid into his bankers', and get his cheque—I advanced 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—we met in reference to that matter at a public house in Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields—an I O U was written on that occasion by Saward, and given to Atwell—on the day when Atwell was to go to Mr. Turner's office, we were all in Kingsgate-street, waiting for him—Mr. Turner was not in at the first application—myself, Anderson,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020072"/>
               <p>Atwell, and Saward were standing in Kingsgate-street in front of the house, when Mr. Turner passed by, and Saward said, "That is Mr. Turner"—in a few minutes Atwell followed him into his office—he brought a cheque out with him, and it was given to Saward to take the signature from—I consented for him to take the cheque away (it was my money), and do what was necessary with it, to take a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>) of the signature—I was not at that time engaged with any person in reference to some blank cheques on Gosling's—I do not know the party at all; I have seen him—Anderson and Saward were the parties that had this man with the blank cheques—on Saturday, 28th June, we all met at a public house near St. Pancras Church—that was the day on which it was arranged to utter one of the cheques—a cheque for 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., purporting to be signed by Mr. Turner, was given to a young man, and sent to the bank—I went to the bank myself—I went inside and saw the cheque presented—I was making inquiry about a dis<lb/>honoured bill drawn by a Mr. Richards—that was merely to take the clerk's attention—I saw the money paid, and the man leave the place—I after<lb/>wards sought to meet Saward and Anderson, but I forgot the house where I was to meet them, and I went home, and from there I went to a Mrs. Dixon's, a cousin of mine, in Union-street, Borough-road; they have the care of St. Michael's Chapel—I said, if the elderly gentleman that used to call on me, should call and ask for me, to say I had been waiting for him, but I had gone home—on coming out of the gate I met Saward—he said, "It is all right, old boy; where have you been to?"—he took me to a coffee shop where the rest of the party were waiting; Anderson, Atwell, and the man that had brought the cheque—on that occasion there was a division of the produce of the forged cheques—I purchased the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at the request of Saward—Saward put the price upon them, and I found the gold to pay—I gave 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; it was all paid in gold—shortly after that, I and Atwell went to Hamburg, and there I changed the notes—I was away about seven or eight days—shortly after my return, a cheque on Messrs. Hankey's, signed by Mr. Baldwin, fell into my possession—I was going into the City to get it cashed, and I showed it to Saward—he said that he could <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> it, meaning that he had got similar cheques—he said he could <hi rend="italic">fit</hi>, it, he had other cheques of the same descrip<lb/>tion; I left the cheque in his possession—I cannot say whether it was returned the same day or the following, but I had it returned in an envelope—I met Saward shortly after—I do not at this moment recollect at what particular house—we were in the habit of meeting at the Magpie and Stump, but we had so many meetings that I got confused with the different places—an arrangement was come to between Saward and myself with reference to some cheques upon Hankey's—he said as he could, <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> the cheque, he should send in some cheques for money—he showed me three cheques prepared for that purpose, one for 50<hi rend="italic">i.</hi>, and two for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—on that Saturday two of those cheques were sent to be cashed by a young man, one from the White Hart in Bishopsgate-street—I went to Messrs. Hankey's as I had gone to the previous bank, and saw the first cheque paid—Saward, Anderson, and I were at different places that day—we did not part till the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was paid—I subsequently had an interview with Anderson and Saward on the subject, at the Magpie and Horseshoe, or the Magpie and Punchbowl, in Bishopsgate-street—we made an arrangement to meet on the Monday—we met on Monday at Gregory's Hotel, I think they call it, in Cheapside, under an archway—the other cheque was presented for payment that day—I had two of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, the proceeds of the cheques, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020073"/>
               <p>Saward had two—I paid 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for them in gold—I remember being at the Gresham Arms, in Wood-street—there was some money of mine counted out there on the table, bank-notes, and gold—that was in case any question should arise about a stranger being in the bank, he should pay in a sum to some one in the country, so as to be afterwards received—I believe the money passed between Atwell and Saward—I let them have the money out of my pocket, and they were counting it—I am not certain whether Atwell had it, or whether I had it, but it was returned to me—Atwell was at the table at the time, and he and Saward, I believe, were both counting it—shortly after I went down to Yarmouth in the name of James Ralph—I took a small furnished house in that name—before going, I made an arrangement that letters directed to James Ralph should be left at the Chapter Coffee-house, Paternoster-row—when I came to London, I found the Chapter Coffee-house was closed, and, as I understood it was in Chancery, I called on the persons inhabiting the house, and asked them, if any letters should arrive in the name of James Ralph, to take charge of them for me, and I would reward them for it, which I did—Saward went with me to the Chapter Coffee-house—I introduced him to the young girl who took in the letters, and told her if any letters arrived in the name of James Ralph, she was to be kind enough to give them to that gentleman, which was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went down to Yarmouth, you were aware, I believe, that letters were to be sent to solicitors there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Atwell was to have the whole management of sending up to London to parties upon I O U's, and Anderson was to take lodgings in fictitious names, and receive the letters sent from the solicitors—after being some little time at Yarmouth, I came up to London to see the result of the letters, and to find the money to pay the proceeds to the different attorneys who had been applied to—I met Saward, Anderson, and Atwell in Queen-street on that afternoon—upon that occasion Saward wrote to the different parties whom Atwell had been in correspon<lb/>dence with about these assumed debts—in pursuance of the arrangement, I changed a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, to get 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—the whole of the money remitted to the country was somewhere about 314<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found the balance very heavy to carry in my pocket, and being anxious to return to Yarmouth that evening, I paid 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into Barclay's bank—I paid it in in the name of Whitney, but I forgot to put that it was for James Ralph, the name that I was assuming at that time; I was flurried at the time—when I got to Yarmouth I applied through Messrs. Gurney's for the money, as James Ralph, and then discovered the mistake I had made—inconsequence of that I wrote to Saward under the name of James Ralph, at the Chapter Coffee-house—he got that letter, and returned an answer which I never got—I was apprehended on the 15th.</p>

Monday: I did not write on Saturday, because I expected to<lb/>day to have been able to have rectified fully your unfortunate mishap. Mr. Roberts attended again this morning at B—'s, to know their determination under the circumstances. It is this, that Mr. Whitney must attend himself at B—'s, and explain the matter, and sign a fresh note with his name, the same as he signed the paying in note, the writing of course being the same by comparison—they will then send a fresh note as instruction for G—'s to pay to James Ralph; the paying in note has been sent to G—'a, and they have it; they would not show it to Mr. Roberts when he applied there on Saturday, but said that Whitney had paid it in to his own credit. Now, I considered the matter <hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi> yesterday, and you must do this, literally: just do as I state; go to G—'s, see the paying in note, mind you must see it; state you have written to Mr. Whitney, and he will rectify it at B—'s, and you will call on them again in a day or two. Come up directly, go to B—'s, write a fresh note for them to send to G—'s, and then return, and you will get the cash. Pray do not move further in other matters until this is arranged, I beg of you not to do so. I can see through a brick wall sometimes, and I see through one now; be guided by me, for I am generally secure by caution;<hi rend="italic">cavendo tutus</hi>, as Ovid says. Mr. Roberts told B—'s this morning, that he thought Mr. Whitney might have gone on a tour of pleasure up the Rhine, but he did not know positively; they said they could not help it. If you can accomplish what you have to do, we will meet you to-morrow night, Tuesday, at 9, at the beef house, but if we do not see you there at that time, we will meet you the next day, Wednesday morning, at</p>

I have written fully, but I hope you will not think it a bore reading.

Atwell is my nephew—n the early part of last year he was living in Cottage-lane, City-road, in the name of Hawkes—I used to go there nearly every day—I have seen Saward there—I first saw him in Feb., last year—he was standing against the Sportsman public-house, City-road, which is nearly opposite Cottage-lane—I was sent to him by Atwell with a message—I did not know him personally, only by the description Atwell had given me; I went up to him, and said, "I beg your pardon, sir; I hope you will excuse the liberty I am taking, but are you waiting for a gentleman of the name of Hawkes?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "He is engaged this morning, and will not be able to meet you, but he will meet you at the appointed place on Wednesday"—soon afterwards I happened to be at my nephew's when Saward called—I saw him—my nephew was not at home, and I told him so—a little after that, he called again while I was there; I let him in, and showed him into the parlour—while he was there with Atwell, I happened to go into the room, and I saw a small roll, about the size of my finger, lying on the table—I believe these cheques were the parcel I saw, but they were not folded in this manner; more like a roll—I saw these papers at my nephew's, for several days after<lb/>wards, on the chimney piece in the front room up stairs, my nephew's bed-room—they were then tied with a small portion of string.</p>

                  </hi>. I am registrar at the Westminster County Court. On 27th Jan. this summons (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) came on to be heard before Mr. Bailey—Mary Simpson was the plaintiff, and Mr. Cregreen was the defendant—Mary Simpson was sworn—I heard her give evidence—there was only one particular point that made much impression on my mind; I remember her swearing that she had lent sums of money to the defendant—she was asked on cross-examination whether the defendant had ever been surety for her to a loan society, and she said he had not—I have no parti<lb/>cular recollection of anything else—after she had given evidence, the case was adjourned till 4th Feb.—I was not present when the documents were produced, but I was when she was ordered into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to my father, who is the attorney in this case—I was present when the case was tried—Mary Simpson was sworn—I recollect my attention being called more particularly to the fact regarding a certain loan—after she had been warned, she stated, in answer to a question put by my father, that she never had a loan—that Mr. Cregreen was not security for the payment of that loan, and Mr. Tomsett was not joint security with Mr. Cregreen—my father then cautioned her to be careful how she answered—he had these two notes in his hand, and he read from them, and said, "Have you not had money from the Brunswick</p>

               <p>Street branch office?"—she said, "No; never—she also swore that she had lent Mr. Cregreen money in July, and several other months in 1856, and that Mr. Cregreen never advanced her any money at all—she was asked whether Mr. Cregreen had lent her money; she said, no, he had put his name down to certain papers as subscriptions for her, but never paid her any money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not your father ask her who was present at any time when the money was advanced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she said that Mr. Cregreen's wife was present on some occasions—and she said that the servant had borrowed money of her on Mr. Cregreen's account—Mr. Ore<lb/>green was then the defendant—11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the amount that she said she had lent—there was money on both sides struck off—the defendant pleaded a set off—this is the set off—it is my writing—a portion was struck off because they were transactions with the husband.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you not on very friendly terms with the late Mr. Simpson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as friendship was concerned, I was on amicable terms with him, because he was foreman under my superintendence—we were on friendly and intimate terms—I have lent money to him on several occasions—I may have borrowed of him to meet contingencies—at the time of his death, I continued on friendly terms with the widow—I did her all the service that laid in my power, for the sake of her family—I got up more than one, two, or three subscriptions for her—I think the first was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. subscribed—I do not know the exact amount—I headed it with a sum, and I paid the sums over to the prisoner—I put my name down half a sovereign—I swear that—I did not get up a couple of raffles, but I instructed the foreman who took the place of her deceased husband to get up the raffles as a mere assistant to her—I took no part, except instructing him to exercise all the influence he could amongst the men (about 100) to get up money for a brother foreman's widow—I never threw at these raffles—I heard her husband say that he belonged to a benefit society—I do not know that his widow received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she might or might not—she did not receive it to my knowledge—I am aware that there was some money due from the employer of her late husband that she was entitled to receive—I believe Mr. Jones, the engineer, said 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all she was entitled to, but on my representation, she received a greater amount—about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it might be: and out of that she bought a mangle—I have got the receipt of it—I did not say at the Westminster County Court that I bought the mangle—I said I held the receipt for the mangle—I went about it—a certain portion of it was paid for with her money—I paid the rest out of my own benevolence—I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I forget which—it cost 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. alto<lb/>gether—it broke down, and they had to have it repaired, and there was a board to notify that mangling was done, and altogether amounted to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I</p>

I claimed as advanced by me on the 13th was not got from the society—I believe I did not say at the County Court that I never had been sued—I could not swear that I have not been sued, because I know I have—I believe I can swear that the question was never asked me—I should not like to swear that I did not swear I had never been sued—if you wish to know, I have been sued—I believe I did not swear I had not—I could not swear I had not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Agar Town, and am a labourer. I knew the deceased Richard Cotterell well. On the morning of 31st Jan. I was with him—we had been in the City, and were returning from it in a direction to King's Cross—we were at the railway station, King's Cross, about a quarter past 1 o'clock—there was a pie shop open; I went into that shop, and left Cotterell outside, and he walked on—I went into the shop, and called for two pies—when I found that Cotterell had walked on, I returned to the door, and called "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>" two or three times—I then saw three men on the opposite side of the way—they were the prisoner, and Hughes, and Moore—the prisoner made use of foul language, and said, "Who the b—hell are you calling to?"—I said I was not talking to them, or calling them, but I was calling a friend of mine—the prisoner said he would learn me how to call <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>—he did not appear to be sober—he struck me in the chest, and I very nearly went backwards, but I kept on my legs—I asked him what he was doing it for—the other two came up, and surrounded me; I pushed the prisoner aside, and rap away towards King's Cross, and the three followed after me—I overtook Cotterell at the corner of King's Cross, close to the railway station—when I was with him, those persons overtook me, and Hughes struck me twice with a stick—I saw the prisoner at that time stand<lb/>ing close by Cotterell, and Moore close by him—I saw the prisoner strike Cot<lb/>terell on the breast, and I saw him fall backwards against the kerb stone; Cotterell had not done or said anything to the prisoner before he struck him on the breast—when I saw Cotterell fall, I ran towards the Great Northern</p>

               <p>hotel, and they all ran after me—I saw the Great Northern policeman take the prisoner into custody, and I went back to where Cotterell was—another policeman was fetched, and I gave all, the three into custody—when I came back, Cotterell was lying as if he was dead; there was no sense in him—he bled very much—the three men were taken to the station, and the Great Northern policeman raised Cotterell up, and led him to the station—after the charge was booked, I and the constable conveyed Cotterell to University Hospital—his head was dressed and bandaged up and I led him back home to his mother, in York-place, Agar Town—we got to his mother's between 3 and 4 o'clock—he was sober.</p>

On the Saturday morning on which this matter happened I was on duty at King's-cross—I saw the deceased standing in the middle of the road—I saw the last witness run up to him, and heard him say, "They are coming"—I stood in a gateway, and the last witness and Cotterell ran towards me, and the prisoner, and Moore, and Hughes followed them—when Cotterell was coming towards me I could see him plainly—the three men followed; they got within ten yards of me, and struck at him—Cotterell turned round to face them, and he said, "Save me!" or words to that effect—there was a blow struck by each of them—the prisoner was on the left side—he struck the last blow, and Cotterell fell, and his head came in contact with the kerb stone—he fell just as a dead man would fall backwards—Hughes and the last witness were engaged on the left of me—they had a bit of a scuffle, and the other two ran off, and turned up Western-street—I followed them, and called one of our men—we went, and overtook the prisoner—I told him I wished him to go back with me—he said, "I suppose you intend to take me into custody?"—I said, "I will tell you what my intentions are when I see what injury the man has received who was knocked down"—I went back, and saw the deceased in the same position as before, and the blood was run<lb/>ning—I asked some stranger to fetch a metropolitan constable—one came belonging to the <hi rend="largeCaps">E</hi> division—he said he did not like to have anything to do with it—after that another came, and he took the prisoner into custody—when Cotterell was insensible, the last witness and I took him to the station—Cotterell did not do anything before he was struck—he and the last witness were running towards me—I do not think Cotterell uttered a word except "Save me," or something of that kind—the prisoner was drunk; he could not walk steady, and Hughes was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the resident medical officer of University College Hospital. I saw the deceased on 31st Jan.—he was in a semi-conscious state, suffering from concussion of the brain—I was told it arose from a blow in a drunken brawl, and I considered he might be suffering from drink—I admitted him into the hospital, but he went away in an hour or two—he came again in the evening of the same day—I saw him on the Sunday morning—he had recovered his consciousness; he was perfectly conscious—he remained in the hospital till the following Tuesday—I assisted in making a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination after his death—I discovered a bruise on the back of the head, and blood on the surface of the brain—the membrane was inflamed, and the substance of the brain, and the front of the brain, exactly, opposite to the blow—there was a wound on the scalp, rather, more than one inch long, extending upwards three-fourths of an inch—the appearances were exactly what I should have expected from a fall backwards against any hard substance—I attribute his death to depression of the brain from the blood—it was such an injury as might be occasioned by the blow—the internal injury would result from the external injury.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 32, North-street, Mile End road. I am a job buyer of artificial flowers. On the morning of Tuesday, 24th Feb., the prisoner, William Henry, came to me; he brought me a bunch of flowers—he asked me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I bought it; he said he had got some more, if I would buy them—I said I was a buyer, if they suited me—both the prisoners returned to me again about half past 12 o'clock the same day, and brought one box of flowers, Thomas Henry carried them—these are the flowers—I bought them; there were three dozen and one bunches—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bunch for them, 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I paid it to William Henry—Thomas Henry was present, and took the empty box away—I saw William Henry again the same evening; he came to my stall for the remainder of the money—I had not paid him all—I had not got the money; he said he wanted some, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the moment I got the flowers I put them out on my stall, and when William Henry came in the evening he said, "I would not put them out for a day or two"—he did not state any reason for that—he went away with the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had known the prisoners for four years—I have bought things of them; they are both dealers in this sort of goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker of Stratford<lb/>grove, West Ham. I have known the prisoner four or five years, in the employment of Mr. Kayess—he. came to my shop on the evening of 14th Feb., and said, "Mr. Kayess says, if you have any ready made boots and shoes which you think will fit me, you are to let me have some to take for his approval"—I gave him a pair of boots, and on Monday morning, 16th Feb., he came and said that Mr. Kayess had not decided on keeping the boots altogether, but he wished to see a pair of shoes, if I had any that would fit him, Smith; I showed him a pair of shoes, and tie took them away—he came again on Tuesday morning, and said that Mr. Kayess had decided</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Dover Castle, Church-street, Greenwich. On 6th Feb., about 11 o'clock, Patrick Donoghue came and called for a pint of beer—I served him—he tendered me a shilling, which I put into the till—there were ten or twelve other shillings there—he drank the beer very quickly, so I looked in the till, and found a bad shilling—I took it out, and put it into my waistcoat pocket—a few minutes afterwards he came in again with the other prisoner, and called for a pint of beer—he laid a sixpence on the counter—I saw that it was bad, but did not tell him so, but gave him the change, and put it in a compartment of the till by itself—the prisoners drank the beer together, and in a minute or two Patrick called for another pint of beer, and laid down a sixpence—I found that it was bad, bit it before them, and put it with the other, but did not say that it was bad—they drank the beer between them—Jeremiah then said, "Master, I do not see that it is any use having a pint, give us a quart," and put down a shilling—I saw immediately that it was bad, and bent it three times one way, and again the contrary way, for the purpose of knowing it—a customer drew my attention off, which made me put it down, and the moment I did so, Jeremiah snatched it up, and said, "You have no business to bend it"—I took it—I watched my opportunity of getting round the counter, and went out to look for a policeman—Jeremiah tried to get away, and fought with me for some considerable time; he pulled the door open, and struck me, and, being stronger than me, he got out of doors, and I having hold of his collar, he dragged me several yards, and got away—I secured him after he had run about 200 yards, and he appeared to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> something away—I hallooed out, "Police"—we got 300 or 400 yards further, and he struck me again; we struggled, and he got away, and ran up a passage by a Church—I caught him again by the collar, and, about 200 yards down the street, met the other prisoner; I <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> him with my left hand, and held them both;</p>

               <p>a policeman came, and I gave one up to him and kept the other; he attacked me in my throat—another policeman came and got his hand from my neck—I am sure the prisoners are the men; I never lost sight of them.</p>

I looked down, and saw a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece or half crown fall out of the paper; I picked it up, and put it on the counter—I had never seen either of those coins before I kicked against them; I swear that—that was the money that Turner took up—after that I saw a paper with 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it on the floor, six or eight inches from the other place, and near to a crack in the floor—I picked that up and put it on the counter, too—I had never seen it before; I did not open it—I had never seen either of the prisoners before.</p>

               <p>take his answers down—he then asked him if he knew Reynolds, Ford, Cuttress, and Dallor?—he replied that he did—the Judge then asked him whether he had admitted to them owing Judd any money?—he replied that he had never admitted to any of them that he did—as near as I can recollect, he said, "I never said to any of them that I owe Judd money"—he was then asked about an I O U—he was asked whether he had stated to any of the witnesses that he had given Judd an I O U? and he said that he had never seen the I O U till the last Court day, meaning 16th Jan.—he was then asked about board and rent, and said, "I never said anything to anybody about board or rent," or "about money I owe to Judd for board or rent," as near as I can recollect, that was it—three of the four persons mentioned to him were called, that was after he was put into the box—they were Ford, Cuttress, and Dallor—their evidence decidedly contradicted him; judgment was then given for the whole amount—the Judge ordered him into custody, and he found one bail in 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the money was paid, with the costs, ten days from that day—it was what we call a short order—the defendant came to the office, and paid the money himself—this is the certi<lb/>ficate of the Judge; it is under the seal of the Court, and is signed by Mr. Clive.

               <p>his bread of us during those months—I said that I could not let the bread and rent go on without money; and he said, "You have behaved very cruel to me, and I will leave"—I said, "If you leave, you must give me an acknowledgment for what you owe me;" and he went up stairs, and sent down this I O U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by his servant—I received it—we then had a fresh arrangement, and he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week regularly, till I left the house; about the half quarter, 1854—I then went to Croydon—I met him several times at a public house, and he said, "I am ashamed to see you"—I heard that he had received the money—he said, "I cannot pay you, but I will pay you in June"—I went in June, and he said, "I do not know when I shall pay you"—I said, "I shall not come, I shall send somebody else," and employed Dallor to go for the money—I did not make out a bill to him till I was at the County Court; it was given to him; this is a copy of it—the agent made out the bill, and he said to me, "You hold this as a copy"—I will swear the defendant had it because I gave it to him—that was the same day that Pocock brought me the I O U—I afterwards proceeded against him in the County Court, for the amount, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and received the money out of Court for it—I never saw his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, and keep the Old Justice, Little Suffolk-street, Southwark-bridge-road. I know the defendant, he resided at St. Andrew's-road, Newington, I believe, but I have never been to his house—I have known him a couple of years—I have known Mr. Judd four or five years—on 3rd Feb. I was in the County Court, Southwark, at the hearing of Judd <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Green—I had been subpœnaed, or I should not have attended—Mr. Green told me eighteen months ago that he owed Mr. Judd for board and rent between 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was when I first knew him, and when he lived with Judd and with Ford—he has said that half a dozen times—he also said, "Mr. Judd has an I O U from me"—he has talked to me about the I O U several times, when we have been smoking our pipes together in the parlour—he was sober at the time—I do not believe I ever saw him the worse for liquor—I heard him examined at the County Court; the Judge asked him whether the debt was just, and he said, "No;" and whether he gave an I O U to Mr. Judd, and he said, "No;" but it was proved—the Judge or the Counsel asked him whether he had ever said any<lb/>thing about the I O U to me, or told me about it, and he denied it—I was asked by Green to arrange the debt for him, but I cannot tell you when; it was before this action was brought, but after the debt was due—I told him that if he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay over to Mr. Judd, I would arrange it with Mr. Judd, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards in a month, and he promised to bring it to me, but no money came, and it was not done—Mr. Judd would have accepted it then—it was to be altogether liquidated for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was twelve months ago, but I cannot say exactly; it was before he went into the shop—Green said that he was going to have some money by some lawsuit—he asked me to make an arrangement, and I said that I could accommodate him—he did not ask me if I thought Judd would press him for the amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You managed to persuade him to promise to give the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a house agent, of Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road. I know the prosecutor and defendant—I was subpœnaed by Mr. Judd to the Southwark County Court on 3rd Feb.—I had before that been employed by him to apply to Green for a debt which he owed—I saw Green two or three times, about Aug., 1856, and applied to him for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent, and something for board, about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. together—he stated that he owed. the money, and referred me to his solicitor, stating that some property was coming to him—I went there, but they did not seem to entertain the idea that he had much prospect—I saw Green again several times, and had con<lb/>versations with him, and suggested to him that he had better pay it; I offered to take it at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at one time—I was present on 3rd Feb., when he denied the debt—the Judge told him to be particularly guarded and read over the evidence to him, and said, "I will again read it over to you that you may know what you are stating;" and he asked one of the officers of the Court whether he had been sworn, and was told that he had; he then asked him whether he owed the money or not, and he denied it—the Judge ordered the payment forthwith, and ordered him to be committed—the Judge asked him whether he had signed an I O U, but I do not recollect his answer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Horsley-street, Walworth, and know the prosecutor and defendant—I have been at Cuttress's house with Green several times, and recollect Green telling me that Mr. Judd held an I O U for the amount, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the exact amount—he said that more than once or twice—after he had received the summons from the County Court, I had a conversation with him at my house, he said, "I have got it at last;" I said, "What?" he said, "I have got a summons from Mr. Judd;" I said, "Well, you owe him the money, you know, and how do you think you can pay it?"—he said, "I do not know how I can pay it"—I said, "You had better try and settle it, if you can," he paused a bit and said, "It would be the best way"—I said, "Perhaps I can settle it for you for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said, "If you could, I wish you would," and pro<lb/>posed for me to write to Mr. Judd—I said, "No, perhaps I may see him"—on the next Sunday, Mr. Judd called on me about something else, and had tea with me, and I spoke to him about it—I do not think I saw Green after that, but he has spoken to me about the debt, I dare say as many as ten times.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly porter in the service of Mr. Galibert, in Union-street, St. Saviour's, Southwark. I went into his employ five years ago—I have known the prisoner Carroll about nine months, and Bou<lb/>langer about six months, he is a hatter, and lives in Worcester-street, about five minutes' walk from Mr. Galibert's—Mr. Galibert is a manufac<lb/>turer of silk plush, used for hats—I first became acquainted with Bou<lb/>langer by taking to him my own hat to have it cleaned and brushed up—he said if I had any pieces of plush about in the warehouse, to bring them in—that was about Oct. last—I took him in some corner pieces and long pieces about that time—they were of this sort (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—he knew where I lived, and that I was in the prosecutor's service—when I took them, he used to give me sometimes 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a glass of gin—I took things similar to these, about eight or nine times—after that he said these pieces were no use at all, he could not cut anything out of them; he said if I had a piece, I could bring it in—he did not say what sort of a piece—I had taken those pieces out of the drawer; when they were cut off, they were flung in there—after he had spoken to me about a larger piece, I recollect taking a large piece in Dec.—it was a whole piece, about forty yards—I did not take it all at once, I took fifteen or sixteen yards first, and the other afterwards—for that he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, by instalments—I believe that piece was upwards of forty yards—I do not know the value of it—the next I took was in Feb.—I saw Carroll about that time, at his own house—he works at a wharf—I told him I would bring a piece to him, and he said he would get rid of it—I took him a piece of plush, about thirty yards—I took that at once—I took a part of that about six yards, or not quite</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 30, Union-street. I have been a silk plush importer for these twenty years—we take stock every month, and on 30th Dec. we found there was a piece of plush missing, a piece which cost me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—we sell it about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—it contained about forty-three or forty-five yards—after that I found that ay porter had charged me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. extra in some charges—I gave him notice to leave at the end of Jan.—on 15th Feb. we took stock, and missed a piece of the best goods, which had only come into the house a few days back—I called Hurne, and said, "There is another piece missed, I am afraid you are the thief"—he said, "No, I am not," but afterwards he confessed it—on that I discharged him—I afterwards sent for him again, to know if he would acknowledge it; he acknowledged it, and I sent for the policeman—I went with the policeman to Boulanger—I saw him, and the policeman spoke to him—a small quantity of the first piece of plush was found there,</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Crosby-row, Walworth, and occupy several adjoining houses; I am a boot and shoe manufacturer. On Thursday morning, 11th Dec., a little before 8 o'clock, I went into my warehouse, and discovered a hole in the roof—two or three rails, on which shoes had been suspended just under the hole, were broken—it appears as if the individual who got through the hole had used the rails as a ladder, as there was damp dirt on the broken rails—the warehouse communicates with my private house, by a short lobby, and is in the parish of St. Mary, Newington—I missed about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property; the most popular articles of the season, those which could be soonest converted into money—they were selected from various parts of the warehouse, which abounds with passages, and has such a multitudinous number of rails, that a stranger would have been bewildered there—the iron bar which had fastened the door next to the garden had been taken down, and the door was half open—I went into the garden, and found marks of cart wheels and horse's feet—such a vehicle had never been there before—a cart had been backed into the garden from the passage, which is behind—I had seen the door safe in the afternoon, and it was not opened afterwards—the hole was in a part of the roof, between two stacks of chimneys—one stack prevents, to a great extent, any one in the private house from seeing the hole, and the other partially covered them from any person going down the side street—the prisoner Thompson had been in my employment—he left a few weeks before—he had been in my warehouse many times, and was conversant with the shoe trade—I found in the warehouse a pair of boots covered with wet mud, similar to that which was in the garden—I saw these boots tried on Thompson, and, according to my experience, they were a good fit—the mark of the toes seemed to fit his toes very precisely—I also missed five or six over—shoe boxes—boots transferred from the warehouse to the shop for sale, receive an additional mark; the selling price is attached to each pair in plain figures, and also a figure representing the month of the year; also, a stamped letter R, and various other marks, by which I know them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct sketch of my premises, and of the place where the entry was made in the roof—the hole was about eighteen inches square; it would not admit a very large man.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thomas Ellis Lush—it is not Lush Ellis—T never go by any other name—persons may sometimes call me Ellis, and sometimes Lush—I was taken into custody in the name of Ellis—they did not know my other name for some little time—I had been out of work pretty well eight weeks when I was taken—I am out of work now, and have been ever since—I have had about two days' work since I have been out—my wife does a little needlework, and sometimes I get a little job—I do not know how much a day I shall get here, I have not inquired—I have not had any money given to me—I believe the Magistrate gave my wife a trifle out of the poor box when I was in prison—I got nothing—the Magistrate gave my wife 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the day I was discharged—I was made a witness—two or three friends of mine have also given me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the police have not given me any money—I was taken up with a pair of shoes in my pocket—I was offering one pair in pawn, and had another pair in my pocket—the pawnbroker asked me if they were my own property—I said, "Yes," and told him that I had bought one pair for my wife, and the other pair for my daughter—I did not tell him where; he never asked me—(I have got two daughters)—that was com<lb/>pletely false, and I gave the policeman a false direction purposely—I pur<lb/>posely told the pawnbroker a falsehood about the boots, because I thought it would hurt me, but if I had told the truth, and given a proper direction, Mr. Hyde and Mr. Watts would have been here; the policeman would have gone and taken the property then, and Watts, and Hyde, and Johnson would have been taken there and then—if I had known they were stolen, do you suppose I should have gone and offered the boots in pawn, when I could have gone and got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward?—I heard of a reward of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not give my right name or address to the pawnbroker, but I gave them to the constable when I was taken at the pawnbroker's—I did not give any account of myself at the shop—I gave the name of Ellis—I have been known by that name all my life, for what I know—I have been in difficulties twice—you do not ask Mr. Hyde what he has been in diffi<lb/>culties about, and he has been transported—I have had three months twice for pewter pots—I have never been locked up besides—no other charge has been made against me—I was remanded nine times at the Police Court—my wife was not, to my knowledge, receiving support from the Magistrate during the whole of that time; she had some trifle—nothing was said to me about it being better for me to turn witness—Mrs. Johnson told my wife that if I had gone on as I had gone on at the first, and not told anything; I should have been the better for it—I did not ask to be a witness—Mr. Norton said, when I told him that I was very ill in prison, and wished to be let out on my own recognisance, "Never you mind, it will be better for you in the end," and in the end I became a witness—my wife was a witness before that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yon say that it was the second time you were before the Magistrate that you told him how you got the boots; why did not you tell him the first time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first time I was remanded for a week, and the Magistrate sent me to the House of Detention—I was put at the bar, and charged with stealing the boots, or having them, and was called upon to say what I had to say for myself—the policeman said that I would not give any satisfactory answers, and the Magistrate said, "Remand him for a week, and see if we can find out the owner of the property"—they did not know where I lived, or my true name; but when I came up to Marlborough-street again I told the officer where I lived, and how I got the boots, before I went before the Magistrate the second time—I knew Hyde and Watts before this—Watts is the master of the yard—he is not the regular master, but he <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> the rents, and let the place—I did not know that it was boots that were stolen till after the things came in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and were locked up in the cupboard—I thought they were the fair property of Watts and Hyde—I picked the boots up in the yard—I do not know how they came there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness, and live with him at Old Bell Yard, Westminster; we occupy a cottage inside the yard. On Friday night, 12th Dec, about 7 o'clock, or a quarter past, Johnson drove a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> into the yard—I did not see him come in, but I heard him—it was not his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, it was a man's named Banbury; but Johnson used to drive it of a night, and Banbury in the day—I did not notice what was done, because I was shut in the place—I had seen Hyde and Watts before, and I saw Watts that evening after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came in, and saw that there was another Person there; I cannot say who it was—I lent a candle to Mr. Watts—I saw one person carrying a load across the yard, but only one; I could not discern who it was—I had the care of the key, but afterwards we gave it up to Mr. Watts—he took it to the next door, and Miss Watts brought it to me on the Saturday night—I heard my husband ask Mr., Watts on that Friday night if he should carry the bundle which they took away—I could not see what the bundle was, but I saw Mr. Watts take a bundle down the yard with another gentleman—I never saw who the other person was—I saw the man, but could not discern who it was, as the light was twenty yards from me—on Saturday morning I saw Hyde and Watts in the Bell Yard, it was about 10 o'clock when they came—I could not see what they did; I was in my own place, and they were inside this public house, but I saw them go away, and Mr. Watts had something under his arm, in a yellow handkerchief and I saw the impression of a boot in it—Hyde was not carrying anything—in the after<lb/>noon they were both there, and they went out of the yard under the gate-way, each with a bag on his back, with a string over the shoulder—our cottage is eighteen or twenty yards from the gateway—it was not dark; it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and the days were very short—the key was not returned to me till late, perhaps it might be 10 o'clock at night—I have seen Johnson there since; he was there the whole of the week, up to the Saturday—the police came to me on the next Saturday—I never saw him after that.</p>

               <p>before, Watts had brought some boxes and packages to the Bell Inn; they were put in his stable by this very cowman, but he drove home in a cart—Banbury, the owner of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, stands in the same yard—he did leave, but he has come back again—since my husband has been in prison, I have received money from the police Magistrate; I think it is six or seven weeks, I cannot tell which—I received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one week, and the other weeks 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my husband was in custody on this charge—he did not show me the boots; I never saw them till to-day—when he came out he received 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the Magistrate; he had it in his hand; he has not had anything since, I am quite sure; not a farthing.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> The wheel marks were of a smallish cart—it might have been a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, the wheels were very narrow, and were not very wide apart.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">contended that there was no corroboration, except by Lush and his wife, which was no corroboration at all.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">sub<lb/>mitted, that Lush was only an accomplice as far as he was dealing with pro<lb/>perty recently stolen, and that the evidence he gave to exculpate himself would be evidence against the prisoners.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">considered, that as Lush had not admitted being an accomplice, the question would depend upon whether the Jury considered him so or not.</hi>)</p>
