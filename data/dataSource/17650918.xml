(The lock the prisoner's key, the proper key, and sack, produced in Court.) When we charged him with taking the oats, he owned he had taken some before, and he came in then for a few more; that he took them for his rabbits, and desired we would let him go.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of the plate?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was worth twelve or fourteen pounds: there were three prisoners then before Sir John, in irons; there was the prisoner Keeley; it was Keeley that came to my house to let me know my plate was found: at first he said, D - n his eyes, I did not deserve to have my plate again; and if he got loose again, he would rob me again. I gave him a shilling, as he seem'd distress'd; after which he said, D - n his eyes if he would rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. from Keeley. Did you not say I had a right to the reward?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not; I did not know who was intitled to that: I was told he had been discharged out of custody but the Thursday before.</p>

            . I have known Keeley ever since Christmas last. On the day before last sessions ended, he came to me about four in the morning, and call'd me out of bed; it was on a Friday; he lodged in the same house where I did; he desired me to go out with him to rob, or get any thing we could. I went out with him; he went into a gentleman's house in Bedford Row, where the door stood a jar, and brought out two glass cruets, with silver tops; this was between seven and eight o'clock; he gave them to me; then he went back again to a corner house, and brought out a knife case, with twelve table spoons, six forks and six knives, and a marrow spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get into that house?</p>
               <p>E. Morgan. He said the door was a jar; it was in the same street; he gave them to me; we brought them home, and went into an empty house, and looked at them, and found them to be all silver.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Where is your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My house is at the corner ofLittle James-street, by the chapel, Bedford Row.</p>

            . Gahagan came to me one morning about six o'clock, about the time of the last Old Bailey sessions: he said, Wright, I believe I can help you to something; there are some knives, forks, and spoons, that Farrell and Boyd have got in the coach yard, St. Giles's, in a shagreen case; and he knew where the gentleman they belonged to lived, and mentioned some Row; but what Row I cannot be particular in. We went in search of the people; presently came Keeley; we went together, and took two men, who were Farrell, and Boyd's husband. We met Hyde in the coal-yard; I told him of it; he went with us: we went two one way, and two another, in order to meet in the fields: the evidence Morgan was sitting by the side of a pond; I brought her along with me: we went to their lodgings, and search'd, but found only two glass cruets, which Boyd and Morgan afterwards acknowledged they had sold the silver tops belonging to them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Keeley. Did I not do all I could to take the persons?</p>
               <p>Wright. The boy took a great deal of pains that morning in order to find out the things and thieves; he was the means of all being taken up: we were to follow his steps: he said, Go along with me, and I'll be bound to have all concern'd in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came to know of the things being stolen?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Gahagan. or the boy Keeley, how they came to know how the things came to be stolen?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Keeley by when Gahagan said he believed he knew the gentleman that they belong to?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, I think he was not then come.</p>
               <p>Keeley's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the Friday night Morgan and her husband, and another man and a woman, were eating beef and potatoes at their lodgings in St. Giles's: Morgan's husband, nam'd Farrell, was very ragged: I said, What have you been doing all this while? O, said he, I will not be so ragged tomorrow, for we have got a very good booty this week. Said I, Will you let me look at it? No, said he, I cannot do that. He brought it in about half an hour to let me see it: she was with him: there were table-spoons, knives, and forks. Said they,

            , that used to buy things of them, and sell them, would not help them. (See Coffee tried with Farrell and his wife, No. 338. in this Mayoralty). Said I, I know a person since I was in New Prison that would buy of any body in the world: they all consented to go into the fields the next morning, and I was to bring the man to buy them: I went and told Mr. Wright of this, for him to get somebody to buy them, and by that means we should get them all. I said, The man must pretend to be a buyer of old cloaths, and call himself a Jew: so he got Mr. Hyde to go with me on that account. When Mr. Hyde came up to Morgan, he took out six or eight guineas, and said, Where is the plate? then she said, This woman (pointing to Boyd) had it. After that, Morgan cleared her own husband, and said I stole the plate. She had no way to come off but by swearing falsely against somebody or other. I am between thirteen and fourteen years of age.</p>
               <p>Boyd's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of this plate. Gahagan, and Farrell and his wife, had words with me, and he came at one o'clock with a drawn knife to take me out of bed: I ran to hide myself from these men: the people ask'd me what was the matter; I said it was a thief going to have me taken with a parcel of constables: he bid me come in and hide myself here: I went in, and got under his bed: the men came, and said, She is a thief: they took me out, and search'd the room, and Gahagan searched with them; and when I was before the Justices, Gahagan was very uneasy: he went back to search the room, and came again with the little boy: they brought in the things, and said they got them in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Morgan. When did you hide your share in the ditch?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I hid it that very Saturday.</p>

               <p>J. Melon. It is ( two glass casters produced): these are my master's property, which were lost out of this stand. (They fitted the frame, and corresponded with the wrought work on the other glasses).</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them before they were missing?</p>
               <p>J. Melon. I saw them the night before they were missing: the next morning I had put them in their places myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the court where your master lives?</p>
               <p>J. Melon. It is called Bragdell Court.</p>

About the 22 d or 23d of July, in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, to ask charity; I gave him some relief after he was gone, I missed two pair of silver buckles, set with stones, from off the counter near the door; he came to the stairs to me, about the middle of the shop, and hearing a strange voice, I came down. Mr. Johnson brought me one pair of them two or three hours after. I knew them to be one of the pair missing. I went before a magistrate, and swore to them; there was the prisoner. I knew him to be the man that asked charity of me; he said he found them.</p>

Mr. Bodker came and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180008"/> said he believed the prisoner had stole some buckles, he having offered some to sale; he had been and offered a pair to Mr. Crew: I took hold of him, and he had one buckle in his hand: we took him to Mr. Crew's shop; he had stopped one buckle, which he delivered to me. I put him in the Compter, and went up Cornhill, on the right hand, to all the shops, but took the wrong side; when I came to Mr. Clark's, he said, he had been looking about for them, and owned them. The prisoner said he found them in St. Paul's church yard: he said he had given the other pair away.</p>

On the first of August, I was above stairs; I came down, and saw the prisoner sitting close to the counter, with her left arm leaning on the counter: I saw her pulling a piece of cotton towards her, with her right hand, which made me suspicious: I walked to the door, and turned again, and saw she had got the cotton near her; I went to go into the counting-house, in order to watch her. I discovered the end of a piece of Irish cloth in her apron, under her left arm: I spoke to my young man, and asked him if that woman had bought any Irish? he said, no. I went up to her, she then got up with it in her apron; I took hold of it, and asked her what she was going to do with that? (there were several customers in the shop) she said very sharply, she had bought it at another shop, and would carry me to the shop where she bought it; I said it was my property, and desired her to walk into the counting house: she did, and made to the door to go out. I stopped her, and sent for a constable; she begged I would forgive her, and said it was the first time she had done so; she threw several little things out of her apron, and said she would give me them all, and pay me for the cloth, if I would forgive her: I called down my servant to search her, but she herself turned out her pocket, and had but Three-pence halfpenny about her: (the cloth produced in court.) I can very safely make oath it is my cloth, and what I took from her; here is my private mark upon it, about twelve yards and a half of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coleman. I live with Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott asked me if the prisoner had bought any thing? I turned, and saw him take the cloth from her; I had cut some cloth off it in the morning and put our private mark upon it; she had not been in the shop above three or four minutes.</p>

            . I happened to be at a house in St. Giles's, where the prisoner was drinking; he haul'd the watch out of his pocket; he said it was his father's, and he had fetched it out of pawn; he offered to sell it to a man for thirty-five shillings: he delivered it into a man's hand, and that man delivered it to me. I took the prisoner to the Round-house; the next morning when I went to take him before the justice, he said, Mr. Wright. I told you a lie, I found the watch just by where you live, in Charles-street, by the stand of coaches.</p>

            . I live in Clarkenwell, and deal in brandy and tea; I hearing the prosecutor say he had been robbed by the prisoner, and he wish'd he could find him; I knowing him, and that he belong'd to the Surry militia, got intelligence of him, and took him up: he was dress'd in a lapell'd blue grey coat, and duffil waistcoat: he was carried to Bridewell at Chatham: I came up to London for the prosecutor: when the prisoner was taken out to go before Mr. Best, to be examined, he went without coat or waistcoat: we went to Bridewell; there we found the coat and waistcoat torn all to pieces, and some of them put into one hole, and some in another. (Produced all in pieces, and a periwig in two pieces).</p>

               <p>I gave very proper notice that I was going away: the prosecutor gave but very little heed to it: Mr. Horn took me up and carried me before 'Squire Best; he told him there were some things belonging to the cloaths I had on that he could swear to; I shewed them to the gentleman, and he said Horn was a very bad man for saying so: I was ordered to put on my cloaths, and was taken to Chatham watch-house; I thought I had people against me that would swear any thing: I sent my cloaths to a house where I owed money, for I always love to pay where I owe; presently Mr. Horn came and tore best part of the place down, and found a parcel of rags that were torn to pieces by a man that had been out of his senses, and confined there. I desired the constable to go to my lodging, to fetch my cloaths, but I could never get them again: I was obliged to go naked through the streets to the justice's; this coat I have on I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180011"/> of the marine society; as I have served his Majesty, I always love to wear the cloth. I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Horn. Did you ever hear of this story of a madman before?</p>
               <p>Horn. No, I never did?</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for his coming in that undress before the justice?</p>
               <p>Horn. He said he had sold the cloaths to a cloaths-man: I know these pieces belong to the coat I took the prisoner in.</p>

Thus she went on some days. I had looked out some things, expecting she would wash them one day or another: she came on the Friday, and the Tuesday after, my apprentice miss'd two shirts: she came the next morning about nine; she put on a boiler; I thought she was going to wash; she went away and left it on the fire, and I saw no more of her till three in the afternoon; then Mrs. Welch, who had recommended her, came and asked for her; I said I should detain her when I saw her, for I had miss'd some things; which were four shirts, two pair of stockings, and a sheet: Mrs. Welch turn'd short, and went away, and return'd in about an hour, with two of the shirts, and said, Here are two of your shirts, and I know where some of the other things are in pawn; in about an hour after, she came and shoved the prisoner into my house, and said to her, There you have robb'd the man; defend yourself. I told her she should not go out till she was conducted out by an officer. I sent for one, and gave him charge of her: she made and excuse to go backwards into my kitchen, and in her return she stole one of the shirts that Mrs. Welch had just brought home: I saw it found upon her the next day, before the bench of justices in Whitechapel; we found a pair of shoe pawned by her with my mark upon them, my property.

               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner live servant with you?</p>
               <p>Stroud. Five months, wanting two or three days: she behaved very well till lately: I trusted her to take money while I and my wife were at market, and I believe she gave a just account, and was a very honest girl for three months; but lately she would not do any thing at all, and behaved very bad; I miss'd money at divers times; the first time I miss'd five guineas, the next four, the next three, and the next two; all in a little time: she used to buy herself things, and used to say she had a rich aunt, that sent her things and money; but I since find they were bought with my money; she has confess'd it all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you mistrust her, upon your missing money so at times?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I did not in the least: I thought my wife had taken it. On the 23d of August, I went to put up a guinea and a half into my bag, and I miss'd two quarter guineas, and either two half guineas, or a guinea, I know not which, and some silver. When I took the prisoner before Justice Cowley, she told us where the key was hid that she opened the lock with; the officer went and found it accordingly: I took her down in the ground, and told her, if she would let me know where my money was, I would let her go about her business; but after that I was frighted by the thief-takers; they threatened me very hard, that they would prosecute me if I did not her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said to her when she confessed?</p>
               <p>Stroud. There was no threatning, as I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said of shewing her favour?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I cannot say any thing as to that; she own'd every thing, and told me what goods she had bought with my money, and that she had laid out 10 l. 13. 6 d. of my money, and for what. (He mentioned shoes, gowns, stockings, hats, cardinal, necklaces, gold bobs, mittens, buckles, stays, petticoat, bonnet, caps, and shifts, which she owned she had bought and paid for with his money.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I should be glad if she could have favour shewed her; she is very young.</p>

               <p>Q. to Nash. Did the prisoner give you any directions about this sheet?</p>
               <p>Nash. No; only she said it was her own property.</p>

               <p>Nash. It is not customary with us to own any thing when people come for them, till we know the right owner?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to the man?</p>
               <p>Nash. I told him to bring the person that pledg'd it, and they should have it.</p>
               <p>Court. Whenever a person comes again from a magistrate for things supposed to be stolen, and you deny them, you will richly deserve to stand where that woman does.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. We had been together, and I went to Rotherhithe, and she came home; but I did not give her liberty to pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of her pawning a bl anket of your's?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did know of that, and I forgave her.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I never could write in my life; I know nothing of this letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you order any letter to be wrote to her?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I never did: she told me she had some money to receive; I said, if she would give me an order to receive it, I'll go and get it for you, and assist you in prison: she would not do any thing: she now owes me above 40 shillings, money lent and for lodging. I told her, if she would agree to that when she got out, she shall have the rest of her money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never send a paper to her in prison?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I sent a line or two by a woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This is it in my hand.</p>
               <p>It was read, to this purport:</p>
               <p>"I am sorry you have made such a fool of me</p>
               <p>"and yourself too. If you had done as I ask'd,</p>
               <p>"you would not have wanted for any thing; but</p>
               <p>"if you don't let me know, I will come to-morrow,</p>
               <p>"but not to be made a fool of again, as</p>
               <p>"before. If you do, all shall be made easy.</p>
               <p>"Pray send me word to-morrow or to-night by</p>
               <p>"the bearer."</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. What I sent by the woman was in such a manner.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. My door was broke open on the 23d of July, and a silk and stuff gown, and a silk clock and other things, were taken away: I inquired about, and found the gown and clock at a pawnbroker's: after that he went to the pawnbroker's again, and was stopt: I never saw him till I was sent for after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barnwell. The prisoner pledged this gown and cloak to me on the 23d of July, between seven and eight in the evening, for 6 s. About an hour after, a person came from the prosecutor, and ask'd if I had taken such things in: I said I had: then Mrs. Hall came and owned them: we bid her be still, and we would stop the man that brought them next time he came; and on the 12th of August the prisoner came again to pledge a hat, and we secured him.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Marybone parish. I carried my rattle to the watch house last Saturday morning, between four and five o'clock, and was going down the road home; there were the prisoner and another man sitting on the King's-head ale-house bench, the corner of Balsover-street; the prisoner had a sack lying upon the bench by him; the other man had a sort of a meal-sack hanging wallet-fashion, over his shoulder; I heard one of them say some thing about St. James's parish: when I came up to them, I said, this is not St. James's Parish, this is Marybone parish. The prisoner said, no master, what we are talking of, is Golden-square, and that is in St. James's parish, and the watchman does not go off there till five o'clock. I said, friend, you seem to be hard loaded this morning; the prisoner said, he was heavy loaded; that he bought it dear, and carried it a great way, having brought it 8 miles. I laid my hand upon the bag, and found that it contained fowls, or something of that sort, that were stolen goods: I went away, with a pretence to go home; they followed me; when they came opposite Argyle Buildings, they crossed over the way; I was a little before them, and turned back. There is a watchman's box at the end of the buildings; I asked the watchman if he had seen them? he said they were just gone by; we ran as fast as we could down Argyle-street: when I came to the top of Great Marlborough-street, I could just see the prisoner; I called to him to stop, he would not; so I told him, if he did not stop, I would set the dog on him. I laid hold of him, and the watchman run after the other, but could not overtake him: we took the prisoner to St. James's watch-house; he made some-resistance by the way, but I told him if he would not go quietly, I would set the dog upon him. The beadle of the watch-house took the fowls out; there were three hens and a cock, three ducks and a drake; the cock that is here produced, is the cock that was in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he came by them?</p>
               <p>Pemberton. He said, the man that was along with him, gave him a shilling and part of a pot of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180016"/> purl, to help him to carry them from Kensington-Gravel-pits to Temple-bar, the other man looked like a brewer's servant, or a bargeman, with a light great coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of it: I went with an acquaintance on Saturday morning last, as far as Kensington Gravel-pits; we were taking our leave of each other. and this man came by, and said, Soldier, are you going to London? if you will take part of my load, I'll give you a shilling and part of a pot of purl, at the first house that is open: I did not know what was in the sack, till it was opened at the round-house.</p>

            . There was a particular acquaintance of my master's came in, and called for six penny worth of rum and water, which was made him in this cup; I don't know the day of the month, but it was on a Tuesday in August; the cup was kept in a little cupboard in the bar, which is in the tap-room. The prisoner came in, and called for a pint of beer; when the gentleman had drank the liquor, he gave my mistress the cup; I saw her put it into the cupboard, and turn the key, but left it in the lock. I observed the prisoner looked at her the prisoner went away; I asked my mistress if he had paid for his beer? she said, he had. I went into the kitchen to do my work, and in less than five minutes, four men came in, and called for some rum and water: my mistress went to the cupboard for the cup, and it was gone, there had been nobody else in the house beside, from the time the prisoner went.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the kitchen in sight of this cupboard?</p>

               <p>Martin. He said he wanted to dispose of the cup. I asked him why he brought it in such a manner, and whether it was his own property? (I meant by its being bruised, and his taking it out of his pocket; as I thought by his appearance he was not master of such a cup) he said it was his own: I asked him his name, and where he lived; he told me his name was

I asked him what he valued the cup at? he said 5 l. I weighed it, and it came to but 3 l. 10 s. then I had a stronger suspicion that it was not his own, as he did not know the value of it. I told him I would stop the cup: he affirmed it was his property; that his wife and he had sell out, and therefore he was going to sell the cup; and that if I would send my servant to Mr. Thomas's, he would vouch it to be his property. I told him my man was not at home, but that he might send a porter, and if Mr. Thomas, or any reputable man, would vouch it to be his property, I would either return him the cup, or purchase it of him. He went out to fetch somebody for that purpose, but did not return again: the next morning I read it in the Daily Advertiser, only in the paper it is said to be marked with letters on the handle, but the letters are on the belly of the cup.

            . I am 'prentice to Mr. Smith. On Saturday, August 24, between the hours of twelve and one, the young lad and two more stood at the window while I was putting a watch together: when I had put it together, I wound it up, and went behind the door where our regulator stands, to time it; a tall genteel young man came into the shop, and stood between the window and me, so that I could not see a great deal of the shop; he took a woman's watch chain out of his pocket, and asked me the value of the chain and seal? I told him the chain was worth very little, as it was not compleat, but the seal might serve himself. Just as I mentioned these words, the prisoner came in as quick as possible, and took this watch out of a drawer that lay upon the board; there were two in the drawer: he went out again immediately: he went to the farther part of the shop, to go to the drawer; he passed by me again to go out, and I pursued him, and took him before he had got a dozen yards. I brought him back into the shop, and asked him what he had got of ours? (I did not see him take the watch, but I was sure he had taken something) he made no answer: I went to search him, and he took it out of his pocket, and threw it upon the ground at about a yard distance. My master saw it upon the floor before I took it up: I took the drawer out not three hours before, for a tool I wanted; the young man stayed in the shop till I came back: we did not know then that he was any confederate with the boy: a neighbour asked him if he knew the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion at that time that the man was concerned with the boys?</p>
               <p>Waddington. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other two?</p>
               <p>Waddington. He that came into the shop about the chain was one of them; the other ran away.</p>

They told me at one place that the prisoner had been there, and offered the things for sale, and the man knew him very well: upon hearing this, I went to Hicks's Hall, and took out a warrant; when I came home, I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180018"/> the things had been stopped at an ironmonger's in Barbican, where I had been: I took an officer, and went to the place where he lived, which was in the same street I live in: he went very quietly to the ironmonger's, where he had offered them for sale: the ironmonger's man knew him to be the man that brought the things to him, which he swore before the justice; the prisoner denied it when at the ironmonger's; I can swear to the things, we know one another's work; besides, I can swear to the measure which they are in, which was stolen at the same time.

When I found what she was charged with, I asked her for the key of her door? she said, the door was open: I went there; there were, I believe, twenty publicans at the door; I could not get in for some time: at last when I got in, there were none of my pots: I have lost a great number.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my shop, on the 7th of September, and asked to see a gold ring. I shewed her one, and while I was reaching for my scales, she snatched one from the card. I stopped her, and took it out of her hand: then she said she was going to shew it to her sister, that was over the way. I said, hussey, you came in with a pretence to buy a ring, and instead of that, you have stole one. She told me her sister lived in Spittal-fields, and her sister's name: (The ring produced in court). I have enquired after the prisoner's character, and find she bears a very good one; and her friends believe it to be her first fact.</p>

                  Isabella 
                  Nemoe

             sat in the room with me; he sat down upon a table for some time; I was very earnest at work. Nemoe was call'd out of the room: I was removed from the table: he fell upon me, with one arm before and the other behind, and with that behind me he put the sash down, which was his left hand, and dragg'd me to the bed from my chair: I had not time to say one word: the sash looked into the public street; it was a two pair of stairs room; the curtains to the window were open.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the bed from the chair where you sat?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. The bed was not a yard from the place where I sat, but not in the same room; then he tripp'd up my heels; I fell upon the child's bed-feet: and with the blow hurting my back, I had not power to speak: he confined my hands down to the bed under my head: I lay on the child's bed, rather on my right side; so then he did what he could do: he did not do so much as he would have done; but he gave me the foul disease.</p>
               <p>Court. If it is disagreeable to you, you must give the court an account, in as decent words as you can, what he did to you.</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. I had a great deal of natural knowledge of his private parts in my body; he put his private part into mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this without your consent?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. It was; he never ask'd me whether he should or should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you refuse or resist him?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. I did as much as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of this?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. He did the same as my husband did; a great deal of moisture came from him; afterwards I was so sore I could hardly sit in my chair.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination:</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first complain of this usage?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. I complained to Isabella Nemoe immediately; she came to the door, and the door was lock'd and fastened unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who unlock'd it?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. The prisoner did: she finding me full of tears, insisted upon knowing what was the matter, and I told her before his face; said she to him. A heavy curse fall on you: and I said, My curse, and God's curse, fall upon you, for my sake and my family.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in the room before this affair?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. I can't tell how long; not above a quarter of an hour. I told her every thing, as he sat in a chair, how he went on with me, and when he was gone, I told her over again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apply to a magistrate in order to take him up?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. He had told us before, he was going away: the very next day after this affair, Nemoe and I went down to his master's, to enquire for him; he was not at home; we were told he had been gone out with bread about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to the Justice for a warrant?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. I went for a warrant a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days after the fact committed was it that you told your husband?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. That would have been a fortnight come the Monday night, and I told him the Saturday before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell your husband of it?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. Because my husband found it out: I was very bad, and my husband took it from me; my husband charged me with giving him that distemper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell your husband he gave it you?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. I was afraid of his knowing of it: to my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. In the street near my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before or after you told your husband of it?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. He was taken up the next morning after.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180020"/>Q. Is not your house very public, what lodgers are there?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. There is a man and his wife, and three or four children, live in the room over me: the landlord lives in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in ravishing you?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. From the beginning to the end it might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you upon the bed before he entered your body?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. Not many minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body confine your mouth?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. No; I cry'd out as well as ever I could, and desired he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak mighty civil to him?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. No, I did not; but told him I would not consent to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, if this misfortune had not happened to your husband, should you ever have taken notice of this insult upon you?</p>
               <p>M. Oldner. Yes, I should have complained; but it would not have been at present; I was ashamed.</p>

I went to look for the money, and it was gone: I said, Sarah, I have lost this money, or mislaid it: she lived with me better than three weeks after I miss'd it (I was in hopes she had not been that bad person); she said she never had it: I used to say, Well, Sarah, I can't find the money; and one day I said to her, Suppose, Sarah, I was your servant, what would you think of me? This was on a Tuesday: she gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180021"/> herself airs, and fell out with me; she went away immediately, without giving me warning, and went to Justice Baker's for a warrant for her wages. On Thursday I went before the Justice, and paid her her wages: I said there, Sarah, I am afraid you are guilty of taking my money; she said she had but one halfpenny. On the same afternoon a relation of mine, who knew of my loss, seeing her have a great deal of money, acquainted me with it: I went the next morning and got a warrant, and on the Sunday evening took her up at Battersea.</p>

On the 30th of August, his master sent me word he had reason to suspect they had both been concerned in robbing me; that he had seen them both with a considerable sum of money, buying trifles, and some nights before they had spent seven shillings in punch and negus, and Moring had been seen with a movement, which he had made up into a watch for his brother. Upon that I sent for a constable, and charg'd Langham: he immediately confessed he had taken the things mentioned in the indictment, through the persuasion of Moring, and delivered them to him: he was sent to the Compter: the constable that took him there came back and told me he had confess'd to more things than he had to me, going along. After that I took up Moring in Smithfield, and charg'd him with those things; he immediately acknowledged he had taken the movement, and all the other articles mentioned in the indictment, as the other prisoner had done before. We took them before my Lord Mayor; they there confessed the same. Moringsaid the movement was made up into a watch, and his brother had it in his pocket in Long-Lane, and the oil-stone was at his father's: we went there, and found them accordingly (the watch and oil-stone produced in court). I can swear to the oil-stone as my property: the movement goes through so many alterations in finishing, I cannot take upon me to swear to that. Moring confess'd the main spring and chain were put in the watch (they are no part of the movement).</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about five months; she lived all that time at Mr. Fisher's. Miss Shoreditch, Mr. Fisher's niece, sent for me about nine o'clock on Sunday night, the 25th of August; I went; she told me the prisoner was taken very bad, and I must sit up with her all night; I went up immediately to her bedside, and said, Maria, how do you do? she said she was much better, and much easier: I ask'd her if I should get her any thing; her sister made answer, she was going to get her something; I told her I was sent for to sit up with her all night; she told me I had no occasion for that, for she should; I came down stairs, and her sister with me; her sister carried her something up; after that the sister came down, and said she would go home and ask her master to let her sit up all night, and desired nobody to go up stairs, for Maria was much easier, and believed she would go to sleep. While her sister was gone, Mr. Complin was sent for by Mr. Fisher's niece; he went up to her, came down again, and said he saw nothing at all; that if she had had any thing, she denied it; then there was orders given to search the house.

            . I knew the prisoner four months at Mr. Fisher's; the maid was so very bad, she could not wash; I wash'd for Mr. Fisher every month; I went that night a little before dark, time enough to have filled my tubs and copper; I saw Maria walking about in the kitchen, and her sister with her; she had her hands by her sides; she was not very well; her sister said she had got the piles; I saw some stuff in a pot on the dresser; then I went away for an hour. When I returned, the house was all in a confusion; she was gone to bed; Mrs. Clark was there; I went down into the kitchen, and they up stairs; I staid till Mrs. Davis and the sister came down; I said, What is the matter? I found they had seen some marks upon the stones in the yard. (I had had a mistrust she was with child two months before).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell her of it?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180024"/>M. Sharpham. No, I never did, nor any body else, as I know of. Her bigness appeared most on her sides: they search'd, and found the child in the necessary; I held the candle while it was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had children?</p>
               <p>M. Sharpham. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have come to its full birth?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharpham. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any still-born children?</p>
               <p>M. Sharpham. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say it was a still-born child?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharpham. I cannot; it was not quite cold; from thence is all my suspicion; it was the proper warmth of flesh and blood, I think. Towards the morning. I said to the prisoner, there was a fine baby below; she said nothing to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her linen and sheets?</p>
               <p>M. Sharpham. I did; they appeared like that of a woman brought to bed, stained in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing after this?</p>
               <p>M. Sharpham. She said it was too late to repent, she could not call it back: she was sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you imagine she was delivered?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharpham. We imagined she was delivered in her mistress's room.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't sometimes pains of a woman in labour come upon them when they can't help themselves?</p>
               <p>M. Sharpham. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a pain should take them when on the necessary, can they help themselves?</p>
               <p>M. Sharpham. I don't suppose they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman perfectly delivered at the time you saw her?</p>
               <p>M. Sharpham. She was not; there was something came from her a great while after.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the violence of her pains discharge the child while she was sitting on the vault?</p>
               <p>M. Sharpham. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say she said she was sorry for what she had done, might not that be applied to letting a man get her with child?</p>
               <p>M. Sharpham. That might be the case.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and man-midwife. I was sent for to Mr. Fisher's on the 25th of August, a little after nine o'clock; Mrs. Clark told me she believed there had been an unlucky accident; the maid had miscarried; that her sister had emptied something down the necessary; I said, I would go up and speak to her: I went up, and said, Maria, what is the matter with you? she said, I am better than I was: I said, I heard that you had something came from you; that you had miscarried: No, said she, I have not: I have been out of order two months, and now there has been rather too great a quantity than what naturally is: I asked her if I could do any thing for her; she said, No. I had another patient waiting for me; I went down, and said they must search the necessary house, and if they found any thing, they must send for me again: I went away, and about eleven o'clock they came and told me the child was found, and desired I would come directly. When I came, the child was lying on the ground, taken out of the necessary: I desired them to wash it, and bring it into the parlour; then I sent for Maria's sister down stairs, who was up with Maria: I asked what that was that she heaved down the necessary; she said it was water; I went up again to Maria, and asked her if she had not been brought to bed; she denied it; I said, You have no occasion to deny it now, for there was a child found that had not long been born; she still said it was not her's; I said, Considering the condition you are in, every body is convinced it is your's; then the lay still, and made no answer at all: I went down, and looked at the child, and found no marks of violence upon it: I told them they must let somebody take care of her that night, and I would come again in the morning: and I dar'd say every thing would come out: when I went in the morning. they shewed me what had come from her since I went away; then, upon my charging her with having had a child, she owned it; then I went away. I was ordered by the coroner the next evening, to open the body in the presence of another surgeon. We tried the usual experiment to know whether the child was born alive, that is, upon the lungs; if the lungs have imbibed the air. if the child has breathed, they will swim upon the surface of the water; if not, they will sink: we gave it as our opinion, that the child had breathed.</p>

               <p>Q. IF the child was born alive, and thrown into the little house, and drowned there, will the lungs always swim?</p>
               <p>Complin. Yes; if it was killed any way they would swim; besides, the soil was thick and stiff, and none of the water or nastiness was in its stomach; some might get up its nose.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you apprehend it was killed?</p>
               <p>Complin. It appeared to me it was stifled in the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think such a child as that might make a great noise, in being brought down stairs, if it was born alive?</p>
               <p>Complin. I think it might.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then this experiment is entirely from the inflation of the lungs?</p>
               <p>Complin. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the child's head was to come into the open air, don't you think the child's lungs would be instantly inflated?</p>
               <p>Complin. Yes, if it gives but two gasps; if it cries, the child was born alive.</p>
               <p>Q. If a woman be upon the necessary, and was delivered there, in the agonies that come near the critical time, can she help herself?</p>
               <p>Complin. No, she cannot; she then requires all the help they can. Sometimes twenty minutes is taken up in the delivery of a woman. In the course of that time, the head of the child being discharged from the mother, when the mouth is in the open air, then the inflation commences: when the child opens its mouth, and the lungs are once inflated, they never afterwards become dense, till some time after death.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not that accident happen to a woman that finds pains upon her different from what she may think the pains of labour, and be taken in labour on the necessary, and be delivered of a child?</p>
               <p>Complin. Yes, that may be the case.</p>
               <p>Q. May not a child falling in the soil have the same appearance as this child?</p>
               <p>Complin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sharpham. Did you see the after-burden?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180027"/>Sharpham. That was put upon a street, and I put it in the pot; then the prisoner was in bed; this was some hours after the child was found.</p>

I had lent them to her, and she said I might have them when I pleased to come for them.

            . I live at Hooley in Surrey. On the 21st of February the prisoner met me in Holbourn, and asked me if I wanted a place; that a gentleman's man had broke his leg; that he had put him in the hospital, and wanted another man, and said, that, if I would go, he would take me to the gentleman.

He went in and call'd for half a pint of wine: he said the gentleman's kinsman was to meet him there: he gave me a glass, and the kinsman came in, and began talking about tossing up, and how they came on the night before: he said he had lost six-and-twenty at tossing up with the butcher; he did not mention of what: the prisoner wanted him to toss up again; he said, I had very bad luck last night, and I can't toss up again; but however, he tossed with him for a guinea; they put a halfpenny under a hat, and tossed at what they call the best two in three; the prisoner got the guinea of him; the other pulled out a large purse, which seem'd full of money, and paid the guinea immediately; he went out, and said he had very bad luck; the prisoner wanted me to go his halves; he said it was only venturing, there was no danger but that I should get money; you see, says he, I get money; so I agreed, that if he won, he should give me six-pence, and if he lost, I would give him six-pence; the man came in again; they tossed; the prisoner won, and gave me six-pence; the other man went out again, and said he had bad luck; the prisoner wanted me to go more; he said, If you come to London. you must not mind a trifle; what is sixpence? you might as well get more as that; I had two guineas and a half, and nine shillings in silver; I put my hand into my pocket, and took my money out to see what silver I had; he said, Young man, that is just right, we will toss him for five pounds when he comes in again, we shall be sure to win, and put his hand upon mine: I said, that is all the money I have; I will not go all that; says he, You will be sure to win as much more; I did not consent to it; he took the money out of my hand; the man came in; they tossed up, and he said it is all gone, Davis: as soon as it was lost, the landlord came into the room, and said, Gentlemen, I understand you are gaming, and I beg you will go out of the house: the prisoner said, Come along, countryman, I'll lend you a guinea. and help you to a good place: they ran into Cursitor street, and said they would go to another house, and I should have the money again; but I lost them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the money on the board?</p>
               <p>Davis. It was in my hand, and he took my hand and held it, and kept talking to me all the while, that I should have the money again.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180028"/>Q. Was the other man by?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; he came in afterwards, and then the prisoner said he would toss with him for ten pounds; I said nothing; I was frightened, and did not know what to do; and it was all done in so little a time: I described them to a shoemaker at the Rose-Tavern in Cursitor-street, who gave me their names; Justice Fielding granted me a warrant, and I took them up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming up Holbourn; looking at the register-office, this man was there, and said there was nothing that would suit him; he wanted a place to look after a couple of horses; he asked me the way to Red Lion-Square; I told him I was going that way as far as the Blue Posts: we went there; I wish'd him a good night; he said, You have been very civil, Sir, and if you will take share of a pot of beer, you are welcome; I told him, I believed they did not sell beer there; but I was just going to have a glass of wine: I was just taking my leave of him, and in he came; I said. Now I will show you the readiest way to Red-Lion-Square: I was going to the door; my friend said to me, I shall not detain you long, if you will stay, and then you may shew the young man. I did not imagine I was going to gaming: the night before, I had been in his company, and he had lost some money; I had gone the young man's halves that won it of him; then he said, I was loser last night, and if you have a mind to give me a chance, I will toss now; he would not toss, unless I tossed for ten pounds: I told him I would not do that, without he would give me some odds; if you'll lay you guess three times out of four, I will lay you: the countryman said it was ten to one that no man could name three times out of four what a half-penny was; he pulled out all his money and laid it on the table, and his money and mine made eight or nine pounds, and we lost it. As I was lamentin g my ill luck, the landlord hearing me say it was unfortunate, he asked what was the matter; and said, Gentleman, I hope you have not been gaming; for he would not allow of it; the young fellow paid the reckoning: we went to the Rose in Cursitor-street; when we came there, the young fellow was not there: I told him he might find me at Mr. Jones's, opposite Sir

As I was standing in my shop, on the 17th of August, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I heard a rattling in the shew-glass, and bid my servant see what it was: he ran to the door, and we perceived the shew-glass was drawn up a considerable heighth; they had lifted the drawer up, and drawn the board of rings out: they drop'd about twenty rings in the shew-glass, and I lost fourteen or fifteen: they took the board away. I secured the shew-glass, and looked after the thieves, but could find nothing of them: there was also a box of silver clasps for shoes, and buttons and studs, and such things that were taken away. On the Tuesday following, Millar came to my house, and said, Sir, you was robbed on Saturday last: if you will get a proper officer, and come with me, I will shew you the thieves, and you may take some of the things on them; he told me he was one concerned in the robbery. I got an officer, and we went into a public-house to get some more help, as Millar told us there were eight concerned in the robbery. I desired him to set their names down, which he did. After we had got a watchman, and two or three others, we went into a house in the Coach yard, St. Giles's: Millar went in first; the constable, myself, and another followed: there was a man; he said, this is one of them, his name is

I said, I wish you would, I will be as favourable to you as I can: accordingly we took Davis to St. Ann's Round-house, and Millar to St. Giles's, that they might not be together. Davis told me there were eight concerned in the robbery, and gave me the same names as Millar had done, which were

             believing they were not gold, offered two of the rings for Half a Crown, which I gave him for them; we had each two rings apiece, and then there were four that could not be divided, because there were five in the gang, so we agreed to sell them, and divide the money: Davis went to sell them, and he happened to shew the brass ring to a woman, who he told us lived in Thieving-lane; and she said, Don't make a fool of me, that have made fools of thousands; he offered to shew her the others, but she would not see them. I went away, and gave the rings to my wife to sell; she got 7 s. 6 d. for them: I also gave her the studs and buttons; she got for some 2 s. 6 d. for some 2 s. and for some 18 d. not knowing they were stolen. The robbery was done on Saturday night, between the hours of nine and ten; and on the Tuesday I made the discovery to Mr. Fisher. My reason for going to Mr. Fisher was, I had been taken up, and put in prison, on false reports; and as no indictment could be found against me, I was cleared. I surrendered myself up, to get from the gang, and get my bread honestly, that was my only reason.</p>

I was sent for to the King's-arms alehouse, in Bishopsgate church-yard; they had got a bag of rough cast metal, that was left under a turner's stall: the person that keeps the alehouse, had sent for his pewterer, who sent for another pewterer, Mr. Fashion, in Bishopsgate-street, who knew they were our make, and sent for me: the prisoner was there when I was sent for; I knew they were ours: the prisoner said he took them out of a cellar. he turned a wheel for me four or five months. There is a particular mark on the mould, by which I know them. (The pewter produced in court, and deposed to by Prosecutrix).</p>

            . I keep a public-house, near Bishopsgate church-yard. This day three weeks in the morning, (there is a stable-yard close by my house) the men doing their business in the morning saw this bag of pewter hid under a shed, that is adjoining to my house, and desired me to take care of it, for the person that put it there, would certainly come to look for it again. I went to Mr. Fashion's, in Bishopsgate-street, that I deal with for my pots; he said they were stolen, and desired me to stop the person: the prisoner came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180032"/> about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and the men in the yard asked him if he had lost any thing? he said, he had put a bag under the place, as he was going farther on business. I said, why did not you bring it into the house? he said he had not got any money to call for any thing, and he did not like to trouble the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what was in the bag?</p>
               <p>Sudgen. He said it was some metal. I said, if you will call in the afternoon, I'll make enquiry of the men in the yard about it: he made slight of it, and said, if it was gone, he did not suppose he should hear of it any more: he came again on the Monday morning, and called for a pennyworth of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>Sudgen. He appeared so. He asked me if I had heard any thing of his sack? I told him, I had, and if he would set down, I would enquire in the yard for the man that found it. I went and fetch'd Mr. Fashion to my house, and then I brought the bag out of my cellar to the prisoner, and asked him if every thing was right? he turned it out upon the table before Mr. Fashion, and said all was very right, all was there that he had left. Mr. Fashion asked him how he came by it? he said he bought it of a man in Spittal-fields. He asked him if he knew the man he bought it of? he said he did not. Mr. Fashion sent for a pewterer in Goodman's-fields, who said they were Mrs. Gibson's moulds.</p>

               <p>I was not sober when I said I took them; I was along with Capt. Jackson, and crack'd my skull, so that if I drink two or three pennyworths of beer; it makes me drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Was he sober?</p>

In the mean time, Shields came by; he said he never dealt in silver, or thimbles in his life. (The thimbles produced in court.)

I asked the prisoner for another, and he pulled eight out of his pocket, and left them with me to sell: I sold five for him, at eighteen-pence each, and gave him the money, and when I found the prosecutor had not delivered them to the prisoner to sell, I returned the other three to him.</p>

            . I was coming from Kensington about three in the morning, on the 14th of July, and saw two men under the Park-wall, about an hundred yards distant; the other man ran away: the prisoner came to me, and said he was troubled with the gripes, and wanted me to let him have some milk; I having no measure with me, could not let him have any. He went to the other end of the dunghill to case himself; I had seen him put two baskets down: he walked farther off, I went and saw there were eight ducks, seven pigeons, and two cocks in the baskets; I took the baskets from where he had hid them, and carried them into the middle of the road. I sent a boy for my fellow-servant; the prisoner stood and peeped, to see what I did with them: when my fellow-servant came, he ran away, and we after him, took him, and brought him back, and secured him.</p>

This was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180034"/> about half an hour after eight in the evening. Two or three days after, Mackrell was taken up for robbing another shop in Leather-lane; he came to let me know he was at the robbing of mine; Mr. Clay came with him: the boy said he saw two gentlemen backwards, writing; that he opened the door, and went round the counter to the till; that the till was not locked: he first took the money out, and the two prisoners received part of the money of him at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was taken out of the till?</p>
               <p>Kirkland. I am certain there was not less than half a guinea lost in silver; I believe there was more.</p>

This was the last day of last sessions. It being pretty late that Saturday night, we went on the Monday Morning; she had told me, a poor woman that lived in the house where Munden lives, could inform me where they were gone to pawn. About six o'clock on the Monday morning, the constable, one of my servants, and I, went to Munden's house in Crow-alley, Whitecross-street; we took him and his wife to Bridewell; he sent for his sister,

I saw a tea-chest and other things, that I believe to be mine, there: we took the prisoner up to Hicks's-Hall; they were committed for farther examination, the man to Bridewell, the others to New Prison.

               <p>Mr. Goldwyre. I am house-surgeon in the Middlesex hospital: I believe the deceased came to the hospital the 20th of August, on a Tuesday; I did not see him that day; I first saw his wounds on the Wednesday; the wounds were so trifling, he was not thought an object to be taken into the house; he had a large cut on his head, which I imagined might be by a fall against the stones; he complained of nothing else then: he concealed the true cause of his wound; he said he had a fall from a scaffold three story high: I never saw but one wound, and did not observe that to be dangerous in the least; he was taken in after he came to be dress'd two or three times. At first the wound went on very well; but after three or four days, it had not so good an appearance; then we thought proper to take him into the hospital. After he was in, the wound mended again, and he grew better, and walked about in the ward with other patients, and was in a very good way: there was a change about four or five days before his death; he had contracted a fever in the house, which is a very common case, which may be by the foulness of the air in the house: his wound at that time had not a bad appearance: he died in the hospital, but I have no reason to believe his death was occasioned by the wound. Two or three days before his death, he complained of an uneasiness in his breast; there was discovered to be a broken rib; but that I do not believe to be the occasion of his death: we impute his death to the fever; we did not believe there was any material injury.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body opened afterwards?</p>
               <p>Goldwyre. No, it was not.</p>

Grief whispered to Adams as she had the candle in her hand, and knocked the candle out of her hand in the room; when the candle was out, they all ran out, Grief, Adams, Wall, and the gentleman; Grief pushed him hard, and said, What business have you with my wife?

             three shillings and six-pence for his snacks, out of the gentleman's money: I left it up stairs, and took one shilling out of it; and when Delaney came and made an alarm that the man was murdered, she asked me for the money again; then she was got to bed; I gave it her; then she went out to Bett Thompson's: said Bett Thompson, the creature that was along with you, was the first that spoke of it: she came to me and gave me a slap in the face, and I ran directly to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you spoke of it?</p>
               <p>E. Madden. I had told Thompson of it that minute; Wall blasted and swore at me?</p>
               <p>Q. from Delaney. Whether I was in company when the man was picked up, or after?</p>
               <p>E. Madden. He was in the alley a little before the gentleman came, and he was there a little while after the gentleman lay dead there.</p>
               <p>Q. from Delaney. How came you to ask me to go up and rob that man that lay in the court?</p>
               <p>E. Madden. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Delaney. I owned before the bench of Justices that I robbed the man after he was dead: How came you to jostle me up in the alley to the man?</p>
               <p>E. Madden. I did not jostle you up.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Did I ever keep you company?</p>
               <p>E. Madden. No; you used to come up in the alley for snacks, when any robbery was done.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Was I in the house when this man was robb'd, or before, or after?</p>
               <p>Madden. You came in after the gentleman was robbed, and went and put out the candle; this was after the gentleman was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Who went out of the house first?</p>
               <p>Madden. All three were out in the court in a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Was it a man or a woman that went out first?</p>
               <p>Madden. To the best of my knowledge a woman went out first; they all went out as quick as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Did you speak to me? and what were the words?</p>
               <p>Madden. I said at Mrs. Cook's, there was a gentleman in the room with

               <p>Q. from Grief. How was I drest?</p>
               <p>Madden. Grief had a light coloured coat on; a body coat.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Had you and I been together that night?</p>
               <p>Madden. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. What is the reason you did not speak to me when the gentleman spoke to me about the money? (that is, the gentleman she has been speaking of.)</p>
               <p>Madden. You heard the gentleman insist upon having his two guineas; then you put out the candle, and all four ran out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. What is the reason you did not speak to me?</p>
               <p>Madden. What could I say to you? you knew the gentleman was robbed well enough before you came into the house, and after too.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. How did we come to part that night?</p>
               <p>Madden. I do not know; you all three ran together; I saw no more of you till next morning, when they brought me from the watch-house to see you, to ask if you was one of the men; I said you was.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. After we went out of the Alley, did you see the man alive or dead?</p>

               <p>Q. from Grief. Did you see me rob the man?</p>
               <p>Madden. No, I did not: you only shov'd him, and asked him what business he had with your wife: if I had spoke, I should have stood as good a chance to be killed as he.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Did you know me, when I came and resign'd myself?</p>
               <p>Madden. Yes, I did; I was but going on three weeks in the place; he used to be there almost every day in the week.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Was you drunk or sober that night?</p>
               <p>Madden. I was sober enough; I had nothing to make me drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. What sort of wig or stockings had I on?</p>
               <p>Madden. I did not take notice of his cloaths; I knew his person very well.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. When I went out of the alley, whether you saw my face or my back?</p>
               <p>Madden. I saw your face and back too in the alley; to be sure I saw his back when he turned to go out of the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. What words past between us when we went out?</p>
               <p>Madden. You asked what business the man had with your wife?</p>

            . I am an officer of excise: I was going on my duty through Wellclose Square, on the 8th of August; it had just gone twelve o'clock on a Thursday morning; I heard a confused noise; I thought there was a drunken company. I considered what to do; I cross'd the way, and stood under a little shelter in ship-alley, that goes into Ratcliffe-highway.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this place from the place where the man lay dead?</p>
               <p>Davell. That may be about 100 or 200 yards distant. I saw three men pass me; they were walking pretty softly: the first of them I did not know; he was in a whitish coat, a well made little man, pretty smart *. I cannot know him again; I had but a transient view of him: the next man was the deceased Mr. Smith: I had a good view of him; he was a lusty gentleman, in a brown coat, and a black waistcoat and breeches: then I did not know whether his coat was black or brown. I cannot pretend to say I knew his face so well as the make of him, and his dress; I am perfectly certain it was the deceased. As he stepped up the step to go to the square, the last person said, Sir, We will take care of you; and took him by the sides of his hips, as I thought; to prevent his slipping; Mr. Smith spoke very thick, and said, I can do; I don't want you: and put his hands out; I thought he rejected their assistance: he appeared to be pretty much in liquor.</p>
               <p>* A proper description of Grief's person, as to size.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light?</p>
               <p>Davell. I had a lanthorn with me; I concealed myself, as well as I could, behind a wall: there I opened my lanthorn, and had a better view of Mr. Smith and the last man for some time than I had of the first; when I went to the watch house about eight that morning, I knew the last man again; the cage was pretty full; I did not hesitate a moment, the people made a lane for me; I said I knew that man, and pointed to Delany, and said, that man I was clear in; I watched them till they were out of my sight; so far as I saw them, one went before, and the other behind Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Can you say you saw me there?</p>
               <p>Davell. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Mr. Smith lodged?</p>
               <p>Davell. He did lodge in Whitechapel, at a china-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the proper way to go to his lodging?</p>

               <p>S. Cook. It was after ten o'clock; and I saw him again in the bottom part of the house; the last time I saw him it was after eleven. When I was at the watch-house the next morning. Delaney said, You silly woman, what business had you about this affair, and d - d me. I began to speak in the watch-house for them not to put me in there, fearing I should see an apparition. On my dropping that expression of seeing the man come out of Adams's house, they took me in custody.

I went to bed, and after I had been in bed a little while, I cannot say to a minute, I heard a noise of running towards the alley end, and a man calling out murder! and watch! some time after, Elizabeth Wall came to the place where I lie, right opposite to where the gentleman lay dead; I heard her, I am certain it was her; I should know her tongue among ever so many women; I have been well acquainted with her; I used the Three Tuns, a house where she used: I heard her say,</p>
               <p>"Ye barbarous, wicked creatures; is it not enough we have robbed the man, why should you be so wicked as to murder him?" A little time after she returned back again: I heard her say,</p>
               <p>"Delaney, do you say I robbed the man by myself." I heard no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. from Grief. Did you meet me in Lemon-street before the murder was done, or after?</p>
               <p>Levi. It was before that was done.</p>

            . I live in Fenchurch street. I heard of this murder on Friday the 9th of August: hearing two men and two women were taken up, and brought to the Angel and Crown, Whitechapel, to be examined, my curiosity led me to go to see them. I was there better than a quarter of an hour before they were brought; then came the two men in one coach, and the two women in another: they were carried into a parlour at the Coach and Horses, at the corner of Gulston street. Delaney was taken out by two or three men, and carried in at the Angel and Crown; he staid there some time, and coming back again, came in at the back door at the Coach and Horses. I heard him say to a man who was by his side, I killed the man with the others, or the rest; one of them two words he said; I believe there might be three or four men by his side. He said, I know I shall be hanged: I went into the back parlour where the two women and Grief were: Grief asked the women, Was I in the room when the robbery was committed? the women both of them said no.</p>

            . I keep the Baptist-head, in St. John's-lane, Clerkenwell. I remember Delaney being at my house, at his returning from his examination, in the custody of the keeper: there were several people and children gathered about the door; I went on the outside, in order to drive them away; the window being open, Delaney stood at the dresser, and as I stood on the outside, looking in at the window, he clapp'd his hands together, and said, Lord, I wish it was over with me; for it is the first time that I ever imbrued my hands in human blood: his face was toward me, and he spoke in a low tone of voice. I said to him, it is a thousand pities, that you had ever any hand in it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the keeper at that time?</p>

Goadby said, the only way was to take up all in the place. and said, let us all go to the watch-house. Madden told me if I could get her carried by herself, she would tell the whole truth: what she told the officer, I cannot tell; I went to the watch-house; the constable was gone home, and the watchman asleep. At last the constable came, and they agreed to surrender, Delaney, the blind woman, and the other two women.</p>

Gould and I were on the patrole between Buckingham-gate and Ranelagh; we pass'd a gentleman from the Engine to Buckingham-gate; he gave us half a guinea instead of a six-pence: Gould kept it till the next day, then he discovered it to me; he changed it, and gave me half; then we had a pot of beer; after that we had another pot at the George: we came from thence to Mr. Shelmerdine's, and there we had two pints of twopenny; then I believe it was four o'clock, or after; then we went in at the Thistle and Crown, there was Stevens; when we came out there, I was for going home; the two prisoners said, if I would go with them. I should see something: I was not for going; this was about a quarter before ten: I had a stick, they took my stick, I followed them, and as I was easing myself about twenty or thirty yards from them, I heard a pistol go off; I put up my breeches as fast as I could: when I came up to them, there was the deceased gasping for life, crying, Ha, Ha, Ha! he was close by them; he ran about fifteen yards towards Shelmerdine's, and dropt down; Stevens ran away: Gould pull'd me me along, I said, somebody is kill'd or robb'd; they said, what was that to me; this was just before the man dropt: the prisoners were taken up five weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them a pistol?</p>
               <p>Chambers. I never saw either of them have a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were they not apprehended sooner?</p>
               <p>Chambers. I was afraid of my life, fearing they would kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in sight when the pistol went off?</p>
               <p>Chambers. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Gould and you go after this?</p>
               <p>Chambers. We went down by the church, and had a quart or three pints of beer at the Black Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a reward of five pounds publish'd for any body that would discover this affair?</p>
               <p>Chambers. Yes, there was: I made this discovery a great while after the reward was publish'd.</p>

            . Chambers said, he and Gould were drinking at Mr. Shelmerdine's the day before this thing happen'd, and Gould denied his being there: Chambers, to confirm what he had said, gave an account there was a bricklayer at work there: all I have to say, I am a bricklayer, and was paving the hearth that day.</p>

            . I am a surgeon; I open'd the deceased body; I found the ball had penetrated his breast, and into his lungs; I took it out, it was a pistol ball; that undoubtedly was the occasion of his death: there is no place in the world better situated for robberies, or easier to get off, than the place where the deceased was found; there frequently are a great number of prostitutes and bad people about there on nights: there are roads go several different ways: Stevens was at that time in the Infirmary with a broken arm (I am assistant surgeon to Chelsea hospital): he was well enough to go out, but not to use his arm; he always behaved very decent and sober; he never was out but one night late in the time, and then he came in about ten o'clock.</p>

            . On the 19th of July I saw a man (I don't know that the prisoner is the person) riding a white gelding or mare full speed in Whitechapel road: when he was near the David and Harp, below the church, he rode over an old woman; the feet of the horse struck the left side of her head: I took her up; she died the next day.</p>

               <p>Walter Herbert. I was crossing the road at the same time as the old woman was crossing the road: the prisoner and another young man were riding down the road as fast as they possibly could: I imagined they were trying which could go fastest, one on one side of the road, the other on the other. After he had rode over the old woman, he pulled his horse round, to see what was the matter; the people cried, Stop the horse, beat him of his horse; then he rode away.</p>

She was brought in insensible, on the Friday, about seven at night, and I think she died on the Sunday. After she was dead, I observed her back was very much bruised by the extravasated blood: if her death was occasioned by that bruise, there must be something internal that must be the cause of it: there was no mortification, there had not been time for that.</p>

            . On the 17th of July last, between the hours of ten and twelve at night, I lost two silver pint mugs; we missed them just before we went to bed; they were taken from off a table, just behind the door, in the fore-room: there was nobody at that table (it is not a drinking table). I was backwards and forwards in the house. I can't tell whether the prisoner was in the house that evening: I never found my mugs again.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner in my master's house, the night the mugs were stolen; he came in about eleven o'clock: I took particular notice of him; he call'd for a pint of beer, and sat down on a bench in the passage, and staid about five minutes: when I brought the beer, he was fitting on the threshold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180047"/> of the door; then he bid me serve him with a pennyworth of gin; he came to the bar, and gave me 6 d. to change: I asked him if I should take for the pint of beer? He said no, he would not have it.

When I went to get change of my mistress in the fore-room, where the mugs were, the prisoner followed me in: I did not then look at the mugs, they had been just set behind the door that he and I came in at. I saw the prisoner the next morning about 11 o'clock before the justice: he asked me who had been in the house I said, I saw no other person in the house, but a man dressed in a red jacket, and a linen waistcoat under it, and his hair hanging about his ears: I had told my master that the boy which is evidence had a long brown coat on; I knew the prisoner directly before the justice; I am sure he is the man; I know him by his face, as well as by his cloaths.</p>

             M'Kenzie and I went all round Wapping one night; we came up Nightingale-lane; He said he would go and steal some silver mugs there; (we had use to go by there every night; he had seen the mugs before) he first went into the passage to the bar, and asked this last evidence for a pint of beer. I stood on the out-side of the door: the girl went to draw it; in the mean time he stole one of the silver mugs from a table behind the door in the fore-room: I saw him do it: he came out and gave it to me; we ran all the way up Nightingale-lane, and hid it under a dung-hill in Black-horse-yard: then we came again to the house, which is about an hundred yards from the dunghill; we call'd then for a pennyworth of gin each; he went in first; we had the gin, and he gave the girl sixpence to change: while she went into the other room to change the six-pence, M'Kenzie stole the other mug; he could reach it behind the door: we then went to his lodgings, after we had been and took the other out of the dunghill. The next morning we went to look for somebody to sell them to, in Duke's-place: we met one Israel Cowen (who is now in Bridwell); we asked him if he would buy some plate? he said, he would see for somebody that would, and he went and fetched Mores Abrahams. M'Kenzie and Abrahams went into a place to bargain; he asked five guineas, and Abrahams offered him two: he said, before he would take two, he would throw them into the Thames. I stood a little way off; Abrahams said, if he would fetch them, if they were worth more, he would give more. I went and fetched them, and in the mean time. Mr. Murry, a thief-taker, came and took M'Kenzie, and said he was the man he wanted: I had the mugs, and seeing him take M 'Kenzie, I turned back, and ran away (this was in Heydon-yard); we were going into the fields to let Abrahams look at the mugs: Israel Cowen met me in the Mulberry-garden, in about an hour after, and told me where M'Kenzie was: then I went along with Cowen into the fields, and let Abrahams have the mugs for two guineas, and I went and spent the money. I was taken about a week after; I was going on board a ship, and there were three boys that knew me: they told Mr. Murry, and I was taken out of the ship.</p>

               <p>This boy, Rvan, met me in Duke's place, and asked me if I knew any body that would buy old silver spoons? I told him, I did not know any body: there happened to come Israel Cowen by; he asked him; he said he would go and see for a man, and he went and fetched a man: they went a little way from me, and talked together, and sent the boy away, and he brought two mugs; I had not an opportunity to look at them; they agreed to go into the fields, and this Murry came and took hold of me. When we came to the prosecutor's, Murry almost obliged the girl to say I was the man. I never was at that house, till Murry brought me there.</p>

            . I am a receiver, or agent, and have an office in Crutched-friars. The prisoner at the bar came to me some time in June, and told me she had a probate of a will, which lay in the hands of Mr. Faulkner, proctor, in Doctor's commons; but she had not money sufficient to pay, and therefore could not get it out: She desired me to pay the money for her. I asked her some questions as usual, but particularly asked her for a parish certificate of the minister and churchwardens, setting forth she was the person she pretended to be; she not bringing that, I declined acting in it. Some time after, she came with this probate in her hand; (holding one in his hand). In consequence of which, I made search, and found there were wages due; but I would advance no money till she could get a certificate. She pleaded poverty, and I let her have a crown, or some such matter, till she could get the certificate: She came on the 26th of July, and brought a certificate; I was then ill in bed: She came again on the 27th; I was then below stairs: the certificate appeared very fair, and I gave credit to her; but as the money could not be immediately got, she begged I would let her have a little. There were several people that came with her, they were very clamorous: some said, they would wait no longer for their money; one said she was indebted to them so much, and another so much. I said, when she has it, undoubtedly she will pay you, or endeavour to settle in some manner among you: that did not satisfy them; they were very clamorous. Then she addressed me to let her have some, to give each of these people something, or she should be arrested: in consequence of which, I let her have three guineas and a half. I went up stairs to my bureau, and she with me; I wrote the body of this note. and called up my lad, he saw her make her mark. Before ever I wrote her name, as is usual, I said, what is your name? notwithstanding her having applied to me before: she told me her name was

               <p>Q. Did you ask her if she could write? Hooper. I think I did; it is usual to ask a person, Can you write? I then paid her the remainder of the money, to make the first three guineas and a half; but the money I paid her before, I can not exactly say. I think it was on the 20th or 21st of August,

            . The prisoner came to me one day, and said, We both want money and watches, and said he could put me in a way to get money: he ask'd me if I had any ordinary rum; he could sell it for 2 s. a bottle; he brought a bladder on the Sunday morning; I could not come at any; so I put about a quart of porter in it, and he took it away. On the Sunday following he came again; I got him two bottles of wine; he put them in a bag that he had, and carried them away. On the Monday he gave me two bladders in a bag; I put about a gallon of rum in one, and a quart of brandy in the other. He came on the Sunday morning following down into the cellar, and took them away in a bag. On the Sunday after, he said his mother was very ill, and wanted a little rum: after that he said she was no better, and she liked Old Hock or Madeira. On the Wednesday night he came, and I gave him some Madeira through the door.</p>

I have only indicted him for the last parcel: he had had eight different parcels; the last was on the 15th of August; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180057"/> said he came from his mistress; I told him his mistress should always send a written order for the future: he said, if I did not chuse to deliver them, I might send them by my servant. I having no suspicion, sent by him what he ask'd for, half a pound of green tea, half a pound of congo tea, 14 pounds of loaf sugar, 13 pounds and odd ounces of other loaf sugar. This was on the Thursday. On the Monday following a tall man came and told me I was very much cheated by a man who came for goods in the name of Mrs. Cheap several times: he said the prisoner sold the goods to one Mrs. Jones in St. Martin's Lane; and if I would go there, I might find some of them. I sent my man to know if the prisoner lived with Mr. Cheap or not: I found he had been gone away some time: I went to Justice Fielding. and got a warrant: the Justice bid me go to my Lord Mayor for a warrant, and he would back it. When I went and search'd at Mrs. Jone's, we found two of the loaves of sugar at a public-house next door to her. Coming home, there was the prisoner in my shop with a written order for a large quantity of goods: I took him in custody: he confess'd that he had sold them all, except three loaves of sugar, to Mrs. Jones, and was going to carry these there; that he had sold loaf sugar for 6 d. a pound, and tea for 5 s. and that Mrs. Jones agreed to give him that money, come when he would.</p>
