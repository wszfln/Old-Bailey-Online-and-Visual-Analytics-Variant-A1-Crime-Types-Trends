            . I am servant to Mr. Fryer. On the second of this instant, in the afternoon, about dusk, I was in the shop; I heard the glass crack; I looked, and saw the two boys at the bar at the window in the street; I observed Hewit's hand in at the broken glass, almost up to his elbow, and saw him draw this piece of printed linen (produced in court) to the hole; I went out, and brought the two boys into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of the linen drawn through the hole?</p>
               <p>Watkins. I believe there was some of it through, but my master's brother took it away from the place; he is not here.</p>

Last Wednesday I went to London, about seven in the morning, and left my maid at home alone; I had a person came, and told me my house was broke open; I then came home directly; I found three chests and a chest of drawers broke open; I missed three gold rings, a girdle, a handkerchief, a new pair of shoes, a pair of worsted stockings and a shirt; I lost some money, but cannot swear to the quantity. The prisoner came begging in the hard weather, and I employed him, and he lay in the barn; I was going to clothe him, intending to make a good boy of him; here are the evidences that took him, can give an account of what things they found upon him.</p>

On Wednesday last, I and my friend went in at the Black Lion at West-end, there we heard people talking of this robbery; the man of the house described the boy to us, which Mr. Grove had a suspicion of; they said the boy went up a bye lane; we went up to a barn in the lane to search, and in searching about, trod upon the boy's feet, he was covered in the hay; we found his cloaths answered to the description; we charged him with this robbery; he confessed he had done it, and said he was very sorry, and delivered these things to us in the barn, (producing three gold rings, a silk handkerchief, a crape hat-band, and silk girdle; deposed to by the prosecutor, as part of the goods he lost at that time;) we asked how he got in; he said, the maid was gone up into the town, and there were some tiles broke, and he took off a few more, and got in, and took the things; we took him before the justice, and he was committed.</p>

            . On Monday the 20th of January, I had a piece of cloth offered to me to dispose of by the prisoner; I am a salesman and draper; I apprehended it to be dishonestly come by; I sent for a constable, and charged the prisoner; during the discourse before Mr. Welch, the prisoner prevaricated; I believe the Justice might say, he had better tell the truth; his prevaricating confirmed the Justice and me too, he did not come honestly by the goods: I believe the Justice thought, by means of this man he might come at farther light; perhaps he thought there might be other people concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. What arguments did he make use of; did he say it would be better for him?</p>
               <p>Vigers. I will not take upon me to say that; but he advised him to discover. I do not remember that the Justice said it would be better for him to confess.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to you when he brought the piece of cloth?</p>
               <p>Vigers. He said it was his own. and that he was the manufacturer of it; I suspected him, by his asking a price considerably under the value; he allowed it for 8 s. a yard; it was worth more; if it was taken on my judgement, I would have given three or four shillings a yard more; he discovered to me he had no knowledge of the business, so as to manufacture the cloth, by the discourse I had with him; this also increased my suspicion; when before the Justice, he did acknowledge he went in to Mrs. Vanderplank's house on the Saturday evening, and took out his cloth.</p>
               <p>Vanderplank. I think he said he waited an opportunity, and went in at the gate on a Sunday evening, and took it out; (the cloth produced and deposed to.)</p>

I agreed to give him two guineas for the golding, and gave him a shilling earned, and desired him to take the horse home; he did when I came there, I desired him to go to Tyburn-road. where he had told me the serjeant lived. that I might pay the serjeant, and have a proper receipt; he would not go along with me; then I said I should stop the horse; I had him cried in Smithfield market, and advertised him; by which means the prosecutor found me, and he owned the horse, and took him away.</p>

I took the evidence Carney in Cheapside; I saw him and another pick a gentleman's pocket there; the next day I asked him, if there was any more of the gang, as we were going to Guildhall; he told me he was concerned with the prisoner, in stealing a frail of raisins from off the key; then we went and took the prisoner as he had directed us, at his lodgings on Salt-petrebank; he told us, he was either there, or gaming on Tower-hill; Carney also described a bag that he said the prisoner had with him, to put the raisins in; we went afterwards, and found the bag marked as he described, with a little hole or two in it.</p>

            . I shall be 14 years of age the 17th of next March; I have known the prisoner about two months; I got acquainted with him at Salt-petre-bank, at a lodging-house where he and I lay. I have a mother alive; she lives in Buckle-street. I worked in Petticoat-lane; when I left my place, I did not go to my mother, but got into bad company with a parcel of boys, and went a thieving. The prisoner asked us to go out at night; that night we went out about twelve; it was one o'clock when we got the raisins; this was about a fortnight ago, on a Tuesday night; we found the watchman asleep on the keys under a ladder; the prisoner went, and looked and saw him, and the other boy went, and took a basket of raisins from a parcel under a shed; he carried it up to the archway, and then put it in the bag, and put it on his head, and carried it along; we went the city way, and round Leadenhall-street, because we would not meet the watchmen; we took them to the house where he lodged; in the morning he got up, and took some in his apron, and asked a person to buy them, who said, he would not give above three farthings a pound for them; then we went into Petticoat-lane; there he bid me go into an alehouse; he came to us, and said, he got five farthings a pound for them, and that they came to 3 s. 3 d. and he gave me 13 d.</p>

I wanted to speak to them; they said, they knew what I wanted, and went both on their knees, and begged for mercy for the sake of their children, crying, Mercy, mercy, mercy, which raised the whole neighbourhood; when they got up, the two cloaks lay as it were behind them.</p>

I asked the prisoner how he could be guilty of such a thing; he said, Sir, I acknowledge the fact; I cut them in pieces with intent to take them away to sell for old brass; he said, I might hang him if I chose it, and behaved in a very impertinent manner; he did not mind being transported, saying, he had been cross the water before.</p>

I took him and them to my master; my master said they were new work, and asked him if it was the first time he had done so; he said no, nor the second, nor the third; my master said, you will come to the gallows; he answered, he did not mind that, if he was not choaked; my master then said, you will surely go over the water, Harry; he said, I have been over the water before, I do not mind that.</p>

             came early to brew; he knocked at the door; I looked out of my one story window; he told me one of my shutters was down, and the sash up; I went down and found it so; I took a rush-light that was burning, and my wife and I came down, and went into the bar, and saw several things lying on the floor; I found the till was gone, with about 3 s. in farthings and two pocket-books in it, a diaper table-cloth, a pair of girl's new pumps, a pillow-case, a cannister of tea, a tin case of lump sugar, a silver table-spoon, a silver punch-ladle with a whalebone handle, were all missing; I observed the groove of the window-shutter had been cut.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you left your house when you went to-bed?</p>
               <p>Sideaway. I came home about twelve o'clock that night, and found my wife and maid up alone; the window-shutter was then up.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they fasten?</p>
               <p>Sideaway. They slide in and out; we went to bed within about five minutes after I came home, and my maid went to bed very soon after; she goes by my chamber-door to her bed; I suspected the evidence Norbury, and two other boys that accompanied together; he lives in the neighbourhood; I laid hold of one of them, (not either of the prisoners) and locked him up in the stable; he had not been there long, before he broke a pane of glass, and got away; that made me suspect him more than before; then I got Norbury, and put him in my back parlour, and kept him there some time; I sent for his mother, and he agreed to let me know at seven o'clock at night, where to come at the other two, who, he said, were to meet him at the Tabernacle-gate; on that condition I let him go, he was to bring them to me; but the next morning one Mr. Caster, that lives about 50 yards from m secured the prisoners, and brought them all three to me; Norbury owned he was concerned in robbing me, and that he took as many things out as were worth 10 l. but did not sell some of the things for above a penny piece: I took them before the Justice, and he was committed to Bridewell, the others were set at liberty; Norbury was brought up again the next day: then he gave a description of the three prisoners at the bar, we went and apprehended them, and the Justice thought proper to admit Norbury an evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. How near to Mr. Sideaway do you live?</p>
               <p>Norbury. I live next door to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not go and tell him what you had seen the next morning?</p>
               <p>Norbury. I was afraid I should be brought into some scrape. On the Monday morning, Mr. Sideaway's man went into the garden, and shut too the window; I looked out, and saw the shutter was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see you that Saturday night?</p>
               <p>Norbury. I went into the alley, fearing they should see me, and make me go along with them; and they were looking one way to see if the watchman came, and I came the other way?</p>
               <p>Q. Could you hear them plain, when they said they would come again the next night?</p>
               <p>Norbury. They talked pretty loud, I could hear them plain.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to them?</p>
               <p>Norbury. He described it, by pointing to a place about six or seven yards distance.</p>
               <p>Warren's defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the affair; I have witness to prove where I was at the time.</p>

               <p>Morris. She was a widow, they were married on the 26th of August last, and the marriage was entered according to act of a parliment, I put my name down as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live?</p>
               <p>Morris. She lived near the church, in Church-court, opposite the sign of the Crown. I think I have heard her say she lived there 12 years. After the wedding we went to Chelsea, and came back and dined at my house; then he, my wife and his wife, went to Sadler's-wells together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I married my first wife in the neighbourhood of St. John's-street where Mr. Morris lives, and I have not lived with her 3 years; I was credibly informed she was dead, or I had never carried my wife into that neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. to Morris. Did the prisoner live in St. John's-street as a housekeeper?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pass for a married man or a batchelor?</p>
               <p>Morris. He past for a batchelor; I remember he did once tell me he had had a wife, but she was dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Morris has seen my first wife several times in that neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Morris. If I have seen her, I did not know that she was his wife.</p>

She may be raised from the dead for what I know. I was a little in liquor; I can prove I had letters when I was at Hull in Yorkshire that she was dead, and I came to London directly, but did not give myself a great deal of trouble about her; after that I heard she died in Ireland.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner</p>
               <p>John. I knew the prisoner in staff, and westminster I saw him at Oxford races.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you there?</p>
               <p>Casper. I deal in the country with goods; he was telling me his wife was dead; I never know he was married again till I came to London this last time, but I heard several people that travel with goods say he was married again.</p>

             am a dyer, and live in g. alley; German and Webber worked with me, the latter on and off twelve years; on the 31st of January, a little after eight in the morning Graham inquiring me with the other; I went and got a search warrant after I had fetched men to watch the nothing should be carried out, then I went and searched Webber lodgings and Graham's apartment, I found nineteen remnants of callimanco, but did not find the piece we went to look for them: I went up into the two pair of stairs from are garret, which both belonged to one his wife and he were both at work in the garret; I found things to red clean and tight; by their decent behaviour I did not suspect them, neither did I at all inspect about their bed; I returned without finding the piece, this was betwixt nine and ten o'clock, after that, Mr. Bell came and told me he had found the piece; before it was found Webber denied it; but after that he owned he had taken that piece of black callimanco that morning, and before Justice Fielding he acknowledged the same.</p>
               <p>Q. from Webber. I worked for you thirteen years, did I ever wrong you?</p>
               <p>Brett. I have had some suspicion of him before this, but nothing certain.</p>

            . On the 31st of January, in the morning, master Brett, whom I worked for many years, called me into the parlour, and said he had found a thief, which was Webber; he said, do you go to the Justice and get a search warrant, to search Webber's apartment. I went to the Justice; the Justice and my master must come himself, he went, and came with a warrant; I went with my master to search, but we could not find the callimanco; after that Mr. Bell came, and informed us of the piece; when the prisoner and piece was before the Justice, I heard him own he took it, and hoped he should receive mercy; (piece produced.)</p>

On the 31st of January my husband and I had just done breakfast, about nine o'clock; my husband was just got into his room; (he is a handkerchief-weaver) we heard a rustling; he ordered me to go and see who was there; I did not go; we soon heard it again; I called, who was there; no body answered; I went down, and saw Mrs. Graham at my chamber-down; I asked what she wanted; she made no answer, but made a motion with her hand for me to follow her down stairs; when I came about three or four stairs down, she asked me if I had seen

               <p>Q. Where had you put the key when you went up into the garret that morning?</p>
               <p>J. Bell.

            . I lodge in Graham's house. On the 31st of January I was in the garret at work; about nine o'clock I heard a rustling; I said to my wife, give a step down, there is somebody in the entry; she said, there is nothing at all; I said, yes, go and see; she went to the head of the stairs, and then, as she told me, she saw Mrs. Graham; I did not see her. About half an hour after, Mr. Brett, a journeyman, and the constable came to search: I never moved out of the garret: my wife desired them to come and search the garret; they came and searched, and were very well contented; then they went down to our other room, but found nothing. About one o'clock I had done dinner, and went to my labour again; my wife went down to make use of the pot, and she called me down, and said, here is something hangs black out of the bed; then I ran down; I laid hold of it, and drawed out a whole piece of black stuff. I went and said to Mrs. Graham, come and fetch that out of my room which you put in, for no body could put it in but you or Webber; she did not come up then: my wife went down and called her up a second time, then she came up; I said, you naughty woman, how could you put that piece into my room, take it out again; she made a great many vows, and said she did not put it there; I said, I'll go and tell the owner of it; she laid hold of my sleeve with one hand and my shirt with the other, and said, if you do go, Webber will be hanged; I went immediately to Mr. Brett, and told him of it; he and his foreman and the officer, came and took Mrs Graham and the piece away together.</p>

               <p>Brown. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the two persons that drank with you?</p>
               <p>Brown. I do not know that; I know there was a soldier in the house that drawed the beer, and the other two were soldiers; (the prisoner is a soldier.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss your things as soon as you awaked?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, I did not remember about the things, but went home.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was in liquor, are you sure you carried these things into that house?</p>
               <p>Brown. I am well assured of that; the next day I went to that house again, and asked whether I had left any thing there; they said, no.</p>

I keep the Dr. Ward's Head, a public-house; last Thursday se'nnight, in the evening, the prisoner and two other soldiers came in, and called for three pennyworth of rum and water; my niece served them, and they paid for it; after that they were quarrelling; I desired them to go out; one of their heads appeared bloody; they said he had fell down and cut his head; they called for a bason of water to clean him; I saw a piece of linen cloth on the floor; I heard one say to the other, why did you take the stockings; the other swore he had got them in his pocket; then they said one to another, let us get away as quick as we can; we suspected all was not right; my-husband went for a constable, but could not get one; they left my house, and went in at the Mitre and Dove; I went there it about half an hour after; there they offered the stockings to sale; they were taken up upon that, and sent to the watch-house.</p>

            . Last Wednesday was fortnight, about half an hour after six in the evening, I was coming along the back lane to go home; I had a shoulder of mutton, a piece of Cheshire cheese, six pounds of butter, and some red herrings in my lap: the prisoner came out upon me, I think from same bank just under the fourth lamp in the lane; he said, Madam, your money; I said, I have no money, upon my word; he said, you have; I said I had mutton, butter, and cheese, if he would name them he was welcome, and go about his business; he said he wanted some money: I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out a penny, and looked at it, and gave it into his hand; I believe a halfpenny slipped through his fingers, and fell upon the ground; I had but 5 s. in all about me; he was very much in liquor; he held me by my pocket-hole, while he stooped to take the halfpenny up; he said, Madam, this is not all, you have more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in fear?</p>
               <p>E. Woodroof. I was very much affrighted, but he did not offer to use me ill or strike me; there was another woman with me, she went to go away; he said, Madam, you must not go, I want your's too; she put her hand in her pocket, and throwed down, she said, about seven farthing; and while he went to pick that up she went away; there came a little boy past me, and he called a man; I believe there was a very tough struggle between the prisoner and that man in the road, for about three minutes; I had not seen the boy, till the boy said he saw the prisoner stop me.</p>

I called, stop thief; he turned again, and offered to fight me; my wife said, strike him with the patten, you do not know what weapon he may have about him, I struck him with my wife's patten; he ran away again; I followed, and struck him with the patten again; then I took hold of his collar, and assistance came up, and he was secured.</p>

After that, my wife put her hand over my shoulder, (for I was turned about to him) and he snatched her purse out of her hand, which I did not perceive till after he was gone; he rode off immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the colour of the horse the man rode?</p>
               <p>Thring. I take the horse to be either a black or a brown; the hair was very thin upon his tail, and he was low in flesh.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you think I was the man that robbed your mistress?</p>
               <p>Thring. I cannot say; all that I know is, that he was a black.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker by trade, but make very few new shoes now, I am what you may call a translator, or cobler; the prisoner came to me some time before last Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I knew him three or four years, but had not seen him for twelve months before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way was he when you knew him?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He was at a tallow-chandler's; when he came, we went and had a pot of beer together; he asked; me I was acquainted with any shoemakers in the, I said, yes, he had got a quantity of upper-leathers, and it I him to some customers, he would give me half a crown a day, and pay my Accordingly I went with him to several masters that for; after this. Mr. Newman came to me, and asked me if I knew such a gentlemen at Woodford as Mr. Mead, and if I had ever sold any leather to him; I said, yes, twice; he asked me how much I sold him; I knew the first quantity, but not the last; he said he had been rob bed, and desired I would go with him, and shew him which of his men it was; I went with him, he brought some porters, and put them in a row, and I pitched upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you who he had the leather from?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, he did not; I was with him before the Justice, there he confessed he took the leather for a support to his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay you the half crown a day?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, he did, all but one day; then he gave me only 2 s. because the goods were not all sold that he brought out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am sorry I have abused such good masters as they have been to me, in so bad a manner; they were very kind to me. I was tempted to commit this wicked act, to support my wife and four young children, at the time of her lying in, she had a very bad time, and my wages but 11 s. a week, would not buy sufficient necessaries to support six of us these dear times; I hope there is nothing but the greatest distress could have tempted me to use the best friends I had, in the manner I have done; and as it is my first offence, for the sake of my poor wife and dear helpless children, I humbly beg the mercy of the court; and if I should be so happy as to get my liberty again, I will always endeavour to provide for my poor family in an honest way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Newman. Do you think the prisoner has made a common practice of taking things?</p>
               <p>Newman. It is impossible for me to know that, in an open shop as ours is.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>

I went with him to Red-bull-yard, St. John's-street, there were two girls that they kept; one of them is called Martin's wife; I saw the cardinal, and proved it to be Mr. James's property: while we were talking about it, we heard somebody coming up stairs; Mr. Clark said they are coming, put the door too; they came up, the prisoner was first apprehended; Martin ran down stairs, but was soon apprehended and brought up: they were taken before Justice Girdler, he admitted the girl an evidence.</p>

               <p>I was going down Milk street, two young fellows ran by me as hard as they could run; the gentleman laid hold of me and said, you have picked my pocket; I said you are vastly mistaken in the man, you are welcome to search me; I pulled off my things; this gentleman went out, and brings in a candle and the handkerchief; the gentleman said, can you swear you saw this man take the handkerchief; no, said he, I cannot.</p>

I laid down the board upon the work-board, by the side of the counter, and only brought two light rings to her, which she tried on; she desired I would weigh them, and tell her the price, they were much of a weight; she agreed to give me 8 s. for one of them; after that she said, Madam, I should be obliged to you to let me look at that ring that hangs on the corner hook, that was a heavier ring; she tried it, and said it was too heavy, I think the other will do very well: she reached cross the counter, and put a ring on the hook that came from; she said she would go over the way to the alehouse, and give me the money for the ring she agreed for: as she went out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176702180033"/> shop, I took the ring which she put on the hook, and found she had changed mine for a brass one; she was got two or three doors off; I ran after her, and got hold of her, and said, good woman, you have taken my ring away, and put a brass one in its place. I brought her back, and pushed her into the shop; by that time my sister came into the shop; the prisoner clapt her hand upon the counter; my sister can inform the court what she saw at the time; (the brass ring and gold one produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a brass ring on that or any of the hooks before she came in?</p>
               <p>E. Rooker. No, there was not; my husband came home, then she was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Rooker, spinster. I live with my brother that keeps this shop; I hearing my sister go out of the shop, came into the shop to see what was the matter; I heard a woman had been in to cheapen a gold ring, and had taken one away, and left a brass one: my sister brought the prisoner in; I saw the prisoner lay her hand down on the corner of the counter, and when she took it up again, I saw a gold ring lying, which proved to be the ring that was missing.</p>
               <p>E. Rooker. There was no ring on the counter when she went out of the shop; I had only taken two rings from the board, and they were on my finger; that brass ring was one more than our number.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I never touched the ring, I know nothing of it.</p>

            . I am turned of fourteen years of age, I saw the two prisoners standing by Mr. Dent; I saw Miller put his hand into his pocket and take but a handkerchief, and give it to Green. I live with Mr. Stevens a watchmaker, in Whitechapel; after that I saw Green drop the handkerchief, and gave a wrench out of Mr. Dent's hand, and run away down Houndsditch; after that I heard Green say he should be cleared, for he did not take it, Miller took it; after that Green was brought back, and carried to Mr. Lane's the poulterer's shop; there they both confessed: Green said Miller took the handkerchief but of the gentleman's pocket, and Miller owned he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise of forgiveness, on condition of their confessing?</p>
               <p>Robins. Mr. Lane or Mr. Dent said before my Lord-Mayor, that if they would make any discovery of their gang, they would pardon Green, but not for this offence; I heard nothing said to them before they took the handkerchief.</p>

I went up stairs with him to the next room to the lodge-room, upon the same floor; he asked me to give him two half guineas for a guinea; (it is a general rule to deposit half a guinea when a mason is made) I pulled out my purse, there might be 30 or 40 guineas in it; I put it on the table; the master of the lodge immediately called; the prisoner had given me his guinea; I in a hurry took up part of my money, but I left some upon the table; I can safely say there were five guineas left; I went that moment into the mason's room, I had not time to take it all up; (I had put it down in order to look out two half guineas for his guinea) I was not absent I believe a minute, nor two I am sure; and when I came back, the prisoner and money was gone; I went down stairs immediately; he was got into the bar, in order to take his great coat, as I apprehend since; (he went then by the name of Thompson) I said, Mr. Thompson, did you take any money off the table; he said, yes, I did take five guineas; I said, what did you take it off the table for; he said, I took it only to secure it, as you was gone; he bell rang again, and I ran up stairs; I don't suppose I was absent three minutes, and when I came down again, he was gone with his great coat; that night I took some friends with me and pursued him; I understood he used the night houses about Covent-garden; I dare say I spent more than 10 l in looking for him; I had been there every night; I had mentioned him to a gentleman that knew him, and I found he was a person of very bad character; last Saturday night a person came and said, run out, Walker, he is just gone by; I ran out, and found him in an earthen-ware shop, cheapening some things; when he came out of the shop, I laid hold of him, and said, Mr. Thompson, I want to speak with you; said he, I am in a violent hurry now; I said, I must speak with you; I am in a violent hurry, said he again; I said, I take you up as a thief, you stole my money in my house; said he, what, for them few guineas; go with me into Queen-street, Cheapside, and I'll give you security for your money; I said, no, you shall never be discharged till you come to the Old-Bailey; I took him into my house, and kept him there till I had time to send for an acquaintance to assist me with him to the Compter; when I took him out of the house to go to the Compter, he offered to give me a note of hand for the money; but going along, when he found I had got an officer to take him to the Compter, he swore he would make it a dear taking up, as ever I paid in my life; this was as we were near the pump in St. Paul's church-yard; he said, you villain, did you not give me that five guineas for b - g me; I got him in at the Nag's Head in Cheapside; he went down on his knees, and swore I had served him in that way, and had given him a bad disorder; and this he told the people when we got him into the Compter.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there nobody in the room but the prisoner when you went into the mason's room?</p>
               <p>Walker. No, there was not; there was nobody near him but the tyler, that was obliged to stand at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he took this money from the table in order to secure it for you?</p>
               <p>Walker. He could not pretend any thing of that, though he told me so below.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the money gone that you left upon the table?</p>
               <p>Walker. It was, there was not a single piece left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never talk of bringing a writ against him for the recovery of the money?</p>
               <p>Walker, No, not for this; I did for a debt that he owed me; I had lent him half a guinea, and hired a horse for him, and he had run some in liquor; the debt was about 53 s.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he come the first time you saw him?</p>
               <p>Walker. That night he came in a coach; Mr. Gill that lodges at my house brought about three in the morning; Mr. Gill requested he might have a bed at my house that night; I had all my beds full, as all the Chester traders come to my house; I had no bed empty; I said he might lie with me, as I should be up in about two hours time; so he lay with me; I got up in about two hours after; I think he said he had been knocked down in Covent-garden; in the morning, about eight, he had a bason of tea carried up, and about ten he desired a dish of coffee.</p>

Thornhill *; he said he had been making interest for him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176702180035"/> Lord Shelburne; he asked me if I was in any employ; I said, not at present, but I expected I should soon; he said it was a pity such a young fellow should be out of employ, and proposed he could do something for me; after that, one night he came home with me to Mr. Walker's, in a coach from Covent-garden; he wanted to borrow half a crown of me; he said he had been abused and struck by a person there; he pretended he could not get in at his lodging, so he came home with me; I went to Mr. Walker, and said, here is such a gentleman, I beg you will let him have a bed here; he said he could let him have no other than to lie with him, and he should be up in an hour or two, so he went to bed; the next morning when he came down stairs, he told Mr. Walker he was going to petition Lord Shelburn on my behalf, and said he would be proposed a mason; I went out, and came home at eleven o'clock, and Mr. Walker told me, that gentleman has stole five guineas from me that you recommended; then I went to Lord Shelburne's to enquire after him, but could hear of no such person there.</p>
               <p>* Capt. Thornhill, capitally convicted in December Sessions. See No. 42.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the Marshalsea court; I went to Mr. Walker's house to-morrow will be a week at night; there was the prisoner there; Mr. Walker said, I sent for you, for this is the fellow that robbed me of five guineas; then I said, charge him as a thief; said he, I do; he had the prisoner by the collar; the prisoner wanted sadly to get from him at the door; the prisoner said, don't lead me in this manner, charge me as a gentleman; Mr. Walker said, you know you took the five guineas; the prisoner said, I know that; just as we came to the pump in St. Paul's church-yard, said he, do you know, Mr. Walker, what you have done; yes, said Mr. Walker, I have done justice, as every man ought to do. Ah! said the prisoner, no, you have not; do you know what you gave me the five guineas for; said Mr. Walker, I gave you none at all: the prisoner clapped his hands together, and said, (turning to me) he gave me this five guineas for b - g me; and to make you more satisfied it was so, I will make it appear before surgeon Sharpe; said I, this is very hard to say this against a man of such credit; the mob rose about us; the prisoner desired to go in at the trunk-maker's; we went in till the mob dispersed; after that, who should come but Mr. Pain; said I to Mr. Pain, I think you have a right to take charge of this man; said he, I had rather not, but am willing to aid and assist, for I have heard what he has said all the way you came, for I kept close behind you; we went from there, then the prisoner begged to go into the Nag's Head; there be made use of such expressions as was a shame to mention; he said he would send for surgeon Sharpe, but he would not, nor did not; he acknowledged the taking the five guineas, and said he would give a note or satisfaction if we would go to the bottom of Queen-street, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to these words, that the prisoner said he took the money?</p>
               <p>Oliver. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went to Mr. Walker's house on Thursday the 5th instant; he took me up stairs; I told him there in the room, I had not money then to be made a mason, what I had was but 3 s. 6 d. The reply to me was, he would lend me any money that I wanted, and pulled out a sum of money from his pocket, and offered me five guineas into my hand; said he, I will make you a present of this money, if you will not mention the case that was when you lay with me at five o'clock in the morning; after this, I told him I would not accept of that sum of money upon any such terms, but if he would lend me the sum of five guineas, I would be much obliged to him, and pay him very honestly; upon this, he consented and lent it me; I took a guinea out of them, and desired two half guineas; he took it and gave me two half guineas, and then took one of the half guineas and went into the lodge-room to propose me as a mason; after he had been into the club-room, he came out to me, and told me he had proposed me; he went down stairs with me; there I staid some time in the bar, and then told him I could not stay any longer; I wished him a good night, and went away.</p>

I happened to come by at the time the prosecutor had him in custody; when the money was spoke of, the prisoner offered to make Mr. Walker satisfaction, if he would go down to Queen-street with him; I asked Mr. Walker whether or no the prisoner took the money; I understood Mr. Walker said he saw him take it; I asked him over again; he said he knew he did take it before he went out of the house; I told the prisoner of it, and he owned to me that he had it.
