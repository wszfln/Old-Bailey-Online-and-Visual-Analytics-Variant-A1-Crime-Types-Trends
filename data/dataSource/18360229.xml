He is a greeen-grocer, and lives at No. 7, Heatham-place, Dover-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington, Surrey—we keep the house, and have two lodgers—on Tuesday evening, the 9th of February, my husband went out about half-past eight o'clock—he came home between one and two o'clock—I did not sit up for him—I went to bed—I left the side-door open for him without a lock—there is no latch to it—I merely put it too—shortly after I got up stairs the clock struck eleven—the shop was safe when I went to bed—the shop and dwelling-house are all one building—the street-door leads into a passage which leads into the yard—there is a parlour behind the shop, and that room has a window looking into the back yard—a person by going along the passage, which I left open, could get to the back window—when I went to bed that window was shut down, but not fastened—there is no fastening to it—there is a shutter, but we never shut it—I am sure the window was quite shut down when I went to bed—I locked the parlour door when I went to bed, and took the key up stairs with me—I had left the cash-box on the side-board in the back room—it had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—there was one sovereign, one half-crown, and the rest in shillings and sixpences, except 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was in copper—I had counted it before I went to bed—I was called by the policeman between one and two o'clock in the morning—there is a door from the passage into the yard which the window looks into—I fastened that door with a bolt, but the bolt was on the side which any person coming in from the street, or the people down stairs, could undo it—when I came down, I found that bolt undone, and the door was open, and the window was open wide enough for a man to get in, I should think—I went up stairs for the key of the parlour, and missed the money-box—I know the box—I saw it again at Union Hall the next day—there is a compass on the lid of it—I had locked that box before I went to bed—I know the prisoner—he</p>

I was on duty in Heatham-place, Kent-street, on the day in question—about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Jackson's dwelling-house with something bulky under his arm—I followed him with Manning my brother officer—as soon as the prisoner saw he was so closely pursued, he hove down this box from under his arm, down on the ground—Manning picked it up—I went after the prisoner—he run for about ten minutes—I overtook him and took him to the station-house—he was searched, but nothing was found on him—I went back to Mr. Jackson's house—I went in, and found the yard-door open, and the window as far up as it could go—a person might get in there with ease—I called up the family.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer of Lambeth-street. About half-past eleven o'clock last Friday morning, in consequence of informa<lb/>tion, I went in pursuit of Carter—I met with him at the Golden Eagle, Shadwell—I searched him at the moment, and took from his coat-pocket this handkerchief and a pair of gloves—I then asked him whose property the handkerchief was—he said it was his own—I then took him into cus<lb/>tody, and took him to the station-house, and told him he was suspected of being concerned in a burglary at Laytonstone—he did not make any answer to that.</p>

On Friday morning, at twenty minutes to six o'clock, I got up, and met two men who I knew by sight having some gin—I went in—they asked me to drink—I said yes—they asked me if I would earn a few shillings—I said I would—we had two glasses of rum apiece—they asked me if I would go down <hi rend="italic">so and so</hi> with a cab, and they would pay me for it—they told me where this property was laid, on the Forest, down a lane—they said they would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay the cab, and if I could get it cheaper I was to have the remainder—I hired a cab for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but be<lb/>fore I went I called on M'Vee to accompany me down—I knocked at his door three times—he got up, and I asked him to go and take a ride with me—he said he would if I was back before breakfast-time—I said I should be—we went to the public-house where the two men were drink<lb/>ing—they called for half-a-pint of rum—we had a glass apiece, and we got into the cab—on going along, I told the cabman if they gave me the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I would give him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then left the cab, and went and found the pro<lb/>perty, and sent M'Vee back for the cab—it came down, and I put the property in it—when I went down for the clock the boots were with it—I put them on, and left my own shoes there, which I believe the officers found—they told me to put them on, being too small for one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Carter's Defence</hi>. I was taken in Ratchliffe-highway, on suspicion of this robbery. On the first examination Pease swore to the gloves being his—on the second examination I explained to him where I got them, that my brother gave them to me—I was sent to Clerkenwell for three months, and these gloves were in the possession of the policeman, K.S.—when I explained this to Pease he would not swear to them the second time—it is a very hard case to let him swear to that handkerchief; any person might go into the same shop and buy a handkerchief like that—I bought it in Field-lane on Wednesday—that was the day I fetched the gloves from the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cellarman to Messrs. Meux and Co., and live No. 6, North-place, Somerstown. On Saturday night, the 6th of Fe<lb/>bruary, a little before nine o'clock, I was going home; and when I was in the middle of Drummond-street I was suddenly tripped up, and fell on my back—I found a hand at my right-hand waistcoat-pocket—I had eight half-crowns and a sixpence there—I had spent some of my small cash in coming home; I had received my wages, eight half-crowns and four shillings—I called out "Murder"—the man ran away directly—when I got up I put my hand to my pocket, and found I had lost some silver—I could not tell what I had lost—I did not examine then—I was then con<lb/>ducted to the station—one of the policeman came up, and took me to the station-house—I got none of my money back—I then found I had one half-crown and a sixpence left—I had been drinking—it was dark—I can<lb/>not tell who did it—I am sure I was not so drunk that I fell down and lost my money—I could walk—I cannot tell where the person came, but I think on me side of me—it was done momentarily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Grundy-street, in the parish of All Saints, Poplar. I had purchased a pig at Leadenhall-market on the 13th of February—I paid a man to take it to my house, and put in on the table in the front room on the ground floor—I stopped at home for two hours, and had occassion to go to town to meet my daughter between nine and ten o'clock at night—my two sons went with me—I have no wife living—I shut the door—it has a spring lock—that is the way we generally leave it—it has no key—it may be opened by pushing hard against it with the knee—the window and outside shutter was shut—I re<lb/>turned about ten o'clock—I found the door as had I left it—we missed the pig off the table, and my jacket—we could not tell how they got in—we found the house as we left it—next evening about seven o'clock I went out from my house across the way, and about two hundred yards up the street I met the policeman—while we were talking the prisoner's brother Ferguson came up—he had some pork wrapped up in a towel—I think three or four joints—the pork that was on my table was entire, not separated at all—I could not swear to it when it was cut up—there was no one with Ferguson—I gave him in charge—I then went to the house, and met the prisoner and another woman coming after the man we had seized—they were about two hundred yards from him—I saw the jacket again before the Magistrate—the prisoner has been in the habit of coming to my house—my daughter had employed her to come and assist in cutting out shirts and making gar<lb/>ments for about five or six months; in fact, two or three years when my wife was alive—when I saw the prisoner coming with the pork, I told her I thought they had had plenty of trouble with the pork, she had better drop it—the women had each of them got some pork—she began to beg my pardon, and a great deal of it—I told here we had taken one, who was gone to the watch-house, and the thing was gone into the hands of the police, and must go forward—she then began to exclaim about her children—she said she had left her two children at home, and she wished to go there—the policeman said there was no objection, and we went to the</p>

On the 7th of February, between five and six o'clock, in the morning I saw the prisoner going up Arlington-street, Hampstead-road—he was with a person of the name of Jones—the prisoner was carrying a basket under his arm—I wantched them down towards Wellington-street, which is a quarter of a mile from there—that is where the prosecutor lives—I saw them coming back at half-part six o'clock—the prisoner was carrying a basket on his shoulder on the dark side of the road—I went and asked him what he had got—he said meat, and that he was employed to carry it—I said, "I saw you go up the road an hour ago, with the basket empty"—he said, "No, you did not, it was full then"—I took him into custody—I know the basket was empty when I first saw him—I then found the prosecutor, and shewed the articles to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Receiver of fines and forfeitures in his Majesty's customs, and was so on the 27th of November, 1834. I do my business in the Custom-house—there is an outer office, called the receiver of fines office, and I have an inner room to myself—this plan of the place (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) appears to be tolerably correct—the entrance from Thames-street and other place are accurately described—in November 1834, there was a considerable sale of property at the custom-house—the produce of the sale would come into my hands as receiver of fines—a few months before that, there had been another sale, upon which the amount was considerably less, which would leave a less sum in my hands—on the 27th of november, 1834, the amount of money in my hands was 4292<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. belonging to the Crown, and about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think of my own, and Mr. Billings had given me 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take care of for him—that was all in the chest on the night of the 27th of November—the property was principally in Bank-notes—on the morning of the 27th I had sent a great</p>

               <p>quantity of gold to the Bank, and received bank notes for it—there were two of £300 notes belonging to the Crown, and one in particular, which I remember besides those—I have a list of all the notes here—I made the balance myself—another person entered the figures—I counted the notes over at the time—there were four of £300, one of £200, eight of £100, ten of £50, two of £40, five of £30, fifteen of £20, fifty-three of £10, twenty-eight of £5, and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and cash 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that might be silver and copper—there was more money belonging to the King, about £200 in notes, 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that makes up the sum I first mentioned—there was a £10 and £5 note among my 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Billings' money was four £100 Bank-notes—this money was put into the King's chest, which is in my own private office, in the inner room—it was secured by two padlocks, and there was another lock to it—the key of that lock was out of order—it is called the stop-lock—the keys of the two padlocks were kept, one in my custody, and the other by the Accountant of petty receipts—the chest could not be properly opened without the concurrence of us two—I occasionally kept my key about my own person, and occasionally locked up in a drawer in my office—my office is private, and separate from all other business of the Custom-house—no body should come there except my two clerks, and the Accountant of petty receipts—when persons come on business, they come from a door facing me—there is not any separation between me and them—the door commu<lb/>nicates between the inner and outer office—persons who buy goods at the Custom-house sales, come to me to deliver their tickets and pay money—they come into the inner office—I was at the office on the 27th of Novem<lb/>ber, 1834, till about twenty minutes to four o'clock, as near as I can recollect—I left the money all safe in the chest, and the chest locked—I left my own key in the drawer, where I usually put it, when it was not about my person—I went to the office next morning at a few minutes after ten o'clock—(I was not the last person in the office that night)—when I came in the morning there was a rumour or clamour about what had happened—when I entered my office I found two persons present—I found the Ac<lb/>countant of petty receipts padlock to the chest was violently broken—my own was locked, and the key in my drawer—the drawer was broken open—it had been forced open—all the notes I have mentioned, and the money, were gone—I had some private bonds which were left—they were foreign securities—they remained there—they must have been touched—the cash-box was of considerable weight—there were three cash-boxes—the money belonging to the Crown was in one cash-box—Mr. Billing's money was in a private cash-box, and my own also—they were all gone.</p>

               <p>

I believe—I should have to give change for the note, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a catalogue</hi>), T.C.

On the 27th of November, 1834, I was assisting in the office of the Receiver of Fines—I checked with Mr. Walsh the account of money, the produce of a sale which had been held before in the Custome-house—I did so about half-past three o'clock, or rather sooner—I ascertained that the balance was correct—the money was placed in the King's chest—I left the office about twenty minutes before four o'clock, leaving Mr. Walsh and his clerks (Wood and Cooper) there—I fastened the Comptroller's padlock on the iron chest, and took the key up-stair, and deposited it in the place where it was usually kept—I am clerk to the Comptroller of fines and forfeitures—I have every reason to believe this is the Comptroller's lock (<hi rend="italic">looking at a padlock</hi>)—this is the key—I arrived at the Custom-house about five mi<lb/>nutes before ten o'clock next morning—I applied for the key of the Comp<lb/>troller's padlock where I had left it the night before, and obtained it—I went to the Receiver's office, and found a servant girl there—it was one or two minutes before ten o'clock—no other clerk or any person of the estab<lb/>lishment was there when I arrived—I did not look at the state of the Comptroller's padlock immediately—I could not do it as the cupboard door was closed—when one of the clerks arrived, (about five minutes past ten o'clock,) I went to the cupboard—I found the cupboard door unlocked, the lock having been forced off it, and the door open—I found the Receiver's padlock on the chest, locked, the Comptroller's padlock had been forced off, and laid down by the side of the chest—I afterwards saw Mr. Walsh apply the key to that padlock, and it opened it.</p>

                  </hi>. In November 1834, I was employed in the Custom-house as an extra tide-waiter. It was my business to attend to the fires in the King's cellar and warehouse—when the clerks left the office, it was my duty to go into the office and put out the fires—I recollect going into Mr. Walsh's office on the night of the robbery—I saw the clerks leave the office—there is a door which opens from Mr. Walsh's office into the lobby—that door is closed when the clerks leave the office—it is fastened by a spring lock—that door was closed on the afternoon of the robbery, after the clerks left, but not fastened—I closed it myself—after closing that door, I went to fasten the door leading into the lobby, on the north side, after the clerks were out of the office.</p>

               <p>September, 1827—my father was a Collector of customs at Drogheda, in Ireland—I became acquainted with seal after being a landing-waiter at the customs, in London—he was a landing-waiter and searcher in the cus<lb/>toms like myself—I was intimate with him—I had some difference with him, which was made up some years afterwards—about June, 1834, when I became very intimate with him again—he made some proposal to me shortly after we renewed our acquaintance—he mentioned to me that he had it in contemplation to rob the Custom-house—we were stationed together at the London-dock at that time—I used to go with him to public-houses constantly out of business-hours—to the Duke of Sussex, at Peckham, frequently; and to the Royal-Mortar, in the London-road—I frequently met him at the Castle, Old Kent-road—I was once or twice at the Three Kingdoms public-house with him—at the time he mentioned this to me, at the London-dock, he asked me if I would accompany him to the Three Kingdoms, which is in Harp-lane, opposite the Custom-house, to see a friend of his, named Mott—I went with him at the time to the Three Kingdoms, and Seale sent to the King's warehouse for Mott—I had not known Mott before to speak to him—I knew him by sight—he came over immediately—Seale introduced the subject to him of robbing the Custom-house, and mentioned the office of the Receiver of Fines and Fortfeits—Mott answered him by saying, that the King's sale, which was then coming off, would be but a small one, and he thought it more pru<lb/>dent to defer such a thing to the next sale, which would be larger one—Seale acquiesced in that—I went to Ireland about the beginning of the August, 1834—I frequently mentioned the subject with Seale and Mott before I went—I frequently met them at the Duke of Sussex—the first time I saw the prisoners Jordan and Sullivan was, I think, in June, 1834, at the Royal Mortar, in the London-road—I became acquainted with them by meeting them in company there—I have gone there with Seale and Mott, and met them there—I was not introduced to them, but became acquainted with them by meeting them there, through Seal and Mott—nothing was said about the Custom-house in their presence before I went to Ireland—I had met them perhaps a dozen times before I went to Ireland—when I went there I met Sullivan and</p>

as he called them—he said they were both experienced <hi rend="italic">cracksmen</hi>; but afterwards, on inquiry, Seale found Newsom was not in this country, having gone to America—Seale told me so; and that Walter was out of town—Mott mentioned the names of Sullivan and Jordan—he said he had met them at the Royal Mortar, and had mentioned the subject to them, and had made an appointment for us to meet them at Jordan's house, No. 4, East-lane, Old Kent-road—Seale, Mott, and myself, went there, and met Sullivan and Jordan—as near as I can recollect, that was about the beginning of October—the subject was introduced by Mott and Seale, and the conversation was on that point only (the point of the robbery)—Sullivan and Jordan inquired what the contents of the chest might be in the Receiver of Fines and Forfeiture's Office—they inquired that of Mott—he said, before the King's sale took place, he should be able to ascertain what the actual contents of the chest were—Jordan and Sullivan said they would inspect the place the day after, or the following day, when it suited their convenience; and it was taken arranged that we should meet at Jordan's house a few evenings after they had inspected the place, (the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures, and the King's warehouse in the Custom-house,) the situation of the place was described by Mott—we met again a few nights afterwards at Jordan's house—Jordan and Suillivan said they had inspected the place, and they considered it would be a very easy matter to accom<lb/>plish the fact—meaning to rob the place—the subject then spoken of was, which was the best way to accomplish it—Sullivan said, he thought the best way would be to fit the locks of the door, provided they could get im<lb/>pressions of the keys—that was the door going into the King's warehouse from the esplanade—the outer door—the esplanade is on the south side—Mott was not present at this meeting, only Seale, Sullivan, and Jordan—I said I would mention the circumstance to Mott when I saw him, and find whether he could get imperssions of the keys—I met Mott the next even<lb/>ing, and told him what had passed—he said he could get the impression of one of the keys, mentioning the large key; but the impression of the key of the padlock he was fearful he could not get—I communicated this to Sullivan and Jordan, and appointed for us all to meet the following evening at Jordan's house; and we all met on that occasion there—Mott on that occasion pro<lb/>duced the large key of the door leading from the esplanade, which he said he had taken from the chest of Mr. Bunnett, a clerk in the same office, in the King's warehouse-keeper's office, and that Mr. Bunnett at the time was absent on sick-leave from sickness—an impression of the key was taken in beeswax at the time by Sullivan—Mott brought the key down, rolled up in a piece of paper of paper folded at the ends—I think it was white paper—after the impression was taken, the key was put up in the same paper, with the intention of returning it to Mr. Bunnett's desk the following morning, when he returned to duty—Seale asked if they would not require the assistance of a third party to effect the robbery—Jordan said, he thought they would, and Seale then mentioned the name of William May—it was merely proposed on that occasion that he should be employed to as<lb/>sist them—we then made an appiontment to meet again a few evenings afterwards, which we did at Jordan's house—Mott, Seale, Jordan, Sullivan, and myself were present, and May was introduced—a skeleton-key was produced by Sullivan which was made from the impression which had been taken—they then stated that this key they had tried at the Custom-house—Jordan and Sullivan said they had tried it to see if it would fit—they described that it would partly fit; but it being rather weak in the shank, they were afraid to force it, and they said they would make another key on a stronger principal—at that meeting Mott produced three small padlock keys, and said it was likely that one of them would fit the padlock outside the door leading from the esplanade—an</p>

               <p>impression was taken of those three keys in beeswax, and an appoint<lb/>ment made to meet again a few evenings afterwards, which we did—I was there—Seale, May, Jordan, and Sullivan—Mott was not there—we all met but him—May, Sullivan, and Jordan said they had tried these small keys, and none of them would fit, and they mentioned, that they considered the best way of doing it was "<hi rend="italic">stowing away</hi>," meaning one of the parties to conceal themselves in the Receivers of Fines and Forfeiture's Office—May volunteered to <hi rend="italic">stow away</hi>—they then spoke about which was the best way of effecting this object, and mentioned that they would go and inspect the place again, for that object, to see which was the best method of doing so—we met again at Jordan's house—we were all six present—it was then coming very close to the King's sale, and Jordan said, they (Sullivan, Jordan, and May) should like to know whether the money was actually in the chest or not—and it was spoken of how they should find out whether the money was there or not—it was proposed that one of the parties should purchase a lot at the King's sale, and by so doing, they would have an opportunity of paying for it in the Receiver of Fines' Office, and would have an opportunity of seeing the chest and the contents of it—Mott said he had purchased a lot, or a friend had purchased a lot for him, of twenty gallons of rum—he desired me to tell Sullivan and Jordan so a day or two afterwards, and I told them—he said he would give the ticket for the rum to Jordan, and he could go and see what the contents of the chest were—he said the Custom-house agent had bought the lot for him—he gave me the ticket, which I handed to Jordan, to pay for the lot—I gave directions to Jordan to take it to the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures, to present it to the Receiver, and pay for the lot—he then said, he had better first go and see the Receiver, to get a knowledge of his person, with the intention of following him into the office the first thing in the morning, before he could have change in his pocket or drawer, to give him for a large note which he intended to present him for payment—an evening or two after<lb/>wards we met again—Seale, myself, Jordan, Sullivan, and May—all but Mott—Jordan said he had seen the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures, and had procured a note, which he meant to present next morning to the re<lb/>ceiver—he said it was a £50 note—he mentioned some circumstance at the time, about having some misunderstanding with the banker, on receiv<lb/>ing the note that day—we met, I believe, the following evening, which I think was the 26th of November, at Jordan's house—he described that he had watched the Receiver in, the first thing in the morning, a few minutes after nine o'clock, followed him right into his office, and put the ticket down for the fifty gallons of rum, and the £50 note—that the Receiver felt his pocket and opened his drawer, and had not change (as he anticipated)—and then the Receiver went to the strong chest and opened one padlock, but the other did not open, because the key was kept by another party—I think he said he was obliged to wait a moment or two before the party came with that key—that the chest was then opened, and the Receiver took the large cash-box, with both hands, and it was as much as he could do to lift it up on the counter, with both hands; and, from the quantity of gold, and notes under the gold, there must be upwards of 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he also described, that he wrote his own name on the back of the note, or the front, and gave his own address—he went wnt at that time by the name of William, Sullivan, but his right name is Leary—he said he wrote the name of Leary, No. 4, East-lane, Kent-road and Mott at the time said it was bad judgement to do so, for he said the book in which they kept the numbers of the notes, and the addresses of</p>

               <p>the parties who gave notes, on looking at it, would lead to certain detection; and it was then agreed that the leaves of this book should be cut out, or torn out—it was arranged that night, that on the following day, a little before four o'clock, William May should conceal himself in the office of Receive of Fines and Forfeitures, behind the door, that he should go a little before four o'clock, (about seven or eight minutes,) accompanied by Jordan and Sullivan, and at the time of the confusion and bustle of the different officers and clerks leaving the department of the King's warehouse, May should take an opportunity of walking into this office, and standing behind this door, which was left open all night—the door of that particular office is left open all night—it was also arranged that on the following morning, at nine o'clock, (which is the legal hour for the different officers to attend,) at the time the door was open, that Sullivan and Jordan should be in attendance on the esplanade, and three or four minutes after the door was open, and after the watchmen for the night had taken their lamps, and walked through the passage leading by the Receiver of Fines Office, Jordan and Sullivan were to walk through, and give May a sign to come out, and Mott should assist them as much as possible, by detaining the parties in his office who went in to sigh the appearance sheet—it was also arranged that night that we should meet on the morning of the 28th, at Seale's house, at New Peckham, to divide the money—we then separated for that night—I was absent from duty on the 27th—I had been unwell, and was absent four or five days by a sick note—about half-past four o'clock, on the evening of the 27th, Seale called on me at my lodging, No. 17, Trinity-terrace, on his way from the London-dock, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards Jordan and Sullivan called—they told me May had been safely lodged, and described the manner in which it was done—they said that about ten minutes before four o'clock, the clerks in the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures Office left their office, and two or three minutes after, they, (Jordan, Sullivan, and May,) walked into the passage leading from the espla<lb/>nade throught the Custom-house, to Thames-street, and took the opportunity, by opening an umbrella, to cover May, and give him an opportunity of going into the office unseen by any parties who stood about—they said they stood about on the esplanade for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, till all the doors were locked for the night—they said Mott was one of the last parties that came out of the warehouse, that he, on seeing the doors locked, and the man safely lodged, gave a sort of jump for joy—Sullivan and Jordan stopped at my house about half an hour, and went away, appointing to meet us the next morning, at seven o'clock, at the Lord Nelson, Old-Kent-road, to walk across the fields, to show us Seal's house, at Peckham, where we had agreed to meet the following morning—Seal stopped with me till about half-past six o'clock—he and I then went down to the place appointed, and met Jordan and Sullivan close to the Lord Nelson—we walked across Peckam fields to Seal's house—Seale pointed out the house, and we separated—I stopped with Seale a short time that evening, at the Duke of Sussex, at Peckham, Which was close by, and from there went to the Castle in the Old-Kent-road—On the morning of the 28th of November I left home about half-past eight o'clock, and went down to Peckham, where I was to meet Seale on the Canal bridge, a short distance from his house—I went there, and went into the Waterman's Arms there, and had some tea and ale, and about in hour afterwards I saw Seale close to the Waterman's Arms—I opened the window, and he came up-stairs to where I was sitting, and we there sat till we saw May, Sullivan and Jordan coming across the Canal</p>

               <p>Bridge towards the waterman's Arms—we then came out and met them, and went from there direct to Seale's house—Mott did not come—he remained at his office—we went into Seale's front parlour—May took the money out of his trowser's pocket in bank notes and sovereigns—Seale then brought in some lunch, a bottle of stout, and so on—May described what took place during the night—he said that shortly after the doors were locked, he set to work at the lock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say where he went to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was in the Receiver or Fines and Forfeitures' office—he said so—he said he first procured the key which opened the Receiver's lock, from his drawer, which had been described to him by Jordan, who saw where the Receiver took it from—he said he then burst the lock open, and then opened the chest, and took from there the money—he also said he cut the leaves out of the book which contained the numbers and names of the parties who paid money there, and he pro<lb/>duced the leaves of the book—we looked over them, and saw the name of Leary—the leaves were then burnt—we then counted the money—it amounted to 4, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—we then divided the money into six equal lots, we tossed up for the choice of lots, and after we tossed for the lots we took our different lots, and there was then a deduction made by them for expenses by (Sullivan, Jordan, and May) there was an odd note left (I believe a £20) but I don't know, we were confused and in a hurry—I did not see the amount of the note, but I think it was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that and the odd silver, and two odd pounds in gold, they kept for expenses—there was a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note with Leary's name on it, which he described as the one he gave Mr. Walsh, and Jordan requested to have that himself, and he had it—Mott was not present at the time—Seals kept his lot, mine and his own together—he took them up-stairs and put them into a package, with the intention of sending them out of town that day—the other parties (Sullivan, Jordan, and May) went away, each taking their own lot—I met Seale in the evening at the Duke of Sussex, and he told me that our money by that time was sixty or seventy miles out of town—he did not say where then—some months afterward he told me it was gone to Leicester—I went down for it by his request and Mott's in Febru<lb/>ary, 1835—Seale directed me there to call on his sister-in-law, Mrs. Do<lb/>noram, and she would give it to me—I went to Leicester and applied to her—she took me to a house some distance off—she went into the house and brought the parcel out, and gave it to me—I brought it with me direct to London, to my lodging in Trinity Terrace, and the following evening I had Seale and Mott with me, and I then opened the parcel—it was a small deal box, about six inches square—I found the three parcels inside, with the initials T.S., W.H., and H.M. written in pencil—we then opened them, and we counted our lots separately—they amounted to 745<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes each lot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the sum you had allotted to you on the morning of the 28th of November? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the sum my lot amounted to—Seale did not count his money that morning, but I counted mine—Mott and Seale gave me their parcels, and requested me to keep them for them, which I accordingly did, with the intention, as they said, of getting an opportunity of disposing of the notes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you finally do with their parcels? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave Jordan part of the money, for which he gave us sovereigns, deducting 20 per cent.—for all notes under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said were not advertised, he said he would take from me at a discount of 20 per cent., and I brought him I</p>

               <p>think 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were altogether out of the three parcels, I got sovereigns for them from Jordan; and some time afterwards I lead another transaction of a similar kind with Jordan—he undertook or take all the notes I had under 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which were not advertised, at 20 per cent dis<lb/>count—I brought him I think about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I met him at a house opposite Astley's theatre, kept by Procter, and there gave him the notes; and a few nights afterwards I met him again, and he gave me the gold for them—I gave Seal his share, and Mott's share I kept for him—the rest of the money I put into a parcel, in a tin case, and concealed it in Camberwell church-yard, where it remained for some month, buried in the ground—I had changed my residence shortly after time—a few months after this, Seale told me we had better try and get rid of the remaining part of our notes; and he said he knew a man who was trustworthy, who would go on the Continent and circulate them—he mentioned his name, Henry Mor<lb/>rison—he said he know where he lived, and would take me to him—I went with him to Henry Morrison's house, and saw Morrison—Seale mentioned the subject—Morrison said he would consider of it, and give us an answer in two or three days—we appointed to meet him in two or three days, at the Leopard coffee-house, near London-bridge—we met him there, and it was agreed that we should give him part of the notes, and allow him 30 percent for circulating them on the Continent—I brought him part of the notes a few nights afterwards to his house—I brought him three of £100, two of £10, and a £5 note—he was absent about ten days on the Continent, and brought the gold to my house for the notes—I was then living at Peckham—I gave Seale his share of the gold, and kept Mott's for him till he required it—I used frequently to meet Mott on the subject at the Duke of Sussex, and he frequently called at my house—I still kept the remaining part of the notes for a few months—in September last I had another transaction with Morrison, of the same description—Mott and Seale were privy to that—it was by their consent; I gave Mor<lb/>rison more notes, and he brought me gold for them from the Continent—I then had three £300 notes left—I was then living at Walworth—I con<lb/>cealed those notes in a cup-board-door, at my own house—I bored a hole with a centre-bit in a part of the door, near the hinge—I there placed the notes, putting a cork on the top to them, first tying them round with a bit of white tape and paper—I put the cork into the hole, and puttied it over, and then painted it—I believe this is the cork and string, and it was such paper as this (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I was taken into custody four or five weeks ago—I am not married—a woman lived with me as my wife—she knew I had something concealed there, but did not know it was Bank-notes—the three £300 notes were still concealed there when I was taken into custody, (<hi rend="italic">looking at some notes</hi>.) I did not take the numbers of the notes—my father came over here while I was in custody on this charge, and I made a statement to him of what I have told you.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I collect from what now—I came from Ireland to the custom-house in 1827, and have been employed there till I was apprehended in January last—I was a you say that you are a native of Ireland? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; my father lives there landing-waiter, the same as Seale—I am about thirty-two years old—I had no employment before I went to the custom-house—I lived with my parents in Ireland—Seale and I became acquainted through my joining the Custom-house, and we quarrelled six or seven months after we became ac<lb/>quainted, which was three or four months after I went to the Custom-house—it</p>

               <p>was open quarrel—we had no intimacy for some years after the difference—the reconciliation began about June, 1834—the steps for this robbery commenced very shortly after our making it up—we became very intimate friends immediately after the reconciliation—I was not living with Mrs. Godfrey in June—I was living in Lime-street, City—Dr. Farrant was my landlord—I went from his house to Ireland, and when I came back, I went to lodge with Mrs. Godfrey—she did not know me before I went to lodge there, to my knowledge—Dr. Farrant knew me before I lodged with him—I think he brought me a letter of introduction from a friend of mine—he knew a relation of mine, Dr. Huey, who lived at No. 12, Lime-street, be<lb/>fore he went to live there, and he had been my doctor before I went to lodge there, as I had been ill—I went to Ireland on leave of absence—my father requested me to come over to see him—he is a collector of customs at Drogheda—I got into no trouble in Ireland at that time—I returned about the 4th of September—I knew Mott as a clerk by sight, but not otherwise, until June 1834—I knew nothing of him till he was introduced to me by Seale, for the purpose of committing this robbery—the first interview to plan the robbery was at the Three Kingdoms, in Harp-lane—I went there with Seale—Mott was sent for by Seale, and come—we held various meetings at that house—the Duke of Sussex, the Royal Mortar, and the Castle, were generally our places of meeting—we generally met of an evening, after the Custom-house business was over—nobody was present at the first meeting but Seale and Mott—the conversation was between us three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the whole plan arranged there, or was it only just suggested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared as if the conversation was an old one between Mott and Seale—Seale proposed breaking open the chest to me—I was rather willing and acquiescing in it—I cannot recollect whether I hesitated about it or not—I did not say I would not mix myself up with it—it was all that time in contemplation till November—we have frequently been seen to<lb/>gether at the Duke of Sussex, kept by Mrs. Gurney—her son-in-law has seen us there continually—I do not know whether he is here—he acted as landlord—I do not recollect his name—he used to bring liquor into the room—we took care that nobody should hear our conversation on this subject—Peck keeps the Royal Mortar—he waited on the customers, and knew as very well, and also the man who keeps the Castle—we occa<lb/>sionally met there as well as at other houses—Mott was not present at all the meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear he was ever at any conversation, except at the meeting when Seale sent for him from the Custom-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, several; and they were in the evening—I kept no dates—the robbery was to be done on the 27th—I did not point out the mode by which it was to be done—I was a sharer, and accessory—I did not take any part in pointing out how it might be done, for I was never in the Receiver's Office in my life, where it is now situated—the office was originally differ<lb/>ently situated—it has been lately removed to the King's Warehouse, and in that office I never was in my life—I could not furnish any means how it could be accomplished.</p>

               <p>wrote down an account of this transaction since I have made the disclosure I gave an account of it, but not before—I made a disclosure to my father and Mr. Rowan, a friend, at the same time—I was in custody at the time it was not written down then it was first written down, I think about the 23rd or 24th of January—I was then in Giltspur-street complete—Mr. Rowan took some notes of it, and some days afterwards Mr. Wal<lb/>ford and Mr. Hobler took it down Mr. Rowan has been a friend of mine for years—he took down what I had to disclose with a view to make a full disclosure to his Majesty's Customes it was to have the particulars of my disclosure for the purpose of detection—I requested Mr. Rowan to goto the Commissioners, and say I would make a full disclosure and confes<lb/>sion of my guilty knowledge of the transaction—he took it down, because he said he could not know what it was unless he did take it down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> did you give the account to save yourself, or for the purposes of justice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My object in doing it, was for the purpose of saving Mr. Rowan from blame, which might be attached to him for his friendly conduct towards me; and, in the next place as a sort of justice to my father and family, for the disgrace I had brought upon them—as to myself, I said at the time I should have no mercy, for I should be transported for life—my family first knew of it when my father came to town—that was about the 19th of January—my father knew nothing of it from me till I was taken up—he was on his way here, and came to town the day I was apprehended—I made a full confession of every thing at the time, and Mr. Rowan took it down in writing—he took a note of it, and I afterwards gave it to Mr. Hobler and Mr. Walford—Mr. Hobler took down the whole of it from the beginning to the end, as near as I can recollect—I told him the same as I have repeated here to-day, as near as I can recollect—Jordan and Sullivan came to me at my own house on the 27th, and remained there half an hour—Jordan, Sullivan, and May came to me at the Canal-bridge on the 28th—we then proceeded to Seale's house—we had to go about 100 yards from the Canal-bridge a woman waited on us at the public-house, before we went to Seale's—I have not seen her since, to my knowledge—there was nobody in the house but Seale and myself—we sat in a room below, and when we saw the other parties coming across the Canal-bridge, we came out and met them—I saw nobody but Seale when we got to his house—I did not see Mrs. Seale, she might have been in the house, but I did not see her—Seale went on before, and had the door opened—Seale told me he did up the parcel that was sent to Leicester—Mott had a portion of the money—on my coming back from Leicester in February 1835, with the parcel, it was opened, and the seals broken—that was at Mrs. Godfrey's in Trinity-terrace—Mrs. Godfrey did not see it done—Seale, Mott, and myself did.</p>

I was at his house on the last day of Barnet races in Septem<lb/>ber last—I saw the two farthest prisoners (Jordan and Sullivan) at my brother's that night, about half past eleven o'clock—from eleven o'clock to half-past—they took something—they were in company—they came on horse-back, and remained about two hours, and left on horse-back—I recollect that Jordan and his horse fell down together—I should day he had taken rather more than I should like to take myself generally—I helped him up again—I should think the horse had in<lb/>jured him—he complained of some part of his limbs being injured by the horse falling down on him—I went with them when they went away—I went on Jordan's horse—I rode in front of him—I think I had got on Jordan's horse before he fell off—the natural consequence of his coming down was my coming down too—I got up again and went to the Saloon in Piccadilly—Fred<lb/>erick Chandler is my brother's barman—I know Samuel Evans—he is called <hi rend="italic">Dutch Sam</hi>, the pugilist—I believe he was at the Saloon that morn<lb/>ing—we remained there till about six o'clock in the morning—Jordan and Sullivan remained there till I left—they then mounted their horses and left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, Ebenezer Dewer. We are founders and smiths, and live in Old-street—we make tools—the prisoner was our apprentice for nearly five years—in the course of the last two years I have missed a great many tools—in consequence of information which I received on Thursday, the 11th of February, I went to the station-house and got two constables—Warton, another of my appren<lb/>tices, accompanied me—Pierce at that time was a workman of mine, and lived at No. 8, Wilson-street, Old-street-road—I went to that house with War<lb/>ton and the two policemen, and in the lower room of that house I found a quantity of tools on the floor, and some in a box—I knew some of them to be ours—I selected such as I knew, and gave Pierce into custody—after that I took a constable back with me to my own manufactory, and took the prisoner into custody—I told him I believed he had got some of my tools—he said he had not—he afterwards said he had got some of them—I said I had found some of our tools at Pierce's house, and Pierce had said they belonged to Sully—the prisoner said he had not got any of our tools—that he had not taken any of out tools—I said Pierce said he had taken them, and that they were at Pierce's house—he said he had made some tools and taken them home with him, but he had made them in his own time—most of the tools I found at Pierce's had marks, but a chisel had my name on it—it was not present when I was speaking to him—there were screws among the tools and I know them by the paper they were wrapped in, the hand-writing of out clerk, who has left us, was on the paper—the prisoner had no authority to carry away any tools or articles from the premises, nor any authority to make tools on the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8 Wilson-street, Old-street. I was in Mr. Dewer's employ for about three months—the prisoner and I worked together at the shop—about a fortnight previous to the discovery of these tools he told me he had got a great quantity of tools at Exeter—I asked him particularly if they belonged to him—he said he had bought the best part of them, and some his father had made—and he asked if I would allow him to bring them to my house—I said, if they all belonged to him I should have no objection—he said he would write a letter on the following Saturday night, and take it to his cousin the afterwards said he took the letter down himself to his cousin at the water-side) he came back to my house on the same Saturday night—I asked him if he took the letter—he said he did, that he had been onboard a long while, and had some wine and grog on board—he said the vessel was going to start the following day, and the tools were to come up the following week from Exeter—and on the following Monday week he told me the tools had been sent in a cart to Helmet-row—he asked if I would allow him to bring them to my house on the following Tuesday—he said he had been to a friend of his in Hel<lb/>met-row, and all the tools had arrived—my house was afterwards searched—the tools had come to my house on the Tuesday night after the con<lb/>versation on the Monday—I met the prisoner by appointment that night at the corner of Helmet-row—I engaged a truck and took Warton with me—the prisoner took me to a court in Helmet-row—to Harding's—and I assisted him out of the cellar with a box of tools into the truck—there was one good-sized box, and to the best of my knowledge two or three small ones—I took them to my house, and the prisoner unlocked them and put the tools on the ground—I had requested Warton to come with me to watch the truck from Helmet-row to my house, and to come in half an hour afterwards—I took Warton there, that if the tools belonged to Mr. Dewer he might give information—I took him as a witness—I had spoken to him on the Monday previous—I had a suspicion that they belonged to Mr. Dewer—when Warton came in, Sully saw him, and exclaimed, "I am done"—Warton said he had instructions from Mr. Dewer to come and in<lb/>spect the tools, and if any resistance took place he would call a constable—it was a previous arrangement between Warton and me that he should say so—the prisoner begged of us not to tell—I requested Warton to come with me and acquaint Mr. Dewer his tools were in my house—Warton said he did not like that—I then proposed that the property should go back—and the prisoner said he would take all Mr. Dewer's property back—the property was selected the following evening—the prisoner filled all his pockets with the tools, which he said belonged to Mr. Dewer, and said he should take them all back to the shop the next morning—I took a great number of drills and turning tools from my house to Mr. Dewer's and put them into my cupboard—I was taken into custody the same day—I put them into my cupboard at Mr. Dewer's factory—the apprentice came to me that morning and asked if I had brought any tools back. and I believe on the following Friday a policeman took them—I put a mark on them—Mr. Dewer produced a chuck in the shop at the same time, and the drills fitted it—Mr. Dewer came to my house on Thursday, the 16th of February, I believe—I did not know the tools when I saw them seattered on my floor.</p>

No, he did not—he mounted on the horse, and made away—I thought that Mr. Venus might have brought him up along with him, and that it was his, he went so directly up to it—he took the harness off in a hurry.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Richard Cooper Goodman. He is a proprietor of a timber yard and premises in Comp<lb/>ton-street, Clerkenwell. On the morning of the 7th of February, at a quarter before three o'clock, I was awoke by a knocking at the door of the private house attached to the timber yard—I went down and found a policeman there—our shed has leaden gutters, but I had not been on the roof, and had not seen them—I went on afterwards, and found the gutters had been ripped and cut—I did not go to bed again till I had seen the prisoners in the station-house, which was about five o'clock in the morning—twenty-one feet of lead had been cut, about two feet six inches wide—I instructed the officer to throw it into a shed from the wall where it laid—it was not there when I went to bed.</p>

Lower Gun-alley, Wapping he went into the house and I followed him, he went up-stairs, pulled a key from his pocket unlocked a door on the first floor, and went in I followed him—the outer door was open—when he got in he said, "I have not got the cover of the letter"—he had not looked for it when he said of—he went and got some paper and tied them up in apiece of flannel he brought them down stairs, and was about to give them to a woman I said, "You had better bring them to the in<lb/>spector and clear yourself"—he said, "You shall not take them they are my property and I shall not go with you," I said, "Then I must give you into custody," which I did—It was a small house—it appeared to have one room up-stairs and another down, that was all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and carry on business in Brewer-street, Somer's-town, in the parish of St. Pancras. I reside at No.67, Pratt-street, Camden-town—my wife carries on the business of the shop, with the assistance of a shopman, named James—I do not know his other name—he lives and sleeps in the house—there are lodgers in the house—my house was broken open no Sunday, the 14th of February—I had attended to business that morning in the shop—un<lb/>fortunately, I open on Sunday morning—I am collector of poor rates for St. Pancras, and am engaged the whole week in that occupation—on Sunday morning my wife generally remains in Pratt-street and I generally go down to look after the business in Brewer-street—both the houses are in St. Pancras parish—the shopman was also there that day—I left at a little after twelve o'clock on Sunday morning, the shopman left with me—I left nobody in the house—every door and window were fastened and locked, I believe, expect the room occupied by three young gentlemen, who merely deep in the house—their door was not locked, they are not in the habit of locking it—the shopman is always at home at ten o'clock at night—the fa<lb/>ther of the young gentlemen lives in the same street, and if the shopman is not at home, they wait there till he comes home—I locked the street door and</p>

On the afternoon of the 25th of January, Ing came to me and complained of being robbed—I went with him to the Bricklayers' Arms—the prisoner was not there—I found him at the Hand and Flower beer-shop—the prosecutor was sober—I see no difference in him now to what he was then—he ran to my house for me, and walked back with me to the house, as sober as he is at this moment—two persons, named Peet and Banks, were at the beer-shop also—I told the prisoner he was my prisoner—he was charged with feloniously robbing Alexander Ing of one shilling—Peet and Banks wanted to return the shilling back to the prosecutor—they asked him if he would take the shil<lb/>ling back which he said he had robbed him of, and they proposed to pay me for my trouble—that was in the prisoner's hearing—I was taking him out of the house at the time the request was made to me and the prosecutor—I told them I could not do business in that way, I must take the case before a Magistrate, and he must decide on it—I did not find any shilling on the prisoner—both Peet and Banks spoke, but Peet was the man who requested the shilling to be paid back—he said, "Will you take the shil<lb/>ling back, and say no more about it?" and offered to pay me for my trouble—no money was produced—I said I would not suffer it—I found nothing relating to this charge on the prisoner—the beer-shop is about two hundred yards from the Bricklayers' Arms—they were drinking a pot of beer when I entered the room, and called for two pots of beer after I went in, which was paid for, but I don't know whether the shilling was paid or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 68, Pall Mall, in the pa<lb/>rish of St. James, Westminster. I am a watch and clock maker, em<lb/>polyed by many of the government establishments—the prisoner was in my service in 1834, and had been so about seven years—I believed him, up to that time, to be an honest man—I should not have kept him if I had not—on the 23d of June he ceased coming to my house, with<lb/>out any apparent cause—I made enquiries and could not discover him—I made search about my premises, and missed four clocks—I have a very extension stock, so that it would be difficult to miss any—with<lb/>out my attention being called to it, I was not likely to discover it for some time—I had bills printed, and took every means to find the prisoner—in January last, in consequence of some information, I processed to Bir<lb/>mingham, and took a Birmingham policeman, and found the prisoner at work at a clock-maker's—I instantly took him on this charge, and went immediately to his lodgings—I made use of no promise or threat to induce him to make any statement to me—the prisoner said precisely this, "It is now all over; I may as well tell you where the four clocks are that I took"—he then described where he pawned them all four, describing the streets accurately, but he could not remember the names of the pawnbrokers—he gave me the name of Eaton-street, Pimlico; a pawnbroker's, in Prince-street; opposite Gerard-street; a pawnbroker's in Green-street, Leicester-square; and a pawnbroker's in Westminster-road, a little way on the left hand</p>

               <p>side—he further told me he had pawned one clock in Eaton-street, in his own name; and the other three clocks in the name of Charles Johnson—I went to the three pawnbrokers he described, but found the three clocks had been all sold, being out of time—I found one at Eaton-street—we searched his drawers, in which he kept his tools, as soon as we ascertained he had run away, and found a clock-winder, which winds this clock.</p>

I am pregnant; I don't like to he dragged about; these things are not mine, they belong to a woman who is gone across the road"—he never made any attempt to go after her; if he had, he would have found her, as there is no thoroughfare, but dragged me through the court, and took me to the station—house; and them I was taken to Worship—street.

On the 16th of February, I lost a shawl from the shop—this is it—the two prisoners came there about four o'clock in the afternoon, under pretence of asking the price of a gown—they looked at one, and asked the price of it, both of them—one of them asked the price of a shawl—then the other asked the price of another gown, and then remarked how dear I was—there were several shawls hanging up—they left the shop, and did not buy any thing—there were no other persons in the shop, not any other shopman—I hung this shawl up myself—I missed it directly they were gone—they ran away from the door, that gave me suspicion—I pursued them, and overtook them in Tottenham-court-road coming out of a pawnbroker's of the name of Franklin—I do not know which of them had the shawl—I said I wanted them, and took them into the passage of the pawnbroker's, and asked the young man to mind them while I got a policeman—this is the shawl I found on one of them—one said that the other gave it to her to pledge, and the other said she met a woman, who asked her to go and pledge it.</p>

On the 28th of January I went to the Grapes Tavern, St. Martin's-lane—I met the prisoner there about half-past ten o'clock in the morning—I entered into conversation with him respecting some horses, and one thing or another, and then went to my shop—I had a cash-box in my iron safe—there were a great many bills of Exchange in it, and twelve sovereigns, sixteen half-sovereigns, and three £20 Bank-notes—there was more than 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all—the prisoner went with me to my shop—we got home about half-past eleven o'clock—we drank together a little—I took him home with a person who had lived with me, and we lunched together—after that, a person called for the payment of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some wine—I got my cash-box out of my iron safe, and got the money out, and paid the amount—I saw the other money there at that time, and left the cash-box on the table, locked—there was no one in the parlour but the prisoner and Corfield, who had lived with me—he is not here—the prisoner saw me take the money out of the box—I was then called into the shop, and left the box on the table, but supposed it to be locked up—I was not in the shop more than half an hour—when</p>

I fell asleep—it might be from what little I had drank, not having breakfasted—I should think I slept for an hour—this was between twelve and one o'clock—I awoke from half-past two to three o'clock—no one was there then—the prisoner and Corfield were gone—Corfield had gone before that—as I remember his asking me if he could do any business for me in the City—I remember his going, and he left the prisoner there—that was before I went to sleep the first time—I fell asleep again, and nothing occurred to make me think of the property, till Mr. Humphreys called to borrow 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I then went for my cash-box, and it was gone, and all the property—there was a gold seal, a ring, and a key in it—I know the numbers of the three £20 notes, and this is my box, and this purse belongs to me—here are two of the £20 notes—they have got my writing on the back of them—and there was another £20 note which I have seen, but it is not here.</p>

On the 17th Febru<lb/>ary, about five o'clock in the morning, I was between Bow-bridge and Bow-church—I saw the two prisoners a short distance apart—perhaps twenty yards, walking the same way—I stopped Johnson with these two pieces of cotton tied up in a blue handkerchief—I asked him what he had got there—he said he had got some prints, and he had brought them from Messrs. Lane's, at Harlow—as the patterns did not suit, he was going to take them to Bethnal-green, to have them exchanged—I thought it was an unlikely story, and took him to the station-house—I called my brother-officer, who went after Turner, and he brought him with another bundle—he said he got them near the Horse-shoes, at Potters-street, which is about three miles below Epping—that he took them out of a bale he found in the road, and thought they had dropped from Mr. Mend, the Harlow waggoner—I went to the King's Arms, in Leadenhall-street, and saw Mr. Mend, and found he had lost a small bale of goods of this description.</p>

On the 7th of February I went to Mr. Sims house, and was there-quarters of an hour—I saw Mrs. Sims, and a person Mrs. Sims called Wilkinson, or Williams at first, that was the prisoner Steel—he made no reply—he was in his shirt sleeves—she afterwards called him Steel—he said nothing—he got up—there were three pairs of slippers on the table—he took them up, and put them into the fire, after Mrs. Sims called him Steel—he said what could he do about burning the shoes—he went out directly on being called Steele—I never saw his before—he was there when I went in—he could hear what Mrs. Sims said—they were sitting on each side of the fire place.</p>

I have seen the prisoners Sims and Steel there—I first saw them about five months since—I know a man of the name of Mallet—he was acquainted with the two prisoners—on Friday, the 5th of February. Sims and Mallet came first, between eight and nine o'clock, and Steel joined them about half-past nine o'clock—they remained till a quarter past ten o'clock together—Sims lives at No. 3, Sidney-street—on the Sunday(after that Friday)the 7th of February, about ten minutes after one o'clock, I saw the prisoner Steel come out of Sims' house—he ap<lb/>peared in a great flurry, buttoning up his coat, and running down the street, as fast as possible.</p>

Wimpole-street—the prisoner was our footman—he came on the 29th of January—we had no other male servant—there are two female servant—on the 15 the of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning I gave the prisoner orders to clean the plate in order that I might put the greater part of it away and said I wished it to be done before it was dark and I think I said before two o'clock he had the care of it, but it was brought up stairs every night—We</p>

               <p>dined at two o'clock that day, and the plate had not come up—I saw it in the dinner-room and told him I was surprised he had not brought it up—I had told him of it between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and at ten o'clock—I mentioned it to him again at tea-time, at servant o'clock and said I was extremely surprised I had had to repeat the order so often—he made no answer—I desired him to bring it up immediately; I was going to put it in the plate-chest—I did not see him any more until I heard the plate was gone—that was about five minutes to eight o'clock the same evening—I heard it through one of the servant-maids, who is here—I saw the prisoner again after hearing this—I passed him on the stairs, as I went down, and asked him whether the silver tea-pot and eream-jug were gone not supposing there had been time for them to go as it was not more than thirty-five minutes after he had taken the tea-things away—he said it was all gone—he asked me if he should go to call the police—(I did not suspect him at all at that time)—I told him to go to the station house—he went out and returned in about two minutes saying there was no po<lb/>liceman there—the station-house is near my mother's in Marylebone-street—I inquired how it was—he said he had found a door leading to the back of the house open—the street-door was shut when I went down—the back-door opens into the yard—there is no outlet from that yard—he said he found that door open, and somebody must have come in that way, and taken the place—I went to look if it was open but it was quite safe, as I had seen it at half-past five o'clock that evening—it was bolted and shut up, and a tell on the window—it is a window-door a double door—I told him I found it as I had seen it at half-past five o'clock—he then was in such a dreadful state of agitation he could scarcely speak at all—but he said it was open—he persisted in that—he said he had found the area-gate open, and a closet under the stairs open—we never had the area-gate open—the key of it was always kept in the sideboard-drawer—that drawer was always kept locked and we kept the key ourselves—the gales was found locked; all the plate was gone—it was kept in a basket, and brought up every night—the basket was also gone—the place consisted of the articles stated in the indictment (<hi rend="italic">enumerating them</hi>)—every evening there are two tea-spoons left out, in order to bring up on the tray at eleven o'clock at night with water but they were also gone—I asked the prisoner where the tea-leaves were—he said they were thrown into a sink in the panty—I and another person looked to see if there were any, but there were none—they could not have passed through the hole of the sink.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of February I went to the premises of the prisoner Bryant, in Charles-palce, Ratoliffe—I have known him, six or seven years—he deals in coke—I asked him if he had bought any sacks of a man called Fish of Gahagan—he said, "No"—I asked if he had bought any of any body else—he said, "No, I have not, Mr. Murray"—I then asked him where the sacks were which he worked with—he said he had got but three, and they were at the was factory—I asked him to go there with me—he said he would go up and put on his boots and go with me—it was about half-past six or a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning—when he went up stairs I heard a scuffling over my lead, and called out to him, "Halloo, Bryant, that won't do"—he then came down stairs with two sacks in his hand, and said then he had got six—I asked him where he got them from—he said he bought them in Rose<lb/>mary-lane, of a man, eight or nine mouths ago, and gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece for than; and that the man kept a green-grocer's shop—I asked him if he had got any more up-stairs—he said, "No"—I then went up-stairs myself and hand one sack lying alongside of his wife, who was lying there very ill, and complained of having three broken ribs—I came down stairs and went into the yard, and in the privy I found one sack with a dog lying on it—I came in and found another in a dark corner of the front room, which I had been in before—I asked him to go with me to the gas factory, which he did—he gets his coke from there—he picked up three sacks there, and gave to me, making eight altogether—I then took him to the station-house—he was taken before the Justice, and remanded till the 15th—he gave the Ma<lb/>gisrtrate a description of the person he said he bought them of, and in conse<lb/>quence of what he said I took Cutlin into custody on the 20th—I brought less out of the cell into Bryant's presence, and said, "Is that the man you bought the sacks of?"—Bryant said, "It is all right; that is the man"—Galdin said, "Certainly, I did sell him four sacks"—Bryant picked out four sock's in Catlin's presence, before the Magistrate—I think what he said was takes down.</p>

               <p>I looked at him, waited a moment, and he said, "That is true"—I went on with the further statement made by Bryant—I turned to him in the same way, and he said, "That is true"—after it had been read, they were asked whether they would sign it, and declined—I did not ask if it was true, but looked at them, and they both said it was true—I forget their words, but they distinctly admitted the truth, saying "It is true," or "That is right," or words to that effect—I will not undertake to say what particular phrase they used I rather think it was confined to one or two words.</p>

On Wednesday, the 13th of January, the prisoner came to my house, complaining of a rheumatic affection in one of her thumbs—I looked, and said I would attend to it—she said she would call in half an hour—soon after she was gone I missed this brass powder-folder—she never came again.</p>

I overtook the prisoner running in Hart-street, Bloomsbury-square, and took him back to Mr. Horne's house—he said, "It was nothing but a lark let me go "—when he got to the house I did not see him produce any thing—he got loose from me at the area steps, and ran violently into the prosecutors's house; and I lost sight of him for a moment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sculptor, and live in Norton-street, Fitzroy-square.

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Rowlett's-buildings, York-street, Westminster. On the night of the 16th of February I was at the Adam and Ere Public-house, in York-street, and saw the two prisoners there—I went from there to the Blue Anchor—when I left there I went in a direction towards my own home—I passed the two prisoners as I came out—there were three together, if not more—it was about twelve or a quarter past twelve o'clock—it might be later—I had got up my own court, about forty or fifty yards from the house—just as I turned up, I heard same people behind, and heard a person say, "There goes the old <hi rend="italic">blank</hi>"—I was turning round to go up the court—I had not gone above a dozen yards up the court, before one or two came up behind me, and caught me fast by the back part of my collar and kicked my heels up, and I felt on my back—I saw both the prisoners, and a third person with them—after I fell I received several blows and kicks from the parties—I caught James's hand in my pocket, and caught it by the wrist—there was one sovereign 2 half sovereigns, and some shillings and sixpences—I had get change at the Bell about nine O'clock—I had to the amount of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. alto<lb/>gether in silver—he got his hand out of the grasp of my hand, and I caught him fast by the leg, and I felt in the meantime the watch pulled out of my pocket—I felt it go—it was fastened by my brace button—I felt it is, I think, James's hand—I cannot be certain it was his—I did not see it—not when I was down—I felt it in one of the prisoner's hands—I endeavoured to recover it—I said as they had had my money, I prayed them not to take my watch—I cannot swear I saw it in the man's hand, but I felt in—I endeavoured to raise myself, and the moment I raised my head, I was struck in the forehead by a kick and a blow, as well from the first—then was an alarm of "Murder", and the police came up—I turned over on my right side when I found them at my watch, and by that means I got the watch out of the prisoner's hand—it was fastened to my brace button—I recovered it in consequence of that—the sovereign and silver were gone—some of the money dropped on the ground when he got his hand out—I am certain some of my money was in his hand at the time I caught hold of it—some of the money had been removed from the bottom of my pocket by the hand before I seized him—that was James's hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a newsvender, and live in Duke-street, Broad<lb/>way, Westminster. I know Foulkes by sight—I should be very sorry to be acquainted with him—I was at the Adam and Eve on Monday night, the 15th of February—I went about eight o'clock, and staid till a quarter to twelve o'clock—Foulkes came in—Norris was there that night—he goes by the nick-name of Billy Button—the prosecutor asked him to toss for a crown—I am positive of that—Norris would not toss with him, as he had got no money—he gave that reason—Foulkes seemed rather out of temper—he called me a b—thief—I had only asked him to keep quiet, as a gentleman was about to sing—Roberts was sitting in the same box with me, and the prosecutor was in the next box—Roberts offered the prosecutor his pint to drink to keep quiet, and he received a blow in the face for it, and he called him a b—counterfeit—on my oath, I saw him strike him—I was elevated in the room, as I was in the chair—Roberts left his seat, but I went in and kept him in the box to prevent a disturbance—the land<lb/>lord came in and ordered Foulkes out—he said, "You must leave my room; it is not to be annoyed by you," and he left the room and got to the bar—there were several persons there—I understood they were about to loss—I did not see any thing of that—it was after the prosecutor had been there some time I left the parlour and went to the bar, and he there chal<lb/>lenged Mr. Cordwent to toss him for a sovereign—he said he would not loss—Foulkes said, "Then I will toss you for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and he put his hand in his pocket to see if he could find money to toss with, he pulled out some silver, and Cordwent declined then to toss—he then said to me (I was next to him). "I will bet you half-a-crown Mr. Cordwent has not 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his possession"—it is a thing I am not in the habit of doing, but I certainly did bet that night—Cordwent was desired to produce 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. If he had it, to get the wager—he did produce more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not get the money—I have not had it at all—the house was at last cleared by the landlord—he was obliged to expel Foulkes from the bar—he ordered him out—when he was going out he said, "Never mind, I will lay wait"—he was drunk, but knew what he was about—I saw him again that night, about one o'clock, with three women—two of them I knew to he had characters, girls of the town, and one I did not know—he said he would give them some gin if the house was open—I came up just at the time he made use of those words.</p>

I will give it you"—I said, "I do not mind," and went with her to the end of Sloane-street—she went up a street, and came out and said that the young woman she was stopping with was not at home; but if I would go to the barracks at Knightsbridge, she would come and call for me—that was about half-past eleven o'clock—about one o'clock I was going out, and met her on Constitution-hill, and she gave me the duplicate, and I sold it to Thomas for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we went and got it out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday evening, the 1st of March, I was on duty in Well-street, Hackney—a little before two o'clock, I beard a noise at the back of the Green Dragon—I went round and found the prisoner Marchmont standing at the prisoner Gregg's back door—I asked what he did there—he said Gregg had given him leave to come in that way, that his mother should not know it—I brought him round to the front door of the house; and he called out to Gregg, who came out—Marchmont said, "Did you not give me leave to come in?"—he said, "Yes, "and I let him go—a little time afterwards, I went and looked into the wash-house, and found the pump gone from Mr. Heeves's which is about two doors from Gregg's; and then I found the pipe gone—it is an empty house—I saw a spade, and brought it out—I went over the next premises, called Mrs. Venables up; and said she had seen the pump and pipe safe the night before—I went, and found the pump close to the fence next to Gregg's premises—I brought it round to the front, and informed my bro<lb/>ther officer what had occurred—he sent me round to the back of the house, and he took Marchmont into custody—we all went to the station-house together—I took off Marchmont's shoes, and they corresponded with the marks in the mould where the pump had been taken from—at daylight we tired it again, and traced several of the same footmarks into Gregg's premises—there were prints of only one person—the pipe was removed from the wash-house, but not off the premises—it was moved out of the wash-house.</p>

On the 31st of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me for a halfpenny print—he gave me a shilling—I noticed the shilling directly he was out of the shop, and found it was bad—I had not missed it with any other—I broke it and put it on one side—on the next Saturday he came again and asked for another halfpenny print—know<lb/>ing him, I asked him for the money before I gave him the print—he put down a shilling—I saw it was bad, and told him so—he went away, leav<lb/>ing the shilling and the print—I described him to Thatcher, and after<lb/>wards saw the prisoner in his custody—I had broken both the shillings.</p>

On the 19th of January the prisoner came to live with me as servant—she left me on the 7th of February, without notice, at about half-past two o'clock—I missed the articles before she left—a little trunk was brought to my door by a person, and I accused her of taking it—she denied it, and left—the piece of silk was in the trunk, and the eye-glass and bracelets—I had seen the trunk about a fortnight or three weeks before—it was kept in a little room, which I used as a sitting-room—she denied having seen the box—she left while I went to get a constable—I found a petticoat-body under her bed—she was apprehended next day, the 8th, at Mrs. Gaymer's, three doors from my own house—I went there and saw her, and said, "You good for nothing girl, to rob me of the petticoat of a lady I wash for; I would not care if you had nothing to eat"—she said, "Oh! forgive me, forgive me"—I sent for a constable, and had her apprehended—the petticoat belonged to Mrs. Cill of Blackheath—I had it to wash.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been three years at Mr. Rolls' next August—I saw the prisoner when he brought the trowsers, about a quarter to ten o'clock on the 11th of February—he said he had brought his master's trow<lb/>sers to be cleaned, and asked when they would be done—I said on Satur<lb/>day; and as soon as they were done we would send them home—he left them—I laid them down behind the counter till a quarter to twelve o'clock, when I entered them in the day-book—I did not feel any thing in the pocket—if there had been the smallest thing possible in the fob I must have felt it—I am positive there was no lump at all—the prisoner said nothing to me about a lump—the trowsers were rolled up when he brought them; but I opened them when I entered them in the day-book—I threw them open on the counter—the flap came completely open—I saw all the pockets and the fob, and am certain there was nothing in them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk printer, and live at Merton, in Surrey. On Friday morning, the 29th of January, we missed these things—they had been put in the drying-room on the 28th of January, in the evening—we lost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pieces of silk out of the drying-room, which is up<lb/>stairs—Mr. Nicholson's premises are adjacent to ours—I never saw the prisoner before—I have heard him spoken of—he was in bed in his own house when I first saw him on Monday night when he was apprehended—we have quite lost the silk—there is a wall between Mr. Nicholson's pre<lb/>mises and ours, and some wooden palings—I observed some footsteps in Mr. Nicholson's premises, leading to my parents—the right foot mark had two nails in the heel, and twelve nails on the side; and on the left foot were three nails in the heel, and twelve nails on the side; and on the tip bad—the party had got in at one window and out at another—and the first footmark I saw was the right foot under the window—they had got up on a lean-to, and got in—we could perfectly trace foot-marks up to the lean-to, and per<lb/>fectly where they got out—there was the mark of only one person's feet—the shoes taken from the prisoner were the shoes he had on, on the night he was taken—I helped to take them off on the Tuesday morning—I could swear that these shoes were the shoes that made the marks—the nails tal<lb/>lied in all respects—the retreat which was traced in the footsteps went from the window he got out at as well—they got to the summer-house in Mr. Nicholson's garden—but they were not traced all the way.</p>

               <p>the factory—I examined it, and saw the place where a person had got out of window—it was two stories high—he must have been a tall person, or he could not have rested his foot—he had hung by his hand, and then fell down on his side—I saw a foot-mark, which I traced up a gravel walk, then to a summer-house, and then, I dare say, for a mile further, to the prisoner's house—it was a foot-mark as complete as possible—I then went back to the factory, and had some conversation with Mr. Nicholson, and from in<lb/>formation I took the prisoner on Monday evening—we had been three times, but could not find him—we went again between ten and eleven o'clock—we knocked, but could get no answer—at last be hallooed out, "Who is there?"—we said, "Open the door, "but he would not—he laid still—we knocked again—he did not answer—he then said, "Who is there?"—Mr. Reynolds said in a feigned voice, "<hi rend="italic">Jack in the Green"</hi>—he then jumped up and opened the door—we took him to the watch-house that night—he had put his shoes on, and the next morning I took the shoes and traced them along to fifty places in the marks—they tallied in all respects—in the summer-house where they had rested, there appeared some shreddings of the silk and shavings—I went into the room he had taken them from, and there was the same—on the prisoner's trowsers was the dry dirt, just where he had tumbled—these are the shoes—the left shoe has three nails in the heel, and the right two—I counted all the nails, and I found them tally—on one tip you will find a little bit deficient, and I traced that very mark to within 200 yards of the prisoner's dwelling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did these two nails in the other heel tally exactly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they did—on taking the prisoner to Horsemonger-lane, Mr. Rey<lb/>nold's said, "I would not have cared if I had got my silk back again, as they are all new patterns"—the prisoner said, "You have not gone the right way to get them"—the prisoner's family has been in distress a long while. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How high was the window at which the thieves got in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think fifteen or sixteen feet, and the lean too nearly reached up to the window—he got up on a gate first—he got out from another window, four or five windows off—he had got on the top of the next window below, and then jumped, I should say, ten or twelve feet—he came on his feet, and then fell on his side—I looked at the shoes while he had them on—I looked at the soles and nails—I saw the tips first—I was in the room while he was dressing that night—I told the Magistrates what he said to Mr. Reynolds about his not going the right away to work—these are shoes generally worn by labourers, but they are not all nailed the same—the prisoner lives more than a mile from the prosecutor—nearer the church—at about 100 yards from his house we get to the fields, and then there is a bye-road to Mr. Reynolds'—I know Underwood—he gave the information—it was very rainy the first part of the night, but it held up afterwards—Underwood is in Horsemonger-lane for stealing or receiving cloth.</p>

               <p>of the Crown Inn, Dulwich, between seven and eight o'clock—I saw several persons there, and among them the prisoner at the bar—when I went in, he was sitting down—he had a gun with him—I saw him get up, and take the gun with him to another part of the room, and do something with it—I saw him take something out of a bag with the bowl of a to<lb/>bacco-pipe, and put it into the gun—he then put something into the pan of the gun; and when he had done, he sat down again—when he put something in the gun, I heard it make a grating noise, as I conceived, against the tobacco-pipe—I did not notice that it made any noise in the gun—some one said, "Are you going a-poaching?" or something like that—he said, "A man has shot a man, and I am going to shoot a man."</p>
