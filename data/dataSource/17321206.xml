               <p>B. Townsend. I was not at home when the Goods were lost; but hearing of it afterwards, an Advertisement was put in the Papers, by which means, I was informed that the Prisoner lodg'd at Mrs. Howard's, a Coffee-House, in Bell-Savage Yard. I went thither on the 11th of November, and found the Prisoner. I ask'd her, If she was not at my Shop about a Week before to buy Half a Yard of Muslin? She said, Yes. And did you not, says I, take away a Manteel, and a Piece of Velvet? She answered, Yes; and she said, she had made the Velvet into a Hood.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Townsend's Shop when the Prisoner came in. It was the 3d of November, in the Evening. She ask'd to see some Muslin; I order'd Candles to be brought, and then shew'd her some. She wanted Half a Yard, and whilst we were disputing about the Price, another Customer came in, and while I turn'd my back to serve her, I suppose the Prisoner took away the Goods: For the Manteel with a Bill of Parcels pinn'd up in it, lay ready for a Gentleman who had bespoke it, and a Person coming to fetch it, in about Half an Hour after the Prisoner was gone, I miss'd both that, and a Piece of Velvet of about a Yard with a Slope on it. I suspected she had taken it, and told Mr. Townsend so when he came in. I saw her no more till Nov. 11. when she was taken at Mrs. Howard's. She readily confess'd that she took the Manteel and the Piece of Velvet out of the Shop; that she tore the Slope of the Piece of Velvet, and made it into a Hood, and that she burnt the Bill of Parcels.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know what I confess'd; they came on me by Surprize. I own I had the Goods, but they were sent me from the Bath. Are you sure it was I that came to cheapen Muslin?</p>
               <p>M. Nicholas. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Cloaths had I on?</p>

            . I am Nurse at St. James's Work-house. The Deceas'd was brought in near the Evening; I put him to Bed, and ask'd how he came by that Misfortune? He said, by playing the Rogue with a Man about a Piece of Bread and Butter. That he fell back, and coming forward again, the Prisoner stab'd him in the Belly. He died about 8 in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had half spread my Roll, and laid it down: The Deceas'd snatch'd it away; I went to save it, and said, pray let's have it, for I am very hungry. No you sha'n't, says he, and then he punch'd and push'd me about, and some how in struggling, while my Knife was in my Hand, he run against it, and then beat me about. So and please your Worship, Master, if so be he had given me my Bread and Butter there had been no Harm done.</p>
               <p>Will. Percival, again. I was in the Shop when it begun. The Deceas'd was near the Prisoner while he was spreading the Butter, and the Prisoner run his Knife at him. There was no struggling till then, nor any Words. The Deceas'd laid no Hands on him before the Stab was given.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not the Prisoner endeavour to save his Bread and Butter?</p>
               <p>Percival. No, for the Deceased came behind him and took it away.</p>
               <p>A Butcher. I have known the Prisoner several Years. He is a poor foolish Fellow, and all the Boys in the Market used to make Game of him, and play Tricks with him; I have seen 'em black his Face, and carry him about in a Basket, and then throw him out into a Kennel to wash him; but I never saw him provoked or fall in a Passion at such Usage; so far from it, that when he has got from them he would run into a Corner and laugh at them. He had always a very honest Character, and has often been trusted by me and several others in the Market. I never observ'd any thing like a spiteful revengful Temper in him, let what wou'd be done to him. The Deceased was as vile a Lad as any about the Market; he was so idle, that he sold his Knot and Basket because he would not work, and used to loiter about and sleep upon Bulks.</p>
               <p>Several other Butchers belonging to the Market gave the like Account of the Prisoner. The Jury <rs id="t17321206-5-verdict24" type="verdictDescription">

            . I look after the Dog-house Bar. About six at Night the Prisoner came into the House, and desired me to let him warm himself by the Fire, for he said he had been with a Cart to Edmonton, and was very cold. He beg'd an old Pair of Shoes, upon which, I took Notice that those he had on were very bad; but I did not give him any. He staid till eight o'Clock, and then went away, and I shut up the Door as usual, and went to Supper at the Green Man on Windmill-Hill, and after Supper I returned to the House at the Bar, and went to Bed: Next Morning the Taylor came to mend my Breeches, which I had left in my Room overnight before I went to Supper, and there was two gold Rings, a Guinea and a half, and 2s. and 6d. in a brass Box in the Side-Pocket. I look'd for my Breeches but could not find 'em, and at the same Time I mist my Hat and my Shoes. Searching farther I found the Prisoner's old Shoes, which were tied with Packthread, at the Door, and the Cellar Door was split in two. The Shoes made me suspect the Prisoner. Next Week I met with him. He confess'd that he broke the Cellar-Door with a great Stone, and then thrust the wooden Bolt back, and got and took the Goods; that he had pawn'd the Hat in Golden-lane for 6d. and the Breeches in Turnbull-Street for a 1s. He went with me to those<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060005"/> Places, and found them there. He had my Shoes upon his Feet.</p>
               <p>- Thompson. I took the Prisoner in Coleman-street. I knew him before, and had heard there was a Warrant out against him. He had pilfer'd some Things while he had work'd with me there. I tax'd him with robbing Mr. Sims. He at first denied it, but afterwards own'd that he broke the Cellar-door open with a Stone, and had pawn'd the Hat and Breeches, but said he was drunk when he did it.</p>

I had been gone from thence about half a Year, when having Occasion for some of my Things, I went thither to fetch 'em. Mrs. Pearson went up with me. I found my Box corded and lock'd as I left it, but as soon as I open'd it I miss'd my Goods. Madam, says I, somebody has robb'd me. She seem'd as much surpriz'd as I was my self. The Prisoner had been her Servant, but was then gone away, and was taken up for another Fact: This gave us Occasion to suspect her. We found her at Hicks's-Hall. She confess'd to me that she had lifted up the Lid of the Box without unlocking it, and drawn the Cloaths out and carried them to pawn, at three several Times, to Mr. Hamlin's a Pawn-broker in Drury-lane. She cry'd, and begg'd me not to hang her. We went to the Pawn-broker's, who used us very ill, and told us we should have nothing but what the Law allowed us.</p>

When Mrs. Peers mist her Goods, I said to her, I am afraid this Wench has robb'd you. We saw her at Hicks's-Hall, and taking her aside, charg'd her with this Fact. She cry'd, and readily owned it, and said, she hop'd I would be favourable to her, for she had not broke any Lock, but lifted up the Lid of the Box and drawn the Things out, and that she had pawn'd them in Drury-lane. We went to the Pawn-brokers; he deny'd them at first, and would not deliver them till we brought her to him from Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Court. What are these Goods worth?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Peers. About 10l.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she say she took them all at once?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pearson. She said she carried them out of my House at three Times, and so carried them to pawn. She went from me September 12.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They promised me to be merciful if I would confess.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you say to that?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pearson. Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you did Wrong. You ought not by Promise of Favour to draw Persons into Confession, and then make use of those Confessions to take away their Lives. When Confessions are obtained in such a Manner, they ought to have but little Weight with the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pearson, We have no Desire to take away her Life.</p>
               <p>Court. It may be so. But if the Jury should find that she took the Value of 40s. at any one time, she will be capitally convicted.</p>

               <p>Court. It looks very ill in a Pawn-broker to receive such valuable Goods of such a Person as the Prisoner, without examining how she came by them. By her Appearance he could not imagine her to be the Owner of them. These People know if they bought Goods under such suspicious Circumstances at an under Rate, they would be liable to be prosecuted as Receivers of stolen Goods, and they think to evade the Law by lending a Trifle upon 'em to Persons who they are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060007"/> pretty sure will never come to redeem them. I doubt not but in these Cases they know too well that the Goods are stolen, and I hope, in time, it will be equally punished. This Man's denying the Goods, when Persons of Credit came to demand them, has a very knavish Appearance.

               <p>Drew Drury. I employ'd the Prisoner to polish Silver for me. I had lost a great deal of Silver for above a Year past. 'Tis my Method to weigh my Silver up every Saturday Night, and enter the Quantity in a Book, and I have constantly miss'd every Week, for a considerable Time, 40, 50, or 60 Shillings worth. The Prisoner used to come to my Shop in a Morning before I was up, to see for Work; I order'd my Boys to watch him, and next Morning they told me, they saw him go to a Basket, where I put a pretty deal of Silver, and tumble it over, and then put his Hand in his Pocket 2 or 3 times. I ask'd them, Why they did not stop him and call me? They said, they were afraid. Upon this I was resolved to watch him my self. And so on Saturday Morning, Nov. 4 says I to my Boys, I'll hide my self in the Closet (for I have a Closet with a Window that looks into the Shop) and don't you be mealy mouth'd now, because you know that I am so near you, but when he comes, play your Rogues Tricks, and run about as you do when I am a Bed, that he may suspect nothing, and have an opportunity of going to the Basket. I went to my Post, the Prisoner came in, and my Boys began to play their Tricks with him, and by and by one of them run out, and the other after him. The Prisoner upon this stept to the Basket, took something out, put it in his Pocket, and follow'd them immediately. As soon as they came in again, says he, my Master will hardly came down till 9 a-Clock, I'll e'en go, and come again, but the Boys persuaded him to go into the Kitchen, and sit down by the Fire. I left the Closet, went up Stairs, and came down again as if I was but just come out of my Chamber. The Prisoner ask'd me, if I had any work for him? I told him, No. I let him go out a little way, and then call'd him back. Robin, says I, 'tis Saturday, and as I have no more work for you this Week, I may as well settle Accounts, and pay you for what you have done. I sent one of my Boys for a Constable, under pretence of getting change for a Guinea. When the Constable came, I charg'd the Prisoner. He deny'd the Fact, and said, I might search him and welcome. He took his Handkerchief out of his Pocket, and held it in his Hand. I could find nothing. Sure, says I, my Eyes did not deceive me. When presently my Boys told me, they saw the Silver in his Hand. Upon which the Prisoner took it out of his Handkerchief himself, and gave it to me, and said, This is the Bit. He begg'd that I would not prosecute him, and promis'd that he would never do so any more. [ This Deposition was by the two Boys.]</p>

               <p>Pris. And had you any reason to suspect me before?</p>

               <p>C. Yes, and a good one too.</p>
               <p>P. Another Man having sent for me to work for him, I was speaking of it in my Master's Shop, and thereupon, I believe he laid this Trap for me, for he's a Man of that good Principle, that he would let no Body live but himself. He has trusted me with a great many Ounces of Silver.</p>
               <p>C. Without Weight or Tale?</p>
               <p>Mr. Drury. No.</p>
               <p>C. Then you were accountable for it.</p>
               <p>P. I don't know how it came into my Hankercher; 'tis a Plot; 'tis common to lose 40 or 50 s. a Week, and sometimes my Master has had more Silver than he should have.</p>

            , Watchman. I beat my Round at 12 a-Clock, and found all safe at the Prosecutor's House, and then I return'd to my Stand, and as I was talking there with my Comrade, a Fellow came up, and ask'd me to let him have a bit of Candle for a Half-penny? What to do? says I. To light me home, says he. So I let him have a bit; but knowing him to be a loose Chap, and where he liv'd, I watch'd him, and saw he went the contrary way. Thinks I, here's some Roguery in hand, so I and my brother Watchman follow'd him at a Distance. He turn'd down Castle-Yard. I left my brother Watchman at the End of the Yard to secure the Passage, and went down softly after the Man. I saw the Casement of the Prosecutor's Kitchen-window unhung, and presently the Prisoner, and the other Man, came out of the Street-door with the Candle in his Hand. You Rogue you, says I, did I lend you the Candle to do this? With that he flung the Candle in my Face, and run to the Gate. The Prisoner had this Stew-pan, and this Plate ty'd before him thus, in this Wrapper. I seiz'd him, we struggled, and the other Rogue return'd, and they both beat me, and then they both run away. I follow'd 'em, and saw the Prisoner turn down Woolpack-Alley, and the other down Angel-Alley, which was a Thorow-fare, and so is Woolpack-Alley in the Day time; but I had lock'd up the Door at Night, so that I knew the Prisoner could not get through. I call'd for help, and we follow'd him. There's a Parcel of old ruined Houses and Rubbish in that Alley, where I suppose he hid himself, for we could not find him. But we set a Watch against the End of the Alley, and in about half an Hour he came out, and turn'd towards Aldgate. Says my Master, There's a Man come out, is that he ? Yes, says I, this is the very Man that came out of the House with the Stew-pan before him.</p>

            , Constable. Hearing that the Prisoner was run down Woollpack-Alley, I set a Watch at the End, and went to see the House in Castle-Alley which was broke open. When I came back, one said to Owen ; There's a Man come out, is that he? Yes, by G - d, says he, that's the Man!</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not near the Place when the House was broke open, but I had been at t'other End of the Town, and in my Way home thought to go thro' Woollpack-Alley, but finding the Door lock'd, I turn'd back, when a Watchman cry'd, Who goes there? I said, a Friend: Says the Watchman, Here he is, Who do you mean? says I. Is this the Man? Says another. I believe so, says Owen, and with that they carried me to the Watch-house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060009"/> The Constable examin'd what I was, and where I lived. I told him I lived with my Father, a Reed-maker, and if they would send for him he would satisfy them. The Constable was about to do so, but somebody said I was try'd here two Sessions ago for stealing a Watch*, and upon that he would not take my Father's Word for my Appearance.</p>

            . I live in Corbet-Court, Spittle-Fields. I work at Mr. James's at the Double Chair on Tower-Hill, and in my way home I saw a Crowd about the Watch-house, and went in. The Prisoner being then in Custody, the Constable asked Owen, if he was positive that the Prisoner was the Man that he first laid hold on? And, says Owen, I can't swear it, but I believe him to be the Man. Then the Constable proffered to take the Prisoner's Father's Word for his Appearance, but somebody saying that the Prisoner had been tryed for stealing a Watch, would not take such Security,</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My acquaintance with her begun by our coming both in one Ship from Scotland. She told me, she was acquainted with great Men, and could do me Service, and expected I should do her some in return. She said, she ow'd a pretty deal of Money, and knew a way to pay off all her Creditors, which was to leave Goods with me, and pretending she was gone to Scotland, would send them word, that she had left such and such Goods, which if they would take in full for what she ow'd them, and give me a Discharge they might, otherwise they might get their Money how they could. Thus she sent me to Mr. Hayward, a Wine Merchant, with 15l. tho' she ow'd him 70l. He thinking that she was gone to Scotland, and left me to act for her, took the 15 l. in full for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060011"/> the 70. So she compounded with Mrs. Avery, to whom she ow'd 20 l. for less than half the Money. It was upon this Account that she desir'd me to lye in her Room, and if any of her Creditors enquired for her, to tell them, she was gone to Scotland, tho' it was all a Trick. Before she left me, I told her, I had no Money for Necessaries. She said, I need not want, there were Goods enough in her Closet that I might dispose of upon Occasion, for I had her Keys.</p>
               <p>F. Naw Sir I last my Keys in my Drawers.</p>
               <p>P. She trusted the Keys and Goods too, to my Care, for she and I were very familiar, I have lain with her many a Time.</p>
               <p>F. Upon my Oath he never did, why, does your Loardship think I was lye with such a Jackanapes as he is? The Goods I trusted him to give to Mr. Hayward and the Brewer, was before I went out of Town.</p>
               <p>P. Here's Mr. Grub, the Pawnbroker, will give an Account of her.</p>
               <p>Grub. I know this Woman by the Name of Hamilton. A Piece of these Goods was pledg'd with me. I have dealt with her several Times. She has a very indifferent Character. She would cheat or defraud any Body. She brought me false Plate for good, and I lent her 20 l. upon it.</p>
               <p>F. I own I did; but you know it was my Lady Cassells, and it is in her Dining-room now; I was deceiv'd in it, and so was you.</p>

I went into the Parlour, and saw the Walnut-tree of my Scritore was broke, but the Lock had not been open'd. My Sister said she heard a cracking Noise in the Night, and cry'd out, Who's there? My Wife had left her Lace in a Band-box, and her Velvet Hood and Manteel in the Parlour over-night, and they were carried off. The Shutter of the Kitchen-Window had been taken down and set aside, and the Casement left open. A Gentleman hearing of the Robbery, asked me what I had lost? I told him; he bid me be easy, for the Thief was taken, and all the Goods upon him. By his Directions I went to Justice Newton, and told him the Particulars. The Prisoner had been examined before I came, and was gone to a Publick-House just by. The Justice had given Orders for the Goods to be advertised. As soon as I saw the Things I knew them, and own'd them to be mine. I went to the Prisoner at the Ale-house, and found my Hat upon his Head. I took it off, and said, Friend, how came you by this? He said he had it among the rest of the Things that were given him by a Man that he met in the Hay-Market against the Opera-House.</p>
               <p>- Garbet. (The Prosecutor's Servant) I was last up but one; I went to Bed between 10 and 11, and all the Doors were safe then. I came down about 7 in the Morning, and found the Shutter of the Kitchen Window was taken off the Hinges, and set aside, and the Casement ('tis a Sash Casement) stood open. I mist several things before my Master came down.</p>

What will you give? says I, why 6 d. says she. I told her I would go for a Shilling; and so we agreed. I went with her, and when we came to the End of Pall-Mall, she said she knew where she was, and would not trouble me to go any farther. As I went back, I met a young Man over against the Opera-House. I gave him a little Shove as I past. What's that for? says he. No offence, I hope, says I. Who's that,

            . My Husband had a poor Brother come to see him out of Northamptonshire, and he was to go out of Town that Morning, and I being dubitons that my Husband should give some of his Money to this poor Brother, I hided the Purse with 90 Guineas in it under my Child's Bed, in the Room next to the Prisoner's. I heard them walking about the Room at the same time, and I suppose they might see what I was doing through the Slit in the Wainscot: Then I lock'd the Door and went down Stairs, and my Husband and his Brother went out together. By and by, one came in for a Hat and Waistcoat that were left in that Room, and I sent my Boy up for it; and when he came down again, he told me that they came into the Room while he was there, and took something from under the Bed.</p>
               <p>W. M. Prisoner. Was no Body else in the House then ?</p>
               <p>Ann Green. No.</p>
               <p>W. M. P. There was a Soldier. I hope the Court will enquire into your Character.</p>
               <p>Ann Green. You have got Moll Harvey of your side, so you need not care.</p>
               <p>Thomas Green. (Aged 16) when I went up for the Hat and Waistcoat, she came into my Room with a Bundle, and says, Tom, take care of this; and then he comes in and says, Give me the Bundle; so he took it away, and came in again, and went to my Bed, and said, this is a pretty Feather-bed. Then he turned it up, and felt under it, and took something out; but I did not think it was Money, for I knew nothing of any Money being there. Then they both went away directly, and bid me tell my Mother they would certainly come at Night. There was no Body else in the Room but these two end my self.</p>

M. from the White Horse in Blackman-street, to Islington Turnpike, and there he put his Head out of the Coach, and ordered me to drive to the Black Horse in the Hay-Market. When he came there, he got out of the Coach, and went into Moll Harvey's, and said he had lost 68 Guineas and a Watch there, and he would have 'em again. Moll desired him to be easy and quiet, and said he should have his Watch: He swore he would have his Money too, or he would go to Justice De Veil and get a Warrant; and then he ordered me to drive to Justice De Veil's. But Moll Harvey going out, and a Woman saying she was gone to Justice De Veil's, and would be there before him, he then ordered me to drive to Justice Lambert's. It was the same Day that he was taken up. Justice Lambert called for me in, asked where I took him up ; I told him, and then I was ordered to withdraw.</p>

I went and found Mr. Green and the Prisoner Murphey there. He charged her with robbing him. How can you say so? says she, I never wrong'd Man, Woman, nor Child; and if I have any Gold about me it is yours. We searched her, and found 7 Guineas, 5 s. and 6 d. and a Gold Ring in a Housewife in her Pocket: So she was sent to New-Prison. The Man of the Alehouse came to me again about 10 at Night, and said there was a Man at his House who enquired for Mrs. Macloughlane, and he suspected him to be concerned in the same Robbery.

I went in, and spoke to him in the Irish Brogue (for I had been a Soldier in Ireland). I ask'd him how he did, where he came from? He answered me in Irish, and said, he came from the North of Ireland, near Dundee. Sure I should know you, says I: What is your Name? My Name, says he, is Will. Maclonghlane. I asked him how long he had been in England? He said he had not been long come from of France. Parlezvous Francois, says I. Ouy Monsieur, says he. I found he could speak so much French as I.</p>

I went in, and found the Window of my Warehouse (which is on a Ground Floor) open, I knock'd at the Door, look'd in at the Window, and saw a parcel of Goods piled up ready to be carried off. Looking farther, I saw the Prisoner in the Room, there is a Lamp faces the Window, I am sure it was he. As soon as he found I saw him, he said, Damn ye, if ye don't desist and go off, I'll shoot ye. He stept up to the Window, in order to get out, I laid hold of him there, and pulled him down; he gave a spring to get from me, but I held him fast; and after a small Struggle on the Ground, he surrender'd, and begged me to let him go. I cr'ed out Thieves; my Wife and Maid came to the Door, and the Neighbours came to my Assistance. One of them went for a Constable, and I did not let the Prisoner go till the Constable came; and yet when he was carried before Sir

               <p>Court. Was your Window shut after it was dark ?</p>
               <p>Fry. My Wife and Maid will give an Account of that, for I went out at Exchange Time, and did not return till about 7. I had Shutters belonging to that Window, but my Wife having lately lain in, her Maid going away that Evening, and a new Maid coming, the Shutters were left unshut till I came; none of my Goods were carried off, but were only moved from the Shelves to the Window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you no Servants that might mislay these Goods. Fry. I left the Key with my Wife. Prisoner. Did any Body but your selfsee when you laid hold on me first? Fry. No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fry. My Spouse knocked and cried Thieves. I was frighted, and came down, and when I opened the Door, he had the Prisoner by the Collar; he begg'd my Husband to let him go, or to go with him to a Tavern, for he said he had taken nothing. I saw the Casement shut half an hour past 6, when I came down to let my new Maid in. The Key of the Warehouse was left with me, I left the Goods in their proper Place on the Shelves at half an Hour past 4 that same afternoon; I double lock'd the Door, and it was not open'd again till after the Prisoner was taken, and then I went in, and found several Parcels remov'd from the Shelves to the Window, ready to be carried away. The Window Board was made like a Table, to turn up and down for shewing Goods; there was 5 Sagathys of 30 Yards each, 4 Serges, 4 Duroys, of 24 Yards each, and 1 Kersey, besides another Kersey that lay upon the Ground, which I suppose the Prisoner dropt upon his being surpriz'd.</p>

My Mistress let me in, and I went directly up Stairs, and look'd at the Clock, and it was half an Hour past 6; before it struck 7, my Master knock'd, and cried Thieves! My Mistress and I went down, and saw my Master have the Prisoner by the Collar. The Casement was open, and a Pane of Glass taken out of it near the Hasp; so that a Man might put his Hand through and unhasp it, and each Side of the Window was likewise broke. There were Lights brought into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060019"/> Court; I saw the Prisoner plainly, and am positive he's the Man, for my Master held him, I believe, one fourth of an Hour, till the Constable came, and I stay'd all the while; I would not swear it if I was not certain, for this is the first Oath I ever took.</p>

               <p>Lane. A darkish Coat with a Boot Sleeve, but no great Coat; and you had, I think, a darkish Wig.</p>
               <p>Pris. The Maid says it was a light Wig.</p>

And Mr. Fry said, I don't know what Damage is done yet, because I don't know what is missing, but the Windows are broke.

               <p>Gale. Freeman met me, and said, Mrs. Gale, I have a Judge's Warrant. Where is your Tip-staff, says I, to serve it? I have none, says he. Where's your Constable then? says I. Why, says he, I am one; and with that he pull'd out a Constable's Staff. You a Constable! says I, how came they to make a Foot Soldier a Constable? so went in to drink at Mrs. Jones's, and had a Quartern of Liquor; and he was so far from losing 15 s. that he had not enough to pay the Reckoning; for when Mrs. Jones asked him for the Money, he said he could not pay till his Wife came, and she afterwards paid for it. He took me into a Tipstaff's House, and he and his Wife-tore my Gown off my Back, and tumbled me in the Dirt ; and he did not charge me with the Robbery till 5 Days after I was committed.</p>
               <p>Then the Copy of the Warrant for her Commitment was read. It was for an Assault, without any mention of a Felony, and dated November 6.</p>
               <p>Freeman. I was robb'd on the second of November, and changed her on the third.</p>
               <p>Court. It's a little strange, that you who was robb'd on the second, and got a Warrant on the sixth, should say nothing then of this Robbery, but only charge her with an Assault.</p>

            . I was at the Castle Alehouse in Sheer Lane, when Freeman brought in Gale, and several more of these Women came with them. There was a great Disturbance and Confusion. I understood he had first carried her to Mr. Davis's, who would not take Charge of her, because she was not brought by a proper Officer. Freeman said he had a Judge's Warrant against her for an Assault, but I heard him make no mention of a Robbery. And he having no Authority to detain her, she made her Escape by the help of the Woman who came with her.

But coming back by the End of Sheer-Lane, his Wife called to him, and said, Freeman, here the Bitch is. He came up, and damn you, you Bitch, says he, I have catch'd you now. He had but 15 d. when he went out, and he spent 4 d. at the White-Lion in the Old-Bailey; and when we came to Gale's Sister's, his Wife paid 2s. of the Reckoning, because he had not enough to pay the Whole. And as he was going home, I ask'd his Wife if he had lost 15 s. Damn him, a Son of a Bitch, says she, who would trust him with 15 s. to get drunk with?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wattle. I keep a Coffee-house in Ship-yard by Temple Bar. I was above Stairs when Gale came running up, and shut me in, and cry'd, for God-sake hide me. I was frighted. The Constable, and Freeman and his Wife followed. I ask'd 'em what was the Matter, and if she had robb'd 'em? and Mrs. Freeman said no.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner had bought 17 large Glass Bottles of an old Man that cries old Rags and broken Glass ; and afterwards coming to Williamson's House, (in the Neighbourhood) and seeing some such Bottles there, he ask'd Williamson's Brother, for Williamson himself was blind, if he had not lost some such Bottles; for, says he, I have bought several of the like sort of an old Bottleman, and if you'll come to my Shop you shall see them, and if they belong to your Brother, I'll stop the old Fellow next time I see him. Williamson upon this (having lost several Goods) got a Search Warrant, and his Brother, with a Constable, went to the Prisoner's House, where they found some of those Bottles; and thereupon apprehended the Prisoner for Felony and Burglary. A great Number of Witnesses were sworn in the Prisoner's Behalf, by whose Evidence it appeared that he was a Person of good Credit and a fair Character.

That accordingly Holms led him to a Place call'd Upper-Morefields, near the Booth, or the Wooden-house ; that then the Defendant told Holms, that he need not go any farther, for he then knew where he was, and offer'd Holms a Penny, which he refus'd; that then he offer'd him 2 d. which he likewise refused. That Holms gave a Whistle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060025"/> and out came a Man unknown to him and clapp'd a Pistol to his Breast; that Holms rifled his Pocket, and took out 5 s. and 9 d. in Money, and a Silver Buckle out of his Shoe.</p>

That Holms offer'd to show him the way, and took him up and down several Streets, which he did not know the Names of, till he brought him to Upper-Morefields. That when they came there, he offer'd Holms a penny for his Trouble, which he refused. He then offer'd him Two-pence, and Holms also refused that, and after some Dispute, a little Man came up, and clapp'd a Pistol to his Breast, and Holms rifled his Pockets, and took 5 s. 0 d. out, and then took one of his Buckles. That he the Defendant said to Holms, they are not Silver, don't take them; but that Holms swore they were Silver, and he would have them, but Company coming up he got but one. The Defendant was ask'd, how he could be sure that Holms was the Person? and he said, he knew him by the Lights in coming along, and that he had reason to know his Guide. Then he brought Persons to swear what he said when he came home.</p>

               <p>P. Sen. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>P. Jun. I did. For Holms, who is now dead, was my Father's Servant, and being in some Trouble on this Account, he sent for my Father, and we went with him before Justice Garret. He was taken up the Day after the Robbery was said to be done.</p>

And says he, To see for you; Mr. King has got a Shoulder of Mutton, desires you and I, and my Wife and Sister, to come to Supper with him to Night. I did not much care for going, and so I went on towards Holm's-House, which is in Old-Bedlam-Court, and he turned back and went with me. When he came home, he said to his Wife, Sarah ! come prithee get ready, Mr. King's Supper waits. Says she, Won't my Father go? Will, says I, to oblige you I will, and so he and I went before, about 8, and his Wife and Sister came after. We stay'd there with him till 11.</p>

               <p>Towers. That I am. I went home with him when the Company broke up. His Sister took hold of his Arm, and his Wife of mine. I saw him partly undrest, in order to go to Bed before I left him, and then it was half an Hour past a 11. Next Day, being the 20th of July, after I had done work, I went to drink a Pint of Beer at an Alehouse in Houndsditch. A Messenger came there, and told me, that my Son Holms was got into Trouble, and was at the Flying-Horse in Morefields. I wonder'd to hear it, because I knew he was not Quarrelsome; so I went thither, and found him sitting in a Box. What's the Matter? says I. Why, says he, Here's a Villain accuses me of Robbing him last Night. Robbing him? says I. Yes, says Holms, and has put a Buckle into my Pocket. Well, says I, we can prove where you was last Night. I'll go and fetch some of the People that were with us. I went out and met Mr. Plimpton and his Son.</p>

His Master desir'd they might go before a Justice; I think 't was Justice Chamberlain's we went to; but he was not at home, and going from his Door the Constable and Holms cross'd Spittle-Yard in order to go to Justice Garret's, when I observ'd the Defendant, who was behind them, turn'd towards Bishopsgate-street, as if he was going off. I can't swear that that was his Design; but I believe he was sorry for what he had done, and was afraid to proceed. But I went behind him, and then he followed them ; and I desired the Constable to take Care of him. The Defendant finding such a favourable Reception at Justice Garret's, he swore the Robbery, or else I believe he would not have had the Impudence to have done it.</p>

            . I was drinking at Mr. Hoare's (the Constable's) at the Flying-horse in Moorfields. The Defendant came and told Mr. Hoare that he had seen a Man at the wrestling Ring who had robb'd him the Night before. Mr. Hoare call'd me to assist him. We went out together, and the Defendant told us we should find the Goods upon the Man, and desired us to stand off a little, while he went to the Ring and look'd for the Man. We staid about a quarter of an Hour, and Mr. Hoare being tired with waiting, sent me to see for the Defendant. The Defendant seeing me coming towards him, came and met me, and said, stay a little, the Man is there, and I see the Buckle upon him. I went back to Mr. Hoare, and presently the Defendant called us, and going up to Holms, he tapt him on the Shoulder, and said, This is the Man. We went to the King's Head Tavern, and the Defendant bid me search Holms. I search'd his left Coat Pocket, and found nothing; but the Constable searching the other, pull'd out a Buckle: The Defendant presently cry'd, that's my Buckle, and here's the Fellow to it: With that Holms said, then somebody put it in. We went to one Justice, but he was not at home, and so went again to Mr. Hoare's House, and he charg'd another Man to take care of Holms. So that I being no farther concerned, did not know when they went before the Justice again. By the Defendant's saying he saw the Buckle upon him, I thought it had been a Girdle-Buckle, till I saw it was a Shoe-Buckle.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see nothing else taken out of Holms's Pocket? Yates. Nothing, except it was 2 or 3 Goosberries. Dif. Did I ever tell you that I saw the Buckle upon him? Yates. Yes, those were your very Words. Def. I had no Discourse with you alone.</p>

            . I was coming over Moorfields the 19th of July at Night, and about the Middle of the Tenter-ground, I saw the Prisoner standing stock still, and 2 Gentlemen coming by, he ask'd them what was o'Clock; they answer'd him roughly ; and I coming up, told him it had just struck 10. He said he did not want to know, but only asked for his Fancy. Then he and I walking one Way, he told me he had been robb'd; and coming</p>

I was afraid he intended to charge me with the Robbery: But however I went in with him. He ask'd me my Name, and where I liv'd. I told him, and he set it down. Then he ask'd if I'd drink a Dram. I said yes. We had a Quartern, and he put his Hand in his Fob and took out half a Crown and some Shillings and Half-pence, and paid the Reckoning. I was in a sort of a Wonder how that Money escaped; but he said his Breeches buttoir'd tight, so that the Man who robb'd him could not find it.</p>

               <p>Quarrel. I am not so good a Judge of that as your Lordship.</p>

               <p>Def. Did not you say in Moorfields, that a Fellow rushed after you, and whistled, and that you suspected somebody had been robb'd?</p>
               <p>Quarrel. No. Def. You knew me first when we met. Quar. I never knew you, till I came to your Lodging.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he been at your House with two Women?</p>
               <p>Quar. Yes, a few Days before.</p>

               <p>Court. The Court cannot read it; such Certificates may be procured in a very odd manner.</p>
               <p>Def. I had no Money to subpoena Witnesses to prove it. Here are nothing but Circumstances against me; and I declare now, (tho' a Man may be mistaken) that he actually robb'd me, and I would say the same, if it was my dying Day.</p>
