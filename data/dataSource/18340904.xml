               <p>SUSAN WILMOTT. On the 27th of July, I was going home to Turnham-green, at three o'clock in the morning - I was coming from my father's house at Hammersmith - the prisoner was with me - I had been walking about with him for about half an hour - it was not three quarters of an hour - I did not say so before the magistrate - as we went down the terrace, he put his arm round my middle, and felt down my side - I felt his hand in my pocket, he threw me down, tore my gown down, and broke the pocket from my side - I never saw him before that morning - I had met him at Hammersmith, and he said, if I would go with him to the Chaise and Horses, he would give me a glass of gin, as it was wet, which I did - I went along with him, and bid him good morning there; but, instead of his leaving me, he followed me across the road leading to the terrace, and there he threw me down, and took my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to walk with him? A. I had such a distance to go home, which took the time - I do not usually walk with people who offer me gin; but he said he was going to walk that way, and he was talking to me as he went along- I bid him good morning at the top of Turnham-green-terrace - he threw me down, tore my gown down, and took the pocket off my side - I am quite certain he took my pocket off, which contained five shillings, a sixpence, and 1 1/2d.; a snuff-box with Scotch snuff in it; a pocket-handkerchief, and a pocket-knife - I got up, and got my pocket from him again - he threw me down a second time - I got it from him, and he threw me down again, and got it from me, and said, if I called policeman again, which I had done before, he would cut my b-y throat - I called "Policeman," and Mynott, the policeman, came up to me - I am certain it was the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I heard a cry of alarm, on the 27th of July, as I was going towards Turnham-green-terrace - I heard shrieks of "Murder" - I went down the terrace, and saw the prosecutrix without bonnet or cap, with her hair all over her eyes - she ran up to me, and gave me information - while she stood talking to me, I saw the prisoner running up the road - I said, "Is that the man?" - she said, "I think it is" - I followed, and overtook him at the back of the Crown and Anchor - he had this pocket inside his bosom, with a handkerchief, penknife, three shillings, and five farthings, and a snuff-box in it - I took it from him - I have had them ever since, and produce them.</p>
               <p>SUSAN WILMOTT re-examined. This is my pocket which I had on - I have the fellow one on now - this is my knife - the strings are off the pocket now - he broke them off round my middle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home, and it rained: going down Hammersmith, I saw the young woman standing under shelter - I stood under a few minutes myself - we got into conversation - she said she was very cold and wet - I said if she came over to the Chaise and Horses, I would give her a glass of gin - I walked down Hammersmith with her- when I got to Turnham-green-terrace, I missed 3s. out of my pocket - I accused her of taking it - she said she had not got it, and I took this money forcibly, having every reason to expect that it was my own - she screamed "Murder" - and I was taken.</p>
               <p>SUSAN WILMOTT re-examined. I tore his shirt in the struggle, and some of the money might have dropped from him, and he ran away above half a mile.</p>

He said he had taken her pocket from her side, but did not say what money he had taken - I found the pocket in his breast with the money, and in his pocket I found 4s. 4d. - he did not say he had lost 3s., nor complain that she had taken any money from him.</p>

In July last, I was at Brentford, going home from hay-making - I was in company with the two prisoners at Brentford - it was about nine weeks ago - I never saw them before that night - this happened about three miles from Brentford - I do not know the time of day or night, or what month it was - I went into a public-house to get a pint of beer, and the prisoners were there - I do not know the sign of the house - it was in the evening, about six or seven o'clock - I was drinking with the prisoners for three quarters of an hour - I was then going with they to hay-making to a fresh place in the parish of Ealing - we went together about three miles, and then we all laid down together upon a cock of hay - I laid there about a quarter of an hour, then took up my basket, and away I went - the prisoners remained on the haycock a little while, and in about ten minutes they came after me - one caught hold of my mouth, and the other took out my purse, and away they ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep on your legs, or were you down? A. I was down - one of the men pushed me into the hedge - I cannot tell which of them - I was pushed into the hedge before the hand was put on my mouth - I was not struck by any body - they got hold of me, pushed me into the hedge, and one held my mouth fast - there was no ditch there - I cannot say who it was pushed me down - it was one of these men - I lost 18s. in a purse which was in my right hand breeches pocket - I do not know who took it - when the men got the purse, they ran away and left me - I had my purse in my pocket at the public-house, and took it out to pay for the beer, and opened it, so that the money might be seen - the prisoners were there when I paid for the beer - I paid one shilling for it - I was sober when I laid down on the cock of hay - I am sure the prisoners are the men who were with me on the haycock.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure it was either of the prisoners who pushed you on the hedge bank? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. As you say you are sure it was one of them, why cannot you tell us which it was- what time was it? A. About nine o'clock - it was not dark, it was dusk - these are the two men - I had only been drinking in one public-house that night - I had nothing but beer - I had no gin - I believe I had nothing but beer, but I cannot be sure - I had some gin before I went with them, but not at that place - I was only at one public-house with them - I had been to two public-house that night - I cannot tell how much gin I had at the first, I forget - I was no more drunk than I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not with a woman of the town, as well as drinking gin? A. Yes; but not along with they - before I came to the prisoners, I had been drinking gin with a woman of the town - I cannot tell how much I drank - I was with her for half an hour - I was not drinking gin all that time - I had some beer first, then had some gin, and then met these men - the woman drank beer and gin with me - I might have had a couple of glasses of gin, not three or four - I will not swear I had not four glasses of gin - I took my purse out to pay for the gin, and put it in again - there was nothing the matter with it till I met with these men - after meeting with them, we had three or four pots of beer- three or four drank of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to the public-house at Brentford, and met the men, did you go to any particular place, and was caught coming out? A. Yes, it was the King's Arms- I do not know the Drum.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not go to another public-house after leaving the King's Arms? A. Yes; when I met these men, I cannot say I did go to the Drum, and I will not swear I did not - the woman did not swear at me and say I had given her 1s. too little, nor ask me for more money - I gave her 1s. - before I met her I had about 20s. in my purse - I cannot tell justly - she did not require me with an oath to give her more money - after I left her, she came back to the public-house along with these men, and asked me to treat her to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay for drink? A. We were drinking all three together - I cannot tell justly what I paid for it - we went off to go to work together - I fell asleep in the King's Arms, public-house - I never minded whether the woman was in the room at that time - I cannot swear whether she was or not - I paid for nothing more after I awoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never took your purse out after you went to sleep? A. No; I have not seen my purse since that night - I drank about three pots of beer before I went to lie down on the haycock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had you four pots at one public-house, and three at another, before you went to lay down on the haycock? A. I can take my oath I was as sober as I am now, when I laid down on the haycock with the men - I forget how much beer I had, and how much I paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever put your hand on your purse after you went to sleep in the public-house, till you went to lie down on the haycock? A. No; I had no occasion to feel for my purse after I went to sleep at the first public-house - these men paid for a pot of beer - I do not know about paying for any beer after I left the woman - I paid the shilling before I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you pay any money in the second public-house you went to? A. Yes; I paid for a pot or two of beer - that was in the public-house that I was in after I was with the woman - I did not pay any money away after I had been asleep, and was with the woman - I paid for a pot or two of beer at the second public-house, where I was with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the woman go with you to the second public-house? A. No. After leaving her, and awaking from my sleep, I paid for some beer at the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040005"/>public-house, and took out my purse, but not at the house I was at with her.</p>

            . I am a publican, living at Brentford. On Wednesday, the 2nd of July, the prosecutor came into my house in company with the two prisoners - they called for a pot of beer, which I took in, and the prosecutor paid for it - they drank together - I gave him change out of a shilling - I do not remember what he took it from - the prisoners were sitting close to him at the time - they remained together while they drank the pot of beer - I saw them go away, all three together, about a quarter after seven, or between seven and eight o'clock - when they went from my house, they were all three quite sober - I did not see the prosecutor at all intoxicated - I am sure the prisoners are the men - I have seen them at my house often before, and they always behaved well there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the sign of your house? A. The Drum. I am certain it was not near nine o'clock when they left the house - my house is about a mile from Ealing - whether the prosecutor had a purse at my house, I know nothing about - no woman came with him - I have known the prisoners four or five months - I have only kept the house about ten months - I only know them by coming to my house for beer.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoners on Pinner Race-course, by the order of my sergeant, on the 10th of July. They were not both together, but both were taken on the course that day - I found eightpence-halfpenny on one, and a few buttons on the other - I took them from the course to the cage, and did not on the road tell them what it was for - they asked me, and when we got about a mile and a half off the course I told them I apprehended them for highway robbery - they said, "Oh, we are innocent of that, at any rate;" and one said, "So help me God, Tom, if I had met you on the course, I should have asked you to drink, for I am innocent of any thing of the kind."</p>

            . I saw the prisoners and prosecutor in Hanger-lane, near the high road, about a quarter before nine o'clock. I knew the prisoners very well before, and I am sure I saw them and the prosecutor together, walking along - nobody else was with them - they were going towards Hanger-lane, from Ealing, about a mile and a half from the Drum public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first hear you were to be brought here as a witness? A. When I went to Clerkenwell. The policeman told me I should have to go up when these men were tried - that was about six weeks ago - I went before the magistrate - he took my deposition - I went before the Grand Jury - I was not before the magistrate at Brentford, or any where else - the policeman found me at my house - another policeman told him I had seen them, and I had a subpoena - he gave me nothing with it.</p>

            . I know the prisoners and prosecutor. I saw them walking along, as I was going home, on the first Wednesday in July, about half-past eight o'clock - I saw them in Brentford-fields - there were no haycocks there - it was a ploughed field - they were going towards Ealing - I am sure they are the men - there was nobody with them- there were two men at the bottom of the field, earthing potatoes - they were about twenty yards off - the prisoners and prosecutor were walking on towards Ealing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When were you first asked about this? A. I was asked about it by the policeman about six weeks ago - I live at Brentford - Tame lives at Ealing, and so does the policeman - it was about three weeks after the occurrence - I have seen the prisoners before, but not the prosecutor.(The prisoners made no defence.)</p>

            . I am a clerk in the banking-house of Walker and Stanley, at Rotherham - Mr. Newman, the agent of Lord Fitzwilliam, paid into the house, in May last, £6,000 - it might be about the 24th of May - the direction given, was to pay it over to Snow and Co., bankers, London, on account of Lord Fitzwilliam - I made up a letter, containing seven Bills of Exchange and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040007"/>three Bank-notes, which amounted all together to £6,000 - there was one Bank of England note for £500, No. 8,240, dated the 4th of April, 1834; one £500 note, of the Liverpool branch bank of England, No. 1,492, dated 28th of December, 1833; and another £500, of the Liverpool branch bank of England note, No. 1,569, the same date - that was all the Bank-notes - the notes were crossed in the face, "Per post, to Messrs. Snow and Co., 31 May, 34," in red ink - having enclosed these notes and the securities in the letter, I sealed the letter and took it home - it was directed,"Messrs. Snow and Co., bankers, London, post paid." - I locked it up when I got home - it was on a Saturday evening - I put it into the Post-office at nine o'clock on Sunday morning, at Rotherham, with another letter, addressed to Barclay and Co. - we have an account with the post-office, and did not pay the postage - (Ruthven here produced a £500 Bank of England note, No. 8,240) - this is one of the notes I enclosed in the letter, but it is not in the same condition as when I remitted it - the red ink mark has been partly obliterated - I saw it at Bow-street, and at that time the red ink was fresher - it was not obliterated at Bow-street at all - it was then in the same state as when I put it into the letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you lock up the letter? A. We have a box on purpose to lock up letters after business hours - I locked it in that box - there are two clerks in my office - we have each a key to the box - the other clerk is not here - I found the letter in the box in the morning - it was sealed - I put it into the Post-office without examining it - I did not conceive it necessary to examine it - the other clerk has a key, but he could not have access to it while it was at my house - I put it into the box at seven o'clock in the evening, and nobody could have access to the box but myself - I might have been out for an hour that evening - I am a clerk in the house - the other clerk is Mr. Dyson - he and I are on intimate terms, and visit occasionally.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. The box was in your house? A. Yes; my house communicates with the bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The note looks different to what it did before? A. It seems to have been wetted since I saw it at Bow-street - it has been in the custody of the officer - when I saw it at Bow-street, the red ink was perfectly visible - the note appeared rumpled, as if it had been carried in a pocket for some time - it could not be an old note when I put it into the letter, by the date of it; it was clean - when I saw it at Bow-street it might have passed through many hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You looked at a book just now, are the entries in your own handwriting? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Who are the partners of your house? A. Henry Walker, Mr. Stanley, and others - there are four partners - the box was in my own house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you took the letter from the box next morning, did it appear in the slightest degree disturbed? A. Not at all - the seal of the office was on it - the seal was locked up in the office - the other clerk could have access to that, but not after I made up the letter, because the keys of the drawer are locked up in the box the letters are put in, and the other clerk could not have access to the box after I put the letter in without going through my house - it is possible I might have been absent from my house two hours on Saturday evening, but I cannot state- I frequently go out for an hour after business, and sometimes two hours.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This account only shows the gross amount of paid and unpaid letters that morning? A.

             was the letter carrier of that division - after sorting the letters to the proper divisions, I call the proper letter carriers to come and receive them from me - when they receive them from me, they take them to their own seats for the purpose of arranging them - I know the prisoner Goodwin - he was a carrier in the 5th division that day - his seat was next to Boyden, which is the Essex-street walk - the prisoner's was the Wych-street walk - they sat next to each other - letters are often missorted when two letter carriers sit next to each other - if a letter carrier finds a letter missorted before he leaves the office, he should send it back to the sorter, to be sorted to the proper district, or deliver it to the person who delivers in that district, if he knows him - if the mistake is not discovered till after he leaves the office, it is his duty, after delivering the letters in his own district, to carry it to the person to whom it is directed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been a sorter in the office? A. I have been in the office about two years and a half - I have always been a letter carrier, but I was a sorter of the "franks and paid," in the inland office - it is one office - there are two hundred or two hundred and fifty letter carriers in the General Post Office - I never counted them - I cannot tell how many sorters there are - I am not aware that there has been any great increase of sorters lately - I will not swear it - there has been a very great increase of letter carriers, to the extent of forty or fifty, and in consequence of that increase, there has been an increased extent of room required for them - I have not seen any particular confusion before the room was enlarged for them - they were all put into the original room at first - I have not heard that it was too small for business to go on - the space has been increased in that room - I suppose that was because there was not room - I have no recollection whether the addition to the room was going on between the 21st of May and the 3rd or 4th of June - the people of the Post Office were not employed in the room at the time the workmen were carrying on the improvements - to the best of my recollection I never saw them - I did not see the improvements going on during the duty of the morning - I have seen them going on - I have been in the room while they were going on - that was when I went to look over my box or desk - I went there to change my coat, not to do any duty - the coat was in my box - there might be letter carriers in the room at that time - I have no knowledge whether there were - I will not swear there were not ten there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been giving us an account of what would be done if a man discovered a mistake; have not you known mistakes occur, the source of which was never discovered? A. I cannot say that I have - I have no knowledge of it - I cannot say that I have heard of it - I have no knowledge of making mistakes without discovering the origin of them - I have made no mistakes in the progress of sorting or carrying letters - I know of no mistake being made on the 2nd of June - no mistake occurred to me - I delivered letters myself on the 2nd of June - my walk is in Lincoln's Inn as assistant - I sat five or six seats from Boyden, to the best of my recollection - there are partitions between the seats - Archer sat on the other side of Boyden - the partitions are not particularly high, for they are scolloped - they slope off from the top - there is no partition dividing the seats - they sit on stools - the division is in the box - the sorters sit without a partition in the seat, but there is a sloping division at the side to part one desk from the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you any reason to suppose you made a mistake that morning? A. I have none.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. When you went into the office to get your coat, and the workmen were about, was it in the middle of the day? - was any public business going on in the office? A. None at all - I went on private business of my own - the business of the office is over as soon as the letters are sent out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. During the time the letter sorting was going on, were the workmen in the room at all? A. No; they came in after that was all over - I have no recollection of any particular letter I sorted that morning - I have no knowledge whether I delivered any particular letter to Boyden that morning.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOYDEN. I am a letter carrier of Essex-streetwalk. Snow's banking-house is in my division - if a paid letter, addressed to them, came to the office on the 2nd of June, it should be sorted to me by Cotton - Messrs. Snow have letters by the early delivery -

             is the carrier of the early delivery - in the course of my duty I should sort such a letter to Powell - I should place it in a packet with their letters - on the 31st of May I changed my seat; and on the 2nd of June Thomas Goodwin sat on my left hand, and Archer on my right - I came on duty at ten minutes before six o'clock - in the course of business, I have to leave my seat and go to another office to get letters - I sort out the letters as I receive them - perhaps letters remain an hour and a half or two hours on my desk before they are taken away by the letter carriers - these letters would be arranged before me in bundles - I sort the letters in front of me for the Essex-street walk - the letters for Messrs. Snow would be on my left side, because it is at the commencement of the delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for the person who sits on the left hand side to reach over the partition and take a letter? A. If disposed, he might - the partition is sloped out, so that our elbows touch each other on each side as we sit - the letters would lie near the high part of the partition, which is about two feet - the letters I sorted on the left hand were placed in sight of my left hand man - he could see them - they would be next to him - the letters for the Essex-street walk were about the length of his arm from him - the partition is to prevent one man's letters mixing with others - it prevents the letters coming together, but would not prevent his taking them - our seats are wooden stools and are moveable - The paid letters form no part of the charge - if a paid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040009"/>letter was abstracted, the carrier would not discover it - the paid letters are not charged to the letter carrier - when a parcel of letters are made up, we are called in to receive that number - we tell them up as to what they amount to, and that money we are to pay into the treasury - the paid letters form no part of that account - Goodwin has signed the book as having delivered letters that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How are the letters brought to you? A. We fetch the unpaid letters from the office - the unpaid letters are kept by themselves - a messenger brings them from one office to the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You receive your letters, I suppose, from different sorters; each bag is sorted by a person? A. No; there is a sorter for every division - he sorts them into walks - they are placed in a box for us - we sign no check for the paid letters, as to the charge.</p>

            . I am assistant inspector of letter carriers at the General Post-office. On the 2nd of June Goodwin was on duty; he was a letter carrier employed by the General Post-office - he has signed the time book in which all the clerks enter their names - his signature is in this book, denoting that he was on duty that day - it is in his handwriting, to the best of my belief - I have seen him write - his duty was to deliver letters in the Wych-street walk.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 19th of June, about six o'clock, or from that to seven o'clock in the evening, I was near Parker-street, Drury-lane - I saw the prisoners Ward and McSweeney come out of a public-house in Parker-street, and part at the door - it was the Crown and Cushion, I think - a person came out with Ward first, and went to the Running Horse, at the corner - he was an old man - I saw no more of the old man that day - I saw Ward come out of the Running Horse and go back again to the Crown and Cushion - both he and the old man came out of the Running Horse, and parted, and Ward went to the Crown and Cushion - after that I saw Ward and McSweeney come out of the Crown and Cushion - I had not seen McSweeney before that - they parted at the door - I gave directions to Leadbitter to follow McSweeney - that is all that happened that day - on the following day I was in the Strand, at Mr. Hawley's, the watch-maker's, nearly opposite Bedford-street - I there saw Ward and the same old man go into the Queen's Head public-house, and then I saw them come out - I followed them to Crown-street, Westminster, into a private house - I think it was No. 20, Crown-street- after being there some time, I saw them come out with McSweeney - they went into a wine vault, at No. 11, King-street, Westminster, close by Crown-street - they left there, and I followed them to the Plough, in Beaufort-buildings, Strand - I saw them talking together at the door, and I laid hold of McSweeney and Ward, and took them into the parlour - the old man went away - when we got into the parlour, I said to McSweeney, "What have you got in your pocket?" - McSweeney put his hand into his right hand breeches pocket, and said, "I will show you"- he produced half-a-crown and 1s. 6d. - I put my hand into his left hand breeches pocket, and there found a £500 Bank-note - this is it (looking at it) it is No. 8240, dated 4th April, 1834 - it has been in my possession almost ever since - I gave it to the Post-office solicitor, having first marked it with my initials - I know it is the same note - the note was not wrapped up in any thing, but loose in his pocket - I asked him how he accounted for having possession of it - he said he was respectable, that he was a gentleman, that he had taken it at a gambling-house at the west end of the town - I asked him where - he said, "I decline telling" - I believe those were his words - I know he declined telling me - I asked him where he lived - he said,"At Chelsea" - I asked him where - he would not say - I searched Ward, and found on him part of the Times newspaper - I produce it - it contains an advertisement of 100l. reward for the property stolen - I had not seen an advertisement in any newspaper about the property myself, but I had seen a placard - as they were sitting in the parlour, McSweeney looked over towards Ward, and said, "It is all over; it is all up; Jack, you are a damned bad one all up your back" - Ward replied, "It is not me, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040010"/>must be the old one" - I took them into custody - Leadbitter joined me soon afterwards - I took them to Bow-street - as soon as he came in at Bow-street, I asked their names, McSweeney called himself Benjamin Swabey, and the other, I believe, gave his name as Ward - I do not know that he stated what business he was - he might do so - I heard McSweeney say he had something to do with the law originally - Ward said he received the piece of the Times newspaper from McSweeney's lodging, in Crown-street, where he had come from, and McSweeney admitted that it was so - this was in the public-house - Leadbitter was not present at that time - I had sent for him, not liking to remove the two by myself - after taking them into custody, I went again to Crown-street, about four or five o'clock that afternoon, with Leadbitter, and a gentleman belonging to the Post-office, named Bokenham - we went to No. 20, and searched the house - we found nothing important there - on returning from there, towards Charing Cross, as we passed the end of Downing-street, a gentleman said, "I wonder where he is going," pointing to the prisoner, Goodwin, who was merely passing by, about a hundred yards from Crown-street - Leadbitter followed him, and from an intimation I received from Leadbitter, I went again with Mr. Bokenham to No. 20, Crown-street - we went up stairs, to the first floor, and found Goodwin there - Mr. Bokenham said to him, "I am sorry to see you here" (McSweeney's sister and brother-in-law were there) - Goodwin, I think, made answer, "Yes" - the brother said, "It is a bad job" - I recollect nothing more - we took Goodwin to the office - when the man said, "It is a bad job," I think Goodwin said"Yes" - I took McSweeney to Tothill-fields prison, in the evening - his sister and her husband were in the coach - they had some conversation with him - the sister was very much affected, and the brother-in-law pressed him to tell the truth, as he could not be a principal - McSweeney said,"No, I am only the go-between; they have not got the right man yet" - upon being further pressed by his brother-in-law, he said, "How can I look the world in the face, and betray my friend?" - the Bank-note was kept in my possession for a considerable time - I went to Ireland with it, and had it in my pocket-book, in my pocket - the red ink was fresh on it when I put it in my pocket-book, and the note was clean - on my journey, my pocket-book got completely wet through, and the appearance of the note very much altered - the red ink is a great deal paler.</p>
               <p>(The part of the Times newspaper produced, as found upon Ward, being referred to, contained an advertisement offering a reward of £100, upon conviction of the parties concerned in the robbery in question, and describing the Bank-notes and Bills of Exchange.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. 100l. reward is offered on conviction; were you aware of that when you gave your evidence to-day? A. Yes - I think I was examined twice at the police-office - I believe what I said before the magistrate was taken down in writing - I do not know that every word I have said was taken down - it was read over to me, and I signed it afterwards - I think I was examined twice - I cannot state whether I signed one or two examinations - what I said, was read over to me - I stated about having gone to the lodging in Crown-street, and seeing the brother-in-law and sister of McSweeney and Goodwin there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word respecting Bokenham making the observation to Goodwin, "I am sorry to see you here?" A. I have no doubt I did; but very often things stated are not taken down by the clerks fully; they take down what appears to them to meet the case - I have no doubt I stated it - this is my signature - (looking at his deposition.)</p>
               <p>(The witness's deposition being read over, did not state the conversation which passed between Goodwin and Mr. Bokenham at the room in Crown-street.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as very odd, when you were in the street, that a gentleman should point to Goodwin, and say, "I wonder where he is going?" A. It did not, for the gentleman making the observation belonged to the Postoffice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it strike you as material that Mr. Bokenham should say, "I am sorry to see you here?" A. Yes; and also Goodwin's answering, "Yes," to its being a bad job - the clerk at the police-office desired me to attend while he read over what I had sworn - this conversation is omitted in my deposition, but I stated it - I did not desire the clerk to insert it in my deposition when he read it - it was material in my own mind - there are many things I stated which are not in my deposition.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought that material, and found it omitted, why not desire the clerk to insert it? A. I have stated that I cannot account for the clerk's not taking it down; I have no other answer to give - I was present when Mr. Bokenham was examined, the best part of the time - I might have gone in and out of the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You saw an old man, why let him go? A. I was by myself and had other reasons.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take the old man? A. I beg to decline answering the question - I had my reasons - I was under promises - I did not believe him guilty of any offence, and I promised I should not interfere - I knew the old man before - I had known him many years - he is not near the Court, that I know of - I did not know where he lived - I swear that I do not know where he could be met with now, but I dare say by inquiring I could meet with him - he did not go before any magistrate on this occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man of good character? A. I do not think I am to answer about people not in Court - I know there is a reward on this particular occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the old man has been transported? A. Unless his Lordship directs me, I decline answering.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the paper, when you got possession of it, cut out in the way it appears now? A. I think on recollection it might be a little larger, but I delivered it to the solicitor of the Post-office in the state I found it - it appears torn - it might be about one-third larger when it came into my possession - I delivered it to the solicitor precisely as I found it - I had it in my possession some days - I might have shown it to the solicitor, but they did not take it into their possession for some days, I think - I should think it was more than three weeks after I found it, I gave it to them - I have not seen it for three or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040011"/>four weeks, till the day before yesterday, when Mr. Peacock, jun., gave it to me - he did not tell me he had altered it - seeing my own signature to it, I put it into my pocket without observation - I cannot say whether it was as large again or twice as large - I believe it was found in Ward's coat pocket - I have no knowledge of the pocket, but I believe it was the coat pocket - it was not rumpled up in the pocket - it was doubled together, smooth, in this sort of way (folding it up) - I cannot say whether it was in an outside pocket - I had seen Ward the day before this - Leadbitter was in the neighbourhood at the time, but we separated a great deal - I was in Queen-street, and Ward and the other man came into Queen-street, and went into the Running Horse - I was in a baker's shop directly opposite - I had a full view of Ward on that occasion - I was inside a baker's shop - if he had looked that way he could not have seen me as well as I could see him, as there was glass intervened.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure the paper has been reduced in size since you found it? A. I think so, but I do not know - I think it was a little larger.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 19th and 20th of June I was in company with Ruthven occasionally - on the 20th of June I saw McSweeney, Ward, and an old man, come from No. 20, Crown-street - I was sent for that day from Bow-street by Ruthven, and went to Beaufort-buildings - I found Ward and McSweeney in his custody - after they were taken to Bow-street, I went with Ruthven and Mr. Bokenham towards Crown-street, Westminster - as we returned, Mr. Bokenham directed my attention to Goodwin, whom we met near the end of Downing-street - I watched him, and saw him go into No. 20, Crown-street - I then called Ruthven and Mr. Bokenham - we all went into the house, and found Goodwin on the first floor with a man and woman, whom I understood to be McSweeney's brother-in-law and sister - Mr. Bokenham said, "Goodwin, I am surprised to see you here" - he did not make any reply, and McAlwin, the brother of McSweeney, said, "It is a bad job" - Goodwin said it was - I then took Goodwin to his lodging in Hatfield-street, Stamford-street - I searched his place there, but found nothing material - I took him to Bow-street - after he was committed, I took him to the front room of the office, waiting for a coach, and when we were there he said, "Is there not another young man in custody for the same thing?" - I said there was - (I had before that told him he was taken on suspicion of stealing a letter, containing Bank-notes) - he asked his name - I said I thought it was Farrant, (which was not correct,) and he said, "No, Bryant" - I said that might be his name - I then took him to the House of Correction - previous to that, he inquired if he could see Bryant - I said he could not - he then begged of me to let him see him, if it was only to exchange a look - I told him it could not be allowed - he then inquired if they were going to the same prison - I said they were not - I got a coach and took him to the House of Correction - I brought him at different times from the House of Correction to be examined, and on the second or third examination, I think the third, I was bringing him from the House of Correction to Bow-street, he inquired if I thought they would be committed to Newgate that day - (there were several re-examinations) - I said I did not know, and he expressed a wish that they might be, and said he was surprised that they were not committed at the examination before that, as he was surprised there was so much evidence against them as there was - on that day the prisoners were locked up in different cells at Bow-street - there are three cells, and each prisoner was in a different cell, and, in consequence of what the gaoler said to me, I went into the yard, and heard McSweeney call, "Tom, keep up your spirits; we can live as well in another country as we can in this" - Goodwin said,"Yes, it is all very well for you; but see how they will serve me before I get there; they will give me two years' solitary confinement, as they did Job Cox, before they send me off" - McSweeney said, "No, the case is not so clear against you as it was against him" - Ward hallooed out,"No; the worst transportation is only for burglars" - Job Cox was a general postman, whom I apprehended about two years or eighteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. That was the man one of them said had two years' solitary confinement before he was sent off? A. Yes; that was the man he named - this conversation must have been about the 4th of July - I made a minute in my memory of it - I think I made a memorandum of it at the time - I have no doubt that I did - I do not know where it is; I have not looked at it - I thought it not material - I think it was on the third examination - I was examined at the second examination - I gave part of my evidence at the first, and merely charged them as being suspected of the offence; and, on the second examination, on a Friday, I gave my evidence - I signed that examination at the time - it must have been about the 27th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations were there after that at which you were examined and signed your examination? A. On no occasion except at the last examination, when my evidence was read over, and I was bound over to attend here - my evidence was read over at the last examination - I reported to the solicitor what I overheard in the yard - I thought it material - I did not apply to the magistrate to have the conversation added to my deposition, and it is not stated in it - I communicated it to the solicitor on the very day I heard it, which I think must have been about the 4th of July - I made a memorandum of the date, which I have got at home, I have no doubt - I did not think it material to bring it here - I was not aware I should be asked for it - I was fully aware that 100l. depended upon the conviction of the men - I had seen the advertisement in the Times, and knew it long before their apprehension - I made this communication to the solicitor of the Post-office, either the same day I heard it or the following one - Mr. Peacock, sen., was present at the last examination, when my examination was read - he did not relate what I had told him, in the presence of the prisoners, in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it is your duty to detail before the magistrate, and in presence of the prisoners, every thing material relating to the charge? A. Yes; but I did not know that was material - I know it was my duty to state to Mr. Peacock all I knew - it was for him to know whether it was material - Mr. Peacock did not desire me to conceal it - he conducted the prosecution - it was for him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040012"/>to know what was evidence, and not me - when I heard it, I did not know it was evidence - I read part of my proof from the solicitor of the Post-office, before I came here - I thought and believed it to be evidence, but I did not know that I should be called on to prove it - Shackell is the gaoler who called my attention to the conversation - I believe he is here - he left the yard, but his assistant gaoler was there - I do not know whether he is here; I believe not - he heard it as well as me - I told Mr. Peacock that the assistant gaoler heard it as well as me - the conversation between Mr. Bokenham and others, in Crown-street, occurred before I was examined at all - Mr. Bokenham said to Goodwin, "I am surprised to see you here."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state that before the magistrate? A. No. I did not know whether it was evidence or material - I was sworn to tell the whole truth - I told the truth with regard to the fact, that he was taken into custody at that house - I cannot repeat every thing that took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell it on your examination on your oath, as well as to the solicitor? A. I was not asked about it - Mr. Bokenham was examined himself - I recollect that - I do not know how long his examination was - if he was examined before the magistrate, it must have been in the afternoon; he was in the office - I do not know whether he gave evidence - he was there, and I expected he would be examined - I did not hear him examined - I did not say he was examined at length.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect to get any portion of the 100l. if any of the prisoners are convicted? A. I assure you I have never given it a consideration - I do expect a part of it - I cannot say how much - I do not think the reward depends upon how many are convicted - when I first took took them into custody, I expected to get some of the money - I think the reward would depend on their being convicted, but that would make no difference as to my speaking the truth - I never thought of speaking any thing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you leave out part of it before the magistrate? A. The solicitor examined me before the magistrate, to ascertain the facts, and, if asked, I should have stated it - the clerk does not ask the witness if he has any thing to add or alter, he asks him to sign his name, - to the best of my recollection, the magistrate did not ask if I had any thing to amend or alter - I believe I was not asked the question - it was read over to me - I did not find the part I had not stated had been omitted, I never thought of it - I thought of stating the facts as they occurred - I thought if there was any thing material in what Mr. Bokenham had said, he would state it himself - I did not hear Ruthven examined - Ruthven and myself are the only officers employed in this case.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to know, or believe, that any person besides you and Ruthven will share any part of this reward? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you told us the whole of the conversation in the yard? A. Yes; to the best of my recollection. They talked about other things, saying, Shackell was a very good fellow, and talking about their treatment in prison - I did not hear McSweeney or Goodwin say they were sorry for Ward, for he knew nothing about it; nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Did you communicate the conversation you heard in the yard to Mr. Peacock before or after the last examination? A. I did it on the same day, or the following day; it was before the last examination. They were not committed, I think till about the middle of July, or the latter end - there were several examinations.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were any witnesses examined after the 27th of June? A. Yes, and their examinations taken. A. gentleman, from Birmingham, was examined, relative to a second charge, and one Cornish, and one Davis, but that was on a second charge - I believe nobody was examined on this charge after the third examination, which must have been about the middle of July - witnesses were examined before the magistrate on this charge, in July - Goodwin was apprehended in Crown-street, which is in the parish of St. Margaret, I believe - I know it is in the county of Middlesex.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Post-office. I accompanied the officers, as they have stated - I have been in Court, and heard Leadbitter and Ruthven examined - I heard a conversation at Bow-street, on the 20th of June, I think, between McSweeney and his sister - it was the day he was apprehended - she urged him very strongly, and so did his brother-in-law, to tell who he received the note from- she said, "For God's sake, do tell, for my sake, and the sake of your family" - McSweeney said, "No; you would have a much worse opinion of me then, than you possibly can have now" - he then said to his sister, "Ben Swabey would rather die, than betray his friend" - I accompanied the officers to the lodging in Crown-street, and heard what passed - I said to Goodwin, answered me with a monosyllable, but I cannot state what he said - Mr. McAlwin, who was present, said, "It is a bad job" - I am not aware of any thing else - I was so agitated at the time, at seeing the prisoner there, I do not know any thing more that passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you examined at the police-office? A. I was not - I attended there, and heard Ruthven examined there - I was not present when he was asked to listen to his examination read over to him - I only heard part of his examination - I was not present at the end of it - I believe I said I was sorry - whether I said sorry, or surprised, I do not know - I have heard Ruthven and Leadbitter examined to-day, and heard one of them say, my expression was, that I was "sorry," and the other, that I was "surprised" - I said, either sorry, or surprised - I only used one of these expressions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you heard in the Post-office of any suspicion arising respecting Mc Sweeney on the day he was taken up? A. I had not at all - Goodwin could have no knowledge of any suspicion being attached to McSweeney, from any thing passing in the Post-office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Goodwin remain in the employ of the Post-office up to the day when he was apprehended? A. He did, I have no doubt, but I am not in the same department - a person named McAlwin was examined at the police-office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time in the afternoon had you the conversation with Goodwin at the house in Crown-street? A. It was in the evening, probably between six and seven o'clock.</p>

            . I am keeper of the lock-up place at Bow-street - the three prisoners were in my custody - I have been in Court part of the time of this trial - I was here when Ruthven was examined, and part of the time that Leadbitter was - I was never desired to go out - I took Ward on several occasions from Bow-street office to the prison - on the 25th of July, I was bringing him from the prison to Bow-street office - he requested me, as soon as I came out of the prison, to let him remain with the two other prisoners for a short time - I asked him what for - he told me he had no money, and his wife had pawned every thing she had to raise money to meet his expenses, and he wished to see the other prisoners, to ask them for some money - I agreed, and he was with them - I believe it was by the sanction of Leadbitter, but I asked somebody if it might be done, and when I was about to convey him back to the prison in the afternoon, he said they had each given him 1s., which made 2s., and that Goodwin had given a girl 1l., and he felt himself much dissatisfied - and if they did not, he knew what to do - he said he would rather dic than split.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever present at any conversation between Goodwin and McSweeney? A. I was frequently in the yard - I remember Goodwin coming in a coach - he was very ill, and was brought into the yard where the other two prisoners were - he appeared very dejected, and was crying- he had the appearance of having had the jaundice - Swabey said to Goodwin, "Don't cry, Tom, you quite unman me; the worst is transportation for life" - Goodwin said, they would serve him in the same way as they did Job Cox, keep him two years in solitary confinement, and then transport him - Swabey said, "They cannot do that, for the case is not so clear against us as it was against him"- part of the conversation was while I was putting them in separate cells, and the latter part of it was during the time they were locked in different cells - they were hallooing from one to the other - this conversation about the transportation was on the 25th of July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear Ruthven give his evidence? A. Yes; I am the principal gaoler.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you rightly, you say the conversation began while you were locking them up in the cells? A. Yes - my under-gaoler is not here - his name is

             - I was locking them up part of the time, and part of the time Tyrrell locked them up - Tyrrell was not always there - the first part of the conversation was openly before me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it begin? A. When Goodwin was brought into the yard, he seemed much dejected, and Swabey said,"Tom, don't cry, you quite unman me" - and during that time I was putting them in separate cells, and then I stayed in the yard, and heard this conversation - I was requested to take notice of any thing I might hear - Swabey said,"Tom, don't cry, you quite unman me; the worst is transportation for life" - that was said openly in the yard before me, before I locked them up - the three prisoners and myself were there - it is a square yard with three cells - there was nobody there but myself and the three prisoners, to my knowledge - in fact, I can take upon myself to swear so, not at that time - I am speaking of a certain day which I put down, on the 11th of July - Ruthven was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Ruthven there during any part of the time that day? A. He was in the cells with me.</p>
               <p>Q. During the conversation you have deposed to, was Ruthven in the yard at any part of it? A. No: the under-gaoler is very ill now - I was subpoened here - the conversation about Job Cox occurred in my hearing - in fact, I had heard it before, and was ordered to keep them in different cells, and they were in the habit of conversing together - and after I told it, I was told to take notice of what they said; and I did so - I was at Bow-street, but was not examined - I laid this statement before Sir Frederick Roe, and was requested to give it to Mr. Peacock - I do not know when I gave him the statement - I believe the prisoners were finally committed before I gave it to Sir Frederick Roe, but I do not recollect on what day - it was on the 25th of July that I took it down - the magistrate did not keep the paper - I laid it before him - he read it, and gave me a note with it, with directions to give it to Mr. Peacock - I do not know whether the prisoners were at that time in my custody - I believe not - I told Leadbitter, and showed him what I had heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself call Leadbitter to take notice of any conversation? A. I did - that was before I took down that writing - I did not stay with Leadbitter to hear it - I left the under-gaoler with him - the first memorandum I made was on the 11th of July - I made another on the 25th of July- it was before either of those dates that I called Leadbitter to listen - I have not seen my under-gaoler since yesterday morning - he returned from Guildford very ill - he came by the coach, as I wrote to him to come up, as I had to attend this Court - there is nothing to prevent his coming here, to my knowledge - I said he had been ill - and he is ill now.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Crown-street, Westminster, and am McSweeney's brother-in-law - I am a housekeeper, and pay rates to St. Margaret's parish - McSweeney's name is Bryan McSweeney - I did not know of his going by any other name except on this occasion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Goodwin at McSweeney's on the 20th of June, before he was apprehended? A. No; not before he was apprehended - I saw him there then - he came in a little after five o'clock, or between five and six o'clock, and asked for McSweeney, about five or six minutes before the officers arrived - I told him McSweeney was apprehended for having possession of a note stolen from the Post-office - he said, "Good God!" or, "My God!" and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040014"/>seemed surprised - I myself was in great confusion at the time, as the officers had been there and searched the place, and my wife was crying - while this was going on, the officers came in - I remember Mr. Bokenham coming in.</p>
               <p>Goodwin's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury: Being asked what I have to say, my answer is in a very few words. I know no more about it than either yourselves or the gentlemen of the Jury. If I am convicted, it will be on the evidence of two Bow-street officers, who are interested in the reward. I trust you will consider my case with justice.</p>
               <p>McSweeney's Defence. I beg leave to call your serious attention to the few observations I have to make. I could hardly restrain my feelings during the examination of the officers. I have no hesitation in saying that there is not an atom of truth in the extra evidence which is not in their depositions. Ruthven says I said to Ward, "Jack, it is all up:" as I hope for salvation, I did not know the man's name was John; I always understood his name to be William Ward. He used to work for me as a shoemaker. I have not seen him for years previous, to a few days before this transaction. I unwarily called him "Ward:" as to the other observations he places to me, I may say without egotism, I am not in the habit of using such expressions - with regard to what is said I said in the lock-up place, Shackle, if he speaks the truth, will say I stated, as far as I knew, the fact, they were both entirely innocent of the transaction - with regard to the subject of transportation, I said it would be as well for me now if I was transported, having hitherto borne an irreproachable character, but now it signifies not what becomes of me - but as to Goodwin's being transported, it is false, for I was convinced he knew nothing about the transaction - with regard to Cox, it is evident Shackle took his cue from the officers, for if I recollect right, Cox had but one year's imprisonment - they could not all mistake my saying two, unless they took the subject one from the other - had I received the note in the way stated, I could have gone to the Bank and got it changed - it is obvious the receipt of the letter could not have been known in London for two or three days, and with that knowledge, what was there to prevent my going to the Bank with it? - I am convinced you will see it in the true light - the fact is, the note, I regret to say, came into my possession at a gambling-house, and I gave 134l. in exchange for it - I had no knowledge of any thing of the sort- had we not all been treated in the manner we were, I should have been able to bring forward evidence - though unacquainted with the persons there, I could have proved where I got the note - we were twelve weeks in confinement - we were brought forward to please Mr. Peacock, and for no other motive: for at the last four examinations no further evidence was given - Gentlemen, I have only to repeat to you that Goodwin is entirely unacquainted with the matter - as far as I am concerned, I did not receive the note from him - Ward is unacquainted with it - he is a shoemaker, and he waited on me on the day in question for a job - I was engaged, and could not give him orders then- we walked out together, and it being very warm, I gave him some drink - I assert positively my innocence, and the innocence of the other prsioners - as regards me, I received the note, not from Goodwin, but from a stranger at the gambling-house - you must be well aware, men of the world frequenting those places, always wish to be unknown, and the owners of those places would be very tenacious of coming forward, it being unlawful - but if I had not been in confinement, (three weeks of which time I was not allowed to communicate with my legal adviser,) I could have brought forward evidence to prove I did win it, and probably the person from whom I got it - Gentlemen, it is generally believed that the capital punishment is abolished in this case; I regret to say it is in full force, and by the observations made by the Lord Chancellor, it will be carried into effect - I trust you will not bring to an ignominious end persons quite innocent - the other prisoners know no more of my transactions than I do of theirs - I have nothing more to say, but in the words of Scripture, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."</p>
               <p>Ward's Defence. I called on McSweeney on Thursday, the 19th, when Ruthven says he saw me - I never went into the second public-house - I live not six doors from the public-house he speaks of, and being in the habit of working for McSweeney, I called on him, and was apprehended - as to the newspaper, it was taken out merely as another piece of paper might be, wrapped up in this manner - it was quite half a paper - I had no knowledge of the contents - I never saw so much of it as I have seen today - I was put in solitary confinement for a whole week, 	- I have been tampered with by the officers - Mr. Peacock sent to me several times, to say he would pay me, and I should be rewarded if I had any thing to say - as to Shackle and the other man, how they can swear to such villanous acts, I cannot say - I am totally innocent.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. I remember the woman being brought to the hospital on the 13th of August - I cannot say I remember who brought, her or who came with her - she was brought in some time in the afternoon - I do not remember the policeman being there - she had two or three contused wounds of the scalp, extending to the bone, at the upper and back part of the head - the skull is rather thin there, but it is not the thinnest part - the wounds were rather considerable - I examined them - there was no fracture of the skull - they appeared to have been inflicted with much violence - they might have been made with that poker - it is probable an instrument of that kind made them, or they might have been produced by a fall - there was no indentation of the skull - there was laceration of the scalp, exposing the bone- there was a wound; it would be difficult to describe the size of the wound, as it extended in different directions, over the space of three or four inches square - that was the whole extent - I do not mean to say there was an entire separation of the scalp for that space, but it was two or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040016"/>three wounds, which, altogether, might have covered that space with contusions - and all there were contusions, besides the wounds - the scalp was not separated from the bone before the examination was made, at least it would lay down on the bone, in that situation, but on sponging it, it could be raised up, and the scalp could be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Altogether, how many injuries were there: wounds, bruises, and altogether? A. Three or four - there were two or three wounds - we call it a contused wound when the edges are separated - a contused wound is accompanied by bruises and contusions - the head was injured to the extent of three or four inches square - there was danger from inflammation attending these contusions and wounds- I should think a great quantity of violence must have been used to have produced them - the woman was perfectly sensible all along - she appeared to have lost a considerable quantity of blood - I should say this poker was a very dangerous thing to strike with - it would be very likely to endanger life - if it was handled two or three inches from the end, it would still be dangerous - the nob was likely to have made an indentation of the skull, and that might probably cause death - it is most probable that it would - there was not any other woman brought to me that afternoon with an injury on her head - I cannot remember the date exactly - we had no woman brought in that week who was similarly affected to so great an extent.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM OSMAN re-examined. I saw Mr. James at the hospital - he gave me a certificate on the following Wednesday - I did not see him the day the woman was taken to the hospital - I am sure it was on Wednesday, the 13th of August.</p>
               <p>MARY COLLINS re-examined. I saw Mr. James attending to the woman - I held a saucer while he shaved her hair off - Ellen McCarthy was the woman he attended, I am certain - I know this is the poker - I have often seen it in the woman's room - I do not know who gave it to the policeman - I did not go into the room afterwards, as the landlady locked the room up - they lived some time in the house - I was often in their room - I am almost sure that is the poker - it was either that or one like it - there was blood upon it when the policeman had it - I saw it in a woman's hand in the room in less than five minutes after this was done - there was then blood and hair upon it - I saw it in the policeman's hands afterwards - it appeared the same poker, and was bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he strike, gently, violently, or uphanded? A. He had his hand up, and seemed to be striking with force - I do not know whether it was with all his force - he had hold of the bottom part of the poker, because I tried to stop his hand with it - he seemed to have hold of it in this way (taking hold of it near the middle) - but I cannot exactly say, for I was frightened - I did not take hold of the poker, but of his hand - some of the smaller end of it was out of his hand - I tried to stop his hand, but was frightened, seeing the woman bleeding.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My old woman went into another man's room, and next morning he reported at the place he worked at, that she had done so and so - one of the men told me about it, and told the foreman too - as soon as I came home to dinner, we got to a few words together; and this happened at the same time, when I was a little jealous of my wife. There is nobody to speak for me. As to this witness, any thing she likes, she will do it. This is not the first time she has come against somebody.</p>
               <p>MARY COLLINS re-examined. I have had no quarrel with the prisoner, I am certain - I have never been a witness in any case before - I have been before a Justice, but never a witness against any body - I was before a Justice about three years ago, as I got a great deal of ill usage myself, and I went to complain - that was on my own case- it was against some men and women for beating me - the magistrate fined them 5l. each.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You have been before a jury about that child? Witness. This child in my arms is my own - I am not married - I have been before a Justice to father it.</p>

            . I am the wife of George Thorpe, and live at Edmonton. I saw the prisoner once, two or three weeks before the time in question, but never spoke to her - on Thursday night, the 24th of July, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was at Stoke Newington - I wanted a lodging, having left London, and did not like to go on to Edmonton - I did not mind sitting up until daylight - I asked the policeman first where I could get a lodging - I saw the prisoner in the street at Newington, and asked her to tell me of a lodging, or tell me any where I could sit up for an hour or two - she said she would take me to her lodging - I went down the street with her as far as the Weavers' Arms, about a quarter of a mile - nobody was with me at all - very few people were passing - she knocked me down close by the Weavers' Arms in <placeName id="t18340904-6-crimeloc37">Newington</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking with the prisoner that night? A. I cannot say but what I took a glass of gin with her - I had been drinking in her company altogether I suppose two hours - we talked together a great while in the street - I am separated from my husband at present: he allows me six shillings a-week, and that was the money I lost - I had seven-pence besides in my pocket - that was all the money I was possessed of; also a boot, and a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ask me to tell you where I could get a lodging? A. Yes: you said you would take me to your lodging.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far were you from the door of the public-house when she knocked you down? A. Close to it - the door was just open - the people were all turned out of the house, it being very late - there was about six persons standing by - there were five or six standing at the top when I got up - they were all her confederates.</p>

            . I am a policeman.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutrix sitting on the steps of a door, very much in liquor - she asked where she could get a lodging. I said I would take her to the Weavers' Arms - I asked if they could give her a lodging - they said, "No; not to strangers." On coming out, she asked if I would have any thing to drink; she paid for a quartern of gin, and she changed fourpence - in coming out, she asked if I had got my money, I said I had, I had one shilling and sixpence when I met her; she asked me to be two-pence towards the gin, I said I did not mind; I changed sixpence, and gave her twopence - two or three men came up, who knew her, and got into conversation with her- a man, that I knew, came up - I was talking to him - during that time, she was taken down a turning by the Weavers' Arms, and shortly after, I heard a cry of "Murder"- I went to her assistance; she was lying on the ground - I went to the top, and walked a little further - the policeman laid hold of me, and when I got up to her, she said I was the woman; but I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

I went to bed on Saturday, the 2nd of August, about twelve o'clock - I was not the last person up - I was called, up, about a quarter before four in the morning, by a neighbour, and observed the parlour door had been forced open - the shop adjoins the parlour - I had drawers in the parlour where I kept my clothes, and where I put my cash-box in the daytime - on examining the drawers, I found them all open, and all my clothes gone - I then went into my shop, and, on examining the till, I found from 20s. to 30s., in silver, taken - on examining my desk in the shop, I found it broken open, and from 3l. to 5l., in copper, taken from it - I also missed one silver table-spoon, twelve tea-spoons, a silver cream-jug, and a pair of silver sugar-tongs - I have not seen any of them again - I lost a variety of things - when I came to examine the premises, I found they had entered through a bakehouse window, which had been made secure by a carpenter, to prevent my men communicating with the shop - it had been shut up for about four months - the wood work was broken away sufficient to admit a man - I had a sharp dog in the bakehouse, which was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040018"/>his regular place - he was always loose - he was a very sharp dog - I did not hear him bark in the night - I found him tied up with a string, in the morning, to a post in the bakehouse - the dog always barked at a stranger, day or night - I am sure the parlour door was locked overnight - I lost a drab jacket, also a drab waistcoat, a pair of drab trowsers, a black cloth waistcoat, and a valencia figured waistcoat - I missed also two coats, and a pair of boots, which were found on the floor in the water-closet - I missed two yellow silk handkerchiefs - on the Wednesday following, three days after the robbery, I saw some of my articles in possession of Watkins, the horse-patrol, and Mead, the beadle of Enfield - the prisoner, Clay, lived in my service, as a journeyman baker, and quitted a month previous to the robbery - I never saw him on the premises after that - he was familiar with the dog, as it was to and fro while he lived with me- the dog belongs to a brother of mine, and came backwards and forwards to my house, as my brother had left his house- I have seen Clay play with the dog, and give him food to eat - I do not know Stanley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. It was a sharp dog? A. Very sharp - it was a terrier - he always barked at strangers - I never saw Stanley before - I have no reason to suppose the dog was acquainted with him - the window had not been open for four months before, to my knowledge, but I had not examined it for a month since the prisoner lived with me - I have not examined it for four months.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did it appear to have been broken open then from the appearance of the wood work? A. It appeared to have been broken before - it appeared an old wound - it was always shut as I passed by in the street and looked at it, I supposed it to be secure.</p>

            . I am a beadle of Enfield, which is thirteen or fourteen miles from Wapping. I saw the prisoners at Enfield on Monday evening, the 4th of August, at the Three Horseshoes, by the Chase - when I went on the bowling-green, they were playing at bowls together - it was near upon seven o'clock in the afternoon - I noticed that they were very respectably dressed - I got into conversation with them - they said they had just returned from the Cape - they forced their conversation on me and others without my asking them any question - I had no suspicion of them at that time - I am sure both of them said their dresses were made at the Cape - Stanley had on a drab jacket and waistcoat - he came to me and showed it to me, and said, "I never saw a better bit of cloth" - that it was made for him at the Cape, and the cloth was made at the Cape - Stanley then had it on - Clay had a very handsome valencia spotted coloured waistcoat, on - I noticed it - he said that was manufactured at the Cape - that one of them went there as baker and the other as cook - on the Tuesday evening, about six o'clock, I received information of this robbery, and I went with Watkins, and found Stanley at the Three Horseshoes, the same house as before - there were some people in the parlour, but whether in his company I do not know - Clay was not there - Stanley said that he and Clay had had some words between them, and Clay had taken his jacket away - he said, when I went into the room, "John, I am glad you have come, for Clay has taken my jacket, and I won't leave the house till I get it" - I said, "As you are shipmates, go with me, and I will find it for you" - I took him to the cage, and there told him what I took him for, but not before - I had not said I wanted him - there was nobody but him in the cage, I am positive - he remained in the cage that night - and next morning I and Watkins took him to London - I searched Stanley when I went into the cage, and he had only four half-crowns and some halfpence in his pocket - I took nothing else from him till we got to the Thames police-office - after he had been searched at the Thames police, I returned to the cage the same evening - nobody else was there - the keys of the cage had been at my house all day - nobody could get in without my wife's knowledge - she is not here - on going back, I searched a privy belonging to another cage which Clay had been in - that was next morning (Wednesday) - in the privy among the soil I found a waistcoat, which I took up, and have had ever since - I found nothing there with respect to Stanley - I found a pair of drab trowsers on him at the Thames police-office - he was wearing them - that was part of the clothes which he told me on the Monday, at the bowling-green, were made at the Cape, and he said they were too tight, and would not button by about two inches.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go in search of Clay? A. The same evening, as soon as I had secured Stanley, and found him lying on the bed at his grandmother's - it might be half-past seven o'clock - he appeared to be very tipsy - I tried to make him understand what I wanted, and he could understand - I told him of the robbery at Wapping - he said he knew nothing about it - that he was not there, and knew nobody there - I am sure he said he knew nobody there - I was searching him - I wanted to take his handkerchief off - he took it off himself, and threw it on one side, and in the corner there was a sovereign twisted up - when I was searching him, he was going to strip - he had this valencia waistcoat on then - he swore he would not be pulled about so - I said I would search him - he instantly pulled his shirt over his head, and tore it to pieces - I said,"It is no use, you must go with us" - after that he turned round and jumped into a window, about twelve feet high from the ground, and forced the frame nearly out, but I pulled him back - he had the same waistcoat on as I had noticed overnight at the bowling-green - he had it on then- it was a remarkable pattern, having so many different colours in it - I took him into custody, after searching him, and pulling him back from the window - I examined the bed he was lying upon - when I first saw him, nobody else was on it - I found on the bed a drab jacket which I have had ever since - I have every reason to believe it was the same jacket as Stanley had on at the bowling-green on Monday- it was the same sort of colour - the waistcoat I found in the soil was the one, in my judgment, that Clay had on when he was lying on the bed, and when he was playing at bowls the night before - Stanley had a black waistcoat on, which I took from him, and have had ever since - I found a drab waistcoat in the same room as I found Clay, just down close by the bed-side - on the Monday, when they were talking about their being made at the Cape, I said, "Why, it appears very much like London make," and said, "Why I do not see why they cannot make as good things there as in London; the country is so enlightened" - Stanley said,"The cloth and every thing was made at the Cape."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a tailor? A. No - I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040019"/>not much a judge of clothes - it was a very handsome waistcoat - I did not think any thing of Stanley having money- he had more the night before - their conversation at the public-house was all quite voluntary - I suppose there might be twenty persons there - no questions were asked them - I afterwards went and inspected the prosecutor's premises - I looked at the window; there was no glass in it; it was boarded - I produce the things I found - this waistcoat was taken by me from Stanley, when I brought him down to the cage - I have had it ever since - I found the drab waistcoat just under the window, between the window and the bed that Clay lay on, not more than two feet from the bed.</p>
               <p>Clay. He said, at the office, he found the other drab waistcoat on a mangle, where my aunt lodges, which is about a mile from where I was taken. Witness. I did not say so - I never thought of such a thing - there was no mangle there at all, that I know of - I am quite sure I found the drab waistcoat in the room where I found him on the bed, and it was doubled up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have produced a valencia waistcoat found in the soil? A. Yes; he had it on when I apprehended him - he tore it to pieces in the cage - I found it torn in the morning - I am certain it is the same waistcoat which he wore on the Monday and the Tuesday when I apprehended him, from the make and pattern of it, he was so particular in showing it to me - it is a very curious pattern and collar - when I took him it was whole - he did not rip it up when he jumped up at the window.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street horse-patrol. When Clay was apprehended, he took a handkerchief off his neck, and threw it down - this was at his grandmother's, Mrs. Thorogood, before, he was taken out of the room - I have had that handkerchief ever since - in the corner of it, I found a sovereign: about three quarters of an hour after, I told Clay I had found a sovereign in his handkerchief, and he said, "I had no handkerchief on, nor yet a sovereign" - I have a pair of trowsers which I took from Stanley - they were taken off him the next day at the Thames police-office - I have had them ever since - I told him to take them off, which he did - after taking them off, he said that when they got off the coach in Bishopsgate-street, Clay gave him the clothes, and said to him, "Do not you say you had the clothes from me?" - I produce the handkerchief and trowsers which I took from Stanley - this is the handkerchief the sovereign was tied up in - here is a silk handkerchief which his aunt gave me, and which the prosecutor claims.</p>
               <p>Clay. I never told him I had no handkerchief on at the time he took me - he never spoke to me in the watch-house about a sovereign and handkerchief. Witness. I did, an hour after, and he denied having a handkerchief or sovereign.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you apprehended Stanley, he went quite quietly with you? A. He did; he did not know what he was going about.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at Enfield. I am Clay's aunt. On the Sunday before they were taken, the two prisoners and another man came to my house - the other man went away - he was a stranger; I do not know his name - it was between twelve and one o'clock, as well as I can guess - they dined at my employer's, where I work, and both stopped there that night - they came together to me - I gave Watkins a handkerchief - Henry Stanley put that handkerchief on my neck, on the Sunday night, and said, "I give you this handkerchief" - I said, "I do not want it, young man; keep it yourself" - I cannot swear to the handkerchief - because I did not undo it, and never saw it since - the one I gave Watkins was the one I got from Stanley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you always told the same story about Stanley giving you the handkerchief? A. Yes; I never asked who it was gave it to me, because I could not remember - I have been in the prison once to see the prisoner - his mother-in-law asked me to call - I did not ask that question, when I went - Stanley wanted me to say it was Clay - I am in the employ of Mrs. Crofts, a laundress- she was not at home when the prisoners slept there - the master of the house was, and he allowed them to sleep there - they came to the house between twelve and one o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>MR. DEVEREUX re-examined. This valencia waistcoat is mine, I am sure of it from the size, it being so small - I am very small - and from the colour of it, but it has been washed since - I had a waistcoat of this sort on the Saturday night before the mischief was done - this agrees with it in pattern, shape, and quality - I have worn this jacket nearly three months, and know it by the collar, buttons, and the length of the arm - I cannot positively swear to this drab waistcoat - I had one of this description, a new one, in my drawer, which was taken out that night, but I had not worn it - it was of this quality and stuff - I have not tried it on - I know these trowsers produced by Watkins perfectly well, by two marks on the knees, which I had done with tar - I have had them in my possession about twelve months - the marks have been there a month- I ran against a tar barrel - I had not worn them for nearly a month - I had seen them in the drawer within three days - I believe this handkerchief to be mine - I bought the piece, and have the fellow handkerchief in my pocket - the one has been washed which I produce, the other is perfectly new - I have no marks on them - I believe this black waistcoat to be mine by the size, not having any marks - I had one of the sort, and missed it among the rest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is four months since you had seen the window fastened? A. Yes; it was fastened with a padlock and staple - it was wood work - I found a piece of wood broken off where the padlock was - it appeared as if it had been done before.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it be done by a person coming to the house in the daytime, without making much noise? A. Yes; it might - my shop is under the same roof with my dwelling-house - it joins my parlour.</p>

               <p>RICHARD JOHN COX WHITE. On the 10th of May, I carried on business in Addle-street, Cheapside - the prisoner was my <rs id="t18340904-12-deflabel73" type="occupation">errand boy</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. When did you lose your money? A. I missed it on the Saturday following - it was there the Friday night before you absconded - it was my money - I never said it was my mother's money - I rent the house in Spencer-street - my mother lived there, but I rent it - nobody slept in the house besides myself and mother - my grandmother, Mrs. Stevens, might sleep there occasionally - I cannot say whether she slept there from the time you left till I found out my loss - when I removed out of Holborn I lost the keys of the drawers and my cash-box - I lost them in Holborn - I was the last person in the house in Holborn - Mrs. Stevens swept that house out - she and I were together when we found the pocket-book - she saw it fall in removing the bedstead, and took it up, and gave it to me, saying, "Here is a pocket-book" - I saw her pick it up - I was removing from Addle-street at the time - she was nearer the pocket-book than I was - she has cleaned out the house for forty years - she was an occasional servant - I never saw my keys after I left Holborn - I had no doubt about the prisoner's character before - I moved the bedstead in Addle-street in the course of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The bedstead was not in the house at nine o'clock in the morning? A. That may be, for I will not be certain whether it was Friday or Saturday, but I know it was found under the bedstead the last day that I moved away, and to the best of my knowledge, it was the 17th - Mrs. Stevens saw the pocket-book first - there was not the twinkling of an eye - she might see it first - she and I were together - I had received 26l. from Mr. Stewart, in Ratcliff-highway - the pocket-book looked as if it had been flung underneath the bedstead - it was rather dirty - it was a little dusty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I never say I would leave your service? A. Yes; and afterwards asked me to let you stop again - I have no recollection of your telling me you would not stop - I swear I told him to come on Sunday.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040022"/>Q. Had any body else been at the warehouse during the week? A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What keys did you miss in Holborn? A. The keys of the drawers the property was in, but my mother had a key which would open it, and I did not pay much attention to it.</p>

I cannot say - there are two rooms up stairs, and they were both open - I could not swear which room he went into - I am certain he went up stairs, and was up there a quarter of an hour - it was after tea that I moved the bedstead in Addle-street - I saw the pocket-book first - Mr. White was standing by the bedstead at the time - I picked it up, and gave it to him - I cleaned out the bed-room where the money was on the Saturday before the prisoner went up - I did not sleep at White's on the Saturday night - I did not say so at the office - I dare say I slept there in the course of that week, as I slept there very often, but I cannot call to my recollection - the pocket-book was lying under the bedstead - I pulled the bedstead out, picked it up, and gave it to the prosecutor - he said, "It is my book, I wonder how it came here" - it was dusty - the prisoner did not clean the bedroom windows - he came down and said he could not, as the sun was on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who cleaned out the house that Mr. White ran away from in Holborn? A. I do not know what you mean by running away - I cleaned the house before Mr. White left it - I swept part of it out - I did not find the keys there - I swear you told Mrs. White that Mr. White had sent you to clean the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I say I had nothing else to do, and had come to do them, as it was the last time I should do it? A. No.</p>

            . I am a police serjeant. The prisoner came with a policeman to the station-house about one o'clock on the morning of the 18th of June - he said he had come to give himself up for stealing several sums of money, but he was perfectly innocent - I booked the charge against him, and in the morning, when he was brought to go to Worship-street, he said he meant to retract what he had said about his innocence yesterday, and to plead guilty - I said I could not hear that, but if he said he was guilty, he might as well tell me where the property was - he said he had thrown the duplicates down a privy in Addle-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I say it was for stealing money? A. Yes, you did, and said I should find it in the Hue and Cry. I went, by the order of the magistrate, and examined the privy in Addle-street, but the soil was so thin, any thing would perish - there were two privies communicating with one vault, at least seven feet deep - it was impossible to find any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. WHITE. I lost some pawnbroker's duplicates.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the latter end of February, I went to live with the prosecutor, who then lived in Holborn - about March, he told me he was going to run away - he asked me to assist him - I said I would, if it would not get me into disgrace - he said it would not - I removed his goods to No. 46, Spencer-street, and his stock to Addle-street - after that, he asked if I had any objection to going about the streets to sell them at different shops, and he would allow me something - I did so, and sold some - I went to Mr. Saunders, in Ratcliff-highway, and got rid of the whole stock for 25l. - he received the money himself, after which, he was thrown into prison - I went every where to seek to get him bail, and on the Wednesday or Thursday he was liberated, and went into the country till the 7th or 8th of May - while he was away, I quarrelled with his mother - I told her I meant to leave, as she called me names - he seemed sorry, and when White came home he quarrelled with his mother about it - I told him I should leave on Saturday, and on Saturday I did leave accordingly - I met a person that I knew, who said he was going into the country to sell some goods - he asked me to go with him - I said I could not leave that night, as I must shut up the place - he said, "Does your master owe you any thing?" - I said, "Yes," - he said, "Never mind, leave the key in the house, and so as you take nothing away, nothing will be hurt." - I went with him to Canterbury, and quarrelled with him because he would not pay what my master owed me. I returned to London, heard this charge was against me, and I immediately gave myself to the policeman - the policeman said nothing, at the examination, about my pleading guilty - I assure you, I am perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>- SHEPHERD. I am the prisoner's sister. Mr. White called on me three times about the money - the first time, I was not there; the second time, he called where I was employed, and a City policeman with him - he said my brother had robbed him - the policeman said it was 25l. in money, and 5l. in value - he said the money was his mother's - that he went to ask his mother for 5l., and his mother went for the money, and it was gone - the policeman was a dark man - he is not here.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner in White Horse-alley, Chancery-lane - when I got to the station-house, I said he was charged with taking a sovereign - he refused at first to give his name or address - at last he gave his name, and said he received the sovereign from his master, and had lost it - I found no money on him - I examined his pockets - there was no hole in the pocket the night I searched him - but, on Monday, before the magistrate, there was a hole in his right hand breeches pocket - I am certain it was not there before - he had the same trowsers on as when I took him - he did not tell me how he lost the money, when I took him, but, before the magistrate, he pulled his pocket out, and showed the hole in it.</p>

             - I was present at her marriage with the prisoner, at the parish church of St. James, Bristol, in February, 1821- my father was present - he is since dead - I saw my sister yesterday morning alive - they lived together as man and wife for some years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I am obliged to put question which I am sorry for. - How long did you know the prisoner and your sister live together? A. I cannot exactly state the length of time; seven or eight years, I should say - they lived together seven or eight years without separation - she was in a good state of mental health all that time - I think it was about seven years ago that she was ill, in consequence of a fright - she had a kind of fever - her mind was alienated at the time for a short time - I knew her constantly; after her marriage she was in an asylum for a short time; about two months, I believe - her family never considered it necessary - she was not confined by medical advice, and that I know of - she was never but once in an asylum, and that was for six or eight weeks - I did not go to visit her during that time; other branches of the family did - I never saw her; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040025"/>four miles from her - my other sister went to see her - I cannot tell in what state she was - I believe my sister that did go to see her is in London - I saw her five minutes ago - I have more sisters than one, and I am not quite certain whether it was the one who is here, or the one who is at Bristol - I think it was my sister Louisa, but I am not certain - she was dismissed in health - the prisoner afterwards travelled with her.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go with them or know any thing about it? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Which of your sisters are here? A. Louisa; I have a sister who is not here - I think the prisoner and my sister lived together as long as seven or eight years; as far as my belief goes, that was, uninterruptedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear her mental aberration did not frequently separate them in that time? A. Never; I was acquainted with her all the time - they were living near Bristol for seven or eight years, I think - I was living in Bristol - my sister went to Foxhill, I understood, on a visit - I know nothing more of it - I know she went to his mother's - I had no home to take her to; our family would gladly have taken her.</p>
               <p>Q. After she travelled, did any of her family claim the care of her to relieve her health? A. She was considered well when she returned from travelling, and managed her own house - I saw her a day or two before she went to Foxhill - I think that is about six years ago - during the last six years she has been under the roof of her father and mother - she was not separated from her husband in consequence of her mind - she came to our house by invitation, to spend six weeks, and she has remained with us ever since - I really cannot say how long she was living with the prisoner's mother after her confinement; I know she was there; I cannot recollect how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you form a belief whether she was there a month or a year? A. I cannot state any further - I did not go to see her, but other parties did - I was about forty miles from her, and could not leave - it might have been two years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you when she was with the prisoner's mother? A. At home with my mother and father - she might be there twelve months, I could not positively answer that question - I have written to her during that time, and answers have come - I cannot say I have received answers, but my mother has - I have not received answers myself to my letters.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your sister was ill seven years after her marriage, and went to an asylum? A. Yes; she was there six or eight weeks - it was her own husband placed her there - I had nothing to do in it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What were you? A. I was living with her as servant - I first became acquainted with her in July - I was very much in her confidence about the courtship - she saw him at Leamington - I was not sent after the prisoner - I do not know where he lived - she saw him at IIfracombe, in Devonshire - I was with her there, and that was the first I knew of it - I only saw them together once or twice before that - he left that place, and I rather think he travelled - he did not live at IIfracombe, nor did Mrs. Wells - I do not know where he went - I saw him at Leamington - I went there with mistress, but not after him; she went home to Cheltenham, where he lived - she went to Leamington on business, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you know that she went there for the express purpose of meeting the prisoner? A. I do not know - she went there, and I went with her as her servant - the marriage took place perhaps three or four days after that - they were married at Charlton Kings, near Cheltenham - Mr. Heywood returned part of the way from Leamington with us, and three or four days afterwards he married my mistress - I think she was about forty years old- I do not know how long she had been a widow - I should think ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that Mr. Heywood had a wife living at that time? A. No; I will swear I never heard it mentioned - he called himself George Heywood, widower, at the church, and where he bought the license - I have heard a conversation between him and my mistress on the subject - many letters passed between them when he was in different parts - he was a traveller - he has been living in London lately, and carrying on business - I have not known him six or seven years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any reason to know Mrs. Wells knew he had a wife? A. To the best of my knowledge she thought him a widower.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. A. What was Mrs. Wells? A. She kept a ladies' school in Cheltenham, and had the appearance of respectability and property - I have heard the prisoner say he was a traveller - she gave up her establishment at Cheltenham, when they were married - her goods and effects were sold after the marriage - I am not living with her now - I rather think she is in Wales, with some friends, but I cannot say- her father is in London - her brother is a clergyman of the Church of England - I have heard her ask the prisoner how long ago his wife died - he said about five or six years - I heard her ask him where she was buried - he desired her not to say any thing on the subject, for it was a very disagreeable one to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. And on that did she make any more inquiry? A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know your mistress's handwriting? A. I could not swear to it - this is very much like hers (looking at a letter).</p>

Mr. Wells, the brother, I understood, of the last wife - the second wife is no party to the prosecution - the prisoner was carrying on business at Mr. Todds' warehouse - he lived in a street going out of Hackney-road - he was living there in apparent comfort with his second wife.</p>

            . I am a clergyman of the Church of England - I have two papers, one a copy of the marriage register of the parish of Mary-le-port, Bristol, which I examined myself, with the register, in a room annexed to the church - I have a copy of the register which I examined with the marriage register, in the parish church of Charlton Kings, in the vestry-room (read).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You are the brother of the second wife? A. I am - I first heard of her marriage about March or April - I recollect I went to Cheltenham at Easter, and received a letter from my father on the subject - I do not live in London - when I heard it from my father, I was staying at my brother-in-law's house - I do not know whether my father wrote to me or him - it was about Easter - I do not know when my father knew of it - it was not above a day or two before I did, to my knowledge - the match did not meet with the concurrence of my family, for I have seen a letter from the prisoner to my father wishing his consent, and a letter from my father refusing it - the marriage was not known to the family at the time it took place - Mr. Heywood afterwards went to my father's house, and was received, because the marriage had taken place, and could not be prevented - whether he carried on business I cannot say - no complaint was made to any of the family of any ill treatment towards my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the prosecutor of this indictment? A. I hardly know how to answer that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the prosecution is not conducted at your sister's instance? A. It is not, but she has told me, since it was commenced, that it was with her approbation and consent.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Tell me if these letters are her handwriting? A. This I believe to be so - this, and that I believe to be so - but it is more regularly written than she usually writes. It was in my father's house at Highgate, that she told me she was consenting to the prosecution, the night before we last appeared before the Lord Mayor; in the presence of my eldest married sister - I will not be certain whether my mother was present or not - she was not sent away from my father's house - she has left the house for a very proper reason.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The unhappy insanity of my first wife deprived me of her society - I provided for her by putting her under the protection of my mother, with whom she lived till her own friends desired she might live with them - I was separated from her in consequence of her malady for nine years past, part of which time I certainly received her back, and took a house for her at the sea side, and took her about in the hope of restoring her; but the malady came on to such an extent, I was obliged to separate from her. I accidentally met with Mrs. Wells on board a steam-packet - a reciprocal attachment was formed, and being advised that seven years' separation from my first wife would justify me, we were married. Mrs. Wells was acquainted with my first marriage and its result, as she would unhesitatingly tell you if she was here - I have continued corresponding with her in prison for the last month or five weeks, and at this moment I have a letter from her from North Wales, which I do not bring forward, it not being evidence - if her letters were read you would be fully aware that the prosecution was not at her instance. It has been supposed that I formed the marriage from sordid views - this I solemnly deny. Mrs. Wells honestly informed me of her situation, and since I have lived in London I have paid several of her debts - she informed me her family were not rich, and I must not expect property, for her father had failed some years ago, and though she had relations of fortune, I might think they were a lucrative family, but it was not so, and she would not deceive me - if, however, there remains a doubt in your mind as to the affectionate terms on which we lived, her letters would convince you of the attachment between us - the prosecution is entirely against her consent, and by those from whom other treatment might be expected. I had just taken a school for her in the Hackney Road, and employed myself as an agent in London - we had a prospect of a good school - the afternoon before I was taken, I found she had been taken away clandestinely by her brothers, as she informs me - they promised that she should return that night, and only wanted to see her on family business. Though I acted erroneously, I hope you will do me justice, and deal to me a merciful consideration, bearing in mind the disgraceful situation this prosecution has brought on me, being dragged from my employer's counting house at an hour's notice. I have a little family entirely dependent on my exertions.</p>

Sutton, of Bow Church-yard, dealt with me for this medicine - this book is called the ready money book, and this the small diary - here is an entry of the prisoner's, on the 6th of June, and again on the 10th, but no entry on the 7th - if he had received any money on the 7th - it would have been his duty to have entered it in the book, and given the money to me - here is no receipt of 5l. 8s. from Messrs. Sutton, at any time, and he never paid me that sum - I have a tenant named Jarvis, whose house of business is in Long-acre, and who resides in Percy-street - his quarter's rent was 26l. 5s. - the prisoner always collected it, and should have paid it to me - he entered it in this book - here are his entries, with"M. C.", which is my signature, to them, but the last quarter's rent he has not entered, nor has he accounted to me for it in any way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What was this man to you? A. He was nothing more than a clerk - I am in the habit of lending out money at interest - I do not know that the prisoner has negotiated a loan with any nobleman - Mr. Carland, my solicitor, has done it - there was property in the country to the value of 400l., for which I could not get my money - I was advised to send some person down to buy it, and make it over to me - I sent the prisoner down - I do not know that it was made over to the prisoner absolutely, though I am sorry to say I have been very negligent, from the confidence I put in him - I believe the property was not made over to him entirely - the deed may be at home, but I have not got it here - the person who resided in the country, was Mr. Browning - I asked the prisoner whether he had received the money of Mr. Jarvis - I told him I found he had received it - he put his handkerchief to his face, began to cry, and said he hoped I would not be severe with him - I said, "I find you have received this money," and he said he had, or something to that effect - he has not been in the habit of receiving a commission on what he sold - he wanted an increase of wages a few months ago - I said, "I will not increase your wages; but if you write a good advertisement for me, I may remunerate you with a few shillings" - I never intended to give him any commission on what was sold - if he had written a good advertisement, I should have given him a few shillings, whether I had sold a bottle or not - I do not think he wrote more than one advertisement, and I believe that was chiefly one that had been written before - I am not aware that I have made several mistakes in my accounts - nor that the prisoner paid me a sum of money in advance before he had received it of Mr. Eccles - I remember the prisoner being arrested - he told me so, but did not say a word about wanting money - he did not say that, in order to get rid of it, he would dispose of an unfinished work he was writing - when I taxed him with receiving this money of Mr. Jarvis, he began to cry, and said he was doing a work, and he should get money, meaning, as I suppose, that he could return the money - I believe he did say he could get 160 guineas for the work, though it was not perfect - I said I must take the advice of my friends - I have not taken any one into the prisoner's situation, but I suppose I have had a hundred applications - I remember a mortgage with a man named Cook - he owes me a great deal of money now - I did not know that he was a tavern-keeper - his property was not purchased by the prisoner - I know a tobacconist named Maddox - I believe there was a warrant for 300l. given by him - I did not direct the prisoner to buy Maddox's goods in his own name - my solicitor might - I advanced the money to Maddox, but I did not give the prisoner money to buy Maddox's goods - I left it to my attorney - I do not think I gave the prisoner the money with my own hands - I do not recollect it - I swear I am not aware of it- I never saw Maddox's shop - the prisoner told me he had put his name over Maddox's shop after the sale, but it was not by my direction - I gave him some evasive answer, when he told me I knew he did it to prevent other creditors coming in, because I had advanced him more than he was worth.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whatever he may have done with respect to a tobacco shop, or his name being put in deeds, was he any thing to you but a servant or clerk? A. I never considered him any more - I paid him his salary regularly and quarterly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he employed by you, and would it have been his duty to receive the 5l. 8s. and pay it to you? A. Yes, strictly so; and it was his duty to receive the 26l. 5s. for the rent, and give it me.</p>

            . I rent a house of the prosecutrix in Percy-street, for which I pay 100 guineas a year - on the 17th of July I paid the prisoner 26l. 5s. for the last quarter's rent, and he brought me the receipt for it - it was written and signed in Mrs. Canham's name - I gave him a cheque for the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he bring it ready filled up? A. Yes; the cheque has been returned to me by the banker, as paid cheques are - it appears by the banker's book that it was paid on the same day it was given - (Receipt read.)</p>
               <p>MRS. CANHAM. This receipt was written by the prisoner, and I signed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not in the habit of giving him multitudes of blank receipts with your name signed to them? A. I am sorry I did so - I have no doubt I gave him this receipt signed in blank, a considerable time before the money was paid, and he repeatedly told me that Mr. Jarvis complained that he was out of cash, and could not pay - I said it was very extraordinary.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a magistrate of Herts. I came to Mrs. Canham's when she discovered something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040029"/>about the prisoner - I spoke to him about the rent received from Mr. Jarvis - I made him no promise or threat, but asked him what he had done with the rent he had received from Mr. Jarvis, and whether he had paid it to Mrs. Canham - he said he had not, but he had received it, and that he had a wife and family, who he hoped would be taken care of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask him whether it was a cheque or money? A. No - it was on the 11th of August, the day he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the year, 1823, I came to London, and engaged with the late Mr. Canham to manage his business - he died in 1825, and I continued with Mrs. Canham. About eighteen months ago, I had some conversation with her about my salary, and she said she would do the same with me as her late uncle had done with another person, Mr. Whittingham - allow me one shilling on every bottle sold at the full price of thirteen shillings. I regret that she should have taken this step, as the consequence is, I shall be obliged to mention some circumstances which have transpired between her and myself; but the truth is, she sold full half of the medicine without stamps. As soon as we had made our new arrangement, I put down in a book every bottle sold at full price, which book was kept in a drawer with the fruit book. The one was indorsed"Fruit Book," and the other, "Account Book," and she could not see one without seeing the other. During the last six years she has lent not less than £80,000, in sums of from £20 to £4,000, to different persons, on securities, many of which were prepared by myself - not a loan was advanced without her consulting me. I am made a party in some deeds. For some years I have not paid her the cash as I received it, but she and I settled about once a week. I have frequently lent her cash, and paid her money, when I have not received it. Had it been my intention to have robbed her, I could have done so, on several occasions, to a great extent, as I have had £3,000 or £4,000 in my pocket, for days together. I have made her acquainted with sums due to her, of which she has been ignorant; and she consented that I should employ myself in any way I pleased, provided I transacted her business. With respect to the money of Mr. Jarvis's, he told her he had paid it to me, and when she saw me again, she told me of it. I instantly said, "I have received it," and she marked it off, as paid, on a list which she kept in her pocket, of rents and debts due, for which I was to call. I never asked her for forgiveness. A new list was made out every quarter, and the balance of the old list was carried to it. She carries in her pocket a list of what receipts I had, and if she were to produce that, it would appear that she has marked that as paid. Two or three days before I was taken, she talked about a bill that was to be provided for, and said Mr. Clutterbuck would lend her the money; and he offered to lend her the money to make up the bill, which she had not the means of meeting; but Mr. Clutterbuck has been indebted to her for years, and is it likely, if he had any money to spare, that he would offer to lend her money, rather than pay off the debt? But this, and the circumstance of his coming frequently to the office and asking me how the business was going on, has led me to conclude that he wished to get me out of my situation, to introduce one of his sons into it. Mrs. Canham was aware of my being arrested, and of my being compelled to pay another debt or two. There was a balance, at that time, due to her. I told her I could pay her soon, or, if she chose, I could do it then, by disposing of a work, which I was writing, for £165; but she said she did not wish me to make such a sacrifice. She lent Mr. Cook several large sums, on different mortgages, and when he became a bankrupt, I purchased some property of his, at Garraway's, in my own name. She appears to deny that she knew of his being a hotel-keeper, but she has been there and examined the premises, and said to me, and to others, that it was very foolish for Cook to go to so great an expense in fitting up the hotel. Had any suit arisen about Cook's property, I must have been a party to it; and, about two years ago, Mrs. Canham sent me to France, with full power to act in her name: and, would she have done so, had she considered me merely as a servant? About twelve months ago, she lent Mr. Maddox £125 - he got into difficulties, and she came in under a warrant of attorney, she was in possession a few days, Mr. Selby was then called in, to value the property - Mrs. Canham then gave me a cheque on Gosling's, to receive the money, which I paid, desiring Mr. Maddox to transmit the money to Mrs. Canham - I then had the business carried on, and one of the creditors has declared his intention to indict Mr. Maddox and me for a conspiracy. Mrs. Canham also lent me £100, which I was to repay at £10 per quarter; part of which has been paid. When I entered Mrs. Canham's service, I gave a bond for £400, which Mrs. Canham still holds, and, therefore, she cannot be a great loser by me. I have written several advertisements for her - I read her three new and different ones in one day, and she expressed great satisfaction at them. I trust this explanation will prove that there has been no embezzlement on my part. I felt no obligation to account to her for money the instant I received it, but I had no intention of keeping it; and after she discovered the rent had been paid, I remained several days in her service, and managed her business.</p>
               <p>MRS. CANHAM re-examined. Q. Do you hold a bond as security to the amount of £400? A. My late husband did, but I was informed that at his decease it ceased - when I spoke to the prisoner about this rent, he took out his handkerchief and began to cry - I have my pocket list here - I have not marked off this sum as paid - I have marked "stolen" against it - I indiscreetly allowed the prisoner to remain two or three days in my office after I discovered this.</p>

            . I am clerk to Newbury and Co. - the prisoner called a day or two before the 29th of November last, for an account due to Mrs. Canham - he produced a bill of 10l. 18s. - I told him of an omission in it of 5l. 8s., and then he brought this other bill of 16l. 6s.; on the 29th of November I paid him, and he gave me this receipt.(Read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I cannot bring it to my mind - I know nothing of it - this receipt is certainly my writing; but I have often gone into the City expecting to receive money which I was to lay out as I went home, for advertisements and other things - Mrs. Canham has frequently said, "Call at such an office, and advertise, or pay a bill," and when I have got home our accounts have been settled on a bit of paper, I have received and paid so and so - I suppose I did not enter this in the book - she has frequently omitted to enter sums which I have paid her - her porter knows that there have been many errors, and he had seen me drawing out leases and warrants of attorney, and she knows it, though she denies it - then she denies receiving bonuses, but I will name two parties from whom she has received them, and I can bring her own solicitor to prove it - the Marquis of *** and Sir *****, and they have been left with me in a blank at the door.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Mr. Booth here? A. No: I have seen his Christian name on letters which came to the house - I have not seen him write it, nor heard persons call him so - he has no partner - I saw a man's hat in the area that morning - Bagster was drunk, and Ward was without his hat - he said his hat had fallen over, and Bagster tumbled over in trying to get it - there are four lodgers in the house.</p>

             (police-constable C 130). I was on duty at four o'clock, in Regent-street - I saw Ward against the rails of the area - he put his hands on the rails and attempted to get over - I caught him - I looked over and saw Bagster sitting in the area with this basket of wine by his side - I called to my serjeant, who got over and took him, and this wine, which was about two yards from the cellar door - Ward's hat was in the area - Bagster did not appear in liquor.</p>

               <p>Bagster's Defence. I had been drinking with Ward all the evening, and when we got to Regent-street, Ward and I were larking - I knocked his hat over; I went to get it, and fell over.</p>

I went to the house in Spicer-street where the prisoner lodged - the shutters were shut - I got up a ladder, put a stick in, and felt that the sashes were gone - I knocked at the door, the prisoner and a man jumped out at the window - we found the sashes broken up, and part of them burnt, and the glass was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Croft gave me leave to go away. I got a young man to help me to move, and the sashes were then gone. I fell out with the young man, and he threatened my life. I thought it was him that knocked at the door.</p>

               <p>MR. STILWELL. This is the letter I sent, in which the 10l. note was enclosed - it was taken from our cash box - we had not received the prosecutor's dividend then.</p>

On the morning of the 22nd of October, after the prisoner was discharged, I heard the lodge had been robbed - I suspected him, he being the only one who had access to the lodge - he was fetched back, and searched, but nothing found on him, and he was allowed to go - I knew Flood slept in the same cell with him - I had him searched, but nothing was found - I frequently urged him to tell me what had become of the money, being convinced the prisoner could not have taken it all out - after urging Flood several times, he eventually gave me information, and pointed out where the rag was - it contained twenty-seven sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a sixpence, and a penny - after that, the prisoner came to speak to me at the prison gate - I asked him inside - he told me he had heard and seen various reports about Summersell's money, and he had come to tell the truth about it - he said Summersell had not told the truth - that all he had taken was twenty-seven sovereigns, and a half-sovereign, and the sixpence and penny was his own money - I neither threatened or made him any promise.</p>

I am the wife of John Flood - the prisoner came to me, a fortnight ago last Friday, and asked if Flood was at home - I said "No;" he was not likely to come till four o'clock, for he was gone to Pimlico - he asked me if he took his money out of the House of Correction with him - I told him, No, he had not, for I understood it belonged to the governor - he then said, How dare he leave his property; that he left 7d. with him.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge at the House of Correction - on our way to the station-house, he told me he acknowledged to the twenty-seven sovereigns and half-sovereign, but it was not thirty-nine, as Mr. Summersell said.</p>
               <p>JOHN FISHWEEK SUMMERSELL re-examined. Mr. George Laval Chesterton is the governor of the House of Correction - I am one of his servants - he resides within the prison - my house is in the prison - it is a distinct building, but within the walls, and in the parish of Saint James, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had Flood access to the room as well as the prisoner? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening of the 22nd of October, my time was out from being confined - I had been fined 5l. for an affair about the "Mercury" - I was not able to pay it - after being ten days in prisoner, the governor offered me lodging in the prison birth - I used to attend on Summersell, to clean his boots, brush his clothes, and put his clothes away after he has come home at ten o'clock at night - his boxes were never locked during the whole time I was there - thirteen or fourteen others had access to the room as well as myself, and a man had to wind the clock every day,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040037"/>who had to pass his boxes - on the 22nd, I was liberated about ten o'clock, when McAnally and Allen told me if I had no money, they would give me some, to have a pint of ale when I got out, but if I would go to the Vine, I might get what I pleased - they begged me to sup with them that evening there - I went to the house on leaving the prison - I called for a pint of ale, and the two Mr. Allens came in, (who attended the prison) - as I had 6s. or 8s. of my own money, I gave it to get recreation there, but I was sent to the wrong house, and the money was taken from me, and given to me on my departure from the prison - Allens came in and said, "You are wanted" - I said,"What about; am I out before my time?" - they said it was something of that kind - I went back with them to the governor - I was stripped and searched - nothing was found on me but the money given to me in the prison - the governor said he could not detain me - if I left my address, I might depart - I went to my lodging, cleaned myself, and supped with most of the turnkeys - I saw nothing of Summersell - he stopped my things at the Thames police-office next morning - I believe it was the common opinion in the prison, that he had lost nothing - Flood was in the same cell with me - I used to divide my prison allowance between him and another man - he gave me his direction to go to his wife, and tell her when he expected to be out; and I went there - I then went on board the Majestic - on my return, I gave way to inebriety - I went to this woman, who told me what was missing, and that I was suspected - by the time I got to the prison I was quite tipsy - the turnkey let me sit down an hour, and then I got more sensible - but in that state I do not know what I said.</p>
               <p>JURY to HOARE. Q. Was he the worse for liquor? A. Rather so, but perfectly knew what he was saying - he was not searched when he went out of the prison - they are just wiped down - it is customary to search them after their discharge - money taken from them when they enter the prison, is returned when they are discharged - every thing is taken away when they come into the prison, and if money was found on them going out, they would be punished - no other prisoner had access to the room - I opened the parcel before the governor - the 7d. was in it - Flood might think it only contained 7d. in copper.</p>

Until Tuesday morning we had - we had never quarrelled before, but on Tuesday morning a deadly quarrel began - the prisoner's sister-in-law began the quarrel - the prisoner had nothing to do with it then - she took part in it afterwards - the prisoner was the first to come out on the Wednesday morning - bricks were not thrown on both sides - I did not throw one - George and Charles Gowan did not throw bricks or tiles at the other party - they kept up the quarrel by coming to the door abusing us, putting their heads through the window and threatening our lives - no part of our family did any thing - I never spoke a word - in the morning my mother said,"Mrs. Brown, if my husband offended you last night, why not say so last night?" - she said, "I have come to abuse you now for it" - I never saw the prisoner's husband abused or ill-treated in my life - the deceased was a very stout man, but able to walk - he was not ruptured, as far as I know - he was a little troubled with gout.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you before the Grand Jury? A. Yes; and gave this account - I am sure that is the woman I heard use the expression - when she threw the brick, she had on a green gown, which she always wore - I am certain she is the woman who my father told me threw the brick - I cannot say whether she was sober - I never saw her intoxicated.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend on the deceased - I cannot recollect the day, but I was informed he had received the accident the night before- I found him exceedingly ill - I found his disorder was in the lower part of the abdomen - I may say, over the whole abdomen - he appeared in very acute pain - I prescribed bleeding and what I thought proper - I first saw him about eleven o'clock in the morning - he died the day but one after that - there was never any appearance of amendment in him - I had no doubt whatever, when I first saw him, that he was labouring under some internal injury of the vital organs - violence might have produced such symptoms - after death I opened the abdomen, and discovered most extensive inflammation over the whole abdomen - the intestines were glued together in serveral parts, and an effusion in several parts of lymph in a small part of the contents of the bowels - I have no doubt his death was caused by violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Might that piece of a brick, thrown by the hand of a woman, produce the appearance you found? A. I should think it might - the appearances corresponded with what might be produced by violence of that sort - I have no doubt the inflamation a was caused by internal violence alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The whole abdomen I think you say was affected? A. Yes; on my examination after death, it was all affected - but the worst part was the particular part about the centre of the intestines, towards the lower part, near the centre - the abdomen is not very large - I have not seen the same appearances produced by natural causes - I have seen appearances resembling them - inflammation may take place to a very considerable extent, if a person has a permanent obstruction of the bowels - in a rupture, where the gut is strangulated, we should have the same appearances as would arise from mechanical violence- old men are not particularly liable to such obstructions - we are all liable, but not old men in particular.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you heard the man was in perfect health at six o'clock, and was nearly bent double about half-past nine o'clock what should you think? A. I should conclude that arose from external violence, but I have been called to a case of persons complaining of violent pain, and found most excessive inflammation of the abdomen; but in those cases, there were other circumstances, such as a perforation in the intestines itself - ulceration might produce that, but the appearance on the opening would be different to this - I should have found a disease of the mucus membrane if it was caused internally.</p>

            , and live in Shorter's-rents. I remember the night Shubbert was hurt - it was on the 9th of July (Wednesday) - I was speaking to him between six and seven o'clock - he appeared in very good health, and stood as upright as I have known him this four or five years - the prisoner lived at her sister-in-law's - I know her perfectly by sight - on the Wednesday in question, I saw her quarrelling, but did not trouble myself about it - I went out about eight o'clock to get something for my husband's supper - I heard her say that evening, "Take that, you b - y old German b -, I will do for you" - that was between nine and ten o'clock, when I was in my own place preparing my husband's supper - the voice appeared close to the deceased's door way - I did not see him when the brick was thrown - I had seen him there leaning outside his own door, a short time before I heard the expression - I suppose that was an hour or an hour and a half before I heard the expression - I had not heard any quarrelling before with him, but the neighbours and them together were quarrelling among themselves - about an hour or half an hour before there was a quarrel, but I had heard no quarrelling for an hour or a half an hour before - I only heard bad words - I saw no bricks, nor bottles, nor stones thrown, for I was in my own place,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040039"/>but I heard plenty thrown - I cannot say I heard any thrown from any side but Brown's - they threw from by the side of their own door, and they got over the paling, and fetched out brick bats to heave - I did not hear one thrown on the other side - as near as I can tell, from half-past nine to a quarter to ten o'clock, the brick was heaved at the deceased - it might be within half an hour of the prisoner using the expression, that I heard the bricks flying about - they were thrown at persons, not at the windows - I saw the deceased that night, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, or half-past ten o'clock - he was in a very bad state, and in great pain - he could not stand upright, even to be undressed - the doctor was called in next morning, about eleven o'clock, and he died on Saturday morning, at a quarter before five o'clock, in my arms - I never knew him in ill-health before - he was able to do his business at the docks for a fortnight before, and on that day - I never knew him have a word with any of the neighbours - he was a German.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know that he was at all a drinking man? A. No, never; I did not come out of my house during the whole quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. All you can say is, you heard stones and bricks passing from one house to the other? A. Yes; I could take an oath that the Gowans did not throw any of the bricks, because I was up at my garret window, two pair of stairs high, and saw the Gowans - I looked out several times during the quarrel - I cannot tell how often - I will swear it was twice, but it might be three times - I was in-doors for a long time together - I will swear the Gowans never threw a brick or tile - nothing further than using bad words.</p>

            . I am a gun-maker. I live in the Rents next door to where the prisoner lived - I knew the deceased by sight - I remember seeing him on Wednesday, the 9th of July, about six o'clock in the evening - I saw him about nine o'clock - he had a mug or jug in his hand, and was going out for some beer - he appeared as usual in very good health - I know the prisoner by sight - I saw her at six o'clock on the evening of the 9th of July, in the Rents, with her sister and brother-in-law, and her husband - when I first saw them, I heard a noise, and not being very well, I went to the staircase window - I saw her husband, her sister-in-law's husband, and two men stripped, as if to fight - there was a blow or two between the prisoner's brother-in-law and George Gowan, but not more - that might be about seven o'clock, or a little after - I saw the prisoner about half-past eight o'clock - she had nothing in her hand - I heard her say, "You German b - , I will serve you out"- I saw nothing in her hand that night, for I went in doors - I was examined before the Coroner about seven weeks ago - I am sure I did not see her with a brick, or part of one, in her hand that evening - I heard nothing more, and saw nothing more, than I have mentioned - I do not think she was sober - I really think they were all intoxicated - she, her sister-in-law, her brother, and brother-in-law, but I do not mean that the decased was so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were at the fight that you saw? A. It is impossible to tell - the court was full of people - I know there were four standing up to fight, but only two fought, there were so many round them I could not tell how many there were - I do not know how many of the Gowans were there - there was Gowan and his brother-in-law - only George Gowan and the prisoner's brother-in-law were engaged in the fight - George Gowan is Shubbert's son-in-law - her husband was present - he was on her brother-in-law's side - he was not engaged in the fight - I saw him strip, but there was no blow - I did not see her husband knocked down - I saw him shoved into the house with violence - there was a scuffle - I did not hear any body offer to fight the prisoner's husband - George Gowan was the party fighting with her brother-in-law - George Gowan said, "If you will listen to what I have to say, I will make it all quite" - he wanted to make peace - he was stripped to his shirt - he was not sparring - but her brother-in-law said, "No, you b - , I will fight it out," and he up with his fist, and struck him, and then they had a bit of a fight - there were no more of the Gowans there - her brother-in-law was stripped, and her husband, I believe, had his coat off, and his shirt sleeves tucked up - I heard the prisoner say, "You German b - r, I will serve you out" - I did not hear her say, "I will have your life before the day is out."</p>

            . I did not see any thing done to my father-in-law myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present at the fight? A. Yes, and took an active part in it - I saw the prisoner there - I did not put my hands upon her - I did not touch her in the course of the fight, I am certain - I will not say I did not put my hands upon her husband - I am not positive that I did - I will not swear I did not - I did not assault him - I did nothing at all to him that I know of- it was James Hicks who came up to me as I stood at my door in my shirt sleeves, as I usually do - he came up and challenged me to fight - I said, "It is a pity we should quarrel, we never had any words - let us make peace and quietness" - he said, "No; I will have it out," and struck me in the mouth - I put my hand up against him - the prisoner's husband was present at the time, and my brother-in-law - if the prisoner, or her husband, or her brother-in-law, were hurt in the fight, it was unknown to me - it must be very slightly - nobody but me was concerned in the fight - my wife's brother was present, but took no part in the fight - it was only a mere scuffle - I swear I did not challenge the prisoner's husband to fight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time in the evening was the scuffle between you and Hicks? A. It might be about seven o'clock, or a little after - the last time I saw my father-in-law was about half-past eight o'clock, before he was hurt - I did not see him again till he received the blow, which must have been about half-past nine o'clock - he was in perfect health about half-past eight o'clock - he had had some beer for his supper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were two people quarrelling - I was standing with my hand to the wall, and he knocked a woman into the dust-hole - I said, "Do not ill-use the woman"- he immediately struck me a violent blow in the eye, and took and dragged me by the gown, and the hair of my head - I was a shame and scandal to be seen by and body - with that I went to my sister's for wearing apparel to put on - I went for my husband to come from work, and he wanted to go for a warrant to take them up - I said, "No, I will take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040040"/>it on myself" - when I came home the deceased stripped to fight, and was very much intoxicated indeed - I took my husband by the collar, and said, "Tom, come away, and we will go and see if we cannot get some redress" - we went to the office, and saw Mr. Prendergast, who told us to come next morning at eleven o'clock, but we did not - I was taken in charge the next day, and the magistrate said one party was as bad as the other, and discharged me - I went home to my husband, and then went to the Borough to my sister-in-law, who was taken very ill there, and could not go home - on the Monday my husband came and told me what had happened, and I went and delivered myself up to Miller, the officer of Lambeth-street - I am quite innocent of the charge - I never went home till five minutes to twelve o'clock - Gowan tore my clothes to pieces.</p>

               <p>MR. LIDDLE re-examined.

               <p>MARY GOWAN re-examined. My father-in-law appeared very sensible that he was dying - he said so a little before three o'clock in the morning - I sat up with him - he put out his hand to my mother, and said, "I shall never be able to earn another shilling for you, but Ann Brown is the cause of my death" - he had no hopes of recovery from the first - he said so - he died at a quarter before five - I did not tell him that the doctor had a bad opinion of him - his breath was very bad, and his feet were very cold, and he said he did not think he should recover - he said he expected he should die - about three o'clock he said, "That wicked woman, who I never offended in my life, who threw the brick at me, Ann Brown, she is the cause of my death" - those were the last words I heard him say.</p>

I live in Shorter's-rents, near the prisoner - I had known her about five weeks before this occurrence took place - I saw her on the Wednesday in question, near her house - I was present at part of the fight on Wednesday evening, between seven and eight o'clock, as near as I can recollect - I did not know the deceased by the name of Shubbert - I always understood his name was Smith - he went by the name of Smith, as far as I heard - I never heard him called by any other till the time of the quarrel - I came to live in the place about three years since, and he always answered to the name of Smith - I never heard him answer to the name of Shubbert - I saw some of the Gowans at the fight - about six o'clock the deceased was at his own window sitting in a chair - I did not stay long as my husband was ill - I was back in a short time, and saw them strip to fight Mr. Smith or Shubbert - he was stripped, and his son and son-in-law were actively engaged in the fight - I did not see stones thrown then, but at a later hour I saw stones thrown from both parties - I swear bricks and tiles windows, were from Gowan's thrown down into the street - I cannot say who at - I heard the cries up at the window - the clock struck ten at the time - I heard no bad language.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you see tiles and bricks thrown? A. Exactly at ten o'clock - as I was at the window I heard St. Paul's clock strike ten - a young man present called up, "Don't kill the parties below."</p>

            . I am a house-surgeon of Westminster Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought in there on Monday, the day after this happened - there was a wound on her temple about an inch long, separating the integuments in the pericranium from the bone - it appeared to be done by a blunt instrument - I did not perceive any wound at the back of the head - she complained of tenderness on the back of the head, but there was no wound - the skin was broken on the temple - it might be produced by the smaller end of this poker - I should think a blow from such an instrument was very likely to produce death - it depends on the force used - all wounds on the forehead are more dangerous than on the back of the head - the skull is very thin on the temple - a very violent blow with such an instrument on the head, would be likely to produce death - she exhibited symptoms of concussion on Monday - I ordered her head to be shaved, and a lotion applied, but she would not undergo the treatment, and left the hospital - she came again on Wednesday in very great danger, but that was in consequence of her neglect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was but one poker in my room - I ordered her out twice when I was washing up my dinner things - she went down again, and came up with the young woman, who went into the room - I met her, and shoved her outside the door - she fell against the corner of the balustrades of the stairs, and cut herself.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Before the magistrate did you state that he said it was the piece he cut off the night before? A. I did - I had at that time five servants - they all sell goods except the prisoner - two of them are here - I do not recollect saying before the magistrate that I could not speak to the property at all myself - it is not probable that I said so, nor that I said I could not swear to it unless it corresponded with the other piece - nor that I could not swear it had not been sold - I say it is my property, because it agrees with the piece it was cut from, and it has not been cut since he cut it - the shopmen who are not here had permission to sell - other houses have the same sort of silk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any means of knowing this particular piece has not been sold by your shopmen? A. I have not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How can you tell this kerseymere has not been sold? A. I inquired whether it was sold - of my own knowledge I do not know it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure he told you he cut that off the piece the night before? A. I am - he did not say he had sold it to any customer, or account for its being in his box - the officer was present at the conversation - I charged him with stealing the kerseymere - I do not think the silk was mentioned - he said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it occasionally the case that one of your shopmen sells goods to another, and books them to be paid for at the time their wages became due? A. Yes; I should not object to that if it was within the limit of his quarter's salary - I have my books here, and can tell by reference whether any article is entered to the prisoner - if Williams, my shopman, had entered it to the prisoner, I should not object to it, but there is no entry of it - the prisoner would have four guineas to receive at quarter day - this silk is worth 9s. 1 1/2d., and the cloth 16s.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember the prisoner applying for time that Williams might be produced before the magistrate? A. Yes; and he had from the Saturday till the Monday given to him - he did not produce Williams at the examination - he was not asked for- he was informed at the first examination that the books should be open to him, and any body in the establishment he wanted be forthcoming - he did not request William's attendance, and he was not there - he required Almer's attendance for the same purpose, and Almer was there and examined; and the book was produced ready for him if he wanted it - he knew the books were there - he gave no account of the transaction except that he cut it off the night before.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there not an entry in the book of a purchase made by him? A. For a piece of black cloth there is - I opened his boxes on the 29th of July.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure he said he cut the kerseymere off the day before? A. The night before - here is an entry in the book on the 10th of June, of 2 3-8ths black plain cloth, at 5s. 7d.; but this was in July, and this is kerseymere.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there an entry in July of the purchase of any cloth or kerseymere? A. There is not - before the magistrate he said Almer had cut it off, and entered it to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he cut it off, or that it was cut off? A. He said he cut it off himself - he said nothing about the apprentice William nor Almer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now what time of night was it? A. About seven o'clock, as near as I can guess - it was not broad daylight - it was so light I saw the prisoner's face and features - it must be daylight, I suppose, according to the hour - it was at the corner of Grace-church-street and Fenchurch-street - of course, there were more people than the prisoners coming along; but my attention was taken by the woman holding me, and the man hustling me - I did not notice whether there were many persons passing at the end of the street - I do not know the times the steam boats discharge their company - my attention was quite taken to dislocate myself - I had the 8s. 6d. shortly before, as I was in the court in Leadenhall market, I can safely swear it was in my pocket - I live in the Kent-road - the court I speak of leads into Gracechurch-street - I put my hand into my pocket and felt it - I merely put my hand into my pocket, and the money was in it then - I had no reason for doing that - I had not been at all incommoded in the road from the market - I was not incommoded by any body - the pavement was perfectly clear till I got to the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner exchange a word with you, or with any body else? A. He did not with me, nor did I see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040045"/>him with any body else - there might be other people passing - I cannot say whether there was a crowd passing - there might have been; I was in such a predicament with a woman holding me, I felt desirous of getting away, at my time of life - the 8s. 6d. was in my left hand pocket - the prisoner was on my right side - it was the little man and the woman that surrounded me, and the prisoner was on this side of me - they were all in company, when I followed them down Gracechurch-street, and saw them by the church - when I lost the money, I was alarmed, and was under the necessity of pledging a gown, as I came along, to make up the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long elapsed between your being surrounded, as you describe, and the time you say you saw the prisoners together? A. It might be about a quarter of an hour- I went to the oil shop at the corner, and the young man there called a policeman - the little man and the woman went away when I got from them - I afterwards saw them all together in Gracechurch-street, and I saw the prisoner coming out of Talbot-court - they were not all close together, but they were all in company together - he was the width of the court from them, and the little man was with them - he spoke to the little man, and the little man ran away - they were talking - I will not swear he spoke to the little man - he was talking when he came out of the court, and the little man was with him - the instant I took hold of the prisoner, the little man ran away - the officer was with me, but I took hold of him first - this might be half an hour after I lost my money, because I went down Gracechurch-street to see if I could see them, and then had to come back to the policeman - that policeman was gone, I called to one who is a witness, and he went with me - I missed my money as soon as I got under the window - I was so agitated I could scarcely put my hand into my pocket - I did not cross over the way before I missed any thing, nor did I go off the pavement - the oil shop is on the left hand side - I was on the same side of the way when I missed my money - I saw the prisoner searched, and 6s. 6d. was found on him - in silver, 1s. - my money was eight shillings, and a sixpence - I had no mark on it - I had not observed the hand of the prisoner about my person at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which pocket was your silver money in? A. My left hand. The prisoner stood on my right side, when he was by my side, and he was in front of me, I think, two or three minutes - when I dislocated myself from the woman, he ran away - he was there when I got from the woman - I turned round, and asked, what he meant by holding me so fast? - there was no necessity for the prisoner to press against me as he did - the pavement is very wide.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to say he pressed on you? A. He was close to my side, and I turned round, and saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you say he prevented your getting on? A. He did; and walked in this manner, to prevent my going forward - I was obliged to turn towards the window of the oil shop, to avoid him, when I got from the woman.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was directed by the prosecutrix to go in search of the party who she complained of - my inspector ordered me to go - she complained to him - the inspector gave me orders to watch for them - she was with him at the time, making a complaint that she had been robbed - I told her to go in front of me, and any of the party she saw to point out to me - I went in the direction of the bridge, but could see nothing of the party - I told her to come back in a direction from Gracechurch-street, and, at the corner of Talbot-court, she went up to the prisoner, took hold of him, and said, "This is the man, and that is the other man," pointing to a little man - I laid hold of the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house - six shillings and six pence, in silver, was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As she herself took hold of him, what did you do with the little man? A. I could not take him - the moment I laid hold of the prisoner, the other went off - the prosecutrix caught hold of him first - I was not close to her at the time - I was two paces from her - I knew she could not hold the prisoner, and I collared him immediately - the little man made off immediately - I think I was a quarter of an hour with her before I found him - I told him he was accused of robbing the woman of her money - he said, "It is no such thing" - I told him to come along with me to the watch-house, and state what he had to say to the officer of the night, and make what complaint, or whatever he had to say - he complained of being taken into custody, when he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was the spot where he was taken, from where she described herself to have been robbed? A. I should think, sixty or seventy yards.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. I do not know whether you know what time the steam-boats discharge their passengers of an afternoon? A. Mostly from seven to eight o'clock. She was ill-used between seven and eight o'clock - she did not come to the station-house to complain - I saw her at the end of Fenchurch-street - there was a good many people passing along the street at this time - the street was a good deal crowded at the time I took the prisoner into custody - I had not been walking in the direction of the bridge before - I had come from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent of the charge altogether - I never saw her till she met me at the corner of the court, and accused me of the robbery - I have not a doubt anybody who was there she would have mistaken for the person.</p>
               <p>MRS. TEMPLEMAN re-examined. I suppose it was not less than half an hour after I lost my money that I saw the prisoner again.</p>

             (police-constable H 135). About twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 2nd of August, I saw the prisoner in Birdcage-walk - Vincent had two cheeses under his arm - I followed them to Wellington-row - I then saw them again, and Ploughman had the cheeses - I asked what he had got; he said he believed two cheeses, but they did not belong to him, but to the man who was then coming up - I kept him till Vincent came up - I then asked him if they belonged to him - he said he knew nothing at all about them - when I got them a short distance, Vincent said, "For God's sake, let me go; if I must go further, you must carry me" - I then shoved them into a baker's shop, tied their hands together, and made them walk before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHLLIPS. Q. Did you not state, on your examination at the office, that it was twenty minutes before one o'clock when you saw them? A. No; I said about twelve o'clock, or a few minutes after - Vincent had been drinking, but was not tipsy - the prosecutor lives seven or eight hundred yards from where I met them.</p>

               <p>HENRY STANTON. I live in Hackney-road. On the evening of the 23rd of July, I was at a society in Bride-lane - I met the prisoner, and went to a house and drank with him - we then went out, and a girl came and spoke to him - he said she was an acquaintance of his, and asked me to give her something to drink - I said it was too late, the houses were shut up - the girl said, "Come to my house" - I went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18340904-72-crimeloc400">Bell-lane</placeName>

            . I have been stopping at this house since I have been from the country - I went into the room; the prosecutor was there - he said he was not going to stop with the other female - I saw the prisoner come in - he sat by the prosecutor's side, laid him back upon the chair, put his hand into his right hand pocket, and then drew it out, but I did not see any thing in it - the prisoner then left the room - the prosecutor immediately said he was robbed, and the other female ran after the prisoner, but could not find him - she came back, and the prosecutor said he would give her in charge, but she went away.</p>

The prisoners came to my house on the Saturday afternoon - they each of them brought some hay on their shoulders, and pitched it down outside the door, but they said nothing about selling it - they called for some beer, and bread and cheese - the policeman came up and said, "Do you want to sell this, what do you want for it?" - they said, "Three shillings a truss" - they called them trusses, but I do not consider they were trusses - there had been some pulled out - they did not say any thing to me about selling the hay - I said, "What do you bring hay here for? I don't want any."</p>

            . I saw the two prisoners go up to Stone's door with a truss of hay in each cart - they were trusses - I weighed them - one of them was 6 lbs. short of weight, and the other 10 lbs. short - 56 lbs. is a truss - when they put them down, Stone went out and spoke to them, and I heard Haylett say, "Why, you are always grumbling; you grumbled at the truss of clover I brought" - Stone then said he did not want any hay - I then went and asked what they wanted for it - they said, 3s. a truss - I took them and the hay to the station-house, and sent an officer to where they had come from.</p>

             - the prisoner came into our employ on the Monday previous to the 16th of August, and on that day we sent him with a pair of iron chases to Mr. Hopkinson - I gave him 12s. 6d. in money to give change for a sovereign - he did not return - I met him afterward - he said he did not know what he had done with the chases - he had no money - I went with him to one place, but could not find them - he was not drunk when he left me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not sent him to Mr. Cope's in Cumberland-street? A. Yes; and he brought me back 14s. 2d. for a pair of chases: but this pair Mr. Cope would not have - he returned between eleven and twelve o'clock - I went to a public-house with the prisoner, and had bread and cheese and two or three pots of beer - I believe I was only in one public-house - I do not know the sign - I was sober - I do not know what I paid - I will not swear I was not in another public house or two - when I found the prisoner next day he was in Shoreditch, but my partner found him in bed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And yet that shawl she is charged with stealing? A. I did not charge her with stealing it; but she is charged with having stolen it - after she left me, a woman, named Sarah Parr, came to my house, from the prisoner: to tell my nursemaid that the prisoner had her shawl, and desiring her to go to her for it, and to take her a shilling, which she owed her - I did not abuse the messenger and the prisoner - I said the prisoner was a very artful woman, she had robbed me, and at a future time she might expect to see me - and if she would come herself, she might have her two aprons, which she had left in her bed-room, if she would return half-a-crown to a young man who was servant to one of my lodgers - it was about a week before she was taken that I sent this message - if she had received that message, she had that week to have got rid of the property, but I do not know that she ever received the message - I did not know where the prisoner was living, till Mrs. Parr came and told my nursemaid, who told me - there was no letter came to my house for the prisoner - she brought a letter of character with her - I gave that letter to Mrs. Hampton, the lady the prisoner lived with before she came to me; I mean Mrs. Colonel Hampton, the lady who prosecuted her before - I gave it her, because I knew she was under an indictment for perjury - the prisoner told me where she lived, and I gave her the letter - I do not consider that letter belonged to the prisoner - she gave it me, and begged me to keep it until she took her trial - I heard that the prisoner was to be a witness against Mrs. Hampton - the prisoner wished me to give her a character, and therefore I did not suspect her, as I thought her character would be of more value to her than these trifling things - I took up one article in one of the boxes, which I thought was my husband's front, but it was not; and I took up some ostrich feathers, but they were not mine - I do not know that I claimed any other things, which the prisoner proved were hers - there were some plates and dishes taken down, and I said I had lost a great many, but I did not claim them - Mrs. Glass said they were hers, and I said, "Then take them" - I do not know that I swore to any things at the police-office which are not in this indictment.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are there any things which are left out of this indictment, because the prisoner could give clear proof that they were hers? A. There was a little pomatum pot, and the officer asked me if I could swear to that? - I said "No" - I only knew that my husband had a great many such, and it was taken out - I have no connexion with Mrs. Hampton - I never permitted the prisoner to have any of these things.</p>

            ; but Mr. Vickery having by mistake written my name "Hickers," in a former character, it was reported, after my trial at the Old Bailey, that it was a forgery; and, on my applying for a situation, that character was refused. I referred them to Mr. Hilyer, of Poland-street, Oxford-street, who had visited the family, and seen me there; and I called on him, begging him to state so - he said he remembered me perfectly well, and he remembered Mr. Vickery speaking highly of me, but the body of the letter being Mrs. Vickery's writing, Mr. Hilyer could not swear to it, and I was then thrown upon the open world, without friend or home, and destitute of character - in this distress, I applied to Mr. Hilyer, and stated the case to him exactly as it was - he pitied me much, and wished me to write to Mr. Vickery, informing him of my situation, and begging him to write my character in his own handwriting, which Mr. Hilyer would be able to prove was no forgery - but in three or four days after my trial and acquittal here, I was thrown upon a sick bed, and confined, by very serious illness, for a great length of time - as soon as I was sufficiently recovered to take a situation, I wrote to Mr. Vickery - I did not receive an answer for two or three days, and I wrote again, begging him to state the character I deserved while I was in his employ - in answer to this, he sent a letter, stating that I had lived twelve months in his service, and had conducted myself well - this letter concluded with his name and address, but it was directed to me by the name of "Mrs. Hickers" - I observed he had spelt my name wrong, but as my character had been so much injured by the prosecution, that I could not take a situation as lady's maid, I did not mention the mistake - I then heard of Mrs. Dove's situation - I applied there, and took my character - she read it, and said, if I thought proper to take her situation at six pounds a year, as servant of all work, she would hire me; there were six of her family, four lodgers, and all the washing done at home - but she said it would be made up to as good as thirty guineas a year - I entered her service, and when I had been about three weeks, I was one day standing at the door, when I saw Madam and Mr. Follet go by - I was aware that they knew me, and I was much afraid they would inform Mrs. Dove who I was, by which means I might lose my situation - Mrs. Dove's was the most wretched situation I ever heard of- still I determined to remain, as I knew I was starving, and was striving to regain a character which had been taken from me - a month passed on, and I observed a very great change in Mrs. Dove's behaviour - I was afraid she had heard that I had lived with Mrs. Hampton - in a few days after she called me into her room, and said, "I understand I have got a thief in my house, and you have lived with Mrs. Colonel Hampton?" - I said I had - she then said, "I am informed you are married?" - I said, "I am" - she said, "You have entered my service with a false name" - I said, No, I have not - I then explained the circumstances to her, and referred her to Mr. Hilyer, of Poland-street - she then said,"I have heard a most desperate character of you, and Mrs. Hampton has fearful apprehensions of you on her trial, and it would be better for you to go out of town" - I said, "I am a witness against her, and nothing shall induce me to leave London" - she then said, "Mrs. Hampton will give me any sum of money to get you out of the way, that you should not appear on the trial" - I said, I was afraid she would hear of me, as when Madam and Mr. Follet passed and saw me, I knew they would tell who I was - I stated how much I had suffered, and how much I dreaded a repetition of the past - she said, she felt much for me, and if I would stay, so far from allowing Hampton's party to injure me, she would protect me - I then passed two months in her service, suffering every privation - I had not a sufficiency of food to eat, having nothing but dry bread for eight or nine days together; in fact, we were half-starved, yet I submitted to it to regain my character - there was a gentleman named Palmer lived on the second floor - I had to clean his shoes and boots, and he found his own blacking - there was also another gentleman, who lived on the third floor, whose shoes I had to clean, and Mrs. Dove was to find blacking - she told me to black them with the other gentleman's blacking, and she made out bills for them as if they were cleaned at the hotel, giving me strict orders not to tell Mr. Palmer's servant - I had frequent opportunities of witnessing Mrs. Dove taking sugar and whitey brown paper of his, and if sixpenny-worth of biscuits came, she would take three or four of them - finding this to be the case, I had very little hopes of getting more than the 6l. a year - the time, however, for Mr. Palmer settling his bills came round, and Mrs. Dove said, no doubt he would give me two sovereigns, but he gave me nothing - Mr. Palmer's servant said that nearly a quarter of a pound of tea was taken - I made a reply, "Mrs. Dove has taken it, and she is in the habit of doing it; I should not like the gentleman to suppose that I had taken it, and if you will tell him this, and he will call her, I will say the same" - and Grant, who was then the nursemaid, corroborated my statement - when I have told Mrs. Dove I was dissatisfied with her situation, and that she had deceived me, she would fly into a rage, and say, I ought to be thankful that she kept me, and that if I left her, she would report it over the neighbourhood, and left it be known that I was a person who was tried at the Old Bailey - the gentleman then missed his French polish, and he said to Mrs. Dove, "My French polish goes very fast" - Mr. Dove called me up, and said to him, "Find out the thief, and I will prosecute them without mercy" - I said, "Mr. Dove, you know the shoes on your feet were cleaned with the polish in question" - Mrs. Dove then flew in a passion, and said, I was the person who had been prosecuted - that I was the thief who had stolen the blacking, and the polish, and that Mrs. Hampton and her would send me out of the country, if possible - I said, if she had any charge, she might prefer it - Mr. Dove wished a policeman to be sent for - I said I wished it too - Mrs. Dove then said,"Her character is well known as a reputed thief, and will the gentlemen believe I have robbed them, when she is a wellknown condemned felon at the Old Bailey?" - I then said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040051"/>would leave her service immediately, and she desired me to get my things ready, and leave the house - I said I had no box there, (finding there was only a damp kitchen to put it in, and her husband was in the habit of routing the boxes,) and I must back," and Mrs, Dove said, "Here is a shawl, take this and tie your things in; I dare say you are going to Mrs. Wilson's" - I said, "No, I shall be at Mr. Glasse's, No. 6, West-row; Eliza owes me a shilling, and if she will call on me with it, she shall have the shawl" - I tied up my things, and took them into the parlour, and said if there was any thing of hers she might take it, and not to say as she had of the servant I succeeded; that she had robbed her of a silver fork, and she detained her things - she said she had lost nothing, and every thing there was my own - Mr. Dove said it was not from any merit due to me, but I wished to get a character - when I left, I applied to the green grocer for a situation; they said they could not think for recommending me, as Mrs. Dove had represented I was a thief - I said she should prove it - I then sent Parr to desire Mrs. Dove to give me the character I gave her, and said, I would sent to her to give me a character, and if she did not give me a just one. I would have her up to Marlborough-street- Mrs. Dove came out of the parlour, and spoke to Parr - she said I was a thief and a robber, and if there were a possibility of getting me into Newgate, before the week was out, she would do it - I sent word I was at Mrs. Glasse's, in West-row - Parr brought back her message to me, but I took no notice of it, as I knew I had not taken any thing of hers - on the Thursday following, I was at a young woman's in Maddox-street, when Schofield came, about three o'clock in the afternoon - he rang, and the servant went to the door - I heard a man say, "I am an officer of Marlborough-street" - I went up, and he said to me,"Ann, we have met once more in our lives; I have a search- warrant against you" - said, "Who has taken it out?" - he said, "Mrs. Dove" - I had slept with Ann Bargeley the night before, and my pocket was on the table- I then took my pocket in my hand, though Schofield had sworn that I untied it from my person, but that I deny; neither did I hand it to Mrs. Glasse in any clandestine manner - I had it in my hand, and I said, "Here, take me pocket, and put in into your pocket, as I do not like to be seen carrying it in my hand" - when we got to Marlborough-street office, he said, "You must go into the office with me" - I made no objection, and Schofield persisted in taking Mrs. Glasse in - she was then desired to turn out the contents of her pocket - she gave up my pocket, and said, "Here is the pocket that Ann gave me, but I do not know that you have any thing to do with mine;" she was compelled to turn out her pocket, but nothing was found but her own property - I was then taken to West-row - I looked at Mrs. Dove and said, "What have you to say against me?" - she said, "You shall find out" - there was a bundle tied up in the shawl - Schofield said,"Where are your boxes?" - I said, "These three" - the first was a deal box, without a lock at all, and in that these books were found - she then took a baby's cap, belonging to me, and said, "This is my husband's false front, take it to Marlborough-street" - Schofeld said it was a baby's cap; and she said, "It is exactly like my husband's false front, and I should have sworn to it" - she then took a piece of holland, and some other things, which she swore to, while I stood by silently, and allowed her to take any thing she thought proper - the next was a hair trunk - I pointed out the key, and it was opened - Mrs. Dove took from it these window curtains, and said, "These are my property, she has stolen them from me" - she turned every thing out, but took nothing more - the next was a bonnet-box, from which she took three ostrich feathers, and said,"These are mine, take them to Marlborough-street" - Mrs. Glasse said, "No, they belong to Miss Faulker, I can swear" - Mrs. Dove then turned round, and said, "I think we have got enough; I forgot, my feathers are gone to be cleaned" - they then talked of searching Mrs. Glasse's trunk - I said it was not mine, but I had forgotten that I had bought it of her, and I gave the key to Schofield - Mrs. Dove said, "You will find a pair of shoes in that trunk which belong to a lodger of mine" - it was opened, and the shoes were found- she said, "These are Mr. Palmer's" - I said, "These I took out of pawn, with a duplicate which you know I found" - Schofield said, "Where did you find it?" - I said, "Down the area" - the bundle was then opened, and the things were put all together, Mrs. Dove saying, it was all her property, and she would take it to Marlborough-street - I said I had had the cup and saucer when I lived at Mrs. Hampton's, but Mrs. Dove said they all belonged to her, and they were taken - when I was placed at the bar, at seven o'clock, the office was crowded, and Mrs. Dove began her statement - she said I had entered her situation with a forged name, and a forged character - that I had been a most inveterate thief, and that she had dismissed. me at a moment's notice, and the property produced I had robbed her of - the things were then placed on the bar, and she swore to them - when she took the cold cream-pot up, Mrs. Glasse said it was hers, and the magistrate allowed her to withdraw that - she stated that the candles were hers, and two of them were moulds; but they were all wax, and surely if she had lost them, she must have known what they were - she then swore to the blue bag, and some pieces of soap, and the blinds - she then took up the cups and saucers, which I can prove are mine; and though I cannot, unfortunately, prove that all the things are mine, yet I can prove this brown holland, which she has sworn to, was never in her house - this china cream-jug and the table-cloth belonged to my mother, who is dead - the china cup and saucer I brought from Devonshire; and the child's cup and saucer I bought at the door, for the purpose of making a present to a friend's little girl - the window-curtains she gave me to give to a poor old woman for neckerchiefs, but she is gone to the workhouse, and they were made dusters - the pieces of chintz, and bits of crape, Mrs. Dove gave me in exchange for a green band, to make her little boy's hat large enough - and these bits of carpet she threw out one day, and said, "You say you have an old footstool at Mrs. Glasse's, these may do to cover it." I now leave it to you to say whether it is likely I would risk my liberty and character for these paltry things, which would not fetch me half-a-crown, and which if found on me would certainly convict me; and whether I would have kept them for a week after I had received her message, to have risked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040052"/>transportation, after enduring what I did in her service to gain a character.</p>

               <p>Q. Then how came you to say, you had not been here twenty times? A. I do not know; there might he two names in a case - I do not know what I earn daily in my business - I do not know what it is, 1s. 6d., or 2s. a day - I got 3s. 6d. last Session.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what did you mean by swearing you did not know what you would get? A. Because this is a London case, I was told there is a difference - I was in a London case a long while ago - I cannot tell when I first appeared as a witness; it was when my father had been robbed of some shoes - I did not rob him, you are as likely to do that as me - it might be five or six years ago, since I appeared in my father's case - I will not swear that it is within six years - it was not ten years, I am certain - I was examined here last Session, before his Lordship, in the case of a handkerchief, and two boys - I forget their names - the Jury did not say, on that occasion, they would not believe one word I swore.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Then it would be out of his duty, in the absence of any other person, to take money for goods? A. Quite so; he was not trusted to receive money.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you remember the transaction in question? A. Yes; the prisoner was in our shop that day, and intrusted with the shop at that time - there was nobody but him in the shop when I went up to dinner - it was his duty then to serve whatever was asked for, that he could serve, otherwise to call either the warehouseman, or myself - I was at home - I desired him, if I was wanted, to call me down.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not told him he might serve without your presence? A. I had not; but he had done so previously, though he was not told by me to do so - I had not complained of that to him, because he never put the money in the till, but gave it to the shopman - I trusted him to receive money in the shop if any body called, and to pay it to the shopman, who was answerable - his duty was not to put it in the till, but to give it to the shopman - I went up to dinner about half-past one o'clock - before I went up, I counted the money in the till, and marked it - there was one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and one pound in silver - I left nobody but him in the shop - he was trusted with the till at that time - it was open - it was never locked.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. When you looked in the box, you found a hat of your master's? A. I did: I saw him take it off the ground, and put it into the box - I was certain he took a hat - I did not see the box open when he first came into the shop - I did not see whether there was any hat in it when he first came in - I am quite sure there was no other hat there besides the one I took out of the box - an old hat was left behind, which did not belong to us - the prisoner must have brought that old hat with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he possibly have taken this hat by mistake? A. No: because the hat was found laid very carefully on two other hats, and the hat which he took had been on the ground in quite an opposite corner - I was with him all the time he was in the shop - I did not see him place the old hat down, it was at the door - my back was turned to him at one time, while I was looking for the size he asked for.</p>

            . I am one of the firm of Finch and Green, who are oil merchants. We deal with Miss Dawson - I paid the prisoner a cheque for 8l. 15s. 6d. on her account, and he gave me this receipt, which I saw him write - here is the cheque I gave him for the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you pay him the cheque yourself? A. I did; I remember the circumstance perfectly well - it is my own handwriting - it says, "Pay to Miss Dawson, or bearer."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the cheque returned to you as paid, by your bankers? A. It was.</p>

            . I am an ale and porter merchant, and live in Spur-street, Leicester-square. I owed Miss Dawson 4l. 8s. 9d. - I bought the goods for cash at her house, and I paid the money to the prisoner, who delivered the goods to me in my counting-house - I paid him 4l. 8s. 9d. and took his receipt - I am not positive whether I gave him any change or a £5 note - here is his receipt, which I saw him write (read).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him sign that? A. Yes; I believe the whole bill to be his handwriting - I am sure I paid it to him - my brother at times attends to my business - I am sure I paid the money myself; but I do not know whether in a Bank-note or coin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish Miss Dawson's books to be produced, to show how she proves I did not pay her the money; for she may swear that two years ago I have received hundreds of pounds for her, for which I have no receipt - I had no cash-book to put it down in.</p>
               <p>MISS DAWSON. I have my books here - they contain an account of sums received about that period - I make the entries myself - I ask him what sums he receives, and set them down - I never omitted to set down what he paid me, or told me was paid - nobody but myself kept the cashbook.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Was there any other book kept, between you and the prisoner? A. He kept a waste-book- I am convinced he never paid me these sums, or told me they were received - he paid to nobody but me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was another book in which entries were made quarterly from that one. Witness. I never saw it; if there was such a book, you must have taken it away with you; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There has been another book which her late father used; it was locked up in the iron safe, and the key delivered to her - it was in my writing. Witness. I always locked the chest myself - I know of no book but the three produced, the cash-book, ledger, and waste-book- the bills were made out from the waste-book which he kept - these goods are entered in the waste-book, but not the payment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If she denies there being such a book three hundred times, she is a perjured woman - I wish it produced.</p>
               <p>MISS DAWSON. There was an old book of my father's accounts, as he had the business before me, but not of my business - I have kept a cash-book since October; before that I had no check against the prisoner - he left me in June - I pointed out to him a sum of 4l. odd, due from Mr. Davis, of Hackney, and said, "When are you going to receive that?" though I knew he had received it - I told him I supposed he knew he was answerable for what he was doing, and said, "Mr. Davis's account, of Hackney" - he said, "If I cannot live one way, I must another," and on the Saturday he left, as I heard he had received another sum - I did not then know of these transactions.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor, and have been so for three years. I had suspected the prisoner - I saw him make two attempts to pocket shoes, on the 27th of June; and on the 28th, I saw a pair in his left hand pocket - I charged him with it - he first denied it, and then said he had a pair of old ones - the shop then began to fill, and he came to me and said he hoped he might rest happy and safe in my not communicating the circumstance to Mr. Lloyd - he then turned out of the shop; and on the Monday I told Mr. Lloyd - these are the shoes I saw in his pocket - I could read the figures on the toes of them as he walked about.</p>

             (police-constable C 179). I received information, and went to Mr. Lloyd's, on the 30th of June. Mr. Lloyd sent for George Filewood, and said to him,"Have I not heard something unpleasant about you?" - he said, not that he knew of - I took him to the station, and he gave me his address in Lambeth-walk - I went there, and found one pair of Blucher boots, one pair of shoes, one spur, and a duplicate of a pair of shoes - I then made search amongst the pawnbrokers, and found above two hundred pairs in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Those you found at his house had been worn? A. They appeared to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040063"/>have been worn once.

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker. I have seen George Filewood at my master's - he has pawned boots and shoes there - I have seen James Filewood there frequently - I have five pair of shoes - one pair of boots was pawned by James Filewood - I cannot swear which of them pawned the others - part were brought by one, and part by the other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You are sure that one pair was pawned by one of the prisoners? A. Yes; I cannot say which pair he left - I always had a suspicion of both the prisoners, that they pawned them with the intention of leaving them, and I was careful not to lend too much on them - I lent 5s. on this pair - they would fetch me about 5s. - we frequently lend 6s. on things which will not fetch more than 5s. to people we know - this pair of boots was pawned on the 30th of December - the prisoners pawned these four pairs of shoes, and James Filewood the boots.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Had he often pawned with you? A. Yes; many pairs of shoes - I advanced a fair value on them - we do not usually advance a full value on goods which we do not expect will be redeemed - I believe it is done.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Do you rub off the mark when you sell them? A. No; we sell a great many - I cannot swear these had not been sold.</p>
               <p>JAMES LLOYD. These are my shoes - they came from Northampton - great part of these are marked in the prisoner's own writing, and part by my apprentice - these boots are not marked - the man who made them is here, but he cannot swear they were made for me - one pair of those produced by Pyatt were marked by the prisoner, the rest I only know from having lost so great a number.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you know when they were marked? A. I have no earthly conception- I seldom sell in my shop - I think it not very probable that these were sold by my shopman, finding them as I did- I think James Filewood could not have bought them for 5s. a pair - he could have sold them for more than he pawned them - I have missed great quantities of boots and shoes - I have not found the fourth part of what I lost - I do not know that I have complained of my apprentice not entering goods sent to country shops - I have no recollection of persons calling to pay for goods which had not been entered - it may have happened - that may account for a pair or two - some of these cost me 5s. a pair, some as little as 3s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM BRYMER PYATT. Q. Are you quite sure that these four pair of shoes were pawned by the prisoners? A. Yes; some by one, and some by the other, but I cannot say which - I never saw them both together.</p>
               <p>George Filewood's Defence. I never had any thing to do with any of them - when Mr. Pyatt was before the magistrate, he said he had seen me in his shop, but could not swear to my pawning any of the shoes.</p>
               <p>James Filewood's Defence. I have been in the habit of buying and selling shoes many years - I attend sale-rooms - I bought a great many in King-street, Convent-garden - no man alive can swear to them.</p>

The two prisoners were in the habit of pawning shoes, and I supposed they were husband and wife; but when they came again I found they were not - on the 30th of December, the female prisoner came and brought this pair of shoes (I had had this other pair of them before) - she said they were her husband's, and that her name was Ann Brown, of Cornwall-road - I said I suspected they were not honestly come by- I sent a lad to inquire if she lived there, and she did not - I then said she must give me her own name, and she gave me her right name - she said she would send her husband, but she went away, and I saw no more of her till she was in custody.</p>

             (police-constable N 144). On the 9th of July, I was on duty on Stamford-hill, at a quarter before eleven at night. I met the prisoner, who had fast hold of the little boy by the hand - the prisoner was a <rs id="t18340904-122-deflabel695" type="occupation">sweep</rs>

               <p>CORNELIUS SANDS. This is my son - his name is Jeremiah - I came home from work about half-past eight o'clock that night, and he was lost - we went to several station-houses, and had no rest - the next morning the officer brought him - he goes to church, and knows good from bad.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH SANDS. I saw the prisoner sitting on our stairs, and he said, if I would go with him, I should have a good master, plenty of shoes and stockings, and plenty of victuals - and I should be a good way off, so that my father and mother would not see me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he was willing to go if I would take him to a good master - he should like to be a sweep. Witness. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master persuaded me to come to London to entice a little boy away, to come and be a sweep, and he would give me a sovereign - I came from Stamford, in Lincolnshire.</p>

            . I am a painter, in the prosecutor's employ. I was working at the same wine-vaults - I saw the prisoner come out of a pawnbroker's shop - he showed me the duplicate of a dusting brush - he had owed me 6d., and paid it me - on the 1st of August, I saw him take a handpot full of lead away, and some dryers - I gave information on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did he show you the duplicate of the brush? A. On the 31st of July, at dinner-time - I had lent him sixpence that morning before breakfast, that he might stand a drop of gin - I and two or three more had asked him to do it - he said, if I would lend him 6d., he would stand some gin - I told him he must let me have it before dinner, as I seldom brought more money out than was necessary to carry me through the day - I had no idea he was going to pawn his brush.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did you not say, "D-n it, pawn your duster; you can take it out again?" A. No - I did not go with him to the pawnbroker's, and take the 6d. from his hand - I waited outside of Mr. Weller's till he went home, as I understood, to get the money - I was surprised when he came out of the pawnbroker's, and I asked him what he had been up to - I told him he had better not have done that - I did not mention that to the magistrate - I was not asked it - Mr. Sowter was not going to turn me away on the Saturday night afterwards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had you seen them last? A. On the evening before - there is no private mark on them - I was sitting at breakfast in the parlour, a little before eight o'clock that morning, and looking towards the shop - I was about twelve yards from the shop door - I had a pretty clear view of the shop - while I was taking my coffee I saw Tyson at the window, but I had no suspicion - it would scarcely take a moment to go to the glass-case - it was locked, but the key was in it - I considered I kept a sharp look-out, but a person might watch when my eyes were off the door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. It was very young, was it not? A. Yes; but not very lively - it never broke out of the field - we bred it, and have got the mother of it- when they are breed together they never go away - the mare was in the meadow with it - I fastened the gate myself that Friday night - the meadow is enclosed with a hedge - I do not know that there are any gaps - the gelding had a shoe off, and I traced it above a mile - the nearest turnpike road is a quarter of a mile from the field, but the gate opens on the heath - they cannot get off the heath, there are gates to stop them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is Missenden from Paddington? A. Twenty-eight or twenty-nine miles - it had a shoe come off on Friday, when it was at work, and it was brought up to Paddington without a shoe - it came by our house on the common - I could not trace it till it had got about half a mile from the house, on the road going towards Cheshunt and towards London - I do not know the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer of Paddington. On Saturday morning, the 23rd, about four o'clock, I met the prisoner, leading this colt along Hanover-road - I asked him what was the matter with it - he said he thought it was griped - I examined it, being used to horses - I suspected it was stolen - I advised him to give it something to eat, and I would come and see it again, and to put it somewhere - I went at six o'clock and saw the colt again, and seeing symptoms of its being very much beaten, I detained him at the Red Lion, where the prosecutor came and identified it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You seem to call it a colt? A. I have been used to horses all my life - we always term them colts, though it is a two years and a half old gelding - a horse-dealer would call it a colt.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Would not you also call it a gelding? A. Not unless I was asked if it was a gelding - I should take it out as a gelding it is a clean cut gelding - I met him at four o'clock in the morning, and took him at eleven.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How did you take him at eleven o'clock? A. I took the gelding at six o'clock, and waited till he returned to the Red Lion at eleven o'clock - he came from London - I had not detained the horse till six o'clock- he was absent then, and did not know it - I did not take the horse from him at four o'clock, but suggested that he had better put it in the stable - I was dressed as a policeman when I spoke to him.(The prisoner made no defence; but

            . I am a coppersmith. I was in the White Raven on Saturday, the 5th of July - the deceased, I believe, did something which vexed Davidson, and in the course of the evening they got angry together - I do not remember their going out of the room - I went into the back yard, and left them - Clubb came into the yard afterwards, and called me - he unbuttoned his trowsers, and showed me some blood on the lower part of his shirt - I believe he did not know at that time that he had been stabbed - there was a great deal of blood on that part of his shirt which a wound in the stomach would make - I saw the policeman come into the yard - the prisoner jumped out of the window - the policeman followed and seized him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. I believe Clubb was a much stronger man than the prisoner? A. He was rather stronger.</p>

            . On the evening of the 5th of July, I was at the White Raven. I am servant there - I found Clubb and the prisoner quarrelling - I was in the skittle-ground - I saw Clubb come out of the room first, and in a few minutes the prisoner followed him, and stood in the passage - the prisoner was not trying to push out - he was prevented by one of his fellow-workmen - he got out in five minutes, or better, and when he got out, I saw a few blows exchanged - I did not see who struck first - I saw both the prisoner and the deceased strike - I saw the prisoner on the ground three times - I saw Clubb struck once on the stomach, and once on the head - as the prisoner was going to strike him on the stomach, I saw him deliberately put his hand into his pocket, draw it out again, and then strike him in the stomach - they were both in a very great passion - the prisoner had been down twice before this took place - he was not exactly knocked down - he laid down more out of cowardice than any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he was in the passage, was not Clubb calling on him to come out to fight, and taunting and challenging him? A. Yes, he was - Clubb took him by the collar, and pulled him out to fight - Clubb was the best fighter, and the strongest man - the prisoner would have had no chance with him - when he fell, it was because he found he was opposed to a stronger man - the last time he was on the ground, Clubb tried to strike him while he was down, and was prevented - the prisoner had laid down- the blow was struck on the stomach before the prisoner laid down - the deceased did not seem as if any thing ailed him after he received the blow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the prisoner would not get up, what did Clubb do? A. He stood swearing, and taking very great oaths what he would do if he got up - the prisoner did not wish to get up - he was afraid of him - I think he had had enough of it.</p>

            . I was in the public-house, at the bar, taking a glass of something - I saw Clubb come out of the parlour - he rushed past me into the street, as if he was in a great passion - soon after I saw the prisoner come out of the room - he passed me quickly as I stood at the bar - as he passed me, there appeared to me in his right hand something like the end of a handle - I could not see of what - his hand was closed, as if he had something in it, but I cannot describe it - he appeared very angry also - I saw a scuffle between them opposite the door, but I never went out - the prisoner was down twice in my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him before the confusion began in the room? A. No; I saw nothing in the parlour.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. William Clubb was brought there on the 5th of July, with a wound on the lower part of the chest, rather inclining to the right side, just about the right groin - I should imagine it was inflicted by some sharp instrument - a penknife, I should think, would do it - he lived from the Saturday night till the Thursday following - I am of opinion, his death was caused by inflammation produced by the wound - I examined the body after death - the wound had penetrated into the cavity of the chest, which would be about an inch - he was a very muscular strong man - I have not a doubt that the wound produced the inflammation,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040072"/>which caused his death - it was bleeding at the time he was brought in - it was a sort of wound a person might receive without being conscious of it - it would not produce a prostration of strength for some minutes - that would arise from the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How deep was the wound? A. About an inch - it was a traverse wound - not circular - the wound was not necessarily mortal, if inflammation had not intervened - the aperture was not at all convex that I observed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could such a wound as that be inflicted by a steel pen? A. I think not; I have not a very clear opinion of that, but I do not think it would produce such a wound.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner about fifty yards from the White Raven public-house - I took him to the station-house, and while searching him, I said, "Have you a knife about you?" and in a very agitated manner he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a penknife - he had no steel pen - I asked him, "For what purpose did you use this knife?" and in a very agitated manner he took it in his hand, and said, "I use it to cut my nails."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How many persons were with you when you first went to the Compasses? A. I went alone - I told them all to go home at first - I told the woman I was going to take her to the watch-house for being drunk - I do not remember any policeman being there, but Garnham, Wells, Drake, Bolton, and myself - only Drake was near me at the time the prisoner made use of the expressions I have mentioned - I dare say he might have heard - all the tustling was directed towards me - Drake had got hold of the prisoner - I dare say he must have heard the expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner engaged in cutting a cigar at the time you came up? A. Certainly not - he had not a knife in his hand when I came up - I saw both his hands at the time - he seized me by the collar with both hands - as he struck at me, I cut him over the wrist with my truncheon - I did not notice any mark of stabs on my truncheon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the prisoner, "I will get you on the gallows, or place you in a dungeon all the days of your life for this job?" A. Never - I never used such language as that, nor any thing like it, that I am aware of - I said nothing about getting him into a dungeon during the affray or afterwards - I never used any such expression on any occasion - the cut is rather inside my finger - it was not done in my attempting to get the knife out of his hand - I never attempted to get the knife out of his hand - I saw him brandishing it about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which hand was cut? A. My left hand - my truncheon was in my right hand - the hand I had hold of him with was cut.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. How did you hold the prisoner? A. By the right lappel of his coat - the front of my finger was not inside his coat - I do not know whether his coat would cover it - I know it was cut in the affray - it was not cut outside - I cannot say how it was cut - in the first instance he had hold of me, but did not hold me above a second - he merely laid hold of me to try to shove me from him - he had not hold of me while I held his coat.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was your finger whole and sound when you put it to his breast to take hold of him, and was it wounded directly afterwards? A. It was - I showed my finger to the policeman - it was bleeding - the blood was running down all the way to the watch-house - McCaffrey is a common prostitute - I knew her to be so before, and knew them all to be bad characters.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the first occasion when the prisoner got hold of the woman, when you seized her, did he seize you at all? A. No; he did not touch me - he let loose of the woman till I got her about thirty yards - they were close behind us as far as the Orange Theatre - that was the first thirty yards - he had not touched me between the time of my seizing her and getting there - Bolton came up at the Compasses before that - he told me to take the prisoner at the end of the second thirty yards - the prisoner kept eight or nine yards behind us during the second thirty yards - when I had her at the end of the second thirty yards she was kicking, swearing, and fighting - the prisoner was eight or ten yards from me when Bolton told me to take him - I do not think that he had been nearer than that after we first started; he was walking between his companions, at the time Bolton told me to take him - I do not recollect that he was saying any thing at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be from your first taking the woman to your getting her the sixty yards? A. I should think twenty or twenty-five minutes - I heard them all talking as we came along the road - I cannot say what about - I had not seen them nearer than eight or ten yards during the second thirty yards - I should think we were not more than five minutes going the last thirty yards, during that time I cannot tell any thing the prisoner said.</p>

             (police-constable B 119). I was present on the night of the 6th of August - when I first came up I was directed by the sergeant to assist Grove in taking the prisoner into custody - he did not tell me what for - he was with the woman - Grove took hold of the prisoner, and said he must go with him to the watch-house - he said he should not - Grove said he must and should - he went a few steps - I then saw him take a knife out of his pocket - Grove said, "He is taking out a knife" - I saw him feeling in his waistcoat pocket - I heard the prisoner use some words, but I cannot tell what they were - I saw him feel towards his waistcoat pocket - Groves said, "He is getting his knife out" - I saw him thrust several times towards Grove's right hand - Grove said, "He is trying to stab me" - I then heard Grove say he was cut, and saw him strike the prisoner on the right hand, which the knife was in - he then passed the knife from the right hand to the left - I caught hold of his left hand, and tried to get the knife from him, but he held it so tight I could not - he then thrust his hand with mine into his trowsers pocket - he got both my hand and his own into his trowsers pocket - he then let go of the knife - it was shut at that time - I did not see that Grove was hurt till we got to the watch-house - I saw his finger bleeding very much, and saw it was severely cut - I saw the prisoner's waistcoat with some blood on it, and some on his hand - he then went to the water, and his hand was washed, and there was no wound on his hand - when he was taken into custody he said it was his own hand that was cut and not Grove's - I found it was not so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not at the Compasses when Grove first went there? A. No - I did not hear the prisoner recommend the girl to go quietly - I came up at the corner of Ebury-square - the girl was going with two constables to the station-house - I did not put my hand to the prisoner's collar directly I came up to him - I did about a minute after - I was about two yards from him when he said something.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he said, "I will knife you, or rip you up," do you not think you would have heard him? A. Not distinctly I should not - I am not deaf - I generally hear pretty well - I was about two yards distant.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You said you heard him say something, you cannot state what? A. I cannot distinctly state the words - I heard him say something.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040074"/>COURT. Q. Did you see the left hand of Grove used at all? A. Grove had hold of him with the left hand - he held his staff in his right hand, and struck the prisoner with the truncheon in his right hand - I cannot say that he never left loose of the prisoner with his left hand - I saw the prisoner thrust with his right hand towards Grove's hand - Grove had not his truncheon out when the prisoner first thrust at him.</p>

             (police-serjeant B 10.) On the night of the 6th of August, at twelve o'clock, I was going along Queen-street - I heard a noise of loud talking - when I got to the end of the Compasses, I saw Grove and Garnham, a policeman, endeavouring to persuade the prisoner and three other men, and a girl, to go away - I asked them why they suffered them to make such a noise - they said they were endeavouring to get them away - the prisoner and the others heard this; they were close by - I myself persuaded them to go away - they refused to do so till they had had something to drink - we told them the house was closed and the people gone to bed, and it was no use to wait there; we could not suffer a noise in the street - the girl was quite tipsy - I directed the constable to take her into custody - the constable went to take her - the other men and the prisoner went and took hold of her - I went to them myself, and told them they had better leave go - four of them had hold of her, but the prisoner most distinctly had hold of her, and one of the others - I said they had better leave go, and the girl said, "Well, I will walk" - she walked about forty yards, the men following close behind us - she then threw herself down, and would not go any further - the two constables had hold of her at the time - the prisoner and the other three came round me, and said,"Do you mean to let her go?" - I said, "Certainly not, till she has been to the watch-house" - this was when she was kicking - they repeatedly said, "Do you mean to let her go?" - I took Grove's rattle out of his pocket, and sprang it, and a constable, named Wells, came up - the prisoner then shook his fist in my face, and said, "You b - , I will be down upon you; I will serve you out" - he was close to me at the time - Wells assisted Garnham and Grove to take the girl on to the watch-house - I followed immediately behind them, and the prisoner and his companions were about five or six yards behind me - I repeatedly told them to keep their distance, and go away, or I should certainly take them into custody - when I came to the corner of Ebury-square, I saw policeman Drake, and directed him to go with Grove, and take the man who had threatened me, into custody, who was immediately behind me - it was very dark there, and I expected every moment they would trounce upon us - Garnham and Wells went on with the girl, and I followed immediately afterwards - Grove and Drake turned round and took the prisoner from the other men immediately behind me - I thought they were coming quietly along - I immediately heard Grove cry out, "He is trying to stab me; he has got a knife" - he cried out that repeatedly, upon which I returned - I saw the prisoner with something in his hand, but could not discern what - I immediately went behind him, and hit his elbows with my truncheon, thinking to make him drop the knife, which Grove said he had got - Drake immediately called out, "I have got the knife" - I said, "Then bring him along to the watch-house" - and with great difficulty we got him there - I saw Grove's finger - there was blood on his hand - it appeared bleeding - the prisoner had blood on his hand - I asked how it came there - he said it was from a cut in his own hand - he washed his hand at the watch-house, and there was no cut on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you hear him say Grove had done it himself, by seizing hold of the knife? A. I heard him say so at Queen-square, but not in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Tell me on what charge you ordered your men to apprehend the prisoner? A. For being disorderly in the street, and endeavouring to rescue the girl McCaffrey in the first instance - she was apprehended for being tipsy and disorderly - the prisoner and the other men said they would not let her go - the prisoner put his hands on the woman, I suppose a minute, after they took her - he was not persuading her to go quietly at that time- when she said, "I will walk," he said, "That is right, walk quietly" - she then went on about forty yards, then threw herself down, and would not go further - the prisoner and three other men surrounded me, and said if we did not let her go, how he would serve me - he was within a yard of us then - it was immediately under a lamp - it was a dark night, but it was not so dark but that I could discern what passed - I was not in confusion at the time - I was as composed as I am now - I will swear it was not one of the other men - that is the man - I did not tell my men what charge to take the prisoner on - I only told them to take him because he had threatened me, and I expected he would trounce upon me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had they used any expressions as they went along? A. They had used different expressions - I cannot exactly say what - I did not overhear what the men said - they were talking of something as I took her along- I repeatedly requested them to keep off, and go away - they kept at the same distance, until they got to the square - they were near enough to pounce upon me in a moment- I did not tell Groves that the prisoner had threatened me at the time - I only told him to take him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Marsham-street, Westminster. On the morning of the 7th of August, Grove came to me - he had a wound in the fore-finger of his left hand, in the inner part - (I think such a knife as this would make such a wound) - it has been under my care ever since - I should consider it was well now, but he has been very ill since that, independent of the wound, and not connected with that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a common cut, has it gone deeper than the skin? A. Certainly, it was about a quarter of an inch deeper - I should think it had no effect on his general constitution - it is not a grievous wound - he has had an attack of fever totally unconnected with that cut - such a cut would not take many days to heal with proper management - if I had seen it at first, I should have dressed it as it had been dressed at St. George's Hospital - it was not necessary to have many bandages - one would be enough - the man is not out of danger, but he is not in danger from the cut.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I suppose the cut was such an one as a schoolboy might give his finger with his penknife? A. I have seen many such cuts given and no harm come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040075"/>of them - I have seen many cuts produce very serious consequences - I have seen cuts like that produce a lockedjaw; and less cuts than that, a very slight puncture.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing a person had laid hold of a knife of that sort when open, with a view to wrest it from the hand of another, and slipped his hand along the blade, might that have done it? A. I should think not, as in that case more fingers than one would be wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose in the hurry of a man attempting to seize an open knife from the hand of another, and the edge of the knife got in contact with the fore-finger, and, feeling himself cut, he withdrew it, might not that have done it? A. I should think it might - I never anticipated any danger from that cut - such cuts are very frequent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Royal Hospital-row, and going towards Westminster, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock - I left there with three more men, but no woman - McCaffrey came up and said, "Will you go and have some gin?" - I said, "We are going to the Compasses, and can have some" - I went to the door of the Compasses and knocked - the landlord came out and served me with three quarterns of gin, and shut the door - while I had the gin, Grove came up and said, "Be off, or else I will take you to the watch-house." I said, "I must not go till I have returned the measure and glass, or I shall be taken for felony" - I knocked at the door, and the landlord came out and received the measure - Grove returned in a few minutes, and pushed the girl into the road - she said something to him - the serjeant of the police came up and said, "Take her to the watch-house, drag her away" - I said, "The girl has done nothing; if you will let her go, she is drunk, I will see her home" - he said, "I will not" - I saw her kick one of the men - I said, "Go quietly" - she got up and walked away - I was going that way, and went on - they turned up a street to go towards the watch-house- I went on about twenty yards, and three policemen came running after us - the policeman turned round before us, and said, "That is the man" - I had part of a cigar which a man gave me, in my hand, cutting it up with a knife, instead of tobacco - they turned short round - No. 119 was the first man that had hold of my collar - he was on this side, and Grove in front - the serjeant said, "This is the man" - Grove seized me by the collar, and said, "He has got a knife!" and, as it was in my hand, he seized the knife, and I seized his hand with my left hand, and wrenched three of his fingers from the knife, and with his pulling the knife he cut himself - if I was going to die to-morrow, I would say the same on the scaffold.</p>

I am a cabman, and live in Castle-lane - I was present at the beginning of this disturbance - I saw the woman McCaffrey - she might be the worse for a glass or two of liquor - we were having some gin at the Compasses - we knocked at the door, the landlord said we could not come in, but should have the gin outside, and we had three half quarterns of gin outside - the policeman came up afterwards, and said, "Go away" - we said, "We are having some gin, stop till we get the measure in," and we gave the measure - they took the female to go to the watch-house - she made a little resistance - they said they would drag her - we asked them not to drag her, and she would go quietly - another man gave the prisoner a cigar to put in his pipe, as he had no tobacco - we turned round a street - the prisoner was cutting up a cigar with a knife as we went along - I saw the policeman lay hold of him - I was on one side of him - they came up and said, "This is the man we want" - they did not endeavour to get any thing from him in my presence - I did not hear him use any bad expressions to the policeman - I went home.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you drive a cab now? A.

               <p>Q. Did any of you take hold of her and endeavour to get her away from the officer? A. No, she threw herself down on the ground, and they carried her - I was standing alongside.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you go along with the officers? A. It was in my way home - I do not know where the prisoner lived - I was quite close to the officers while they were taking the girl along, so as to see any thing that was done, and hear all that was said - George Stirrup gave the prisoner the cigar - he is a coachman - the prisoner asked the policeman to let the girl go - we said nothing about serving them out - I heard no offensive expressions - I think it was after the girl threw herself on the ground that the cigar was given, and the knife taken out to cut it - he took the knife out of his pocket, I believe - I did not notice where he took it from - I did not know there was any charge till next morning - I went away, as I thought they would take us all.</p>

Just after we left the Compasses, not before the disturbance - the girl was going home - the policeman caught hold of her, and was going to take her to the watch-house - the prisoner and I persuaded them to let her go home quietly, and she kicked up no more disturbance - they took her to the watch-house; and directly we got a few yards, we were walking arm in arm, the policeman came and took the prisoner out of our arms - he was in between us - I did not go to the watch-house - they had a bit of a scuffle, I believe - directly I saw him going to the watch-house, I walked home - three or four policemen were going to take him - I could not see what took place - I think four policemen were at him - I think there were six policemen in all - I cannot swear that; there were two taking away the girl,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040076"/>and three or four taking the prisoner - the girl was not sober nor quite drunk - she was a little the worse for liquor - I had been with her I suppose half an hour - I was in company with Beer and her that evening - I had been with Beer all the evening at Fulham - we met the prisoner as we came from Fulham - we met the girl in Jews-road, Chelsea, and came together to the Compasses - I had nothing to drink with her before I got to the Compasses.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing like an attempt to get the girl from the policeman's hands? A. No; we persuaded the policeman to let her go - we did not lay hold of her - we persuaded her to walk quietly - we were standing close by her when she threw herself on the ground and kicked - we were together standing close by the side of the policeman - I gave the prisoner the piece of cigar directly we left the Compasses - before the girl was in custody, he took out his knife and began cutting it - I did not see any attempt of the policeman to strike him with his truncheon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had the Compasses been shut up when the policeman came? A. The door was shut, and the landlord gave us the liquor outside.</p>

             - he is not a customer of mine - I knew nothing of him at the time in question - on the 6th of August, the prisoner came to my house about four o'clock in the afternoon - I did not know him before - he presented a note purporting to be written by Mr. Butler - he said nothing more, but merely presented the note to my young man, as he tells me - I came into the shop immediately afterwards - my young man is not here - I came down myself into the shop, in consequence of reading the note which was sent up to me - I was up stairs when it was brought - I went down and saw the prisoner - I asked him if the note was from Mr. Butler, and if the syringe was for Mr. Butler - he said it was; and the reason why Mr. Butler sent to me was, because he had a country order, and wanted to send the syringe off immediately by coach - I gave him the syringe myself; the value to me is 15s. - he went away with it - I afterwards suspected the note was not Mr. Butler's handwriting, and sent my young man to Mr. Butler to make inquiry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you present to witness the presentation of the note? A. I was up stairs - I swear it is the note my young man gave me - I stated at Guildhall, at the first examination, that I had torn up the note, but found afterwards I had only torn up the blank side of it - I still preserved all the writing - the magistrate said I could be examined again if I found the note - I found it (order read).</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MRS. JONES. Q. Have you been in the habit of buying wood of him while these premises were pulling down? A. Yes - my house is about three doors from Mr. Hobbs' building - the sale was made openly, and other neighbours bought it as well as me - there was no disguise about the prisoner.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN CHAPMAN. My dwelling-house is in the parish of St. Martin, Ludgate. On the 27th of June, I went as far as Bull and Mouth-street, at a little after two o'clock, leaving my wife at home - I returned within half an hour - my wife was down stairs - I found the prisoner in my room - I have but one room, and that is on the ground floor - he is my grandson - he seldom visited me - I asked him where his grandmother was - he said she was down stairs - he went away in two or three minutes, saying he was going out with a cab, and should be back in an hour- he did not live in the house - as soon as he went out, I ran to my drawers, and missed a ring, two boxes, twenty sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns - I had seen them all safe an hour before, when I looked over the money, as I was going to pay my rent with it - I know I locked the drawer - there was nobody but my wife in the house, and nobody but the prisoner came in while I was away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you not lose five-franc pieces? A. Yes; that is the proper name of the coin - the prisoner was apprehended on the 26th of August in London, at the Blossoms Inn, and brought to me - I missed to the value of 40l. in French coin, and two sovereigns in English coin - there might be franc pieces and half-francs - they were kept in my trunk in France - I did not go before the authorities there about it - I came to town to overtake the prisoner - I employed Parish, the policeman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the prisoner, "If you will confess the robbery and restore the money, no more shall be done to you?" A. No - I said, "Sam, what do you mean by robbing me?" - he said, "I don't know" - I did not offer him pardon or forgiveness, or any thing to that effect - he delivered a bag of forty-one sovereigns to the officer - the officer did not tell him he would forgive him if he would restore the money, in my presence - he was unwilling to give it up - he gave it up for fear of being punished, I suppose - I said nothing to him about being punished - I left it all to the officer - he said, "I must search you" - he seemed unwilling to be searched, and moved about and pulled out the silk purse - the canvass bag was found about his watch fob - after some altercation he produced it - I have got back 41 sovereigns and 15s. from him - I lost 40l. - after the money was produced, I said he might go back with me and work with me again, and save his character - he had restored the money to the officer then - I did not say if he wished to remain in London a few days I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040078"/>remain with him - I said I would not mind giving him 2l. 10s. if he wanted to go any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the policeman you did not wish to proceed further against him? A. Not to my knowledge - I might have said such a thing at the moment - I am not willing to receive him into my service now.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 26th of August, in consequence of information, I went to the Blossoms Inn, and found a name booked for Nottingham, but the person's box had been sent to Maidstone by mistake - I waited till the box was returned, and waited to see if the prisoner came for the box - he did not, and next day at one o'clock I went there, and saw him with another person near the window - from the description I had received, I believed him to be the man - I saw him go into the office, and ask if his box had come - he was told "Yes" - I then asked if he was going to Nottingham - I took him to a house where the prosecutor was, and told him I apprehended him for robbing him - he said, "What I have done, I have done in France - I am not in France now, and am not amenable" - I said, "You will find the difference" - I took him to another house, and told him I must search him - he said he would not be searched - I took him into a corner, and he let me search him - I took a purse from his left hand pocket, which the prosecutor identified - I afterwards went to his other pocket, but I could not get my hand to the bottom - I found a garter strap had been put round it to confine it - I took out 41 sovereigns - I afterwards went with him to get his box, and in that I found a hat-cover, which the prosecutor claimed - I said to the prisoner,"How is this? these are sovereigns" - he said, "O yes, I changed the silver for sovereigns" - he desired the prosecutor to forgive him, and said he had behaved very kind to him, and he had done very wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that all that passed? A. As far as I recollect - the prosecutor did not say if he would confess the robbery, and restore the money, he would forgive him, nor any thing of the kind - he did not tell him in my presence that as he had restored the money, he should return to France and continue in his situation - he said to me at the door, "I would not mind giving the poor fellow a sovereign to start him on the road, though he has used me so" - he did not say if he chose to go to Nottingham, he would give him 2l. 10s. to pay his expenses, in my hearing: but he had an opportunity of saying it in my absence, as I went to Guildhall to ask if it could be entered into in this country - the prosecutor never asked me for the money - he said before the magistrate, that he did not wish to prosecute, and he might have said so to me, but I think he did not - I am certain he never asked for the money - I never refused to give it up, because I was not asked - the magistrate would not allow me - I do not recollect his saying he was willing to take him back to his service.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said if I wished to return to France, he would take me again into his employ, and that he would give me 50s. to go home to Nottingham.</p>
               <p>MR. DODSWORTH re-examined. I received no character with him - he came to France, and asked me for a job of work - this is my hat-cover and purse.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were a little more or less elevated? A. No; I was not much in liquor - a trifle raised - I was a little tipsy - I had been to the Still in Barbican, and had a pint of ale, part of a pot of porter, and a small glass of gin - that was all I had there - then I had part of a pint of porter at the Portland Arms, in Long-lane - I had one-fourth or one-fifth of a pot of porter - I do not think above four persons went in with me- I suppose there were about four, but I did not know them - (I did not go to another public-house) - they were not companions of mine - two persons went in with me, and there were others that I knew nothing of - I did not know any of them - I went out by myself - I did not wish to have any more to do with them - I paid 4d. for the lot - I paid it all - I did not wish to have any thing to do with the prisoners - I am not married - I met them after I came out- I was rather fresh - I remember using part of a broken pipe which I lost - I dropped it out of my hand - it fell into the street - I had been smoking - I took it out of my mouth, and let it fall - I have no recollection of it being taken out of my hand - I never saw either of the prisoners take it out of my hand - it might have been knocked out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not making rather free with the prisoners? A. I have some small recollection of it - I was talking to Carmody - I do not say I was making very free with her.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past one o'clock, I observed the prisoners and prosecutor larking together, handling one another about in a lascivious mood - I turned my light off, and stood in a door way - I afterwards heard a cry of "Watch" and "Police" - I ran across in an oblique direction, and saw a woman stooping to pick up something in the road - I crossed to where the prosecutor and Simpson were struggling - he gave her in charge - I gave her to another watchman, and crossed to where I had seen the woman picking something up - I found a half-crown in a tin box - she was gone then, but was taken afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The half-crown was on the ground? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why not interfere? A. It is a common occurrence in that part of the City - if we interfered, they would decoy us away while they robbed houses.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER -. I am a watchman of Cripplegate. I went to the Compter with the prisoners, and in Aldersgate-street, Carmody said, "I know you are a good fellow - if you won't say any thing, I will tell you where I have put the money" - I went with her to Golden-lane - she stopped and took up two half-crowns, out of the kennel, and I picked up one - Simpson said she dinged it, and the other one said she planted it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is dinging? A. I do not exactly know - I suppose she meant taking it away, and planting is stowing it away - I saw the prosecutor that night - he was a little bit tipsy - I dare say he knew what he was doing, he must have known, for he was returning their lascivious motions - I have heard him deny making free with them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH re-examined. I had been drinking - I do not think I was taking out of the way liberties with the women - not going too far with it.</p>
               <p>(Simpson put in a written defence, stating that although she was with Carmody, she knew nothing of the robbery.

            . I am a City-officer. I was in Aldersgate-street - I saw the prisoner and another going up the street with a blue bag in their hands - I suspected them from their looking at the different windows - they came up to Mr. Capey's window - they passed it twice, and the third time the prisoner put his hand up and made a cut at something - a smaller one who was with him held the blue bag, but it was not large enough to receive the things, and the boots fell over - I ran after the prisoner for a quarter of a mile, then brought him back, and the boots were taken into the shop by Mrs. Capey.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On Sunday evening, the 29th of June, I saw a gig pass as I was at my front garden gate - it was about four miles from London - the gig was going, I should imagine, as fast as the horse could go - there were two men and a female in it - one of the men was driving it, and he was urging the horse on with the whip - I then saw a cab pass in the same direction - there were two men in it, and the prisoner was driving - he drove very furiously - the horse was on the gallop, and he hit him with the whip as he passed my garden - it was about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and quite light - one of the men in the gig beckoned his hand towards the cab, as if for it to come forward - as soon as I had seen them pass, I heard the screams of some females, and said, "There is an accident" - I ran out, and saw a child who had been picked up, in the arms of one of the witnesses, and the cab was turned back - I took the horse and cab, and the prisoner, and gave him to an officer as soon as I saw one, which was nearly half an hour - I put the person who was driving, and the same cab, into the hands of Heath - the child was carried to Mr. Richards, the surgeon - the road was forty-two or forty-three feet wide - there was no carriage but the gig and the cab near the spot - they were going twelve or fourteen miles an hour, to the best of my judgment - the child appeared to be about seven years of age - I never said I saw the child on the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw the two carriages, how far was the gig in advance of the cab? A. I should think from twenty to thirty yards - the cab was, in my opinion, attempting to get up to the gig - they seemed to me to keep about the same distance from each other - I did not notice the gig horse, but I did the cab horse, as I had it in my hand for half an hour - I did not see any boots on the horse's fore-legs, but as I did not particularly notice, in the confusion, I cannot swear there were none - I am in the habit of going in wheel-carriages - I have gone twelve or fourteen miles an hour years ago - I never rode in a cab.</p>

            . I live in Blackman-street, Southwark. I was in the Hampstead-road on the evening of the 29th of June, about half-past eight o'clock - I saw a girl, who appeared to be about seven years of age, crossing the road - a gig had just passed me, going twelve or fourteen miles an hour; as fast as it could; and a cab was following it, about twenty yards behind it - it was gaining on the gig- the cab knocked the child down, and the wheel went over her body - I should think the cab was going twelve or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040081"/>fourteen miles an hour, but I am not a judge of that - it was quite light enough for the driver to see the child, but it appeared to me that it was going at such a rate that the driver had not the control over it - I cannot tell how far the driver went before he stopped, as my attention was occupied with the child - I gave it to a gentleman, who took it to the surgeon's - I saw it go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw these carriages, what distance was there between them? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take notice of the cab horse? A. I believe it was an iron-grey.

            . I am house-surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital. The child that was run over was placed in my care - it died the next day - it had a rupture of the liver, a rupture of the spleen, and other injuries to the intestines - a wheel passing over the body would have produced them- there was a wound on the side of the head - a wheel running against it would have occasioned that - her mother came while she was living - I asked her what her name was - she said, "Eliza Fox."</p>

No - I cannot tell whether the horse was frightened at the fall of the poor man, or whether the prisoner was able to control it - the prisoner gave his right address - he did not seem at all intoxicated.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not said, on a former occasion, that Fry buttoned up his coat, and said he had no objection to fight Compton? A. Yes; he did say so - when he got forty or fifty yards, Compton continued to aggravate him, and Fry then said he would fight him for 5s., and if that would not do, he would put down 10s., he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out some more silver; Ward told him to put his money in his pocket, and not think about fighting, and I told them to keep on - and as they were leaving my beat, I told them not to think any thing about fighting, but to go in peace, and the best thing they could do was to go and spend the 5s. - Compton and Davis appeared friendly, and Fry and Ward appeared friendly - they walked together two and two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON. Q. Had you been in the public-house? A. No; I did not hear Compton say he would fight Fry, or any man who took his part, for 5s. - it was not Compton who produced the 5s. - I had known Fry before - I do not know where they went to - Compton was aggravating Fry, and after they got a few yards from my beat, they began again - I called to them to go on - Davis and Ward did what they could to prevent it - Compton would not be pacified, but Fry went on very well - he and Ward kept the middle of the street - the other two were on the pavement.</p>

             (police-constable G 36). I live in Parr's-place, Goswell-road. About three o'clock on this Sunday morning, I heard an alarm of "Police" as I was on duty in York-street - I went to the spot, and met the three prisoners and another man at the corner of Rahere-street and York-street. Fry and Davis had the deceased on their shoulder - they said, "As you are the first policeman we have met, we will give him in charge to you" - that they had found him drunk lying in the City-road - they were three or four hundred yards from the brick-field, and about a hundred yards from the City-road - I asked if they knew him - they both said they knew nothing of him further than finding him drunk - my brother officer stepped over and assisted them with the deceased off their shoulder, and I went down to the station-house for the stretcher - I came back and put him on it, and Fry and Davis volunteered to assist to carry him down to the station-house. Ward and the other man went away when we put the man on the stretcher - they were in a direction from the brick-field to where I saw them - when the man was placed on the stretcher, my brother officer said he was dead - when Fry and Davis were in the watch-house, they said we had better cut it - they left their address there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If a person had come from the City-road, down York-street, they must have met you? A. Yes.</p>

             (police-constable G 177). I was in Macclesfield-street - I heard a cry "Police," and saw several persons with the deceased on their shoulders - I said,"What have you got here?" they said, "We have found this drunken man in the road; we did not like to see him there, as we sometimes get drunk ourselves, so we took him on our backs, to carry him to the first policeman we saw" - I assisted in taking him off their shoulders, and said I thought he was dead - they said they did not know - I sent my brother officer for the stretcher - I again said, "The man is not drunk, he is dead" - Fry answered, "What do you know about it? you are no doctor; you cannot tell a dead man from a drunken one" - I said, "I have seen too many drunken men, not to know whether he is drunk or not" - another officer came up, and I sent for our surgeon - Davis expressed great anxiety to see every attention paid to him, and said, as they had found him in that state, they would not leave him till they had seen him properly attended to- Davis and Fry assisted in taking him to the station-house - the other two men were about twelve yards off, and I called to them not to go away - they followed on for a short distance, and then slipped away - I said to Davis, "Where are your friends gone?" he said, "It is all right, they are coming" - when Fry and Davis got to the station-house, they gave the same account as they had before, and expressed a desire to see him in the morning - his face was perfectly clean - I should think it had been recently washed - his coat was off, hanging by one arm, and one of them had his hat - I did not see the prisoners again till they were at Worship-street.</p>

             (police-constable N 104). I live in Moon-street. On that Sunday morning I went to Featherstone-street station-house, about seven o'clock - I then went to Davis, at No. 2, Bath-street - I found him on the bed, and dressed, apparently a little intoxicated - I aroused him up, and asked if he could tell in what part of the City-road he found the deceased - he said he knew nothing about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040084"/>road, or where he was, as he was drunk - I asked where he came from - he said, "Pentonville" - he said he knew nothing about the City-road; but he would go to his friend, Fry, who should come with him and tell - he then sent his wife for some gin, he drank part of it, and threw the rest into the child's face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the bottom of the deceased's shoes? A. Yes; the Saturday night was very wet, it had rained for several hours, and his shoes were covered with dry brick-dust - I gave information to the inspector, and went to Mr. Rhodes's brick-field - I found some foot-marks, as if there had been a great struggle - that was from four to five hundred yards from where the officer met the prisoners - a piece of paper, a pocket-piece, and a halfpenny, were found there - I afterwards went back to the field with the left shoe of the deceased, and it corresponded exactly with some marks in the field - there was a piece of iron tacked on the toe of that shoe - I fitted it in the presence of Bromley, in more than one or two places - I traced the marks from the gate to where the struggle had been, and they appeared to have dragged the body on the toes - I went to Davis's again - we waited till he came home, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When had it rained? A. From nine o'clock at night till two o'clock in the morning - the City-road was flooded - the shoes had dry brick-dust on them, but the brick-ground is naturally dry and his shoes were dry when I went in the morning - no one sent me to Davis, but I wanted to know on what part of my beat it had happened - I do not go further than the bridge, and this happened one hundred yards over the bridge - I was reported for neglect of duty, but my superiors were well satisfied with my conduct - I went before the superintendent - he told me he thought there might be some neglect on my part.</p>

             (police-constable G 145). I live in Taberacle-walk - I went to where Fry lives on the Sunday morning, about eight or nine o'clock - I waited a little while, and saw him - he had a black eye - he came with me voluntarily - I had a young man with me, and he asked particularly whether he was one of the relations of the deceased - I said,"No."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you not yourself tell him, if he would tell you the whole truth, it would be of advantage to him? A. No; nothing of the kind, I swear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say? A. I said, "If half a dozen people were to come up, and swear you were the man that fought with the deceased, would you call them liars?" - he said, "Mayhap, I might" - I observed to him,"You have got a black eye" - he said, "Yes; I was out taking my drops last night, and got it" - I asked him if he knew Compton - he said, they were shopmen, and he knew him from working him with him occasionally - he was speaking either of Compton or Davis - I found 11s. 6d. on him, and three Union Cards, which I gave him again - Davis asked me how it was likely he should get on - I said I did not know - he then asked for some water - I brought him some, and asked him if he knew any thing about the coins which had been found - he said they had been used in bathing the deceased's temples - he then asked who apprehended Fry - I said, I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you not forget the story you told before the coroner and the magistrate? A. I may not, perhaps, recollect the whole of it - I have stated what I said before the coroner, to the best of my recollection - one of these coins is a pocket piece - I do not know how they could assist in bathing a man's temples - nothing took place between Davis and me, after he said that - I have never detailed a conversation which took place after that - what I said was read over to me, and I signed it - I think there is no conversation stated there which took place between him and me after I spoke about the coin - I might have given him the water after that - he was sober when he talked about the coins being used in bathing the man's temples - I thought they had been used in closing his eyes - something occurred which called me, and I went away.</p>

             (police-serjeant N 9). I live in River-street, Islington. I went to the brick-field - I found a half-penny and a copper coin - I compared the deceased's shoes with the foot marks in the field - they appeared to tally as if he had been in that place - I went to John Davis, and met his wife - I asked her if Davis was come in - she said he was - I went up stairs and found him- I told him I apprehended him on a charge of murder, and cautioned him not to say any thing that would injure himself, as it would be given against him - I asked him if he knew a man named Compton - he said he had a slight knowledge of him - I asked him if he was in the brick-field with him - he said, "You know all about it" - he then said he was very sorry he had told a lie, and he would tell me all about it - he then said, he had been at the Bridcage with the other men, and when they were about to leave, Ward said he would stand a quartern of gin, but the landlord would not draw it - Compton then said, "I am going," and a little man said, "You might have gone before;" that he struck him, and Fry upbraided Davis with it - that they came out to fight, and the watchman prevented them - that Compton then came up to Fry, put himself in a daring attitude, and said, "It was not Davis, it was me," and they then agreed to fight for 5s. - that Fry put down 5s. in Davis's hand, Compton refused to cover it then, but he did in the field, and it was placed in Ward's hand - that they then set to, and in the first round, Compton had considerably the best, but, in coming up the second time, Fry gave him an up hit, and he fell - Fry said, "You don't call that half a round," but he made no answer, and Fry said,"He is done," or "dead" - that they then sat down to consider what they should do with him, and they thought it was best to take him to the public-road, which they did, and he was taken to the station - on the Monday I took Ward in Fryer-street, Vauxhall, about three o'clock in the afternoon- he was on a bed in a back room up stairs - I told him I took him on a charge of murder, and I gave him the same cautions I did to Davis - he did not appear to wish to keep any thing secret - he said he was glad I had come, and he told me nearly the same words that Davis had - he said he gave up the money to Fry, and he took the man to the pool, dipped his silk handkerchief in, and washed him, and endeavoured to restore him, but unsuccessfully.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was Davis gave you the first account? A. Yes; I do not recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040085"/>his saying that Fry said he would rather not fight - they both seemed very sorry.</p>

            . I am a surgeon - I examined the body at the work-house - there was an effusion of blood on the membranes of the brain, which was the cause of his death - there was a discolouration on the outside which corresponded with the rupture within - it might have been occasioned by a blow with a fist - the skin was not broken - it is my opinion it was caused by a blow at the back of the ear - any other part of the head would have been more exposed in falling - in other respects the body was healthy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Suppose a man got a blow on the breast, and fell down on a stone? A. That might have occasioned the same appearance - he might have fallen from his own exertions, but most likely in that case the skin would have been broken - it appeared to me to have been effected by a blow under his left ear, from a man's right hand.</p>

               <p>Fry's Defence. The facts have been greatly exaggerated - I took him to the station-house, and particularly requested them to send for a surgeon if there were any thoughts of his dying; and it was not till after he had been left on the cold step of a door for twenty minutes that the stretcher arrived - I asked two policemen to tell me where the surgeon lived, and I would fetch him - they said, "No" - when I got him to the station-house, I said I was very sorry he was dead, and any information I could possibly give, I would come next morning and give - I told them to inquire if he was married - I meant to go, but I was taken - I asked for some beer at the station-house; but one of the policemen said it was too good for a murderer, and if I would confess, it would be better for me.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Cannon-street-road. I know the prisoner and her husband, they were the father and mother of the deceased - I had attended the child for seven months prior to this - he had an inflammation on the lungs, for which I ordered a warm bath, and the child received benefit from it - on Sunday, the 2nd of August, the child was brought to me with a case of catarrh - I gave it some medicine - the father came again in the evening - I gave a powder to be added to some water to form a lotion, and directed how it was to be used - I saw the child the next morning - it was very much distressed - I ordered poultices to be applied to the feet, and a small portion of brandy and water to be given it - the skin was off the left foot - I saw it three times that morning- the second time the convulsions had taken place, and it died about twelve o'clock, I understand - I consider the death arose from the irritation of the scald of its feet and legs, and the fright it had received - I should consider the feet and legs had been immersed in water - the line of heat was the same height on each leg - if a person had put the child's feet into water, without applying their own hand, they might have made it too hot - a mere immersion into hot water would have produced the effect in so young a child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not been applied to, to go in the course of the night? A. Yes, once; three applications were made for means to use - I think I was first applied to about nine o'clock, and I observed to the father, "If I go to see the child, it will be a loss of time - there is but one treatment for burns and scalds - I advise you to go and use those means through the night," giving him directions what to do - a man came to me afterwards who was very impudent, and said if I would not go, some other person should be got - the father was with him, he apologized for it - I can hardly say whether I was applied to, to go a third time or not.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ - on the 10th of May, I went to Croydon, in the afternoon, leaving the prisoner at Addle-street, and directing him to come to my house, in Spencer-street, the next morning - on Monday morning, I went to my warehouse in Addle-street - I missed two coats, a waistcoat, and a leather hat-box - they had been safe when I left the prisoner there on the Saturday, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040088"/>found the prisoner's jacket on the counter - he should have come to me on the Sunday morning to have received his wages, but he did not come - he should have slept at Addle-street, but he was gone - no one but him and myself had access to the premises.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long had the coats been there? A. They were there when I left on the Saturday - I remember going to see the Trades' Unions walk - I had not one of those coats on that day - I was arrested on a disputed account - you did not get bail, my lawyer got it - you went to Mile-end-road - you left the key of the warehouse with my mother, but that was a fortnight before - I do not know any thing of Mrs. Stevens and another woman ransacking the warehouse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you arrested? A. On the 2nd of May, and I was bailed on the 3rd - I swear these articles were in my warehouse on the 10th.</p>

The prisoner was brought to our office on the 18th of June, about one o'clock in the morning - the officer stated he had given himself up, as there was a charge against him, but he was quite innocent - the next morning he said he was not innocent, he meant to retract what he had said, and he should plead guilty - he said one coat was a Petersham, which he had given to a friend - he had not pawned it.</p>

             (police-constable G 106). The prisoner gave himself up to me - he asked if there was not a black mark against one named Shepherd - I said, not that I knew of - he said, "Yes; there is - I am that Shepherd, I do'nt say that I have robbed my master; but I am down" - the next morning he said he should plead guilty, and he had given one coat to a friend - he did not say in my presence what coat it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the latter end of February, I went to live with this Mr. White - about the latter end of March he told me he was going to run away, and asked me to assist him - I told him I would, if it would not put a blemish on my character - I assisted in taking his things - he was then a hatter and furrier - he asked if I would have any objection to go about and sell his caps; and I took some to Mr. Saunders in Ratcliff-highway, and sold 26l. worth - he never gave me one farthing for it - he then went into the country, and while he was gone I had a quarrel with his mother, and I said I would go away - when he came back he said, what was I going to leave for - I said I should, and I did.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITE re-examined. Q. Did he tell you he should go away? A. No; my mother and him had some words while I was away, but that was passed over - there was 4s. due to him when he left.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Bartlett, a pork butcher, of Fleet-street, gave the prisoner a good character, and engaged to employ him.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. I suppose you had a great deal of conversation with him? A. I charged him in consequence of losing some gun metal - I then found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040089"/>the drawer where these cocks had been was perfectly empty - I did not say it would be better for him to tell me - I said, "This drawer was full of cocks, and they are gone" - he then said, "I have taken from six to eight."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say any thing more? A. No; only expressing my belief that he had taken other things - he had no authority to take them - he said he took them to pieces to make them more portable, and he had sold them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Did you say one word of that before the magistrate? A. I am not certain, but my father did - I was sworn to tell the whole truth - my deposition was read over to me - I was not asked if I had any thing to alter or to add to it - the clerk gave me the paper, and told me to read it and sign it, which I did - I will not swear whether the clerk asked me if I had any thing to add to it - my father swore that the prisoner said that he took them to pieces for the purpose of taking them off - I don't know whether that was taken down - I think my father stated that - I will not swear that he did - my impression is that he did say it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALEXANDER GALLOWAY. I was present when my son brought the prisoner into my counting-house, stating that he had missed a number of cocks, and the prisoner had admitted he had taken six or eight, and sold them to some man in Turnmill-street. I expressed my astonishment that a youth like him should have so degraded himself as to take property with which he had been intrusted, and I asked him how he took them - he said he had separated the parts and taken them in his several pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the officer present at this conversation? A. No; my son and the prisoner and myself were present when he stated this, and asked for mercy and forgiveness - I then sent for the officer, and he never denied any statement that he had made in the presence of me and my son.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he account for the possession of the money? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. What do you mean by saying she passed as a dress-maker? A. I never saw any dress but what she made for me - I have reason to believe she only pretended to be a dress-maker - she did not make my dresses well - our intimacy was very trifling - she is not related to me - I had not made any disposition of my property in favour of any body in case of my death - I never lent her two 5l. notes - I never claimed any property which turned out not to be mine.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in High-street, Islington. I have twelve yards of silk, and a handkerchief, which were pawned by the prisoner on the 7th and 9th of August.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). In the manner detailed in the evidence, I became acquainted with Mrs. Stalker, who readily threw in my way every allurement, even the first night of my taking to the lodging, which I had engaged for my business - a short acquaintance with her established in my mind a sincere regard for her, which seemed reciprocal on the part of Mrs. Stalker, who not only confided in me the most unbounded confidence, but actually assigned to me, verbally, those things which I am charged with stealing, and a great many others which never were in my possession, and, under that idea, however mistaken it might have been, I took these things from her residence - the silk in question, with other articles used in my business, I purchased at Bailey's, in St. Paul's Churchyard, and who have stated to a messenger, that they have a corresponding entry, though not exactly to the same amount, which, from my purchasing several articles at the time, I cannot precisely recollect.</p>

In 1817, I was keeper of the County Gaol, at Horsham - in the spring assizes, that year, George Stuart was committed to my custody - he was tried at the spring assizes that year, and pleaded guilty to the indictment - he was afterwards reprieved, and I put him on board the Captivity, off Portsmouth, on the 6th of May - I have an acknowledgment, which I took from the hulk, for him among other prisoners whom I delivered there - I cannot recollect who gave me the receipt, but I had it on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Allowing for the change seventeen years make in a man, look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you believe him to be the man? A. I am inclined to think so, but I should not like to swear it - seventeen years is a great while.</p>

            . In 1817, I was guard on board the Captivity hulk - I am now chief mate of the Leviathan - I remember Smart bringing a number of transports on board our ship, from Sussex - this is the receipt given for them - I have a perfect recollection of the prisoner - I have not a doubt of his being one of the men brought by Smart on that occasion - he was sent to New South Wales, in the ship Lorkins - I speak from a perfect recollection of his person - he is the man and no other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you go out with convicts? A. Not now - I did then - I did not go out of the country with the Lorkins - he was on board the Captivity from the 6th of May till the 11th of July - and then went in the Lorkins - I cannot tell how many men there were - they were brought at different times - I cannot tell how many were brought at one time - Smart and other people brought them, but generally Smart - he always had assistants with him - I cannot say whether he always came - I am certain Smart came when Stuart came - I cannot exactly remember the names of the others that came - I remember the person of Richard Stuart, who came with him - there was something remarkable in it, as they were supposed to be soldier officers - their manner, dress, and appearance, were respectable, and they were particularly noticed - many persons came to see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever stated that Stuart had a wen on his hand? A. I have said so - according to the written description given, it was so, but a wen can be removed without incision - there was a projection on his right hand - that I have a distinct recollection of - he had a projection, whether from a strain or not, I cannot say - I do not know that I ever said myself that it was a wen - it was entered in the description book as a wen, by the steward of the ship - I have looked at the description book since my attention has been called to the prisoner, but I had a perfect recollection of him before that; and having seen it in the Hue and Cry, I was first applied to about this, in July last - I had not then seen him for seventeen years - I saw him in Newgate on this charge, not before - I was not in London till I was called on this occasion - I should think not less than 8,000 male convicts have passed through my observation since 1817.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I presume Smart only brought the convicts from Sussex? A. Certainly, no others - he brought the Sussex convicts generally, and I believe always - I never had the least hesitation or doubt of the prisoner - when I heard he had escaped from New South Wales, which was about 1829, I said, I should know that man again, see him whenever I might - I believe it was 1829.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you remember seeing him in Newgate? A. Yes; I saw him in the presence of Mr. Cope, in July - I said, in Mr. Cope's presence, that I should know him by a wen on his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you speak with hesitation about his identity until you looked at his hand to see if there was a wen? A. No; at his first appearance, I said, "That is the man, I will swear to him" - I had no hesitation about him - I said I should know him by the wen, but as soon as he entered the door, I said, "That is the man, I will swear to him" - it was before that, I said I should know him by the wen on his hand - I believe it was before I saw him, I said so - I examined his hand to look for a wen, after I had expressed my confident opinion that it was him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there a wen on his hand when you examined him? A. No; I had not the least doubt of him - I know him by his face and his make, independently of the wen.</p>

I am not aware that there is, I have no knowledge of it - I have never been on a trial of the sort - I am certain there is no reward for me - I have heard of rewards being given, but I do not know it for a fact - I never knew any one receive it - I do not expect to get one farthing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The time from the first conviction of the individual named, is seventeen years - there is no evidence but the guard - you have heard his observation as to not expecting a reward: till that question was put, it must have entered your minds that he was influenced by the hope of reward or favour of some kind - how is it to be supposed that a man can take on himself, after seventeen years, to swear to an individual he never saw since? - would any of you gentlemen do it? and, if not, you ought to consider that no other man could conscientiously do it - therefore you will be pleased to weigh the matter in your minds - here is an elderly man, whose foot is on the border of the grave, he will not attempt to do it; but the other man is in the habit of guarding felons, and has become as callous as any of them.</p>

            , Esq. I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, can a wen or excrescence be moved from the hand of a man, without leaving some mark? A. I have paid great attention to such cases - I must say, though surgery has advanced very much indeed, we have not the art of disguising an operation, so much as to leave no mark - it is my decided opinion if a wen is taken off, you must see a mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it was a swelling, which exhibited a general appearance of a wen to an uninformed person, might that be removed without a mark? A. Certainly; I am assuming there was a wen; then there must be an incision.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. An ignorant person might call that a wen which is not one? A. Certainly; all I say is, if there was an incision, there must be a mark - there has been no operation on the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>JOHN NEWMAN re-examined. When the convicts are brought on board, they are generally examined by a surgeon, but not so particularly at that time as they are now - the description entered in the book is done by the surgeon.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether it was a wen do you know? A. I do not - the steward keeps the book - I recollect a projection on the back of his right hand, but I think it must have been a sprain.</p>
               <p>MR. CARPUE. A wen may be taken up into the system, and not be taken off by an operation.</p>

             (police-sergeant N 19). On Wednesday, the 23rd of July, I met the prisoner and Rairdon in Church-street, Hackney - Rairdon told me in his presence he had been accusing him of stealing some money which he had hid - I asked how much - the prisoner said it was four sovereigns, which he had hid in the skittle-ground, at the back of the King's Head - I asked him to show me where - he took me to the skittle-ground, and showed me a small hole, where he had hid it - I asked how he became possessed of so much money - he said he received four sovereigns from Taylor, on the previous Tuesday week, to mind for him - I took him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know he had been sent for the day after the robbery, and came voluntarily? A. He came there with one of the servants - before I saw him with Rairdon.</p>

On Sunday, the 17th of August, I was called on to see Timothy Brien - he was then dead, but not cold - I should think he had been dead about five minutes - I opened a vein in his arm, the blood was rather thick - I squeezed out about an ounce - I examined the body next day with Mr. Bateman - I found a swelling under the right ear, and his back was rather of a livid colour, and so was the face - I removed the integuments of the head, and found the upper part of the temporal muscle had a kind of bruise, and an effusion of blood under the right eyebrow - on removing the top of the skull there was nearly half a pint of blood flowed out on the floor - I found a quantity of coagulated blood over the brain, and at the base of the brain, and down into the spinal canal - the muscles of the neck appeared to have an effusion of blood over the jugular vein, over the right ear - in my judgment his death was produced by external violence - it struck me it was by a blow - there was an abrasion of skin over the right ear - this was likely to be caused by a person fighting.</p>

She went down the court, and I went down after her - Brien was standing there - the prisoner came out at the side door, and gave him a blow on the right side of the head, and he fell - his wife took up some mud and threw it at the prisoner - I looked at Brien and said to his wife, "Go and call the police for he is a dead man" - I observed the manner in which the prisoner slipped out at the side door - the deceased could not see him till he received the blow - he was not aware of it in the least - he seemed quite intoxicated - the prisoner was sober - I left the court, and saw no more till Brien was taken home.</p>

            . I live in Parcel's-court, Islington. The deceased lived about ten yards from me - I saw him on Sunday, the 17th of August, at the Blakeney's Head public-house, at the top of the court, having a drop of beer - I went and saw the deceased and two more men at the bar, having a pot of beer together - we had not finished it when the prisoner came in, and had some beer with the deceased - the deceased said to the prisoner, that he knew some of his signs belonging to the Union - the prisoner said he did - Brien said he was a b - liar - they had some words, and wanted to fight in the public-house - I interfered, and then Brion wanted to fight with me - he was drunk and quarrelsome - I then walked into my own place, and in about five minutes Brien came to my door, knocked at it, and said, "Come out, you b - b -, and fight me" - I stopped in doors - he came, and said,"Come out, you b - rogue, and fight me" - a crowd came round the door - I came out, and took Brien home to his own door - he expressed himself again after a low manner, and tore my coat into bits, and said I should fight him; and then he and I had a row between us and fell to the ground - I struck him open-handed, and put my arms round him, and shut him in his own house - he returned to his own window, and said to me, "Mind, go to bed, and be up at six o'clock in the morning, and fight me" - I said, "Go to bed, and in the morning both of us will forget it" - the prisoner came up, and made a blow at the deceased in his own window - he walked away - the deceased came out of his own house, and followed him forty or fifty yards, down to where he lodged - I walked into my place, and saw no more, till he was carried home by a man - the deceased was not hurt in the scuffle with me - I struck him open-handed, merely to get him into his own house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did he fall from any blow he received from you? A. No; only by laying hold of his collar, and bringing him to the ground - it was not the effect of a blow; I pushed him down - it was not with violence - I put him into his own house, and shut the door - he did not give the prisoner any further provocation than calling him a liar - he wanted to strike him, but I prevented him, and got him out of the house.</p>

               <p>EDWARD CUPPLES DILLON re-examined. I attribute the death of the deceased to the last blow he got, under the right ear - I think, from the manner that was given, and the appearance his head exhibited, and the state of intoxication he was in, that caused the death - extravasation of blood would follow more readily from the state he was in - I think the blow must have been violent, from the effusion of blood I found under the muscles.</p>

            . I am a Thames police-surveyor. On the 5th of July, in consequence of information from Mr. Jackson, I went to the George public-house, Commercial-road, with Fogg, a brother officer, and there apprehended the prisoner Frampton - he asked what he was charged with - we told him with stealing a quantity of books from Baldwin and Craddock's - he asked me if it was for stealing any particular quantity, or whether it was for stealing them generally - I said I did not know, that Mr. Jackson would be at the office and make his charge against him - I took him to the police office - I made him no promise or threat - on our way to the station-house, before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040095"/>I met Mr. Jackson, he said it was trouble had brought him to all this - he was detained until Monday morning, the 7th; I then took him to the police-office - Mr. Jackson was there, and said, "Why, Frampton, I am sorry to see you in this situation; it is a duty you owe to Baldwin and Craddock's, to society, and to the young men in their employ, to disclose the whole transaction" - Frampton said,"I wish to keep nothing secret - I wish to tell the whole truth and keep nothing back" - Mr. Jackson said it would save the officers trouble if he would tell them where the things were - he did not say that i'n a manner of encouragement, or solicitation; he said it straight-forwards, as one man would to another - Frampton said he would tell him where the things were - nothing was said to induce him to think it would be better for him to say any thing.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the prosecutors. I saw Frampton, and said to him that I was sorry to see him in that situation, and the only reparation he could make to his employers, to society, and to the persons in their employ, was a full disclosure - he said, "It is my intention to do it; I have sent to Baldwin's to that effect - but I must tell you I have employed Mr. Hobler to attend for me" - I do not remember making any reply to that - I believe, I said, "Where are the Hogarth's prints you took?"</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not your manner that of encouragement to him to make a disclosure? A. Decidedly not: I had no intention to inspire any hope in his mind that mercy would be extended to him - my only motive was that he should retrieve himself; but not that the law should not take its course.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL CHRISTOPHER EVANS re-examined. Mr. Jackson asked him where Hogarth's prints were, saying it would save the officers trouble if he told them where the things were - upon that Frampton said they were in a case on the wharf - he did not think the case was yet shipped - that it was No. 6 case - after that, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner Whicker, at Stebon-terrace, at the back of the London Hospital, not a great way from the docks - he was in a ready-furnished apartment there - when I took Frampton into custody, there was a young man with him, who he said was his brother - I went to Whicker about two hours and a half or three hours after I apprehended Frampton - I found there the same young man (Frampton's brother) and a young woman, who Frampton said was his wife, they were with Whicker - I told Whicker he had got a box there belonging to Frampton, and asked if he had beard the difficulty Frampton was in - I said, "I suppose you have heard about Frampton" - he said, "Yes" - I opened this deal box there - Fogg put some questions to Whicker - Whicker said he had some books on board the Britomart, and he said he had often given Frampton money to buy books, for he had known Frampton from his childhood - that he knew he was in a bookseller's shop, and thought he could get books cheaper, being in the trade - he said he was going out to Sydney, and meant to take Frampton out as his clerk - I do not recollect his naming any body else who had books there that night - on the 7th of July I went on board the vessel, and Whicker met us there by appointment - while we were on the deck together, Whicker said there were two cases in the hold belonging to him - I said, "But you have another case on the wharf, Mr. Whicker, which is not yet shipped" - the wharf is at the London Docks - he said, "Oh, yes, there is, there is another case on the wharf" - I said I wanted to see the contents of it - he said, "Very well," and went on shore with me: we went to the wharfingers belonging to the Dock Company - Whicker said he wanted to examine a case of books which was on the wharf - he gave every facility to have it examined - the case was marked"G. W. L., 6" - the dock officer sent a cooper with us to open it, under Whicker's direction - the dock officer asked why he wanted it opened - he said, "I am the merchant - I want to examine the property" - it was opened, and I found a quantity of Hogarth's prints, and some maps, as soon as it was opened - on the next day, the 8th of July, I went there again, and brought away the two cases on board the Britomart, and the case on the wharf, and took them to the Thames police-office - the same cases are now in Court - when we went for the cases on board the ship, we went to the searcher's office - Whicker asked if he could have the seals taken off the packages, as he was the merchant, and wanted to examine them - the searcher looked at some document, and said Whicker's name did not appear - that there was the name of Robinson, and they must have Robinson's consent - Whicker said, "I am the owner of the property, Robinson is my agent, why cannot I see them?" - we went to the Custom-house, and at last the searcher allowed him to open them - we got the cases out of the hold - they were given up to Whicker - the searcher said, "As you appear the owner of the property, I shall give them up to you" - I said, "Now, Mr. Whicker, I must seize this property - I insist on having them opened and detained" - I opened them on board the vessel - one of the prosecutor's men was present, and took up several books, and said he could swear to them - I told Whicker I had found him in possession of stolen property, and the onus lay on him to show how he came in possession of them - I said that without having instructions from any body - he said he could not identify any of them, and said, "Take them to the police-station" - he said, while the packages were on deck, "There is mine, and Frampton's, and the Doctor's all packed together, and it is impossible for me to identify any of them" - I asked him how the doctor could identify his - he said, "The doctor had a catalogue of his"- I expressed my surprise at his not being able to identify his - he said, "They came to my house one evening in a cab when I was out - they were all packed in paper parcels, and were not opened."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you told us every thing that passed at the apprehension? A. I think so - Frampton was not present when the cases were searched on the wharf - some books had been taken out, but the packages were not opened in his presence - some books were produced before the magistrate - they were not shown to him in any other way - he was not present at any of the conversation with Whicker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. You alluded to the charge made against Frampton when you first went to Whicker's house? A. I did - from the first moment of my interview with him, he knew the charge against Frampton - I saw Whicker on Saturday night, Monday morning, and Tuesday morning - he was twice at the Thames police-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040096"/>office without any charge being made against him - he kept the Court waiting the third time about half an hour, and then we sent a constable after him - he was committed for trial the third time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He kept the magistrate waiting: was he committed after that? A. Yes; he was committed at that examination - I desired to see the contents of the cases before Whicker said what he did to the searcher - it was in consequence of what I said that he endeavoured to have the cases examined.</p>

I was in the service of Baldwin and Craddock for nearly twelve years and a half - Frampton came into their service some time in August, 1833 - in the beginning of last May Frampton told me he was going out for three or four days - that was a few days before he had asked to go - he never returned into their service - in July last an application was made to me by Mr. Baldwin, in consequence of which I made a full disclosure of the transactions I had been engaged in - I afterwards attended at the Thames police-office as a witness on this charge - I was there shown the contents of the three cases, which are on the floor of this Court - I have looked through them all, with Mr. Jackson - I identified some of the works which I had been concerned with Frampton in taking from the house, but the greatest portion of them I could not swear to - I believe they were all of them such works as the prosecutors had in their possession - a portion of them are in sheets; they were taken at different days and times - here are some of Hogarth's prints which we took from the prosecutor's stock in March - nothing was taken at the same time with them - there are about sixty-four prints - there is one in particular, I swear to as having written on it in pencil,"Cook's plate, Heath's repairs" - (this was found in the case on the wharf) - this enables me to recognise it - they were taken from the prosecutors' premises by Frampton - he had no authority to take them - they were stolen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you receive any money in consequence of his taking these prints? A. No; I was present when he took them away in a roll under his arm - I gave them to him - in one of the cases was found a list of sheets of imperfections, and some memorandums in my handwriting on it - and there is the Annual Register from 1758 to 1819- they were in the three cases, some in each - I have a memorandum on them, which enables me to recognise them as the property of the prosecutors - I can identify the Encyclopedia Metropolitana, fifteen volumes, quarto boards - I can recognise them as their property - there are three sets of books in quires which I could not swear to: but which I had agreed he should have, "Paley's Works," "Cook's Roman History," and "Mills's India."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know in whose employ the prisoner Frampton was before he went to the prosecutors's house? A. Yes; Mr. Dowding, the bookseller in Newgate-street, who has a considerable quantity of prints and books - I am not aware that he has a number of Hogarth's prints - he has bought a great many things from our house - Hogarth's prints were kept in a room - the door was locked, and I kept the key - the prisoner went into the room with me on this occasion - I let him in - I went to look over those prints for him to have a selection of them - I let him in to steal them - that was not the first transaction - he wanted a complete set of Hogarth - it was his object to steal them as well as mine - I do not exonerate myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not to exonerate yourself you gave evidence? A. Partly that, and partly to remove it from my mind - I never shall forget it - I wish to do justice to my employers - I was not taken up myself - I recollect going with my wife, on the 4th of July, to

             - Mrs. Hand was present - I knew Frampton was under suspicion when I went to Harris, and that she had been to Paternoster-row - I told Harris that I had lent him Hogarth's prints - I had thought of telling this before he was accused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, in the presence of Mrs. Hand, that you would say you had lent Hogarth's prints to Frampton? A. I think I did say something of the sort, but I thought better of it afterwards - I had helped him to steal them - they acted deceitfully towards me - Elizabeth Harris said,"Oh, I did not know they came from you - I thought they came from a different quarter" - I did not tell Mr. Baldwin that I had lent them to Frampton - I cannot tell why I said I would tell him so - I do not wish to exonerate myself - mine is an waful situation to be placed in - I have turned King's evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not for the pure sake of public justice that you have come here? A. It is both to save myself and for the sake of public justice - I should be sorry to perjure myself - I do not understand the law.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect to be saved in proportion as the Jury believe you? A. Yes - I should be extremely sorry to deceive Mr. Baldwin - I never did wrong before, nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. Not since the Hogarth prints were taken? A. No; the things are taken in a different arrangement to what I expected - the Hogarth prints was the last trasation - I have had no correspondence with, or any letter from the prosecutors, since I went to gaol - I sent a letter to them, not with an object to get back to the situation - I do not expect to get back - I wrote to them for forgiveness - it was after I was detained in the House of Correction to give evidence, the prisoners were committed for trial - I have come from the House of Correction this morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the writing on the print your own handwriting? A. No; it is the handwriting of Mr. Ebbs, the person who lived in my situation before - I have sold books to the prisoner, and taken money for them, which money I did not account for to my masters - it was not understood so - he gave me money for books which were to be stolen - I received half the usual trade price, and kept the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it half the sale price? A. The sale price is 30 per cent off the selling price, and it was half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040097"/>that price - they went at half the usual sale price - the sale price is 5 per cent. lower than the trade price - the trade have 25 per cent. off the selling price, and the sale price is 5 per cent. below that - I sold them for half the lowest price, which would be 35l. for 100l. worth.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you begin to rob Mr. Baldwin first? A. In January - I never robbed my employer before I began it with the prisoner - I am not aware that Mr. Baldwin had complained of losses of books or prints before the prisoner came into his employ - I do not recollect that - I never did a dishonest act till January - I swear I never stole any article before January - it was Frampton urged me to steal at first - I ought to have gone and told my master, but I did not - after two or three times I fell into the project - I was rather coaxed - I was unwilling at first - I refused at first, and said I would not do it - I did not make the proposal to him - I began to take money from him in January - I took some in part of the first transaction - the "Retrospective Review" was the first he had- I never told my master of this till the prisoner absconded - I was never taken up - I was accused of this, and did not hesitate a moment in telling of it - it was from fear I told of it - Frampton had absconded about six weeks before I told of it - I do not know whether I should have told of it if I had not been accused - I felt miserable under it - I think I should have told if I had not been accused - I do not know how soon - it dwelt on my mind very much - I never knew Frampton was going to Van Dieman's Land.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your motive for telling to save yourself? - should you ever have told but for that object? A. That was my object - I was under the prosecutors's roof in the day time during the six weeks - I never saw any prints of of Hogarth brought by Frampton from Mr. Dowding's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a single syllable about the robbery of the prints till you heard Harris had gone and made a communication, which would implicate yourself? A. No; it was after she had made a disclosure that I gave information.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You have been asked about other robberies, and you say sometimes you received money from Frampton; on those occasions were the books delivered to him in the prosecutors' house? A. Some were, and some not - he was perfectly aware I stole them from the house - he lived at No. 12, Noble-street - this system began in January - one Saturday he was standing at his desk in the binding department, with the catalogue of our works before him, which was open in a place were the Records of Parliament were mentioned - Frampton said to me, "I understand you are going to waste some of these?" - I said "Yes"- he said, "Can't you let me have a set of them?" - I said"No" - he said, "You could if you liked" - and after a little bit, it was agreed he was to have those which were to be wasted, at 10l. - "wasting" them means selling them as waste paper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you always said January was the first transaction? A. Yes; I remember a trade sale at the Albion in October - I have said, that it was immediately after that sale that I began robbing my masters, but I received no money on that transaction - it was a misunderstanding saying January - I gave my evidence to that effect at the Thames police-office - that was merely the time I received the money - I had robbed my master without being paid for it in October - he asked me for a set of books for his private reading - it was sixteen volumes - he was to keep it - it was sold off cheap at the sale - it was a"turn-out," as we call it - I did not steal them for sale till January.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. About how many times did you part with property from your master's house? A. About ten times; it was property that my master intrusted me with- I received some paintings in February from Frampton, valued at 7s. 6d. each - I have delivered those paintings to Mr. Jackson since - he had thirteen volumes of the Records of Parliament, which I delivered all at one time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were Hogarth's prints complete sets, or odd prints? A. Odd plates - there wanted fifty or sixty to complete the set - he had one of each as far as they went - there were sixty-four - the Annual Register was imperfect - they were found in a box - I received a note from him of the imperfection, and it was completed afterwards - I made up the set from 1758 to 1819 - they have an index to that date - it was agreed at 8l. - I was to have received the whole of the 8l., but it was put down with other things, and there was a balance - it was set down in a catalogue at 19l. - that was a lower price than usual.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Excise. On the 12th of May, I attended at Whicker's lodging to pack some books - Whicker was there, and Frampton with him - I saw the books - some on a table, and some on the floor, in the room in which the prisoners were, at No. 7, Stebon-terrace - some of the books were lying open, and some in brown paper - some laid loose on the floor - I attended to pack them to ascertain the weight, that they might receive the drawback when they were exported - the drawback is regulated by the dates of the books - in order to ascertain that, I cut the packages open in their presence - I asked Whicker if he was a bookseller - he said no, he was not" - in order to be entitled to receive the drawback, a person must be in the trade - I asked him whose the books were - he referred me to Frampton - I asked him if he was a bookseller - he said he was in the book line, which answered the same thing - I found a great many second-hand books among them, and said to Frampton, "These books are not entitled to the drawback" - he said, "Throw out any you please"- and I did so - I weighed all the books that were entitled to the drawback - I was there from about ten o'clock in the morning, till about eight o'clock in the evening - it did not take all that time to examine them, but there was a case of stained paper, which I had to cut the ends off - Frampton was not there quite all the time, but he and I packed the books - Whicker had nothing to do with packing the books, but he was backwards and forwards - they were packed down stairs in the yard - Whicker had the opportunity of seeing them - the paper was all taken off in the room in his presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you mean he was there all the time? A. All the time the books were being examined up stairs, but not below - he was there - I was attending to my business, and do not know what he was doing, but he was in the room, and it was a small room - any body could see what was going on - the books were on the floor, and on the table - I believe the books on the floor were open, and the others were in brown paper parcels,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040098"/>about a half cwt. each - I do not know that Frampton lodged in the house, nor that Dr. Hall lodged there, and was going out in the same ship - I understood Whicker to say, some of them were Dr. Hall's works - he did not say"books."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were known to Frampton, as an officer of the Excise? A. Yes - I told him I had seen him somewhere before - he said, "Perhaps you have seen me somewhere, "I had seen him frequently at Baldwin and Craddock's, where I frequently go - he had not sent for me himself - the note was written by the agent of the vessel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In how many cases were the books packed? A. Two - I sealed them - they were sent to the docks - they went on board ship - I did not pack the one on the wharf.</p>

I lived with the prisoner, Frampton, as his wife, at No. 12, Noble-street: about three months ago I went to the prosecutors' with a few books he had made me a present of, and asked them to purchase them - I saw Mr. Jackson - in consequence of what I told him, I went before a magistrate, and was examined as a witness - I have seen Whicker several times - I saw him twice at our lodging, in Noble-street, about two months or more before Frampton went away - I cannot recollect the time - I did not know what he was there about - Frampton was at home - they talked together, but I did not pay attention to it - that was at both the times I am speaking of - Whicker lived in the Strand at that time - I understood he was going abroad - I have seen parcels at Noble-street, but I did not know they were books - I think I have seen some plates of Hogarth's works there - it is no use my looking at them, because I do not know them - I have seen pictures - I do not know that they were Hogarth's - they were these kind of engravings - I have seen Poole in Noble-street, several times - Poole brought a note to me once, to deliver some paintings to him, which I did.</p>

             - I have no share in the business - my attention has been called to the three cases of books - I took an inventory of the contents, and examined all the books and works - Poole made a list of them, under my direction - they are all books which the prosecutors deal in, and they have more interest in most of the works than other booksellers - they are exclusively the publishers of some - some are in sheets - we sell to the trade in sheets - the Annual Register wants some sheets, and at the bottom of one of the cases I found a list, stating the imperfections of it - that list, has Poole's writing on it - I know Poole's handwriting, and believe it to be on that paper - I cannot say which case it was taken from. (This paper being read, contained an account of several sheets which were necessary to complete the Annual Register.) I have looked at these engravings of Hogarth's works; in the early part of this year the prosecutors had engravings of this kind in their possession - here is a pencil memorandum at the corner of one - it is in the handwriting of Mr. Ebbs, who was formerly in their employ - this was not intended to be sold - these plates were kept at the top of the house - a conversation once took place between Frampton and myself respecting these plates, while he was in their employ, (about April) - he stated to me that there was at the top of the house a quantity of Hogarth's plates, which would sell, and it was a pity they should remain in the state they were in, and I went and saw them, and have since looked in the same place, and they are gone - at the police-office, when he was there, I asked him where the prints were which he had taken - he said, "They are in the case, on the wharf"- I believe none of the plates have been sold since he showed them to me - I produce eight paintings, which I received from Poole, in the presence of Fogg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been in the house of Baldwin and Craddock? A. Nearly twenty years - the stock is very large - I do not know that they missed property before Frampton came into their service - I never heard of such a thing - I never missed any - I believe Poole did not make any statement untill Eliza Harris called at the house - I missed a copy of the Annual Register, because our stock of that is so low - I cannot miss the other things, the stock is so large - I saw Frampton on the 7th of July - I said I was sorry to see him in such a situation - I did not say I thought he had been led into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you knew every thing, and he could hide nothing from you, as you had every evidence against him? A. I think it very likely that I did say it, but I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, before he made any disclosure, that the best thing he could do for himself - the only means he had of saving himself, which indeed he was bound to do, in justice to his employers, and the benefit of mankind, was to disclose every thing? A. Certainly not - I have not a perfect recollection of every word I said, but I can be sure I did not say a certain thing, without recollecting exactly every thing I might say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him at the same time that Poole was in custody? A. There has been some misapprehension on that point - I do not know whether I did or not - my impression is, that Poole was under the same sort of government as if in custody - whether I told him so, I do not know - it is very likely, if he put such a question to me, I might have said so - I do not think I should have said so if he did not ask - there was some conversation about Poole - Mr. Baldwin had allowed Poole to go home, on the express condition that he should return again - he was not in the custody of the law, I considered him in the custody of his employers.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, that, when you knew he was not in custody, you did not represent to Frampton that he was in custody, for the purpose of extracting something from him, to learn more on the subject from him? A. I swear I did not - I say I did not, to the best of my know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040099"/>ledge, tell him he was in custody; but if such a conversation came up, I might consider him in the custody of the house, for the crimes he had committed - no officer had been sent for, but I considered him in custody, to be called on when wanted - I might have said they felt a desire to punish all parties concerned - I did not say that the object was more to punish the others concerned, than Frampton, nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever lead him to think your object was to punish Poole, and induce him to think he would be favourably dealt with? A. Certainly not; I said every thing was known - he said, "I intended to make a disclosure, and have sent to Mr. Baldwin to that effect" - I told him it was his duty to make a full disclosure, therefore I cannot say I held out no inducement to him - I said we had evidence against him, for Harris had given full information - I had no object to extort confession - my object was that he should make a full disclosure - I had no indirect object - I told him it was his duty to make a confession, and he said he should do it - I did not state that to extort, but to induce a confession - he was taken to the police-office.</p>

            ? A. I do - on my oath I did not state to Frampton that Henry Lamming was coming forward that morning to make a charge against him - when I found there were others implicated in the business, and knowing Frampton and Lamming were acquainted, I certainly said, "Is Lamming concerned in this robbery?" he said, "No; he is not" - I did not tell him that Lamming was the person who would bring forward a charge against him that morning, nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Frampton ask you the nature of the charge, and you state you were in a delicate situation, and could not tell him? A. I have no recollection of it, nor of any such conversation - I can swear conscientiously I never said it - I have not the most distant recollection of saying that Lamming was the person who would bring a charge against him - I have the most moral certainty that I never said Lamming was about to bring a charge - my feelings were excited at seeing him in such a situation - I cannot state every word that passed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you such a recollection of what passed, as to take on yourself to swear you never said Lamming was coming forward against him? A. I have the most perfect belief I did not - I swear I never said so.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you undertake to swear it never passed? A. I do - I recollect no conversation respecting Lamming than what I have said - I have not the most distant recollection of any conversation regarding him, except asking Frampton if he was concerned in the robbery - Lamming did not come to the office that morning - I had not seen him at that time - I saw him afterwards - I did not ask him if he had any charge to make against the prisoner - I asked him if he knew of any delinquency of the prisoners - that was after opening the cases and seeing Frampton - I saw Lamming at Messrs. Baldwin and Co's. - he is in their service.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, do you mean to swear, without reservation, that you said nothing to the effect that Lamming was coming to bring charges? A. I swear I have not in any way a recollection of any such conversation - I do not recollect a word that passed, in reference to Lamming, but what I have said - I may have forgotten it, but I should say it never occurred.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. You asked him if Lamming had any thing to do with it, and he said not? A. I did - I have no recollection of asking him a similar question about Whicker, and receiving a similar answer - I did not recollect the conversation about Lamming till it was brought to mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of Frampton's saying Whicker knew nothing about it? A. I have not - I cannot recollect all I did say - I cannot undertake to swear it, having been mixed up in the matter, and making inquiry - I have no recollection of putting the question - if I am to swear through it, I must say I did not say it, as you will take it in no other way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are asked if it passed, and say you do not recollect it; you are then asked whether you could sufficiently recollect, so as to undertake to say it did not pass? A. Certainly not - I will not say it did not pass - it may have passed.</p>
               <p>Q. MR. BODKIN. Q. Whatever conversation might take place respecting Lamming, was it before or after Frampton told you where the property was to be found? A. I cannot say - Lamming is still in the service.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you aware that Whicker was an acquaintance of Frampton's? A. I had been informed of that by Eliza Harris and I believed at that time they were equally guilty - it was not an unlikely question to ask him if Whicker was implicated.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Was there some doubt about whether the ship would sail to Van Dieman's Land? A. Yes, very great doubt - it was supposed once that it would not said - the ship's company were not on board.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Baldwin and Co. I have seen the prisoner Frampton write - he has sat near me writing - (looking at the letter) I should think this is not his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been in the house? A. Seven years - I have heard complaints of works in quires missing before Frampton came - I cannot say I have known it.</p>
               <p>Frampton's Defence. I must throw myself entirely on the mercy of the Court - I would call the attention of the Jury to the witness, Poole; whether the books have been proved ever to have come from the house, I leave it to them to say.</p>
               <p>Whicker's Defence. I wish to examine witnesses who will prove my innocence of any knowledge of their being stolen - I told the officers I would give them every information - Frampton might have stolen the property: I could not think it possible - I gave every facility to the boxes being examined - they were not shipped to myself - I knew the property belonged to myself, the doctor, and Frampton, but I could not point out Frampton's property - they were brought to my house merely for the convenience of packing, by the Excise-officer - I had a great quantity of paper hangings, entitled to the drawback, and the officer being there for the purpose, Frampton's books were there at the same time - he had agreed with me in March, as a young man who was going over to the place with me as clerk declined going - Frampton heard I had offered to take a young man to Sydney, and said he should very much like to go out with me - I agreed to pay half his passage, and after being in the country three months, he should go where he pleased - he agreed to the proposal - he said he would consult his employers whether he should go or not, for he had formed an improper connexion, and wished to get out of the country - I said, "What is it? tell me" - he said he had formed an improper connexion with a female, and invited me to come to his house and see the person - I went, and saw Harris, whom he called his wife - I came out, and remonstrated with him very much, and told him he acted imprudently, in representing that woman as his wife, and the sooner he left her the better - I advised him to leave the house that day - he said he would leave as soon as possible - I asked if he had any property of his own - he said yes; he had been with Mr. Dowding some years in Newgate-street, and I knew he sometimes purchased books at the trade sales - he said he had bought them very cheap, and asked if I wanted an Encyclopedia at a very cheap rate - I asked to see the work - he brought a few copies, but I was engaged, and made no agreement for them - he referred me to Mr. Paul, at the Mansion-house, who he said had bought some of him - I called on Mr. Paul, who said he had known him many years, and bought books of him, and that the books he did not consider were any bargain - I named it to my wife, that I was about buying an Encyclopedia of Frampton - she wished me to decline it, and buy what she required herself in lieu of it; and I did not buy them - about a fortnight afterwards, Frampton came, and said he had seen his employers, and he could leave; that he had upwards of a quarter's pay coming to him, and he would go out and pay half his passage; and he gave me the money a few days afterwards - Captain Jackson, who is gone out to New South Wales, was to have been a passenger with us - Jackson wished to study mathematics while he was going out - I said Frampton could get him the books he required - I got Frampton's brother to buy some books, and those books were brought to No. 7, Stebon-terrace - with respect to the other books, they were to have been brought to the Strand instead of my house, to be mixed up with Dr. Hall's and my own books; but when the exciseman came, he asked whose books they were - I told him the new ones belonged to Frampton, and the old ones to myself and Dr. Hall - indeed, I was quite ignorant but what all the books were entitled to the drawback; but when I understood it must be new books, I told him some were Dr. Hall's, and some my own, and the new books were in parcels belonging to Frampton - I never interfered with them; they were taken down in the yard, brought back, and packed in the passage; but before they were finished, they put in some books not entitled to the drawback; but I could not swear to my own books, as some my wife had I never saw in my life - on the 5th of July, two officers came, and they have given evidence most unfairly, for they have not stated what I did say to them; for the moment they came, (Frampton's brother had told me, only five minutes before, that he was taken,) I said to them,"This woman has not taken him into custody, surely," as she had been watching about, and I thought she had had a child by Frampton - I had no idea that it was for felony - I asked the officers what the charge was - they said, "For stealing books" - I said, "It is impossible; I have known, Frampton for years, and I do not believe a more honourable man is in existence" - they said it was the fact that he had stolen the books, and confessed every thing, and he would be received as the evidence; "But," they said, "he has quite acquitted you; that you are innocent of any thing" - I said, "I am glad he has spoken the truth, and if there are any books on board the ship, I will go and point out the cases, that you may identify them" - Fogg said he called on Sunday; but I proved that was wrong before the magistrate - he never called on Sunday, though he swore he did - I can prove he was never near the house, though I remained at home all day on purpose - he called between seven and eight o'clock in the morning - I went down to him - he asked what time I would meet him on board the ship - I had told him there were two cases in the ship, and one on the wharf - on Monday, I went on board, and pointed them out; but being shipped in the name of the broker, I had no control over them, and many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040101"/>of them belonged to Dr. Hall - at the second examination, Frampton acquitted me clearly of knowing the books were stolen - I was three days before the magistrate, and allowed to depart - Mr. Ballantine let me go, on my promise to return; and, though I had paid a deal of money for my passage, I would freely give that up, and be a witness even against Frampton, if he was guilty - I appeared four times before I was committed; and the last time, the evidence was very different to what it was before; in fact, both the policeman endeavoured to entrap me in every way, and misrepresent almost every thing - I never anticipated men would be so base and wicked as to entrap a man - I have given them every opportunity a mortal man could do, to let them see the property - I got the Excise seals broken, and ran the risk of losing the drawback, for the ends of justice, to show there was no transaction improper on my part - I think there is not an individual I was connected with, but knew they were Frampton's and Dr. Hall's books - Frampton told every body I had nothing to do with the books, long before he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. HANSARD. The Parliamentary History was published at my house - Frampton bought a complete set of me on the 20th of April - I knew him when he lived at Dowding's - he always bore the very best of characters.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. The Parliamentary History is published by you? A. Yes; I know nothing of the Parliamentary Records, Baldwin and Co., I believe, are agents for that.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you been in Court during the trial? A. Yes; the Excise-officer, who was examined, is the person I speak of - it took the best part of the day to pack the books - I was in different parts of the house - Whicker was at home, but I do not believe he was at home when the officer first came - I cannot say the day the books that were packed came to my house - there was one cab came with some books which Frampton took out, and took up stairs - I did not see what they were, for they were packed in paper parcels - they were put in the drawing-room which Whicker occupied - Frampton occupied that room with him, he being his clerk.</p>

            . I am a friend of Dr. Hall's, who sailed to Van Dieman's Land. I was present at the police-office, but the books were not produced - I saw the books in Store-street on Good Friday - I saw Dr. Hall's books - I could identify part of them, Bell's Anatomy of the Teeth - I have a list in my pocket - there were two or three volumes of Scott's novels, which I made a present of to Dr. Hall; Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, 1 volume; 12 volumes of Gibbon's Rome, and a book on Botany - there were forty volumes in all.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you found those forty books in either of the cases? A. No; I have not seen the cases - I know Dr. Hall had forty volumes, which I have a list of, and they were sent to Mr. Whicker, in the Strand, by a porter - whether they were packed in the cases, I cannot say - there were more which I cannot recollect - they were sent to Whicker to be packed to go to New South Wales.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. Shortly before this investigation, I came to London to take leave of him - I stayed about ten days at his lodging at Stepney - we have relations of the family who have property at New South Wales - I know he was going out to settle there - I knew it for two months before - he has talked about it for twelve months - Frampton told me, in my brother's presence, that the new books and prints belonged to him, pointing to some which lay in the room - I did not look at them to tell what they were - there was a quantity of new books lying there - he said he had agreed with my brother to go out to Sydney as clerk - I said, "Are you going to take out an adventure?" - he said, "Yes, I am going to take out these books, which are worth 80l. or 90l. here, and if I meet with success at Sydney, I may make 150l. or 200l. of them" - he did not say how he had bought them.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long ago is this? A. About three months - it was some time in the latter end of May - I came to town on the 9th of May - I went there next day, and stayed ten days - it must have been between the 10th and 20th of May - I saw a large quantity of books in different parts of the room, some on the floor, and others on the table - Frampton was then living entirely in the house - I believe he came about the same day as I did - I came from Devonshire on purpose to see my brother, and arrange my own affairs with him - I am a farmer - my brother is a gentleman - my father has supported him for these eight years - I know that, because the money comes through my hands - his father is retired, and lives as a gentleman - he was going out to cultivate land.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What was your brother when he lived in the Strand? A. The same as he is now - he was going into the employ of Dr. Gilchrist, his uncle, who was going to establish a newspaper, I believe, and my brother was going to superintend it for Dr. Gilchrist - I suppose he had paper-hangings to furnish his own apartments at Sydney - I saw a great many paper-hangings, and guns, and muskets.</p>

I took the male prisoner into custody, on the 28th of July, on suspicion of burglary - I saw him pass something into Ellen Sulivan's left hand - I turned round and seized her wrist - she opened her hand - I laid hold of the duplicates, and a farthing, and an apron - there were about eight duplicates - there was one for these six silver spoons among them - I found on Thomas one pair of cotton stockings, one black bag, a purse, a hymnbook, and 17s. 6d. in copper - I found two keys and a chain in his pocket, which was claimed by John Sutton - when I first took Thomas into custody, Ellen Sulivan, with two females, came up to me, and declared the innocence of Thomas - I told her to keep off and not impede me - she followed us, and in going up Fetter-lane, I saw him give her the duplicates, and after that, in Greystoke-place, Thomas said, "I will give you a sovereign" - I could not take the female prisoner, but the following day I was at the Compter expecting she would come there to see him; instead of which she sent a companion - I produce a cap found on Mary Ann Sulivan's head - after taking Ellen Sulivan into custody, a letter came from the male prisoner, with the address of Ellen Sulivan on it, but I do not know that myself - I do not know myself who it came from.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have four duplicates which I found in the pocket of Mary Ann Sulivan - they are for two curtains pawned for 4d., in the name of Ann Conolly, a cruet-frame in the name of Ann Conolly, a petticoat, bed-gown, and shift for 1s. 6d., in the name of Ann Conolly - the pawnbrokers have produced the property - I searched Sulivan's lodging - they both lodged together - I found the box which was lost partly burnt - the day after the prisoners were committed I had information, and went to the cellar, and found six wine-glasses and six shells.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Thomas's Defence. On Monday, the 28th of July, I got from my bed between six and seven o'clock - as I was going up Holborn I met a gentleman who asked me to take care of the property for him - he took me into a public-house for a glass of ale, and said he would not be long before he came back; and he accordingly came back, but during his absence, he sent a man to me to give him half a dozen of spoons, so I did - he then looked and took a quantity of things out and got them pawned, and then gave me the duplicates - after a short time he said the things belonged to his wife, who had taken away his best clothes, and a great deal of money, and as these things belonged to his wife, he should make away with them - he pawned every thing, and brought me the duplicates - I saw Ellen Sulivan about twelve o'clock, and asked her to have something to drink - she asked what property I had there - I told her a gentleman left them in my care, who said he would not be long before he came back, and he wanted them pawned - I asked her to stop into that public-house, while I went to look for the gentleman - I came back and did not see him - I gave her the duplicates in that cap to take care of for me - she cannot read, and she took them home to her sister Mary Ann, who took them - it was her sister's cap - she put it on her head - I did not pawn the spoons, and do not know who did - the man gave me the duplicates after pawning them.</p>
               <p>Ellen Sulivan's Defence. I met Thomas, as he has stated - he gave me the duplicates to mind - not being able to read, I did not know what they were - I put them on the mantel-piece - my sister Mary Ann took them up, and put the cap on her head.</p>
               <p>Mary Ann Sulivan's Defence. The policeman asked if I had a pocket on - I said, "Yes" - he then asked what I had in it - I said, "Duplicates;" and that some of them belonged to my sister, and some to myself.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GAHAGAN. I live in this house, and am the landlady - other persons lodge with me - It was alarmed by the sound of a foot coming up stairs, about a quarter past four o'clock - it appeared to stop in the passage - I had no reason to think they had gone into the room, not hearing a door open - I was alarmed - it was light then - I heard a man's foot going down stairs - I got the key of the prosecutor's room door, from where it hung, and saw a man going down with a bundle and a box - I ran after him - he much resembled the male prisoner - it was like him by his back appearance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is your father's name? A. Joseph - my uncle's name is Michael - I have no uncle named Charles, nor any relation of that name - I have seen the prisoner once or twice before - he had no dealings with my father, to my knowledge, previous to that day - I am a Jew - he represented that he was going to be possessed of 2,000l., which his wife's aunt had left him, and he gave my father a paper that day to that effect - we have the paper - it was all fictitious lies.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did any Bill of Exchange pass on that occasion? A. Yes; Wilkins gave a Bill of Exchange for 50l. - 25l. was given to him, for the Bill of Exchange and there was an old debt of 25l. - he came to my father and said he was happy he was able to pay him his old debt, and brought him a bill purporting to be drawn on Alexander, his wife's aunt's executor, and gave him a paper to that effect - my father inquired about it, and understanding there was a Mr. Alexander, a respectable man, and the bill purporting to be drawn on him, he said as the dividends were not payable till July, he had allowed him to draw the bill of 50l., which he brought to my father to discount, and take 25l., his old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040104"/>debt, out - my father never had any dealings with him till that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How then did he owe him 25l.? A. It was a bill on Mr. Tibbins for 15l., and the costs amounted to 25l. - he was party to that bill - Mr. Tibbins was a bankrupt, and he endorsed the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the bill given to receive 25l., to pay 15l. which was the debt, and the rest for the watch? A. No; it was 25l. for the old debt - my father did not give any receipt on account of the old debt - directly my father ascertained it was all a trick, he went before a Justice - that was about three weeks afterwards, as far as I can recollect - I believe the interview at the Bank Coffee-house was on the 27th of June, and the latter end of July or the beginning of August applied to before the magistrate - he had given full value for the bill in money and the old debt - I saw the prisoner about a week afterwards, and said, "Where is my watch?" and he pulled it out of his pocket - my father went several times to the house, and he could not be found, and he sent him a letter - my father appeared at Lambeth-street, and made a charge against the prisoner - I do not exactly know on what day - I went to the Mansion-house after that about this charge - I wanted to prefer the charge at Lambeth-street, but they said I must go the Mansion-house - my father's charge was not dismissed - I believe it was a charge of obtaining money, under false pretences - it was not a felony, but a fraud - the prisoner was ordered to be taken to the Mansion-house, the money being obtained in the City - I went before the Lord Mayor respecting the watch after I had been to Lambeth-street, but I do not recollect the date - Mr. Norton was the attorney at Lambeth-street - my father went to Lambeth-street of his own accord - I was only at one examination at Lambeth-street - on my oath I was only there once - I went to the Mansion-house after that - I then went to Guildhall, as the Lord Mayor did not sit that day - I appeared at the Mansion-house about the beginning of August - I know it was in August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to Guildhall on the 20th of August, and to the Mansion-house on the 26th of August? A. I do not know the dates - I think it was about five weeks before I went to either place - I will not swear it was less than seven - I will swear it was less than eight weeks from the day the watch was obtained, till I went before the Lord Mayor at the Mansion-house - when he showed me the watch, he said he had not seen Mr. Alexander - I did not demand it of him - I did not tell Mr. Norton about it - I have never seen the prisoner between June and August - I did not go to look for him - my father did - and my father had such confidence in him, seeing him dressed all in black, and he gave him a paper, which my father has got.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You expected he would return the watch in two or three days? A. I did; I never gave him authority to keep it - the Bill of Exchange forms the subject of another charge against him.</p>

             - and after the business had been transacted about a bill, he said Mr. Alexander was a very good friend, and he should like to make him a present of a watch - my son happened to take his watch out, and he said, "I should like one something like that," and said he should like something similar to present to Mr. Alexander - my son seemed to look at me, to know if he should allow him to show it, as he said he should like to show it to Mr. Alexander, and if he liked it, he should like to give him one similar to it - he took the watch away - he was to return it in a few days, I am certain - my son has never got it, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I do not know whether you and I are old acquaintances? A. I have had the pleasure of seeing you before - the watch was merely seen by the prisoner by accident - my son might have taken it out, and Wilkins see it and say, "I should like to make a similar present to Alexander" - he said he should like a watch like my son's, which he had seen before - my son might have taken it out, whether by accident I do not know - he never saw my son before.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been a bankrupt, Mr. Millingen? A. I have been a bankrupt, and am proud to boast I have paid 20s. in the pound - I was a bankrupt twenty-two years ago - I was one but a year ago, and lost 22,000l. - I have been a bankrupt four times, but always paid 20s. in the pound - I have never compounded with my creditors or taken the benefit of the Act - I never superseded either of the commissions - I have been plundered of too much money - there was 3,000l. to pay 1,000l. - I have been convicted of a conspiracy - I beg to state it was through the attorney who is now conducting the defence, Saul Yates, of Bury-street - it was in consequence of his swearing he saw placards in the hands of myself, and the other party, when we had ten respectable witnesses - we have a rule nisi granted for a new trial, on the perjury of Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the rest of your misfortunes, how often have you been burnt out and recovered the money from the offices? A. I never recovered money but once - when my wife was nearly burnt to death, I received 70l., and my costs were 200l. - I have had fires in my factory when I was not insured for a farthing, and lost 1,000l. - I think fires have occurred accidentally at my manufactory three times, but I was not insured for 1s. - I never swore that I once received 70l., and at another time 100l. - I think about eighteen years ago there was a sum of 110l., and 70l. when my wife was nearly burnt to death - it was not 200l. that I said I recovered - to my knowledge I never said so - I cannot tell what I said three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you recovered 90l. once, and 200l. at another time? A. I cannot say that I did - I will not say I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you ever indict a gentleman named Jessop, or something, for perjury? A. Yes; there have been indictments and cross indictments and informations, and 1,000l. has been spent in law expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. When you prosecuted that person, did not the Jury stop the case in the middle, and declare themselves satisfied? A. I suppose they were satisfied - there have been complete cross indictments - it was on the 27th of June that my son and I were at the Bank Coffee-house - my son, I believe, saw the prisoner a week afterwards - I was not present - I made application to him by letter, I think, on the 1st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040105"/>August - I expected the watch was the same as my bill, that all he had told me about his wife's aunt and the property was as true as could be - the bill was due on the 31st of July - I then found it was worth nothing - I applied to the magistrate about eight or ten days after, at Lambeth-street - I think, the prisoner was held to bail - fully committed - he was not held to bail at Lambeth-street - he was fully committed, that I swear - I went to Guildhall, I believe, two or three days after, for we found out the occurrence took place in the City, and could not be entertained - the Lambeth-street magistrate did not tell me that he had no jurisdiction - if your client has told you so, it is false; if my son said so, it must not be with any intention, but a mistake - I mentioned, on my examination before the magistrate, at Lambeth-street, that he obtained a gold watch to show Mr. Alexander, and at Guildhall, before Alderman Copeland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get to the Mansion-house before the 26th of August? A. I really cannot tell - I went myself and took the prisoner about the bill on Wednesday morning, for we could not find him at home - I took him first on the Bill of Exchange - the Bill of Exchange was given for part money he owed me two years ago, and 25l. cash - I discounted a bill of 15l. brought to me by Mr. Tibbins - it was never paid, and both parties were sued on it - the prisoner called, and said he was a poor man, and it was useless my going against him - I let it go against Tibbins - my expenses were 10l.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The affair of the bill is the subject of a future indictment? A. Yes: I have indicted him for fraud respecting that transaction - that bill has nothing to do with the watch - my son has never been burnt out at any time, nor a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or your son in your presence, on your oath, give him any authority whatever to dispose of or pawn the watch? A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He pawned it in his right name and place of abode? A. Yes: I found him at that place - I did not know him before - I was not applied to to look after him till the Saturday - I was present at the examination at Lambeth-street - the watch was mentioned there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the examination at Lambeth-street taken down in writing? A. No: he was remanded to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What charge was he examined on? A. First on a charge of forgery, it was then considered to be fraud - Mr. Norton, the solicitor, discovered on Tuesday that the offence was committed in the City - he was not committed from our office - he was remanded to the Mansion-house - I took him there on the Thursday, I think to Guildhall; and to the Mansion-house, on the 26th - he was not committed for the bill - the bill was mentioned - Mr. Norton attended as attorney for the prosecution, at both examinations.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has the prisoner an attorney? A. Yes - the Bill of Exchange and the watch are two different transactions, and form two separate indictments.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MILLINGEN re-examined. This is my watch - I never gave him any authority to sell or dispose of it in any way - he promised to return it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the watch finished when it went out of your hands? A. I am not in the trade - it is one I wear myself - I had worn it six months.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did it go like another watch? A. Yes - I wound it up regularly.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, in his defence, made a long address, which was partly inaudible: the substance was - that the charge was supported by gross perjury - that, in 1831, Millingen, sen., held a bill for 15l., accepted by the prisoner, and drawn by one Tibbins, which bill was given in consequence of some proceedings in the Insolvent Debtors' Court; the bill was dishonoured, Tibbins took the benefit of the Insolvent Act, but gave Millingen another bill for the one in question, and Millingen informed the prisoner he was exonerated from all liability on the bill - that he met Millingen the Bank Coffee-house, on the 27th of June, by appointment, having asked him to discount a £50 bill: which Millingen proposed to do, by giving £20 cash, selling the watch for 15l., and taking 15l. to pay Tibbins's bill - the prisoner objected to purchase the watch, and declined the proposal; Milligen then offered 25l. cash, to charge 10l. for the watch, to take 15l. for Tibbins's bill, and the prisoner's I O U for 14l. 15s., which included a sum of 9l. for costs incurred on Tibbis's bill; this was acceded to, and the prosecutor made no application to him to return the watch, nor did he charge him with stealing it till after he found he could not substantiate a charge of forgery against him.)</p>

            . On the 17th of June, I was in Spitalfields - the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy a bugle - I said I did not particularly want it - I asked if it was a good one - he said, "Yes," and asked 15s. for it - I bought it for 14s. - I paid 9s. as a deposit - I afterwards pawned it at Hebert's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040106"/>value of this? A. About 16s - I am a musician - I have one which cost four guineas - there is no maker's name on this - I pawned it three or four hours after I bought it - I am not in the habit of buying things in the street - I was taken up, and gave every information - I know this is the same instrument; the bridge is off - you cannot play it without a bridge - I was going to have one put on - I teach the key bugle - I had to pawn one of my own instruments to buy this - I have scholars who learn of me - I was playing with two musicians when I bought this, neither of them are here - it was about eleven o'clock - I sounded it in the street - I found I could not play upon it - it was hung up in Mrs. Moffat's bar till I paid the other 5s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went down Petticoat-lane, and met a man who had a lot of cloth and this bugle-horn - he offered me the whole for 2l. - I gave him 30s. - I took it home, and made the cloth into caps, and hung the horn in my window, but could not sell it - I then saw this man playing, and asked him if he would buy it - I left the horn at Mrs. Moffat's for him - the next day she told me that the officer had been making inquiries for me - I went to the office, and saw Atfield - I asked him if he had been making inquiries for me - he asked me my name, and said, yes, he had.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the mark? A. This painted mark - I stated to the magistrate that Slight said, "Don't make a noise" - I will swear that occurred - the pipe was broken when I found it - it was in twelve pieces.</p>

I was working in my back kitchen - I heard a noise, and went up - I saw these pieces of lead, and McDonald was standing there, very drunk - he sat down in one of my chairs, and said, "I want 6s. for this" - I said,"I will not have it" - he said, "I must have money to get more beer" - I said he had had beer enough, and I took out half-a-crown and a shilling - I said, "This is all the money I have - if you will come to-morrow when you are sober, we will talk about it" - the officer then came in - I was very much agitated - I opened the door - I then returned again - I stooped and took up the lead - he never stooped himself - I went with him to the station-house - I said, "I have not bought it - I had not money to pay for it" - I had only been there five or six weeks.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER BETSON. On the 23rd of July, I went to the West-end. I then took an omnibus, and went to the Tower - I then met Burnett, who asked me to go with her - it was then between nine and ten o'clock - I went with her to her own lodging - she asked me to give her some gin - I gave her a shilling, and she sent Finn for some - she gave me some in a tea-cup - I then went to bed, and felt sick - I had then a sovereign, two half-crowns, one shilling, and two sixpences - I felt it all safe just before I met this girl - after I felt sick, I went to sleep, and between one and two o'clock in the morning, the two male prisoners came and roused me up, and told me that was their bed - I said a young woman brought me there, and said it was her room - they said she had often done that when they were at sea - I then got up, and looked for my trowsers, which I had put under my head - they were gone, and I told the men I had been robbed - Ferguson found my trowsers at the foot of the bed - he heaved them at me - I went to where the rest of my clothes were, and my hat, handkerchief, and waistcoat, were gone - Ferguson then gave me an old hat, and told me to take that, and be d-d, and to be thankful to get a hat of any sort - I told them I would call the first policeman I found - Ferguson then led me into the court - when he saw a policeman he ran away - the officer came to me - I told him I had been robbed of my money and these articles - I went with him to the room at No.9, where I had been - it was then empty - the officers told me to stop there, and they went to No. 2, and found the two men and Burnett in one bed, and the other girl asleep in a chair - they called me to know if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040108"/>these were the men - I knew them, and they took them - I found my black silk handkerchief in the bed.</p>

On Tower-hill - I went with her about five minutes' walk - I had nothing but a little beer all day - I counted my money just before I met her - I had only been five days up from Scotland - I missed my money when the two men aroused me, and my trowsers were not where I left them - Burnett might have left me before the men came - I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of St. Andrew's, Holborn. On the 7th of August, at half-past four o'clock in the morning, I saw a cab coming up Fetter-lane, driving very furiously - West was driving it, and the other two prisoners were in it - he drove to Holborn, and put it on the stand; the three prisoners then got out, and went to the coffee-shop in Farringdon-street - in about a quarter of an hour, I met them coming up Holborn-hill - I went to meet them; instead of coming up to the cab, they turned into Bartlett's-buildings - I followed them, and sent another watchman round another way - I followed them to Bartlett's - passage - I there saw Lockyer take something from her breast, which I thought was a watch, and give it to Jones, who put it into his pocket - West was with them - they were all close together - I then laid hold of Jones, put my hands into his pocket, and took this watch out - Lockyer then took the seal and key out of her bosom, and was in the act of dropping them, when the officer took them - they were all taken to the watch-house - 5s. was found on Lockyer, and 3s. on West.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. All you saw was Lockyer handing it to Jones, and he put it in his pocket? A. Yes.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoners were brought into the watch-house - 3s. were found on West, and 5s. on Lockyer - I asked if she had any thing to say - she said she would tell me the truth - that she was at Vauxhall, and a gentleman hired a cab, and the cabman asked the gentleman if he would suffer his sister to ride with him, and the gentleman said yes, if she was his sister, and he desired the cabman to drive to York-street, Westminster; but instead of that they drove to Strutton-ground, where they got out of the cab, and the gentleman, the cabman, and a policeman went to a public-house, and had something to drink - that they got into the cab again, and the cabman drove to Piccadilly - when they got to the Green-park, the cabman desired her to rob the gentleman, which she did, that the cabman then took him out, and set him against the wall, and they three had got into the cab and drove away - she said West was the cabman, but he denied all knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she sober? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did she say the gentleman was drunk? A. She said he was asleep, and that Jones stood by while he was robbed.</p>
               <p>JOHN LADD. I live in Little James-street. I was at Vauxhall that night - I hired a cab - West was the driver - I told him to drive to York-street, Westminster - he said the fare would be 2s., and asked if I would allow Lockyer, who was his sister, to ride home - I said if she was his sister she might, and she got in - I had a watch and seal and key when I got in; and after I left the cab and came to my senses I missed them - they drove me to Strutton-ground, and I had something to drink there, and whether there was any thing put in to it to make me stupid I do not know - this is my watch and seal - I am positive to West - I cannot swear to the girl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many public-houses had you been into? A. One before I got into the cab - I was there drinking brandy and water when the driver was sent for - we had two glasses of brandy and water between the driver and me and the waterman - I will not swear who proposed to go into the next public-house - I never was in the house before - I might have selected the house - I cannot say what I drank there - I cannot tell what I paid - I do not know exactly what money I had - I paid a shilling for a glass - I do not know whether there was more than one glass - the landlady brought it to me - I handed it to the prisoners to drink, and I was standing facing them - I was so stupid after drinking the first brandy and water, I cannot tell what I paid - I do not recollect getting into the cab again - I was going to York-street - I did wrong to get out of the cab and go into the public-house - I took no liberties with Lockyer.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SIMONS. I am a watchman. I saw the cab<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040109"/>come out of Fetter-lane that morning - West was driving, and Jones and Lockyer were inside - they then went down Bartlett's-buildings - I heard some altercation - Jones struck West, who was very drunk - he fell off the cab two or three times - I parted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say West fell several times? A. He must have done so, for he was all over mud - he was not quite sober when he went before the magistrate - when they went up Barlett's-buildings I thought the cabman had been robbed, as his breeches were loose - he was more likely to be robbed than to rob any one.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. On the night in question I had been drinking with an old schoolfellow at the Admiral Keppel - West and the girl came there, and asked me to go and have a ride - I went to the coffee-shop, and we were quarrelling about it, when the watch was handed to West.</p>
               <p>Lockyer's Defence. I was at the gardens, and the cabman brought me some drink - he brought the gentleman, who he said was his brother - I got into the cabman's place, and the cabman sat in my lap - we went on - the gentleman called a policeman, and said, "I will give you something to tell us where there is a public-house" - they then went to the public-house, with a female who was with me, leaving me outside - they sent me some rum-and-water out; and then they got into the cab, and we went to Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>JOHN LADD re-examined. Q. Are you able to say you had your watch when you were at Strutton-ground? A. I had it when I got into the cab, and that was the first time I got out.</p>

             (police-constable C 109). I was on duty in South Moulton-street - I met the prisoner, and after he had passed me, I picked up a duplicate - I had not seen it there before - I went to the place it referred to, and found these articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it since you had been at that place? A. About ten minutes - there were not many persons then passing - it was half-past five o'clock- it had not been there all night, for it was quite light, and I must have seen it.</p>

             (police-constable H 22). I was called, and found 13s. 6d. in the prisoner's shoe, and 6s. in her hand - she owned that all the money belonged to the prosecutor but 5s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man said he was ill - he asked if I knew where he could get a lodging - I told him, and he said he should be glad if I would show him, and I did so - he said he had only one sixpence which he dropped on the pavement - when we got to Sheen's his watch was pawned, and half a pint of gin was brought in, and a pot of beer - they drank the gin, and we had the beer between us - the prosecutor then laid the money on the ledge, and it fell down, and he asked me to pick it up, and pay the reckoning - I said it was paid, and he laid down on his back - I went and told Mrs. Sheen the man was asleep, and I had his money - she said, "You can leave the house, but do not take the money" - I said, "No; I will not leave it, but in his presence" - she then wanted to take the money by force - I said, she should not - I went to put it in my shoe, but I could not get it all in - he then sent for the officer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor can only swear to the spoon by having another like it; but are these the only two spoons that are alike? and supposing there are initials, there may be many others like them - when a new pattern is introduced, it is carried round and urged upon the trade; and when the shopmen sell them, they may fall into the hands of persons whose initials are the same - one might sell some to Michael Watts, he would take them to an engraver to put M. W. on them - another sells some to Mary Wilson, who has her initials put on them, and will it be possible to tell which were done for Watts, and which for Wilson? - and if there were even a crest on them, it is not possible to distinguish them - on the death of parents the plate is divided, the brother retains his, the sister takes hers to a refiner, who allows her 4s. 6d. an ounce for them, and she buys some of a modern pattern - you might purchase some of them of the refiner, and be under the necessity of pawning them - if you went to the brother's house, and the duplicate was found on you, how would it be possible to prove whether it was one sold by the sister, or one retained by the brother? - how then can the prosecutor swear to this spoon? - he has no proof that it was pawned by me, and the pawnbroker is unable to identify me - there is therefore no proof that I pawned or stole it - and this might be one of mine, as I purchased several spoons some time ago.</p>

             (police-constable N 248). On the 4th of July I was sitting at my window on Islington-green - I saw the two prisoners and another cross the green, to Mr. Fawcett's shop - I knew them, and watched them - Stewart stood against the prosecutor's door, and Baxter walked backwards and forwards twice - he then took two pieces of moreen and gave them to Stewart - the other man then took two pieces and gave them to Stewart - I ran down and took Stewart with the four pieces on his shoulder - I asked him what he was going to do with them - he said, what was that to me - I said it was to me, he must go to the station-house - I seized Baxter - Stewart then threw down these pieces, and tried to get away - I got assistance, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How far was Stewart from the shop door when the property was taken? A. The distance of the window; two or three yards.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SMITH. This is my master's property - it has our mark on it.</p>
               <p>Baxter's Defence. I was merely passing when this man was taken - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Stewart's Defence. I was passing the green, and a man asked me to carry these.</p>

I went to the place, and took the prisoner - the prosecutor said,"I have missed a piece of cloth, and can have no suspicion of any one but you" - he got off his board, threw his lapcloth off his knees, and said he knew nothing about his master's cloth - he said he lodged where he did, at No. 6, Edward-street - I left him there - I went to the office, took the order-book in my pocket, and returned - I then went with the prosecutor to a house in Wellington-street, where we found the cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you were sent for, did you know where to go to find this property? A. No: I left the prisoner while I went to the watch-house, and when I came back, I saw an alteration in his countenance - I said to him, "It appears to me you are guilty, and that the cloth you said your parents had bought you, is your master's, and if it is, you had better give it up" - he then said,"It is not at the lodging where I told you - I do not live there now" - he then took us to the place where the cloth was.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master and the officer promised if I would tell where it was, I should not be punished.(

In the fields, coming from the back of Mr. Bacon's premises- I apprehended him, after a chase and a great deal of resistance - I searched him at the station-house, and found on him a knife and a counterfeit shilling - he made great resistance - I was an hour before I could get him out of the field - he got me down, and I was forced to draw my staff - I struck him twice.</p>

The prosecutor applied to me, and said the prisoner had taken his horse out of his stable, and desired me to go and look for it - he stated it to me as a case of felony - I said, "Do you mean to say he stole the horse?" - he said,"Certainly, what else could I mean?" - we met the prisoner in the street - the prosecutor said, "There is the man"- he caught hold of him, and said, "Jem, I want my horse, where is my horse?" - he did not answer - I took him into a shop - the prosecutor again began swearing, and said,"Where is my horse?" - he asked him to forgive him several times - we found the horse at the prisoner's father's stable, with another horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was walking near his father's house? A. Yes, within one hundred yards of it - he told the magistrate he had come to see his father and mother.</p>

The prisoners used to clean my room, but they had no regular occupation - I admitted them to my room from kindness - I am not in any business - they were out of situations - while they were there, I missed all this property from the back room second floor - some was in boxes, some in drawers - on the 29th of June, during their absence, I discovered some boxes opened, and on their return, I named several articles that were taken, but I had not examined the boxes from the time I came there, which was the 29th of April - (Ellen helped me to move) - they were in my room during my absence - the property was found in their apartment - Ellen went to a situation, I understand, on the Tuesday preceding - they had left my place without notice - when I came home on Sunday, the 29th of June, Margaret was gone - I had been out to dinner, and left her there, and came back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not you desire Ellen to seek for another place? A. She was seeking for a situation all the time she was with me - I have a sister named Mrs. Hance, whom I lived with before I came to where I am now - she did not come backwards and forwards to my lodging, to my knowledge, nor any of her family - I left my sister because she left her house - I never charged my sister with any thing in particular - I may have missed thing during the time I was there - I do not think I charged her with robbing me - I swear to the best of my knowledge I did not - I lost things - I did not charge her with breaking open my boxes - Hance was not at my apartments, to my knowledge - the apartments were in the care of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On Friday, the 4th of July, I went to Great Charlton-street, Somers'-town - I found the two prisoners lodging there - they came home about ten o'clock - Ellen opened the street door - I crossed the road, and said to Margaret, "I want you: where is Ellen?" - she turned round; I said, "Ellen, I want to speak to you also; it is very particular what I wish to tell you, will you walk a few yards with me? I want you about the Edgeware-road business" - they looked at each other, and said nothing - I said to Margaret, "You have no shawl on, would you wish to go home for one?" she said not - I said, I must take them to the station-house - I said,"Mrs. Wyatt says she saw you come out on Sunday night with a bundle each" - Ellen said, "It is false, we had no bundle, it was only this small basket, I had nothing else"- I said, "You went home in a cab" - they said, "Yes, we saw an empty cab in the New-road, and called it" - on getting to the station-house, I searched her basket, and found a piece of ribbon, two watch-hooks, and one custard cup - I found two keys, one of the street door, and one of their room - I went next morning to their room with the prosecutrix, and, on opening a box, I found all this property, which Mrs. Archer identifies - I found twenty-one duplicates in their boxes not relating to the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Ellen say the box you found the property in, was intrusted to her by Mrs. Archer? A. No; she was not present - she said nothing of the sort at the office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is that a new veil or has it been worn? A. I should take it to be a new one - I advanced 10s. on that and a pair of half-boots - it is worth about 20s., - to the best of my recollection it was the prisoner - I have not the slightest doubt about him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not your master say it was but an old one, and he could not advance more? A. Not to my recollection.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it not the custom of small shoemakers, when in distress, to sell shoes on Saturday nights to shops? A. It may be - Smith asked the prisoner if he had any shoes to sell - he did not offer to sell these - he said he had kept these for his own use, and he had worn one pair - he was liberated on bail, and has surrendered here - he made search for the person he bought them of, and had one person taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that person's name Smith, and was he not a cousin of this very Smith the officer? A. No, he was not - the magistrate asked him that - he said he was not, but that he always called the policemen cousins and uncles - I do not know what his name was - these shoes hung on our door-post - a person might stand at the door and take them.</p>

             (police-constable H 80). I produce the first pair of shoes that was found at the prisoner's - the other officer afterwards found the other two pair - when I got up to the door, Smith and the prosecutor were talking to the prisoner - Smith said, "Were any shoes sold here on Saturday night?" - the prisoner said, "No" - Smith then asked if any were offered him; he said, "No, not to me, but I will ask my old woman" - he turned to his wife, and said, "Were any shoes offered?" she said, "No" - I said,"I have information that some are here which are stolen" - he said, "I have no objection at all to your searching;" and under the bed I found this pair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this the first thing that happened? A. When I went up, the prisoner and Smith and the prosecutor were in conversation - we had been waiting at a distance - we thought if we had gone in at first, he would have made away with them, most likely - there were three men in the house, and the prisoner's wife, who would very likely have assisted her husband to get out of trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the boy who was taken up by the prisoner after he was bailed? A. I had seen him about four months ago - I had spoken to him - he gave his name as Peacock - I do not know how long Peacock had known Smith - he said he was related to one of the officers - I should not like to state who gave me the information - I did not receive it from the prosecutor - I received it from a person who was afterwards charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, from the same source that you derived intelligence that the shoes were in the prisoner's house, did you not know who the thief was? A. No; he did not tell me who stole them - he said they were sold at that house, and he was along with the party who sold them- it was Peacock told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Peacock charged before the magistrate with stealing them? A. No; he was taken up for being in company with the person who sold them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you say he was charged in the presence of the magistrate with being the person who sold the shoes? A. Peacock said, in the presence of the magistrate, that he in company with the person who sold them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And the magistrate discharged him? A. Yes - Mr. Broughton was the magistrate - Peacock said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040125"/>he was with the person that sold them, but he did not sell them, and the prisoner said the same.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I want to know how it was that Peacock was discharged? A. The magistrate said he did not blame the solicitor to want to get out of a bad case.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known this Mr. Peacock, who admits being with the person who sold them? A. Four months - I have seen him, and spoken to him, perhaps a dozen times - he never gave me information before, I knew he lived in Wentworth-street - I do not know the number - he came to me voluntarily on my beat and told me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is Peacock? A. In my opinion, he is a thief - I told the magistrate I had seen him in company with thieves - I said that before Mr. Wooller put the question to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean on your oath to say that Peacock was charged with stealing these shoes, admitted he was with the man who sold them on the very night they were stolen, and you told Mr. Broughton you had seen him in company with thieves, and he discharged him? A. Yes - the magistrate said it was very unusual for the thief to tell of himself- it was during the last month that I was on duty in Wentworth-street, that I had a thorough knowledge of Peacock.</p>

             (police-constable H 122). On the 28th of July, I went to the prisoner - I saw him at his door - I asked if he had a pair of shoes to fit me - he handed me down some second-hand shoes - I said they were not good enough, and if he had any better I would thank him to show me them - he said he had none - I said, "Have you no new ones?" - he said, "No" - I said, "Did you get no new ones on Saturday night?" - he said, "No" - I said,"I have been informed you bought some stolen ones on Saturday night?" - he said, "No; we do not do business in that way - we know who we buy of" - my brother officer then came up, and went into the back room - he found one pair of shoes under the bed - nothing more transpired for a good while, till I found these two pair of shoes under the table in the front room - they were concealed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you mean? A. There was a dish cover between the sight of persons and them, and there was a green baize over the table - I asked him if he had any shoes to sell - Webb gave me information of this- I believe I know the person who informed Webb - I have no doubt I do - I do not know that any one was taken up for stealing these shoes - I have not heard it - there was a person taken up for being with the person who sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the person taken up was not charged with being the thief? A. I believe that was the charged he was brought on - I believe his name is Peacock - I never saw him till the evening we got information - I believe he has claimed to be my cousin, but not in my presence - I heard he had not been a very good character, but had not been in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not been a reputed thief, and as such suffered to go at large by the police? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Saturday night, about half-past ten o'clock, two persons brought these shoes to my house, and asked 15s. for them - I said it was too much, and they agreed to take 12s. - on Monday morning, Smith asked if I had any shoes to sell - I said, "No," as I meant to keep them for myself - when the officers came, I said they were welcome to search, as I had done nothing I was afraid of - they found these shoes, but they were not at all concealed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he look like a man who had 60lbs. of lead? A. He looked rather bulky in front of his stomach - I went into the cistern two or three times - I was not in it when he cut the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you were not in the cistern at all? A. No; I was not at the time he was in it - I might have said it - I was in the cistern two or three times - I did not cut the lead in the cistern - I cut the waste pipe - I have a brother-in-law, who is employed at Drury-lane theatre, and I sometimes went to assist him before I went to Mr. Soward - I did not go to any other theatre - I was in the employ of a Mr. Duncan - I have travelled to Bath - I was in the service of an umbrella-maker - I did not say any thing to the prisoner when I saw his waistcoat open - I thought it might be heat - I was not taken up myself - I told Mr. Soward the next morning when he asked me, and showed him where we had been.</p>

            . I am brother of Mr. Clack, who lives at No. 77, Manchester-street - I was at home on the 27th of August, and he was out - the prisoner brought this lead about six or seven o'clock - I did not know him then - he asked me if Mr. Clack was at home - I told him no, but he could leave the lead till Mr. Clack came home if he liked - I weighed it - there was half a hundered weight and seven pound - he came the next morning, and brought two or three bits more, which he said he had forgotten - Mr. Clack was at home then, but he was not up, and the prisoner was to come again in the evening, but did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever say you did not know who the man was? A. I could not describe him to Mr. Clack - the prisoner rang the bell, and I went up stairs - he was in the shop then - I was up in half a minute - I do not know whether a man could have unrolled this lead from his body before I got up, but it was on the bench when I got up - it was rolled up - my brother was taken up - I cannot tell whether I stated that the prisoner was the man before my brother was taken up - I had not known the prisoner before - I had no suspicion of any thing being wrong - the lead was taken into our vault - I parted it into two lots, and wrapped it up in some new bits of our own.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You found the lead on the bench, and the prisoner in the shop, when you went up stairs - where did he then go? A. Down stairs to our lower shop, and when he left, he went up the area steps.</p>

In July last, the prisoner came and said she had recommended my house to old Mr. and Mrs. Varley, her husband's father and mother - that they wanted a great many things; and first, they would have some silk handkerchiefs and stockings to choose from- I had my bonnet on, and was going out - I told my young woman to show the handkerchiefs - she said they were to be shown to Mr. and Mrs. Varley, and to be returned if not approved - she came several times, and at last I began to have some suspicion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Has not she been in the habit of dealing at your house for some years? A. Yes; since October, 1831 - either she or her husband paid for the goods she had - she asked for the running credit of twelve months, which she had, and paid soon after Christmas, but it was of small amount - we entered the goods she had in the waste book, which is here - I entered these goods to Mrs. Varley, but supposing it was for old Mrs. Varley - this entry was similar to the previous entries - I made out a bill of parcels to Mrs. Varley - I did not write"Old Mrs. Varley's."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Would you have let her have these things for herself? A. No, not in any way; her entries before this were not more than 8l. in a year - I knew old Mr. and Mrs. Varley by report, and one of the parcels was directed to Pangbourn, near Reading.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutrix's shop when the prisoner came for these things - I heard her say she had recommended Mrs. Porter to Mr. Varley, of Pangbourn, and she wished to have some handkerchiefs and other things - Mrs. Porter was going out, and I made up the order - I offered to send it, but she took it away herself - the goods were to be taken back or exchanged, if not approved by old Mr. and Mrs. Varley - the next day, she came again - she said two of the silk handkerchiefs were not approved of, and she looked out seven others - she wanted some more of the stockings, but we had none - she came again, and went on dealing, till the bill came to 25l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You entered the goods to Mrs. Varley? A. Yes, as we had before; and I gave her a memorandum of them, as she said they would want to know the price - I knew they were not for her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband's disgraceful conduct was the cause of my pawning these things - I was privately married to him, but his conduct in going with other females was such that I could not live with him - the man Varley, now in Court, persuaded his son to abscond and leave me destitute; and, on my demanding a maintenance, he promised, on my retiring into Wales, to allow me the vast sum of 20l. a year - I went there; but on my applying to a bank, through which it was to be remitted, he, to my great surprise, refused this 20l. a year, pretending it was not due - my friends then persuaded me to return, and reside near his country seat, till he felt inclined to perform his promise, and send me this handsome settlement of 20l. a year - I went and resided at a little cottage, near his country seat - but finding he would do nothing for me, I went to Mrs. Porter, who let me have the things; but as she had given me twelve months' credit before, I thought I should have time to pay her - I thought, as I had the good had a right to do what I pleased with them - my chief prosecutor would not send me what he promised, though his son got in debt with other women, and it was all laid on my shoulders; and so destitute has my husband left me, that when I go out, I should not know where to turn for a home, nor where to go for a sixpence.</p>

             (police-constable C 164). On the 2nd of September I was on duty in Grafton-street - I heard a noise at No. 23 - I went over, and the gentleman at No. 22 looked out, as he had heard a noise - I waited till Bishop came up - we went into No. 22, and got into No. 23 - we heard some persons run up stairs, and we went up- I saw a hand taking a ladder through a trap door at the top - I jumped up, caught the ladder, and went up - I found the trap door of No. 24 was open - I went in, and found Evans in bed, with his stockings and drawers on, and Wood was on a bed on the floor - there was some lime on his shirt, and on the bed likewise - I found a bunch of keys on the table, and a knife - Bishop and I desired them to get up, and they were taken to the station-house - I went back to No. 23, and found a sack, with these things in it, on the roof - there was a puddle of water on the roof, and I found wet marks in the room where the prisoners were - Wood's shoes were wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find Evans's shoes? A. No; Wood was in his shirt; but it was some minutes after I tapped at the door before it was opened - I did not examine Evans's feet, but his hands were dirty - there were some women on the stairs of No. 24.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went in with Alderson - I saw some persons go into No. 24 - we got down, and tracked them by some lime - we knocked at a room door, but it was five minutes before we got admission - I heard some bustling inside - Wood was on an old piece of bed on a blanket, and Evans was in bed - I asked him how long he had been in bed - he said about two o'clock - I took him to the station-house, and in going along he threw this knob down an area - I found some of these things on Evans, under his shirt - this key fits one of the locks, which was found on the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the magistrate you heard a hustling in the room? A. Yes; I cannot tell whether that is in the deposition - I only saw one woman in the house, who appeared to live there - I went into the next room - I did not look at Evans's shoes - he took them from under the bed, and put them on - this lantern was burning on the roof.</p>

The prisoner, George Francis, came to me on the 14th of August, and asked me to hire a chaise- he said if I did, the baby I had in my arms should ride - he went with me as far as Mr. Corben's door - he put 2d. into my hand, and said, "Mind you have the chaise that I point out" - I hired the chaise, put my baby into it, and went to Pancras fields - he then told me to take my baby out, and he would put his sister in - he then ran away with it.</p>
