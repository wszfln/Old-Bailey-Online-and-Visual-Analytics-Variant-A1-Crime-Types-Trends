               <p>next office—she counted the notes over and said that they were right—she had been in the habit of paying money in for me before and of signing bills for me because I could not see to do it myself—when she returned I asked her whether she had paid it in and she said, "Yes"—I never gave her per<lb/>mission to use any portion of the money for herself—next morning she got up at four o'clock and said that she would have a drop of brandy and take a walk, I said, "It would be much better for you if you would do that every morning"—I got up about half-past six, she was not in, but she came in while I was having my breakfast—I asked her whether she had paid the money into the bank and she said, "Yes"—I said I wanted one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—she said, "You cannot have it unless you draw a cheque"—she and her sister then sent me out to Mr. Cubitt's as an excuse while they robbed the house—when I returned they were both gone, and I missed table cloths, curtains, silver spoons, lustres, and two sets of china tea services.</p>

I have seen Armstrong go down there, and I have been with him nearly as far as there, but he would not take me with him; but as I was standing opposite White Lion-street, a young chap came up to me, and said, 'You are waiting for your mate.' I said, 'I am waiting for a chap with a sailor's cap on; and he said, 'He is down at Wybrow's.' I waited a long while for him and he did not come, and I went down there and looked in and I could not see him; he was gone, and the young chap said to me, 'Do you want any things? I said, 'No, but the other chap is gone down for some.' I did not see him again all that day. He came against my house the next morning and whistled for me, and as I was in bed I did not come out.

I am a cab-driver, and live at 43, Cowper-street, City-road, on the morning of 1st August, about half-past five, I saw the prisoner at the corner of Judd-street, Euston-road, he hailed me, I took my fare to the Euston-square station, and when I returned I found the prisoner within 100 yards of the place where he first hailed me—he had had some liquor—he got into my cab with a walking-stick and a bag, and told me to drive to Fetter-lane—I did so, and drew up at the Magpie and Stump—I afterwards gave the policeman the stick and bag of money.</p>

I am one of the Sanitory Inspectors of the City of London—I was formerly a butcher—I was on duty in Aldgate-market—I saw the two packages from the prisoner, containing part of two hind-quarters and two fore-quarters of beef—it was in a very pale and emaciated condition—it was coated with hot fat inside and out, and upon removing that I found inflammation between the ribs—in my opinion the animal had been suffering from disease some time—I made an incision in the buttocks, and found it smelt very strongly, which I presumed was physic—it was totally unfit for human food—it was covered with fat to hide the disease—I took possession of the meat, and had it condemned in the regular way—I took these labels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off the packages—on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. August I went down to Halesworth, and saw the prisoner—he made a statement, which I took down in writing—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was sent with the meat—(<hi rend="italic">In this letter the prisoner stated that the cow had met with a misfortune, and broken its jaw-bone, that it had no disease whatever, and that the farmer of whom he bought it had kept five stone of it for his own family</hi>,)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would diarrhoea or cold constitute disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Diarrhoea and dysentery together would—Diarrhoea of itself would produce wetness—the meat did not smell until I cut open the buttock—the ground upon which I say it was unfit for human food is from the wetness of the meat and the smell of the physic in the flesh—I have known of diarrhoea being caused to persons eating meat which had been physiced—it is common to rub poor meat over with fat, but it is only rubbed on the outside, not inside—the calf that was sent with this meat was good.</p>

               <p>my lodgings in the house of Mrs. Fidele Katzenstein—I was arrested by Mr. Hall on 5th December and taken to prison, Mr. Levin went with me—I did Dot see the defendant that day, Mr. Hall told me he was arrested—he had come with me from France to England to take a lodging for himself and his wife and daughter—I had known him about a year in Paris—he was in diffi<lb/>culties he had no occupation, he had been expelled from the Club where he had been for several years; that was in the Bourse—I had occasionally em<lb/>ployed him on some errands before I came to London—he came to the same house as myself in London, and three days afterwards sent for his wife, who came with her three daughters—I have lent him money out of charity, enough to prevent their leaving and to pay for their lodgings, and in England I lent him 5,000 francs for him and his wife and daughters to set up a Parisian laundry—that was in October—and on 24th or 25th November he came to me, told me he had no money to go to market and requested my charity—I refused to give them money and they requested me to lend them 3,000 francs on an inheritance to come—I gave them a bank note of 50f. to get rid of them and told him and his wife that they could not yet have spent the money which I had lent them; at my reckoning of their expenditure they ought to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left—I did not see them again for some time—from the time I came to England till I was taken in custody I never told the pri<lb/>soner or any one else that I was going to America, or that I intended to leave England and go abroad; I came to London to stay here and die here—on 5th May the prisoner came to me in Whitecross-street prison, that was the first time I had seen him since my arrest—I did not speak to him but Madame Rey spoke of the affidavits concerning my departure for America, and he said that he had told a lie in saving so; but that Mr. Hall and M. Bouillon gave him 12,500f. to lie, and if I was willing to give him the same price he would say the truth but he should be obliged in that case to leave London immediately, because Mr. Hall would get him arrested, as he was cunning enough to get him arrested beforehand if he had any suspicion: as to the oath he was to take, that he did not care because English justice was a comedy, and as to taking an oath he would take as many as might be re<lb/>quested from him at that price—I saw him again at Westminster at the trial but did not speak to him—I was in prison from 5th December to 16th June—I was taken in custody to Westminster to give my evidence—I heard the prisoner examined and cross-examined through an interpreter.</p>

Donflou after his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from Bouillon and his wife—they gave me 7,500 to 8,000f. out of 40,000f. which ought to have come to me under the will—on the day M. Donflou died the official seals were put on everything that was for his personal use; I had two wills of M. Donflou—shortly after that, on 1st December, I was charged with having abstracted a certain number of shares, by the adopted children of M. Donflou—the officers came to lock me up on 4th December, 1862—after M. Donflou's death and before the officers came, I sold fifty-five Orleans Railway shares, twenty-five coupons were my own property, coming from the Orleans railway, five other coupons were from shares belonging to my sister, the capital of which had been put into the lands of M. Donflou, and the twenty-five other coupons had been given to me by him for house expenses—I was charged with ab<lb/>stracting or stealing fifty-five shares of the Orleans Railway, belonging to the deceased, and fifty shares of the Lyons and Mediterranean Railway but I had not done it—I do not know whether I was accused of stealing twenty-five shares of the Paris Omnibus Company, but they were demanded of me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140022"/>
               <p>—I wish to explain; on 4th December, 1862 I was brought from my house, M. Bouillon the husband of the adopted daughter of M. Donflou came, accompanied by a commissary of police and two men, and asked me if I had in my possession coupons of Orleans Railway Shares, I said, "Yes"; he said, "Have you silver plate?"; I said, "Yes"; he said, "You are to be brought to the Prefecture of police"—I wrote at once to the Juge d' Instruction in order that he should have me brought before him and I was afterwards in<lb/>terrogated by him on four different occasions—he did not say, "You are charged with having fraudulently abstracted to the injury of the heirs of M. Donflou, thirty-five shares of the Paris and Orleans Railway, fifty of the Lyons and Mediterranean, and twenty-five of the Paris Omnibus Company," he only asked me how many shares I had in my possession—I did say, "I do not know what has become of the shares which are claimed of me"—from 5th December, 1862, to 24th April 1863, I was kept in prison with the threat that I might be kept there for two years—I maintained and still main<lb/>tain that I had not abstracted the shares I was asked about—I denied it be<lb/>cause I had not done it—I wish to explain, on the eve of the death of M. Donflou he told me that by our marriage I should be entitled to half of his fortune, but he said, "As I am unfortunate enough not to be able to live to fulfil my duty, here are 100,000f. which I give you"—the result of that enquiry was that I was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, and it was in order to take from me my plate and my shares in the Orleans Rail way that I was put in prison—I came out on 20th October, 1863, and on the same day that I came out the females of the defendant's family came to ask for me and I made their acquaintance—after I left prison I made the acquaintance of Mmlle. Rey—I did not see her while I was in prison—when I came out I went to live at the same hotel as the defendant—he was not a waiter there or anything at all—his wife and daughters had left him, not to give him bread—I remained in the same house with him till 1st July, 1864, when I left—I did not see him constantly during that time—I gave them hospitality for two months when they were living with me, and when they left I paid the rent of their rooms—I went to Bordeaux in July, and while there I think I wrote this letter without date (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Mdme. Lafourcade—as soon as I went to Bordeaux I applied to all the defendant's family for charity for him and then I wrote this letter—I left Bordeux and went to Paris in August, being called there by the Minister of Justice; and when I had settled all my business with the solicitor, I sold all I had and came to England in Sep<lb/>tember—at the end of August or in September I gave the defendant 50 Lyons and Mediterranean shares to sell for me, and 25 Orleans Rail way shares, and 25 Paris Omnibus shares—I had no knowledge of those shares when I was examined before the Juge d' Instruction—the defendant handed me over 94,000f. in French bank notes, out of the 100,000f. that M. Donflou told me he gave me when he handed me those shares—I gave the defendant 100f. for his trouble—he accompanied me to England, and we arrived on the 25th or 26th September, and went to the Hotel de Ville de France in Dean-street—I passed there by the name of Bertin, and also of Valentin, since the proceedings in France—nobody called me Bertin at the hotel, as nobody knew me, my letters came there to me in the name of Valentin—the ladies of the defendants' family called me Bertin, because I had told them not to call me Donflou any more—I do not know whether the defendant went by the name of Edward there—I always heard him called Jean or Lafourcade—I had never been in London before 26th Sep<lb/>tember, 1864; I had never seen it—I mean to say that I had not been in</p>

               <p>London in the early part of the same September—Mr. Hall made Coulan go up stairs with me when I went to prison, and had told me that he was in custody also; and coulan had shown me the warrant to arrest him—I did not say to Coulan, "Directly you regain your liberty, go to the hotel where I lodged, and ask them to give you a black leather bag"—I may have expressed a desire to have my bag—I did not say to Coulan, "If the Bouillons get that bag I am lost"—I had nothing to fear from the Bouillons—I did not say, "Get possession of that bag at any cost and get away to France with it"—if I expressed a desire to have it, I repeat it now—there was property concealed in the lining of that bag—I had taken a pretty large sum that very morning to the Union bank, and there was left in the bag 30,000f. in bank notes, and 14,000f. in coupons of railway shares—they were the coupons of the very railway shares which had been sold for me by the defendant—after the defendant left the hotel I went three or four times to Berwick-street, where he had started as a wine merchant, because he wanted to hire me the apartments on the first floor—Coulan was with him in Berwick-street, as friend and interpreter—Coulan twice accompanied me with his wife from the house in Berwick-street to the hotel—before he was entirely residing with Lafourcade he lodged with his wife in Jerrard-street—I persist in my statement that on 24th or 25th November I refused to give them 3,500f.; but I may make a mistake as to two or three days in the date—it was on 25th or 26th November, about 8 o'clock in the evening.</p>

Donflou suddenly became worse, and died before the ceremony could be performed—a day or two before his death he handed me a sealed packet, in the presence of a third party, and said "Here are 100,000f., which I give to you, they belong to you by our marriage, you will be entitled to half of my fortune: here are two wills, which if I die will add to your fortune: if I am unhappy enough not to live till to-morrow, so as not to accomplish our union and perform my duty, let that sum of 100,000f. be deposited in the hands of a friend;" and a few hours after he gave them to me they were deposited in the hands of a friend, on the same day that he gave them to me—I did not open the packet first; I knew the contents—I received that packet into my possession some months after I was liberated from prison—it was in the private cabinet of the <hi rend="italic">Juge d' Instruction</hi> that I was examined—Mr. Nicholay, the <hi rend="italic">avocat</hi>, was not present—there was only the Judge and his secretary, and the <hi rend="italic">gendarme</hi>—any shares or coupons which I sold after M. Donflou's death and before I was taken in custody, were what I had received from him for domestic expenses, while he was ill—I had received 25 coupons—I sold no other shares—I only used the coupons—I never took from the estate one <hi rend="italic">son</hi>, except what M. Donflou gave me—I employed M. Houett, an <hi rend="italic">avoue</hi>, to represent me before the French tribunal, but he sold himself to a solicitor at Versailles—I made a complaint against him, which resulted in bringing me a few thousand francs, and I received something from the Minister of Justice besides—the <hi rend="italic">avoue</hi> continued to prosecute, he was not punished for having broken the official seal, but he received a reprimand—the coupons which the defendant sold for me in Paris, for which I gave him 100f. for his trouble, came from the packet which M. Donflou gave me on 16th Septem<lb/>ber—I think these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the warrants which were shown to me by Mr. Hall himself, when I was in custody in London—when he showed</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 69, Davies-street, Berkley-square, and am a porter—I came to London last October, and went to the Hotel de Ville de France, kept by Mr. Katzenstein—I found Madame Valentin and the prisoner there—I had never seen either of them before—after I had been there a little time, the prisoner and his wife and family left the hotel and went to 56, Maddox-street, and I went with them—soon after leaving, he told me that he would send Madame Valentin to the galleys for ten years—I asked him the reason—he said he could not tell me that day—he told me two days after that it was about some shares which she had stolen from a M: Donflon, with whom she had been cohabiting thirty-two years, and that he would have her in prison because she had promised him money, and did not keep her promise, and if I would serve him and help him in the case, I should be handsomely rewarded; that I need not fear, for it was not for my proper account that I was acting; and that he would have Madam Valentin arrested soon—he said it was for revenge—he wrote to Paris to his daughter Matilde, in order to obtain M. Bouillon's address, who was the son-in-law of M. Donflou, and a few days after he received a letter from Paris from his N. daughter, in which she gave him the address of M. Bouillon—I saw the O. letter, and he told me that it was from his daughter Matilde—he told me a P. few days after that he would write to M. Bouillon to have a reward, and to Q. make a denunciation against Madam Valentin—he told me that I was to R. support him, and he made me promises—he afterwards said M. Bouillon S. offered him a reward of 12,000f. if he would tell him where the thief of the T. shares was, and that he would go and see a gentleman, named Hall, who had U. instructions from M. Bouillon to reward him, and that he would say every<lb/>thing V. he could to Mr. Hall—soon after that interview, I saw Mr. Hall at W. Berwick-street—the first time was about the middle of November—I have X. seen him with the prisoner, but was not present at the interviews—he Y. came about 11 o'clock, and went away at 1 or half-past—after he left, the Z. prisoner said that Mr. Hall would give him 12,000f. if he would give his AA. statement against Madam Valentin, and that he should do so. and accept the BB. 12,000f.—that was about 12th November—I saw Mr. Hall at the prisoner's CC. two or three days afterwards, but was not present at the interview that day DD.—Mr. Hall afterwards said he wanted the prisoner's statement directly, but EE. the prisoner said he would not give it without money; that Mr. Hall had FF. promised to make an agreement, and he would then accept—he made the GG. same communication to his wife in my presence; she said, "Well, at any HH. rate, if you have no money at present, we shall have 12,000f. at the end; do II. it"—two or three days after that, the prisoner said that he came from Mr.</p>

Bouillon—I asked him what he required from me—he said, "Only to corroborate my statement"—he did not tell me what I was to corroborate—I said that I did not know Madame Valentin, and it was very strange that he made such a proposal—he said that I need not fear, I was acting for my own sake, and he would reward me—he said, "As you understand both English and French, you will be very useful to me"—he had previously engaged me as his interpreter—two days afterwards I went with him to Mr. Hall's office—I think it was about 23d or 24th November—we saw Mr. Hall in his private office—he asked the prisoner who I was—he said, "It is my nephew; you need not fear, you can speak before him"—I am not his nephew—Mr. Hall asked him if he had made the written statement—he said, "Yes," and the prisoner signed an agreement—Mr. Hall said that it was an agreement for the deposit of the 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after the prisoner had signed the statement, Mr. Hall said, that to have her arrested under lock and key, it would be necessary to state that she was going to America—I do not think any other gentleman was present—the prisoner said that if it was necessary to say it, it must be said—the prisoner and I left the office with Mr. Hall and went to the London and Westminster Bank, Temple-War branch, where Mr. Hall gave a cheque to a gentleman at the counter, and the prisoner and Mr. Hall signed a book—the gentleman gave Mr. Hall a paper, which he gave to the prisoner, and said, "I hope you will have that money soon"; the prisoner said, "I hope so"—I went back, to the best of my recollection, to Mr. Hall's office, but the prisoner was not with me—I called on Mr. Hall next day, and the prisoner was with me—I went with Mr. Hall from his office to Chancery-lane at a little before 5 in the evening, to a place which I found out after<lb/>wards to be the Judges' Chambers—the prisoner was not with us—Mr. Hall there presented a paper to me, and I signed it—I did not read it, nor was it read to me—Mr. Hall also signed it—Mr. Hall and me each took the book and kissed it, and something was said to us, but I did not know then that it was an oath—I went next day with the prisoner to Mr. Hall's office—we saw him and his brother, and a French <hi rend="italic">avocat</hi>—Mr. Hall said that he had not succeeded in obtaining the arrest of Madam Valentin yesterday, and one of the Mr. Halls said that something must be <hi rend="italic">made</hi> to have her under lock and key as soon as possible—the prisoner said, "Make it strong this time"—we went out and came back a little time after, when a paper was ready which the prisoner signed—that was the paper I looked at when I was called this morning—I do not recollect whether it was signed at Mr. Hall's office, or at 13, Gray's Inn-square—I went with the prisoner and the two Mr. Halls to 13, Gray's Inn-square, and was present when Mr. Cree ad<lb/>ministered the oath to the prisoner—I heard Mr. Charles Kennedy Hall interpret the oath to him—he interpreted it correctly—he also interpreted the affidavit—the prisoner afterwards told me that he had obtained Madame Valentin's arrest—about 8 o'clock on the morning of 5th December, Mr. Hall came to Berwick-street, where the prisoner and I were staying—I had not seen Madame Valentin in the meantime—he said to the prisoner and his wife and others, "To-day is the day appointed for Madame Valentin's arrest"—there was a Sheriff's officer with him—Mr. Hall told me to watch till Madame Valentin came out of the hotel in Dean-street, and give a</p>

               <p>signal to the officer—she came out; I touched my hat, and she was arrested—a cab was called—she was put in, and Mr. Hall and I got in—we went in the cab to Bream's-buildings, and I received these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Hall—I showed them to Madame Valentin—we left her at Bream's buildings—I afterwards saw Mr. Hall, who gave me some directions, and in the afternoon I went back to Bream's-buildings, and saw Madame Valentin again—I do not recollect whether I showed her the papers then or in the morning—I then went to Katzenstein's with Mr. Hall and the prisoner—Mr. Hall and I went in, and the prisoner stopped outside—we saw Madame and Miss Katzenstein—I had these papers in my pocket—Mr. Hall showed Madame Katzenstein some papers—I went down stairs and made a com<lb/>munication to Mr. Katzenstein, but I did not show him any papers—he handed me a black bag, which I took upstairs, and told Mr. Hall that I had it—I did not give it to him then—we took it to Berwick-street, the prisoner's residence—he was there; and as no key could be found to fit it, Mr. Hall opened it by the two sides, and I saw some articles of lady's wearing apparel—after a more careful search, some coupons were taken out of it and a roll of papers, which had the appearance of bank notes—Mr. Hall counted the coupons with the prisoner, kept some of them, and gave me l,500f. in coupons to keep in my pocket till further notice—there Were also some French bank-notes, which somebody counted—they put the contents of the bag in again, and it remained a few days at the prisoner's—it was not sewn up again—Mr. Hall took the coupons—I was examined on the first trial of this matter as a witness on behalf of the Bouillons, when no one appeared on behalf of Madame Valentin, and there was a verdict against her—that was in the February sittings, after term this year—I was not examined on the next trial—Mr. Maniere was the attorney Madame Valentin had instructed to defend on that occasion—there was a conversation between me and Mademoiselle Rey in the beginning of May—before that conversation Mr. Hall proposed to me to sign a paper at his office—that was on 1st or 2d May—the prisoner told me that something existed in his deposition that was not true, but that he said it to have money—that was the part stating that Madame Valentin was going to America—I said I did not exactly understand why he said so—he said that he had no scruples with a woman of that sort—on another occasion, he said that the affidavit was not true, but he had done it for revenge, because Madame Valentin had promised him money and did not give him any.</p>

Bouillon promised you, to make you declare to such a lie; I know that he can promise much, but I know that he does not keep much of what he promises"—the prisoner answered, "I have not been satisfied with the engagement, I have received something on account; I have a perfect regular engagement for what is promised"—I said, "You know perfectly well that Madame Valentin is not about to depart to America; how is it when she has done you so much good, that you have done her so much harm"—he said, "If you knew how these things are managed in London; a book was presented to me, and I was asked to sign something, I did not bother myself about the remainder"—I said, "What you have done has had very important Consequences for her, since she has been put in prison, and is not yet out,</p>

Bouillon, to show me that such sum was well secured to him—I told him that it was infamy to have her arrested, because he knew well that the property belonged to her—he said that it was in order to make money—I told him I was very much astonished that he should take an oath so easily, that in England it was a serious matter—he said, that an oath which was taken not in our own religion was not binding, and that he had been made to sign two affidavits, the first not having been sufficient.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in partnership with Mr. Denton, we were solicitors for the Bouillons in the action—my brother is an avoue in Paris—about 16th November last, in consequence of a commu<lb/>nication from Paris from the Bouillons, I made enquiries about the prisoner, I knew nothing of him before that—the first interview I had with him was, I believe, on 17th November, at 56, Berwick-street, Oxford-street, where he lived—I saw him alone and he told me that he had in his possession docu<lb/>mentary evidence which would enable the Bouillons to find and recover without loss from 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of shares, payable to bearer, which belonged to them as heirs of a deceased person named Donflou—I already knew what their representative character was, but be refused to give any information or to name the documents unless he was remunerated for it—I communicated with Paris, and on 19th November received this power of attorney (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is in French—I then had another interview with the prisoner and informed him of the nature of my authority, but terms were not agreed upon and I considered the matter ended; but on 21st November he called on me and stated that he would forego the payment of a sum of money down—the proposal having been communicated to Paris and ratified, was put in writing on 23d November—that arrangement referred to the deposit of 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., this is the document—(<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum of agree<lb/>ment between the witness and the defendant, dated November 23d, 1864, and stating the terms upon which the</hi> 480<hi rend="italic">l. was to be deposited in their joint names, signed</hi> "<hi rend="smallCaps">J.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140031"/>
               <p>Coulan went with me—the same afternoon that the deposit was made, be<lb/>fore five o'clock, Coulan had handed me this paper with information, I think that was on the 23d, but it may have been on the morning of the 24th, before we went to Bow-street—it was not precisely an application at Bow-street, it was a mere submission of documents—up to that time there was no idea of a capias, I never thought of it and had not the least idea it would apply—there was no communication with the prisoner about his ma<lb/>king an affidavit for a capias—the paper that has been put in in Coulan's writing refers to the criminal proceedings—I got the information as to the possibility of Madame Valentin going to America, from Coulan—I mean that statement, it was on the way back from Bow-street—the prisoner was not present but Coulan repeated the statement next day in the prisoner's presence—Coulan gave me verbal information in addition to what was in the written statement—the first application to a Judge at Chambers was made late in the day on 24th November, on a joint affidavit of Coulan and myself—it was prepared in Coulan's presence and he read it—we were sworn on the same testament at the same time—the next application was made on the following day on a more explicit affidavit of myself and an affidavit of the defendant—I had had no conversation with him before that as to the probable intention of Madame Valentin to leave the country, but I had re<lb/>ceived the information from Coulan before—upon that a capias issued and on 5th December she was arrested—I had very considerable communications with Paris in that interval—the execution of the capias was purposely delayed—I did not when she was taken say that Lafourcade was in custody or that Coulan was arrested—I went with her to the lock-up in Bream's Build<lb/>ings—Coulan remained there after I tot and afterwards made a statement to me in consequence of which I saw Mdme. Valentin, who denied all know<lb/>ledge of the shares or coupons—in the afternoon I went to Katzenstein's to serve process on him in an action of detenue, for detaining part of Bouillon's property, and before I left the place I saw that Coulan had possession of a bag—I believe this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) there are some brass things on it and a ticket—there is no key that I know of—it was opened in this way. (<hi rend="italic">Bending the iron</hi>)—I did not open it, Coulan emptied it of all its apparent contents, and it was thought to contain nothing further, when in this corner some lumps about as big as walnuts were felt, thereupon it was forced a little more open and the lining was pulled out a little, and between the lining and the leather was a little bag carefully sewn up which we opened and out came three bundles of coupons—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a portion of them, these are all of the Lyons Railway Company, and these of the Paris Omnibus Company—the earliest coupon of the Omnibus Company is 1st January, 1863, and the latest 1st July, 1864—there are four sets, January and July 1863, and January and July, 1864—those of the Lyons Railway are 1st May, 1862, to 1st May, 1864, also four sets—I took possession of them but not of the Orleans then—there were also in the bag some sleeves, collars and small articles of dress, a bottle of scent, and a case with two pair of spectacles in it—there were no l,000f. bank notes—Coulan retained possession of the bag, all the other things being put back except these coupons—one morning in December when I reached chambers I found the bag on my table, tied up in a newspaper but who left it I know not—the same things were in it ap<lb/>parently—I put it aside on the top of a book-case folded up in paper and tied with string and there it remained till the day of the trial, at least it was produced once in the meantime—I have received from the prisoner some sale notes of shares which exactly correspond with the coupons found in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140032"/>
               <p>bag—these shares pass from hand to hand and the coupons can only be cashed at the Company's office, they must ultimately be paid by the Com<lb/>pany—a subsequent action was commenced against Madame Valentin by M. Bouillon after the discovery of the coupons in the bag, in consequence of fresh instructions from France; it was an action in trover for the shares themselves, the first action being for the coupons—they were both tried and the defendant was a witness—a M. Maniere acted as solicitor for Madame Valentin, I can hardly say whether he was her solicitor at the time of the first capias—I was only in communication with him three or four days after the arrest—Madame Valentin referred me to him as her solicitor on, I think, 8th December—he acted as her solicitor at the first trial on 6th February, when both actions were tried as undefended, and afterwards a new trial was permitted, and then the larger action was to be tried and the second was to abide the event; one was tried and the other only formally tried—I had two or three interviews with M. Maniere when he was acting as her solicitor and all notices were served at his office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked to account for them, and you said, "I had those copies made for an original to be prepared in case of necessity?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You will see that that is explained afterwards; at the time those writs were handed to me I bad not the least recollection of them, I supposed them for the time to be copies of the writs against Valentin, afterwards, when I found that they had been handed to him, they said that he asked to have his name put in—I said in my former examination that I supposed they were prepared to have originals made from them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked the question, "Do you remember saying, you are an actress of great merit, but you are not so clever as to succeed, you have brought many into trouble by your tricks, this poor young man Coulan was arrested through your tricks," did you say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my answer was not "This poor young man I might have said"—it is obvious that part of the question is run into the answer; it is not English as it stands; it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140035"/>
               <p>should be "This poor young man; I might have said that she was an actress, because I understood she had been on the stage"—there is something left out there—I did not make that answer; I may have been mis<lb/>understood—Coulan was present at the interview with Madame Valentin—I never heard him spoken of as "This poor young man."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not further asked, "Was Coulan there at the time? I believe he was—I believe he did not say one word, and he has told so many lies I do not know what is the truth. When did you know he was arrested? I knew it after he had done it to get me back the coupons." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The coupons were delivered over directly afterwards—I had them the game day, I think it was, I did not know of this until some time after the coupons were got—I wish to point out that there are manifest inaccuracies in part of that copy—on the day of the arrest, after Coulan had an interview with Madame Valentin in the lock-up, he came to me and repeated that being alone with her in her room she said to him, "How comes it that you are arrested with me?" "Thereupon," he said, "I took my cue and said nothing"; that she said, "You cannot be kept in prison very long; when you go out, go to my lodging, and get a bag you will find there, and make away with it, hide it, burn it, or go to France with it"—in consequence of that proceedings were taken, and the hotel-keeper gave up the bag afterwards—it was found that the bulk of property claimed could not be traced, and Coulan continued to act out the character of fellow prisoner for two days longer for the purpose of ascertaining who she was in communication with, in order that the property might be traced—that was about the 7th or 8th, and I was aware that she was under the impression that he was a fellow-prisoner—I knew that his scheme was to pretend that he had been arrested, and that he was carrying it on for three days, but the idea originated with Madame Valentin—it was done with my knowledge for two or three days—the papers were made by my clerk on 8th December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to persevere in telling my Lord and the Jury that on that day when they were made you did not know that it was process against Coulan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was informed when I returned that they had been made and that his name had been introduced, but that was after they went out of my hands—I was taken quite by surprise in the trial—I attached so little importance to it, that of course in six months the fact itself had passed from my mind—it dawned on me for the first time on the trial; I had no notion of sham writs—I saw what it was intended to impute to me, I was asked, "Are those in the writing of your clerks?"—I knew on the same afternoon that Madame Valentin's writs were copied and that Coulan's name had been substituted—I believe it was on the 15th that I first saw M. Maniere, for, strange enough, I was in the very act of preparing the affidavits to hold her to bail and I had him shown into another room—he said that he was going to get her discharge as she was not going to leave the country.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman living on my means—about 1 on Thursday, 13th July, I went into St. Jude's church—I there saw Jane Taylor, the pew-opener—I passed into the vestry and found everything in confusion, the things all lying on the floor, the drawers out, and three cupboards broken open—we sent for a constable—I missed a linen cloth, seven spoons, three coats, an umbrella, and some other things—two money-boxes had been wrenched from the body of the church, and the money was gone; a small bag and a fan had also been taken from one of the pews—I last saw the church safe on Monday at a quarter-past 1 in the day—I noticed the vestry door which opens into the school-yard on the Thursday—there were at least six marks where it had been forced open by a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> or chisel—there is an iron gate which leads from Turk's-row into this school-yard—it would be easy for any one to get over that gate, and they could then get into the school-yard, and then to the vestry door—I found some tapers which had been taken from a cupboard, and some empty wine bottles—I have since seen the umbrella, which I can positively swear to, I broke the spring one day, and I know it—I have had it some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 8, Brewer-street, Clerkenwell, and am errand boy to Mr. Redmond, gold-case maker, of Clerkenwell—about two weeks before Christmas I was taking a bag with a quantity of gold in it to the flatting mills—I was coming back with another boy named McMillan, I had the bag in my hand by a string—when we got to Market-street the prisoner came up and said, "What have you got here"—before I could answer him he cut the string of my bag—it was about 6 in the evening—he was with another man—they ran away together—I and McMillan ran after them, but did not catch them—about the middle of last June I was taken to the old-street Police-station—I was there shown ten men, and I picked the prisoner out from them—I am quite sure he is the man who robbed me.</p>

I live at 49, Grosvenor-street, and am secre<lb/>tary to the Italian Legation—I know the prisoner by sight, he has often come to me at the Italian embassy—I received this letter marked "A" in May—the usher of the Leglation, Angelo Pozzie, I think, put it into my hands—I have read it and have seen a translation of it before the Magis<lb/>trate which was correct—the prisoner also came to ask me to recommend him to the Society and I sent him several times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Italian Benevolent Society—I know the prisoner and have seen him write—this letter marked "A" is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">The letter being translated by the. interpreter was dated London, 24th May, to Count Maffei, stating that the Italian Society did not care for his letters, and calling them "monecchi" or mountaineers; that as an Italian he was entitled to help from the Society, his daughter having died for want of the necessaries of life, it concluded thus</hi>: "My blood and the blood of my daughter who is so inhumanly dead, blood for blood. If this letter shall not have the desired effect I will go myself to the Society and vindicate the blood of my daughter. I have sworn to do myself justice; blood for blood. To die on the scaffold is bad, and to die for want of the common neces<lb/>saries of life, to die of hunger is worse, of the two deaths I have chosen the mildest, hoping that the Italian Legation will do me justice—I am with all respect to yourself.

I applied to the Italian Society for assistance but they sent me away. I used the word "monechi," which is only the same as calling a London man a cockney, I meant to say that the blood of my child was the blood of my blood and the flesh of my flesh, I had no bad intention, and I wrote it very quick, it is in Italian and it sounds different in English, it is, in fact, only an application for assistance I said that I would rather die hanging than starving, but I had no intention to do anything. I addressed it to the president himself, not to any member.</p>

                  </hi>. I was steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Starnaway</hi>—on the morning of 13th May, about 2 o'clock, I was standing aft, and spoke to Baker; a few minutes afterwards Reed came down, and said to Baker, "Baker, what did you mean by saying you are as good a man as I am"—Baker said, "What do you mean by telling me to go to h—?"—Reed said that Baker was the first man that had told him he was as good a man as he was, and that he should try it, or something to that effect—they then commenced fighting—I do not know who commenced it—I heard Reed say, "You have</p>

               <p>got a belaying-pin," and I heard a belaying-pin fall on the deck—this is a belaying-pin—it is put into the side of a ship to hold the ropes—I went and called the men, and told them that the mate was abusing Baker, and kicking him—Baker was down, and Reed was punching him about the ribs with his fist, and kicking him violently—I went away, and the captain came out—he asked Reed what the row was about—Reed said that Baker had told him that he was as good a man as he was—the captain told Reed not to beat him any more but to bring him aft—Reed was taking him aft, and when close to the cabin Baker fell, and Reed kicked him violently—this lasted about a quarter of an hour—the captain was standing close by—Baker was then taken to the cabin, and afterwards confined in the sail-room, which was three-parts full of sails—it is about twelve feet long, six or seven feet wide, and six feet high—there are two small windows about six inches long and four wide, but they were nailed up—Baker was confined there seven days—he is a peaceful in<lb/>offensive man, and had never been at all riotons—after the fight Reed asked me if I saw it, and I said, "Yes"—he then asked if I saw Baker strike him first—I said, "No"—he said that he had something in his room that would carry five or six balls, and he wished he had used that—I saw Baker's face afterwards, and it was cut and bruised all over.</p>

I was carpenter on board the <hi rend="italic">Starnaway</hi>—on 12th May, I heard Reed and Baker having words at the fore part of the ship—I did not hear all that was said—about two o'clock next morning I was called up by Murphy—when I got on deck Reed had got Baker down, and was punching him—he had got his knee into his stomach—I touched Reed on the shoulder, and said, "Mr. Reed, let the man get up"—he said "Car<lb/>penter, leave me alone, he has struck me with a belaying pin"—Baker called out, and said, "He is biting me"—the captain came to the door, and said, "What is the matter?

I live at 32, Bath-street, Clerkenwell, and am a painter and grainer—on Wednesday, 5th July, about half-past 10 in the evening, I was with the deceased, coming from Islington, along Goswell-road, towards the General Post-office—there were ten of us, we had been to a temperance meeting—we had to cross Spencer-street from the right to the left-hand pavement, close to a public-house, which I do not know the name of—there was a light there, but no other gas-light except from a beer-shop round the corner—the deceased attempted to cross first, and I was about two feet behind him—when he got about two feet from the other side of the pave<lb/>ment he made a half turn, seeing, I suppose, a cab, which was about thirty feet from us—I turned to look what was the matter, the cab shot past, and the deceased had got his hands on the flank or neck of the horse—I made a</p>

               <p>snatch to pull him away, but he made a kind of half turn to the right—the horse's leg threw him, and the off wheel of the cab went over him—the cab came from Charles-street, crossing the Goswell-road, and at the rate of about ten or twelve miles an hour, as near as I am a judge of a horses' speed, and I have frequently ridden about with my brother in his chaise—it was more of a gallop than a trot—the horse and cab ran away when they had gone over the deceased—I did not see the cab stopped, I was too much engaged—I heard no one call out—I took my friend to a doctor—I saw no vehicle standing still.</p>

                  </hi>. I am out of business—I was with Mr. Blythe on the night of 5th July, driving along Charles-street—just as we were entering Spencer-street near the public-house, there were two ladies and three gentlemen in company—they appeared to be coming out of the public-house and had got some two feet from the kerb when the cabman called out and I called out as well—four of them stopped, but this unfortunate man rushed against the horse's head, struck the collar, and fell down—he appeared as if he was stooping in running—in my judgment, the cabman could not have avoided the accident—he was not driving so fast as a cab drove me down here to-day, between five and six miles an hour—previous to our coming out of Charles-street into Goswell-road, the cabman pulled up his horse to allow a lady to pass by—that was not quite at the corner, some few houses from the corner—that was some few minutes before the accident—after the accident the cab was turned round by the policeman—I was sitting on the side where the accident occurred—the cab was stopped by Mr. Blythe, and pulled up on the off-side, not quite twice the length of this Court from the scene of the accident—I noticed No. 27 I think—I saw the policeman run up on the near-side; he crossed the road and came up to the cab just as I was alighting—it was then at a standstill.</p>

Q.</hi> Then the place where the defendant pulled up his cab, was quite within sight of the people where the accident occurred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close to the spot—those who were present and saw the accident, could not fail to see the cabman pull up—he pulled up because Mr. Blythe shot his hand through the hole at the top, and not at the instance of anybody getting into the middle of the road and holding up his hands—there was no one in front of the horses' head—I had my hand on the dash-board to alight, before the policeman came up, and Mr. Blythe was out of the cab on the near-side—the off-side was close to the kerb——the cabman stopped his cab at the off-side before the policeman touched his reins, or made any signal—the policeman did take hold of the reins after the stoppage—I heard the cab<lb/>man call out; I do not know whether my friend must have heard it, because his attention was called to putting his hand through, and the cabman's shouting was not so loud as ours; I heard him call out before in Charles-street—he was going at the ordinary pace of cabs—I have been accustomed to drive for the last six years, and know what pace a horse goes at—it was impossible for that horse to go more than eight miles an hour, if he was pushed it would not exceed six miles—I was perfectly sober, and so was the cabman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 195, Goswell-road—I was at the corner of Spencer-street, crossing the road to fetch my supper beer—the first thing I heard was the cabman calling out most lustily; just as he was coming out of Charles-street, a passenger appeared to be going across; he stopped for her, but she went back to the kerb, and then he loosened the horse's reins, and started on again till he got to Spencer-street—I noticed that he did not use the whip, for it was in the socket—when he got six or seven yards up, there was a party of people on the pavement, and the deceased crossed and stooped his head as if to go under the horse's head, but he was knocked down—it was in my judgment quite impossible to avoid the accident, for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140060"/>
               <p>there was a light van standing at the corner of Spencer-street, and the people that crossed came from behind it—they must have seen it, because it obstructed their crossing—I am not a good judge of horses' speed, but I should say it was the ordinary speed, five or six miles on hour—I saw the policeman take hold of the horse's head after it had stopped.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far did he get before he did stop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five or six houses up Spencer-street, nearly twice the length of this Court—it was not forty yards—I should say he pulled up about twelve yards from where the accident took place—100 yards would be absurd, that would be halfway up the street—the deceased's friends must have seen the driver pull up, unless their attention was called to the deceased, and they did not hear—the policeman crossed the road to him after he pulled up—I did not hear the policeman examined—he may have held up his hands, but he did not stop the horse, and I did not see him hold up his hands—he could not have caught hold of the horse's head by the reins, and stopped him without my seeing it; if he says that he did, it is an utter untruth.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 119). About half-past 12 on this morning; I was on duty in St. Ann's-lane—I went down the lane to Peter-street—I then saw the three prisoners together, standing about ten yards from me—I went back again up the lane, leaving them there—when I had got about sixty yards up I heard something fall heavily on the pavement, and on look<lb/>ing round I saw three or four persons, and saw the female prisoner run from them as hard as she could towards me—I stopped her, and said, "What are you running for?"—she said, "Nothing"—I said, "What is the matter down here?"—she said, "Some man has knocked a chap down, and I ran away because I was so frightened."—I said, "Well, you had better come back with me, and let us see what is the matter"—I took her back to Peter-street, and there saw the prosecutor, Mr. Goodacre, and the two male prisoners The prosecutor said, "That is the woman who robbed me"—the two men said, "No, I am sure that is not the young woman, the person who has robbed you has run down St. Ann's-lane"—they said that repeatedly—I said, "Nobody else has run down there"—both the male prisoners came very close to the woman, and I pushed them away three or four times—they both asked Mr. Warrington repeatedly not to press the charge against the woman, as they were sure she had not got his watch—Mr. Goodacre was accompanying me down to the station with the female prisoner and the prosecutor, when Fulbrook went up to him, and, I believe, caught hold of his arm and tried to prevent him going, and I saw Mr. Goodacre strike him, or push him with some force, from one side of the street to the other—I sprang my rattle, and the two male prisoners directly made their escape—I did not see any more of them that night—I had no doubt that the prosecutor had had a little to drink, but he appeared very nervous from the effect of the fall—I could not say whether it was the effect of drink, or the effect of the fall—he recovered when he got towards the station—about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver was found on the female prisoner at the station—I afterwards went back to the place where the robbery was committed, and in a narrow passage close to where the female prisoner had run past, I picked up this handkerchief—I took Davis into custody the next day—I told him I wanted him for being concerned with others in stealing a watch from a gentleman, in Great Peter-street,</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—the prisoner was admitted on 4th July, with various wounds, which I should say were self inflicted—the prosecutrix was admitted about 4 o'clock in the morning—she had a large lacerated wound on the scalp, on the right side, and a smaller wound below it, also four wounds on her face, which had been done by a blunt instrument; two of them were on the forehead and one communicated with a fracture of the bone of the face, under the left eye—this hammer would produce such wounds—she was in the Hospital six weeks.</p>

I live at 10, Slade's-place, High-street, Deptford, and am a carpenter, and also paid agent to the Royal London Friendly Society, 51, Moorgate-street—on 23d April last, the prisoner entered my service as a clerk, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—his duty was to collect moneys and enter them on the receipt cards kept by the members, and also in a collecting book which he had for the purpose, and to deliver the moneys he had received during the day, to me at night—I subsequently increased his wages to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and after that to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he remained in my service till July last—he did not pay to me on 26th June, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Charlotte Smonton, or on 5th July, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mrs. Scotter—the week he was given into custody I asked him if he had received it, and he denied it—he has never paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received on 6th July from William Haggerty—I am answerable to the Society for the money that is received.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the Eight Bells Public-house, at Greenwich, for my brother—In May lout I engaged the prisoner as barman—from certain suspicions that I had, on saturday 16th July, I called in a constable named Alvin—I marked two half-crowns and gave them to him to have them passed over the bar—that was about 7 o'clock—I afterwards looked in the till and found that they were there and subsequently I found that one was gone, one remained—about 11 o'clock when the business closed 1 called both the barmen into the bar—I told them I thought I was being robbed, and that I imagined the prisoner was the man that was robbing me—I then asked the prisoner if he had any objection to being searched—he said, "No," all he had in his possession belonged to him, and won what he had saved—we then went up stairs into his room, and in his box we found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in small silver, rolled up in paper, and a silver watch—he had 34 or 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on his person, and amongst the money the constable discovered the half-crown that I had marked—I recognised it directly—I have not the least doubt it was the same—on the prisoner being taken before the Magistrate on the remand we searched his box again, and found another pound in silver wrapped up in paper, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more in another piece of paper—we never allow a barman to give change from his own pocket, we always have sufficient money in the till—when I looked in and saw the half-crown I should imagine there was about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver in the till—when the prisoner came into my service, he asked me to intercede and get his money weekly, which is very contrary in the trade—he said he was short of money he bad 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. advanced to him, and I afterwards let him have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was some weeks before the night in question—he was in my service altogether eleven weeks.</p>

I am single, and live at 8, Clarence-street, Rotherhithe—Fennell lodged in that house for about eighteen months—the deceased was my father; he was quite sober on Wednesday, 26th July, and I was sitting at the window, and I saw him at the top of the street—I saw him <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi>, and went and told him to come home—when he got to our door Gainey hit him on the nose, and made it bleed, and while he stood in the road bleeding, Fennell knocked him down, and kicked him in the back—he ran into No. 10 to get away, and Gainey pulled him out, and kicked him again on the left side—he got up, and then Fennell hit him on the eye—he fell with the blow—my aunt ran over to take his part, and Gainey hit her, and raised a great lump on her head—Fennell's wife then took the prisoners in doors, and my father went in doors, and washed his face—he went to work next day, but came home ill at 12.30—he went to bed, but could not rest, and went down to my uncle's—he took to his bed on Thursday night, and did not get up any more—he died on Sunday morning—Mr. Frith attended him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Smith, paid," was painted on one of the bars—the carman and Clark went into the Dun Horse again, and drank, and when they came out again, Clark went to his work and 'the van drove off—I drove after it to York-road, Battersea—it stopped at the back premises of the prisoner Smith—he is a smith and wheelwright—I saw the van partly unloaded there—Smith came out in his shirt sleeves, with a paper in his hand, while it was being unloaded—I then left and went back to Mr. Moser to tell him what I had done—afterwards, about 4 the same day, I went with, the constable Bell to Smith's premises—I saw the iron as soon as I entered the gate—I believe Bell asked Smith whether he had received any iron that morning—he said he had—he asked from whom—he said, "From Moser"—I said, "It is here" and he said, "Yes it is here, but I have an invoice"—he produced this invoice, and gave it to Bell—he was asked where the other part of the iron was—he said he did not know, for he was not there when the iron was brought—of course I knew it was him, because I had followed him on the 7th with iron from the same premises, but I thought he was noticing me in the cab, and gave it up—I saw Smith go into the Dun Horse with Clark and Goodall on that occasion.</p>

               <p>information I received, I went to Smith's premises, at Battersea, with Ballard, Neale, and Mr. Moser—I asked him if he had received any iron from a firm in the Borough that day—he said he had—I asked what firm—he said, from Moser's—Neale then said, pointing to the iron, which was close by, "That is the iron that was taken away from the firm this morning"—I then asked Smith if he had paid for it—he said he had—I asked if he had got a bill or invoice—he said Yes, he had—he then produced this invoice—I examined it and asked if that was all the iron he had received—he said, Yes, that was all—I said, "Have you not received some sheet-iron and some five-eighth rod iron"—he said, "No, I have not," but directly afterwards he said, "Yes, I have received some sheet-iron and rod-iron, but I was not present when my man brought it home"—I examined the bill and the amount, and said, "The five-eighth rods and the sheet-iron is not down here"—he said, "Is it not? probably my man has brought it by mistake"—I then told him that the whole of the iron had been stolen from Messrs. Moser's in the Borough, and that I should take possession of it—he said, "Well, I have paid for it, and it shall not leave my yard"—I spoke to Mr. Moser, and then said, "As you have paid for it, who did you pay"—he said, "My man paid Clark, I gave him two sovereigns, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get him<lb/>self some refreshment, and he brought me back 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change"—after a little conversation I left, and then went to the carman, with Smith, at 34, York-terrace, twenty or thirty houses from Smith's house—I saw Staines, the carman, and asked him if he had received any iron from a firm and brought it to his master—he said Yes, he had—I asked who he paid for it—he said, "Clark, I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and brought the iron away"—I asked if he knew anything about the sheet-iron and rod-iron being placed in the van—he said no, he did not know, he took the order from his master—he did not mention a written order at the time—I then went to Messrs. Moser's, and took Clark into custody—I showed him this invoice—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some pieces of paper—he wrote a paper and handed it to me—I produce it—I saw the iron weighed when it was brought back—it weighed between ten and eleven cwt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>was to supply customers with goods when they came, and to deliver the goods—I have seen Smith several times before; I know him as a customer—I went with Bell and Ballard to his house on the 18th, and saw the iron found there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to the present indict<lb/>ment. I have known Smith seven or eight months. A week previous to 18th July, he told me that he had bought some iron, and that he had paid Mr. Sample in the office for it. He asked me to go and have something to drink, and he then said to me, "I want some iron," naming some different sorts; "if you can get that for me, I will send up some money for yourself." He was to send the first thing in the morning. On the Tuesday, about 8 in the morning, Smith's carman came, and I loaded him with four bars of angle iron, five bars of inch-square, two bars of three-inch, three bars of five-inch round, a bundle of five-inch rod, and a bundle of sheet-iron—he sent an order by the carman. This is the paper he sent—the carman gave me two sovereigns; they were in my pocket when I was taken to the station—the policeman did not take this paper, he never saw it; he took everything but that. I made out the invoice, because Mr. Smith's carman asked me to give him a receipt for what money he gave me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that bit of paper was left in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in my waistcoat-pocket—this is the paper; it was attached to the brief of my Counsel—I gave it up to Mr. Brook, my attorney, on the Tuesday following, on the second hearing before the Magis<lb/>trate—it never went out of my possession till then—I showed it to my bailers—I did not find it on my first examination—I have been in Mr. Moser's service between seven and eight years.</p>

Moser's on 12th July with Smith—he bought a little lot of iron, about four or five bars of 3/4 and 5/8 iron, and also a sheet of iron—he then ordered one of the porters in the yard to look out some round iron—I took away a sheet of iron on that morning—I don't know what the order was—I fetched the iron on the 12th—when it was looked out, Smith said he would call for it in a day or two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law writer, and live at Maria-terrace, Rother<lb/>hithe, nearly opposite the gate of Mr. Black's field—it is about 25 or 26 yards from my first-floor window—on 3rd July, about half-past 11, I was sitting there, and heard the rattling of the chain at the gate—it was a beautiful clear moonlight night—I looked across the road and saw the two prisoners at the gate of the field—Gray opened the gate and went into the field and drove the cattle towards the gate—Taylor stood by the gate, and as they came through he just backed into the road, threw up his arms, and made a noise with his mouth, and turned them up the road towards London</p>

               <p>—Gray then closed the gate and went along the field on the inside—I did not see him get into the road—Taylor drove the beasts as far as I could see—I spoke to William Matthews and remained where I was till a policeman came, which was in about twenty-five minutes—I spoke to the policeman—there is a lamp on the road on the same side as my house, about 40 yards off—I saw Taylor pass under that lamp—he was under my observation altogether I should think about seven or eight minutes and Gray about five minutes—on the following Thursday I went to Rotherhithe police-station, where I was shown into a room where were ten persons, I believe, with the two prisoners—I pointed out Taylor first and Gray afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the same house as the last witness, and am a timber porter—on Monday night, 3d July, I was walking along the Kew-road, from my work, and saw the prisoners standing at the gateway of Mr. Black's field opposite my house—one was in the gutter and the other close to the gate—I heard Taylor say, "I wonder what o'clock it is?"—I then went to my gate and stopped there, the men stood for a few minutes, and the taller man opened the gate and went into the field and drove four beasts out, and the shorter man turned them towards the Kent-road—the man who drove them out put the gate to and then went up behind the hedge right through the field and I never saw any more of him, the other one went along the road with the beasts—in passing the lamp I observed the colour of the beasts—it was a very clear moonlight night—ten yards was the shortest distance I was from the men—I was ten yards from Taylor when he was in the gutter, and when I heard him speak—they were ten minutes under my observation to the best of my knowledge—on the following Thursday I went to the Caledonian-road police-station and from there to the Metropolitan Cattle Market—at half-past three in the afternoon I went round the market and saw Taylor sitting on some fencing—the moment I walked to him he got off and began to stroll round the market—I followed him and he went into a bank—I went in to light my pipe think<lb/>ing it was a public-house, and met Taylor at the doorway and asked him for a lucifer—he said, "I will feel in my pocket," and I recognised his voice instantly—I went and told the police and he was given into custody about three minutes after—I afterwards saw Gray driving some sheep in the market, and he was also taken—these are the two men I saw at the gate of Mr. Black's field, Taylor especially, and Gray to the best of my belief—I did not hear him speak.</p>

I live with the prosecutor—on the night of 21st July, I got home rather late—about ten minutes past 11, I was bound to go to the rear of the premises, and I saw the two prisoners in the yard—I saw Wright by the padlock of the warehouse door, and saw Crudgington cross the yard, and try the sash—they then went over the wall—I went round and found the sash open—they came back over the wall—I went up to the back gates, and heard one of them say, "We will have it now before we go"—I then went up stairs, got my life preserver, and put my slippers on, went out at the front gate, and went round to the rear of the premises—I saw Wright standing at the corner outside our premises with a woman, and saw Crudgington and another man stooping close to our gateway as if they were being sick—they saw me, but did not know me—I then returned through the house to the back of the premises—there is a lamp in Salisbury-crescent, and I stood just outside the back door and had a good view of them—I saw Wright in the warehouse handing soap to Crudgington, who was just outside the window, and he was packing it in boxes—I let them go on for a little time, and then I walked up to Crudgington—he said, "Halloa, my Lord, we have been looking for you long enough; we have got you at last"—I said, "If you don't look out, you may very likely catch something else"—he said, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, don't say anything about it; I have done trouble, you know; you know me well enough; <hi rend="italic">I'm Ikey Crudgy</hi>"?—he then escaped over the wall—Wright was then coming out of the window, and fearing I should get a knock myself, I thought the best plan would be to take the first opportunity and give him one, which I did—I hit him with my life preserver, and then caught hold of him and tore his coat and waist<lb/>coat—he struggled with me and got away—I had a slight knowledge of him before I have not a doubt but that he is the man—I have known Crud<lb/>gington from the beginning of last winter—about half-past 2 the same morning I went with a policeman to North-street, Lock's-fields—Crudgington opened the door—he made no resistance.</p>

Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Walking foreman and time keeper—I work for Mr. Evans, an extensive building material dealer—I was never in a court of justice as a criminal in my life—the persons I saw in the yard were eight feet four inches from where I was watching them at first—there was light enough for me to discern who was there and what they were doing—I can't say how I hit Wright; it was on the head somewhere</p>

On the night of 21st July, I was passing Worcester-cottage, about 11, and saw the prisoners near the rear of the premises, talking together, with a woman—I went on my beat, and at 12, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and got some information from the last witness.,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 427). In consequence of information I received from the last witness, I went with Wheeler to Crudgington's house—I knocked at the door, Crudgington opened it in about five minutes, and on seeing me he ran to the parlour door—I said, "I shall take you for a burglary"—he said nothing—on 27th July, I was with Sergeant Ham, when we met Wright in York-street, Walworth-road—Ham said to him, "How did you come by that cut over your eye"—he said, "I did it in running"—he afterwards said, "I did it in a drunken frolic"—we told him he was charged with being concerned with another in committing a burglary—he said, "If you take me you will be very foolish; I known you are two detectives"—we were in plain clothes—we took him to the station—he was put with five or six others, two of whom had bandages over their heads, and Wheeler immediately identified Wright as the man.</p>
