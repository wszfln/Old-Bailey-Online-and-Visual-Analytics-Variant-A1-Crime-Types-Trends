I called in at the City of Bristol, a public house. I had a porter with me, with a bundle, containing the things mentioned in the indictment. Mr. Hay the prisoner came into the house. I ordered my man to take the cloaths away. Mr. Hay said he should not take them away, for he would have them; there was a scuffle between my man and him; Mr. Hay took the goods, and bid a man lock them up in his room for his use.

               <p>Q. Suppose you was to tell the whole story.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Smith. He was second mate of the Eagle. I bought the goods for him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had received some money of him, I believe.</p>
               <p>Smith. He owed me money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received no money from him?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor no order?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was your debtor for the goods; was he?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; he owed me money before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these goods would have increased the debt?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; and the captain of the Eagle would have given me a draft upon his owners for all the money due to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drop into this house by accident?</p>
               <p>Smith. I went in to drink.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you invite this press-gang; belonging to lieutenant Hay, to press Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Smith. I don't know what you are raising.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire that Kennedy might be pressed?</p>

               <p>Q. You say you did not come into the house with Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; he was in the house before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he press'd before you came?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; and he was in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it can't be true, that when you came into the house you pointed to Kennedy, and said that is the man?</p>
               <p>Smith. I deny that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to press Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Smith. How do I know?</p>
               <p>Q. Who told them that Kennedy was a sailor?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Kennedy did not say to you, How could you use me so ill as to betray me?</p>
               <p>Smith. I don't know but he did next day; he did not that day; I was on board the tender that day. - It was not Kennedy said so; it was one of the press-gang, that lent a hand off with my cloaths. I don't remember Kennedy said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cloaths were taken up, did Kennedy own them or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050004"/>Smith. I never heard him own them in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What pretence did Mr. Hay make for taking these things?</p>

               <p>Smith. None at all in the world, but insisted upon it that they should be lock'd up in his room for his own use.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give no reason why he took them?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all - I told Mr. Hay, if he took the cloaths from my man, I would swear a robbery against him. I told him they were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Court. Upon your oath, do you think that the prisoner took the cloaths from you with a felonious intention - with an intention to steal them, in the presence of all these people?</p>
               <p>Smith. I do from my soul believe he did?</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. You do believe he did?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say Kennedy did not own them?</p>
               <p>Smith. He did not own them in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you don't know that he said to whilst you was in the house?</p>
               <p>Smith. I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any body else say they were Kennedy's?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any talk of your having bought them for Kennedy whilst you was there?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all; they came up with their great clubs, and the man was obliged to deliver the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no talk of your having bought them for Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all; there was nothing said.</p>

            . I am a porter. I went with Mr. Smith to the City of Bristol, a public house, on the 20th of October. I carried a bundle of cloaths for him: I put the bundle down upon the bench, and put my elbow upon it. Soon after the press-gang came up. Mr. Smith bid me carry the things back to where I brought them from. Mr. Hay took hold of one end, and I the other. He got the bundle away from me, he gave it to one of his gang, and said, Take this to my room, and lock it up for my use. My master said, that is not right, they are my property. Mr. Hay said, If you say much, I will send you on board the tender. They came up to me with their clubs; I was glad to get out of the house; I was afraid of being murdered.</p>

            . I am a foremast man, and belong to the St. Antonio, Lieutenant Hay had a press gang at the City of Bristol public house. I belonged to the gang.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any message to go to Smith's house to search for men?</p>
               <p>Williams. Smith himself came down between 6 and 7 in the evening, and asked if any of the gang were in the house. I was called out of the kitchen to him. Smith told me that there was a mate of a vessel at his house that had got no protection, and he asked me to go and press him. He did not tell me the man's name. I went with three of our gang to Smith's house; the man was not there. He sent for us a second time; we thought he was playing tricks with us, and we would not go. About an hour afterwards, Smith and Kennedy, and a porter with a bundle, came to the house, Smith sat down in the kitchen in an arm-chair; he looked round to us, and said, pointing to

               <p>"That is your men." Upon that I asked him if he had got a protection; he said, No. I said, Pray what ship do you belong to? I think he said the Eagle, and was bound to the bay of Bandorus. I told him I must stop him till my officer came in. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050005"/> looked immediately upon Smith; he called him a villain, and asked him how he could behave in such a manner, to bring him to a press gang? The porter put the bundle of cloaths upon the table. Kennedy took them up, and put them upon a copper; then he gave them to me, and said, As I am your prisoner, I beg you will take care of my cloaths. In two or three minutes lieutenant Hay came in; he said, Williams, what is the matter? I told him what we had been doing of. Mr. Hay said, My friend, have you any protection? He said, No, none at all. He begged Mr. Hay would take care of his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. When Kennedy said the cloaths were his, what did Smith say?</p>
               <p>Williams. He said they were not his, for he had bought them, and was not paid for them. Kennedy said he was not scoundrel, and asked our liberty to lick him. He said, Smith, do you owe me some money, or do you not? Smith said, No. He asked him the second time; upon which Smith said, Yes, the sum of 4 l. 4 s. and the third time he asked him, he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he owed the money for?</p>
               <p>Williams. That was not mentioned; this was before Mr. Hay came in: When he came in, I acquainted him with what had passed, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any struggle about the cloaths between the porter and Mr. Hay?</p>
               <p>Williams. Not to the best of my remembrance. When Kennedy said he had no protection, Mr. Hay said he must go on board the tender. He said to Smith, My lad, if you will come on Monday morning, the right owner shall have the cloaths. I carried them up to Mr. Hay's room, and after that I took them on board the tender, with Kennedy's name to them, and took a receipt from him. On Monday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, our lieutenant went on board to regulate the men. Smith came on board at the same time, and brought a bill of what he had paid the shopkeeper for them. I said, Are you not a pretty man to use the man thus? He said, his reason was, he was coming down to the rendezvous, in order to see him safe on board the ship; that he did not chuse to go, but insisted upon picking up a whore.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of the cloaths being carried to the Regulating Office?</p>
               <p>Williams. I heard they were; I did not carry them.</p>

             and a porter, Smith pointed to Kennedy, and said to Williams. That is your man, Williams; then asked him if he had a protection: he said, No. He told him he must detain him. Then Kennedy took his bundle, and laid it upon a copper. Smith said they belonged to him, he would take the money for them. Kennedy said they did not, and that Smith owed him 4 l. 4 s. Smith said he did not. Kennedy mentioned it a second time, then Smith said he did.</p>

               <p>Court. There is no occasion to go any further; there is not the least foundation for charging this man with a felony upon the evidence of the prosecutor himself, unless we can suppose the lieutenant could be thought to commit a robbery in the presence of all these people. Now the thing comes out, these two people give another evidence contradicting the prosecutor in every particular of his evidence. To charge a man of reputation in this manner with a felony is an abominable thing.</p>

             I lodge at one Mr. Allen's, a turner in Pains Alley, Aldersgate street. I met the prisoner in Moorfields about twelve o'clock at noon, the Friday before my Lord Mayor's day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I had never seen him before There was another man with him. They asked me to shew them Bethlem, which I did. They asked me to go in with, them; I did. I went round the inside with them, then I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050006"/> them I could not stay any longer, for I was going a journey. The prisoner asked how far; I told him I was going to Stretham, and I had the road to seek. The prisoner said that they were going that road, and they would instruct me. I wanted to go home to make an alteration in my dress, to put on a clean, apron, and the like. They followed me to Fore Street, and begged I would go in and drink a glass of wine with them for shewing them Bethlem. I went with them to the Angel in Fore-street, from thence they were to go to Stretham. They persuaded me not to go home; they said it was seven miles to Stretham. I was glad of the opportunity of going with them, and did not go home. They called at another public house before we got out of town; after that we called at another public house. They said they called there for some writings that the man that was along with the prisoner was going to have made over to him at Stretham. This public house was in Oxford Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with them at all these public houses?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes; at the first place we had half a pint of mulled wine between us three. At the other two houses we had a glass of brandy. We said in Hackney road an hour, or an hour and a half. This was between two and three o'clock. From thence we went along the road, then they turned down a lane, I don't know the road, nor the name of it; then they took me over some fields, and then they turned into another little town, and then took me into some more fields. It was then between four and five o'clock. I believe then they began to curse me, and d - d my blood, and said they had not brought me there for Stretham, but they had brought me there to lie with me. They had both of them their hands in my pocket. I lost half a crown. They blasted me for a b - h, and shook me about. They demanded my buckles out of my shoes; the prisoner took them; they were silver; I never had them again. The prisoner said to the other man, Why don't you make haste and pull her buckles out of her shoes? what signifies her crying and making a noise? They put a pair of black buckles into my shoes, and they wanted me to take some money. I begged for God's sake they would let me go home to my children. They said I had no children. I said I had. They took my handkerchief out of my pocket; they put some money into it, and crammed it down my bosom. Meekin d - d me, and bid me go home, and think myself well off that I did not lose my life. They bid me not makes any noise.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did they put down your bosom?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. It was yellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your buckles taken by force, and was you put in bodily fear by these men?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It is odd you should take a fancy to these two men you never saw before, should shew them Bethlem, tell them a story of being to go a journey to Stretham, and that theft men should be just so luckily going to the place you was going to.</p>
               <p>Mazemore. They appeared to be gentlemen, and they behaved vastly well. I asked them if it was a road-way; they said the chief of the way was a road. They behaved very well all the way till they got into this field.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where did you dine that day?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. In Hackney road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No, before. We had mutton chops for dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. All agreeable company there?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think you should make your visit to Stretham rather late?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. They hurried, they said, upon my account.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to dinner?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. And the robbery, you say, was afterwards?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. A widow, I have two children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body of this upon your road home?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I told nobody of it. The first place I came to was Hoxton. When I came home I examined my money.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe you found it not to be it good as you could have wished?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. When I came to Hoxton, I did not know where I was. I asked a boy which place it was; he told me, Hoxton. He shewed me the way to Bishopsgate Church-yard. went to feel in my pocket to give the boy some thing, and I had no money, I had half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050007"/> crown in my pocket when I was with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make the first complaint of being robbed of your shoe-buckles?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I sent for my sister, and told her I had been used ill and robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. My buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. What drink had you with your mutton chops?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I had a glass of brandy; they had beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink no beer?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes I drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never been at Stretham before?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it take up to see Bethlem?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all lost time. Did you ever see them before?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No neither of them. As I was going from the shop I work at to dinner, I saw the prisoner cross the road; I ran up to him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see nobody as you came home?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes, several single men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to them?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; I was afraid the men would come after me and murder me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the field you say you was robbed in from the little town you came through?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. About half a mile, or better. I went over the fields all the way till I came to the road to Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you dine at?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I think it was the sign of the Smiths Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you perfectly sober at this time?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes, very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose care were your children left?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. One was in the house, the other at nurse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you intend to return to town that evening?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I was not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. After dinner you pursued your road - Had you on thoughts of being benighted? - They had told you it was seven miles to Stretham.</p>
               <p>Mazemore. They said so.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you lived in London?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Sixteen or seventeen years.</p>

               <p>Cross. Yes. I had not seen her a long time. She used to wash for me. She asked me to come and see her. She said she was at home only on Sundays. I went to see her the next Sunday about four o'clock. I had seen the prisoner, and another man with him, about the road. I asked her who the men were that I saw with her. She said she wished she knew who they were. She did not tell me any thing that had happened them. I saw the prosecutor again about a week after; then she told me what had happened. I told her, if I saw him again, I would secure him. One day, about three weeks ago, after having been looking for him, I was informed he was in custody. I asked him if he did not remember seeing me that day; he said No, at first; afterwards he said, Yes, he did. He said to her, That gentleman (meaning me) is your friend, and said to me, You are a young man as well as myself, if you will make this matter up, I will return the buckles. He said, what other injury he had done he would make her any recompence for she should require.</p>

I sat down in the box with them: this little man had been in company with her before; they had a pint of wine together; he went out of doors to make water; then she said to me, what a foolish young man that is! I said, why? says she, he says he has had an aunt died that has left him 700 l. I said, so much the better; she said, if I had half of that, it would be the making of me: I said, so it might be. I asked if he was her husband; she said, no; she said he was an acquaintance he had met with by Bethlem; she said they went up to the gate, but it was not time to go in; she told me they were to go to the play in the afternoon, and that they were a going to take a walk till the afternoon; she bid me say I was her cousin; that we should all three go together, and she would make him pay for all. She proposed to go to Dobney's Bowling-Green; we went there; then we went up Bethnal-Green Road, where we met that man; he asked where she was going; she said, a little way with a shop-mate of mine; we took a walk round by Hackney; she complained all day that her stuff shoes took water; she wanted the man to give her a pair of pattens; she said she would be married to him, as he was a little foolish; she said she would get seven or eight guineas of him; instead of that, she got nothing but a parcel of medals, after all was over and past; fifty people, I suppose, were coming along the road; we dined afterwards in Hackney Road; we came arm and arm along the road; she wanted me to come another day to see her; she told me where she lived; it was two hours before dark when we parted: I asked her if she had got any money; she said, yes, hold your tongue, I have got about ten or twelve guineas, that will be the making of me; I bid her a good evening, and parted with her; I never saw the man before in my life - If your Lordship pleases to call my cousin

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Sherwood; my master sent me down Houndsditch with Mr. Crowden; when we had got about twenty doors from my master's, two men came up against us, and push'd us against the wall; one of them pull'd Mr. Crowden's watch out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Which took the watch?</p>
               <p>Jennison. The prisoner did, Mr. Crowden bid me follow them directly; I did; they were not out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run away together?</p>
               <p>Jennison. They walked at a very great rate; I gave my master information of it; my master stood at his door; I shewed him the man; my master and the oldest 'prentice took him.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the men dressed?</p>
               <p>Jennison. The prisoner was in blue, the other man in light-coloured cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take only the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jennison. Because he had taken the watch; I told my master so at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the way was the prisoner on?</p>
               <p>Jennison. The same side as my master's house; the other man had crossed the way.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Jennison. He asked what we wanted with him; we told him a gentleman wanted him that would be in, in a few minutes: we took him to my master's; the prosecutor came in; we searched the prisoner, but did not find the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch at the time it was taken?</p>
               <p>Jennison. I saw it in the prisoner's hand when he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he did with it?</p>
               <p>Jennison. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now are you sure the prisoner is one of the men that shoved the prosecutor and you up against the wall and robbed him?</p>
               <p>Jennison. Yes.</p>

I turned back, and went into his shop; he shut the door; presently the man came in, and said he had been robbed of a watch. I said, By whom? He said he could not tell: the young man said, I will take my oath you was with the man. He said first he saw me with the man that committed the robbery; now he swears that I committed the robbery. I was searched; it was not found upon me. I had nobody with me; I could not have conveyed it away. Mr. Sherwood said, Where is your companion? I said, No-body was with me: they sent for an officer, and I was carried to the Poultry Compter.</p>

            . I lost the sheep mentioned in the indictment, from out of a meadow facing my house. I enquired next morning of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050010"/> turnpike-man in the road to London; he told me a man on horseback and a boy went through the turnpike about twelve o'clock with some sheep. I found the sheep at Islington, in Mr. Stanton's the salesman's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How were your sheep marked?</p>
               <p>Ware. They were marked with a W and an O on the near side, and a dot of tar upon the near hip. The prisoner told me at the Compter that he stole them out of a meadow opposite my house.</p>

            . I am a salesman. About seven o'clock on Friday morning I went to my pens in Smithfield. The prisoner had put the sheep into my pens. I told him he must take them out. He asked me what he must do with them. I asked him whose sheep they were; he said he brought them from Chatham, or somewhere in the Kentish road. I asked him if he had any letter from the owner, or any body's name that was to sell them; he said, You shall sell them. I asked whose they were; he said a man he met with on the road bid him drive them there: and when they were sold, a woman would come and take the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the name of the person.</p>
               <p>Stanton. No; he stood at the pens. I went and asked some other salesman if they knew any thing of the sheep; they did not. The prisoner stood there near three quarters of an hour. The prisoner slipt away towards Porter's Block. A person I had desired to watch him, secured him, and brought him to me. I suspected from the first that they were stolen. He was in several different stories; first, that he had a father; then, that he had none; that his mother lived at Camberwell. The prisoner escaped from the person I left him in the care of. We found him by St. George's Church, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think such a boy as this could steal so many sheep himself?</p>
               <p>Stanton. No; it is plain he did not.</p>

            . I was sent for on the the twenty-third of last month to the Three Tuns in Smithfield, to take charge of the prisoner. He said he brought the sheep from the nineteenth mile-stone near Gravesend. I asked him if any body was concerned with him, he said, Yes; a man he had never seen in his life before, who was to give him a shilling for driving them to town. He said he wished he could see his mother, for then it would be make up in a quarter of an hour. I asked him if she had been in Smithfield; he said, Yes; we walked twice round Smithfield, but could not find her. He said the man came with him as far as St. George's Church, and then gave him a groat or eight-pence to hire another lad to help him to drive them to Smithfield. He said the person that employed him lived at Camberwell. Sometimes he said it was his father, sometimes not. We enquired at Camberwell, and found there was such a person as he had described, who was a smuggler, but he had absconded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>A woman at the Three Crowns at Chatham sent a letter to my mother that I could get employment there to draw beer. I went down in the Gravesend boat, and went to Chatham. I thought the place was too grand, and I too little to do; so I went to Gravesend again, I was sick a-going down, so I thought I would walk up. About a mile from Gravesend I met this man. He asked me how far I was going. I told him to London. He said he would gave me a shilling to drive some sheep for him. He gave me some gin; then he went down a little road. He was on horseback. He went down in a field, and told me, if I saw any body a-coming, to come down and meet him; if not, I was to turn the sheep to London. When he came to the turnpikes, the men asked him how many he had got; he said, sixty-three. He parted from me in Kent-street. He gave me my shilling, and four-pence to hire a boy to help me to drive them to Smithfield. He told me to give them to any salesman to sell, and meet him at one o'clock on London bridge.</p>

Her business was parting rags in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to know the rags you thus found were yours?</p>
               <p>Mills. I found this key [producing one] in her house. This key opened my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the rags in these bags?</p>
               <p>Mills. Somewhere the bags had my mark.</p>

               <p>Q. From inspecting the bags, could you swear they were your property?</p>
               <p>Mills. I should have been loth to have sworn to them in the house of any body else. They were foreign rags.</p>

                        targets="t17701205-10-off42 t17701205-10-crimeloc44"/>; I saw the prisoner pass by my house, on horse back, on the 6th of October, at near twelve o'clock at noon; I was at my door with my child; I had got a brush, and was sweeping off some dust from my neighbour's door, that had fell from my house, which was then repairing, when he passed by. In about five minutes, I heard a voice behind me, saying, Mr. Holloway, you are the man I want. As soon as I heard the prisoner's voice it terrified me, because he had frequently before threatened my life. I started round to my left, and I saw the prisoner close to me; he was then on foot, and had a pistol, which I then believed to be my own, that I had lent him some time before. It was under the flap of his coat; I could see it as far as to the cock; he endeavoured to pull it out with his left hand, but it was so entangled that he could not get it out immediately. I sprung round in order to get into my house, and was in hopes I should have got in before he disentangled it; but he got to the door before I could shut it after me, and got the pistol in between the door and the door post, so as to prevent my shutting the door. I endeavoured for the space of a second or two, to keep the door against him; I found he was too powerful for me. As I saw the kitchen door open, I quitted to door thinking to escape into the kitchen. As I was quitting the street door, he said, d - n you, I will have your life directly: and the pistol went off before I could get myself quite into the kitchen, and the ball went through my left arm, then I saw him go over to Mr. Peck's a founder.</p>
               <p>Q. When he d - d you, and said he would have your life, did you see in what manner he held the pistol?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I was making for the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation is the kitchen from the door?</p>
               <p>Holloway. The kitchen opens out of the wainscot on the left side of the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the road did you live on?</p>
               <p>Holloway. The same side as Bloomsbury; the door opens to the left, and the kitchen door is on the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the street door been opened?</p>
               <p>Holloway. After I felt the ball, I turned round and saw him shutting the street door, which was then half open. The pistol must be brought upon a straight line to reach me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the ball found?</p>
               <p>Holloway. One was in the kitchen, upon a line with the position of my arm; another upon the head-way of the door of the passage that leads into the yard: it went into the brick wall.</p>
               <p>Q. You was executor to the prisoner's brother, I think?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard the prisoner threaten you at any time?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes, many times. About the Sunday fortnight before he shot me, he killed a hen of mine: I was out; the maid told me of it when I came home. I saw the prisoner at the door; I said, you are a blood-thirsty fellow; I am surprized you will be guilty of such blood-thirsty actions. He said, G - d d - n you, I would sooner kill you than your hen. - I sent to Mr. Sheldon, the surgeon, he was not at home; so I went to the hospital and had my arm dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any reason why he had malice towards you?</p>
               <p>Holloway. There was some money secreted, which I went and demanded for the benefit of the children and the widow; before that, he was as agreeable as any man; but, after that, he owned me a spleen. He came to me next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050013"/> morning, and said, G - d d - n you, you have frustrated our scheme. I said, What do you mean; He said, We wanted to go to Barnet to buy cows. I said, If it is requisite, for the good of the children, to buy cows, you shall have the money again, and I will go with you to buy them. He said, No, G - d d - n you, I wanted to buy them in my own name.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the prisoner a man of a very weak understanding</p>
               <p>Holloway. I never held a great deal of conversation with him, so don't know the extent of his abilities.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not reason to think he is out of his mind, at times?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I never heard any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you threaten to have him pressed?</p>
               <p>Holloway. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistol was your own, was it not?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes. I had lent it him some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. What for?</p>
               <p>Holloway. The widow said she was robbed the night her husband died. The prisoner came and told me so; and, at the same time, asked for a pistol: I lent it him. He said, he was in danger of his life in going over the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the pistol went off by accident, or by design?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I believe, by design. [This is the pistol, producing a horse pistol.]</p>

            . I am all enameller, and live in Mr. West's Garden's, Tottenham-court-road. I was going by Mr. Holloway's house, I saw him and a man with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What man?</p>
               <p>Fournier. I am not sure that the prisoner is the man - I saw Mr. Holloway, his child, and the man together; they seemed to have words. Mr. Holloway, all of a sudden, made a push to get into his own house; the man followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish what off, the words were?</p>
               <p>Fournier. When the pistol went off, he said, D - n you. I saw him push the, pistol in at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the man when the pistol went off?</p>
               <p>Fournier. Close to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you?</p>
               <p>Fournier. I was within about three or four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the cock fall? Or how did it go off?</p>
               <p>Fournier. I heard the snap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive whether the door was open, or shut?</p>
               <p>Fournier It could not be shut, the pistol was between the door and the door-post.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive whether the door opened wide?</p>
               <p>Fournier. It did not open quiet; he held his hand up thus [describing the presenting of a pistol, elevated pretty high] The door was open thus much. [Describing it to be about five inches.]</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pistol quite out of sight when it went off?</p>
               <p>Fournier. No; it was about half of it out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Fournier. He went away directly. The child cried, My papa is killed. The child was shut out of doors; I knocked at the door; a woman opened it; Mr. Holloway came out that instant, he held up his arm; I said, Thank God you are alive. He said, I am wounded. I saw the wound in his arm, the blood trickled down. I saw the prisoner cross the way as soon as he had fired the pistol. I was in a great fright; I made haste home.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner's arm was hurt by the door?</p>
               <p>Fournier. I can't tell any thing of that.</p>

He started up in a great passion and sent me out of the yard quicker than I came in: he ran at me with his pistol and I was afraid of my life. A gentleman offered me half a guinea to take him. I followed him into the yard: I tripped up his heels and took him.

I ran down the road, when I came to the corner of Mr. Holloway's house the mob pushed back, and said he was going to fire again. Mr. Richmond and some more people brought the prisoner out. The people asked him how he came to do such a rash action. He said he intended to give him a pill out of it; he repeated it several times, that he did intend to shoot him, and was sorry he had not done it.

               <p>Q. Did it appear to be a wound occasioned by a ball.</p>

            . On the 5th of November I had been drinking with some friends till my reckoning amounted to more money than I had. I slipt from my company, and pawned the outside case of my watch for 2 s. 6 d. in the Strand. As I was coming home, about half past seven o'clock, I met the prisoner upon Ludgate hill. She asked me to give her something to drink; I went with her to the <placeName id="t17701205-17-crimeloc72">Cock on Ludgate-hill</placeName>

I offered to leave my watch with the landlord, for the purl, he refused to take it. I wrapped it in my handkerchief, to keep the dust from getting into the work, and I put it into my coat pocket. Soon after, the man that brought me my purl, bid me feel for my watch; I found it was gone. I was so much in liquor that I was almost insensible.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Stewart. It was between nine and ten when I came into the house; I went to her room about ten; this was about twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Stewart. I was not very sober when I came to the house at first. I gave her a shilling; she picked my pocket of the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not give it her?</p>
               <p>Stewart. I am sure I did not give it her; I was not so drunk as that. I had wore the guinea in my pocket a month or six weeks; I could know it from a great many; she owned to the justice and the watchman, that she had taken it. There was a young man with a girl, in the other room, had lost 5 s. 3 d. he went to charge a watchman with her, and that was the way it came out.</p>
               <p>Constable. We were called to a man that was in this house. We were taken to the room where the prosecutor and the prisoner were in bed, he waked, and said let me see if I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050019"/> robbed. He got out of bed, and felt for his breaches, and said, I have lost all my money. I asked him what he had lost; he said, a guinea and some silver. The watchman searched the prisoner, and found the money, laid in the indictment, upon her. She was very agreeable to be searched: she said, she did not know she had again in the world; she said, they went to bed in the dark, and she did not know what the prosecutor had given her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had robbed him of it?</p>
               <p>Constable. No. she did not.</p>

I looked at my watch; it was about half past eleven. I did not get out of bed directly, but waited to hear more noise, I heard a noise like people getting in; then I got out of bed: I looked out at the window, but saw nothing. The third time I looked, I saw a man coming up a paved court that leads to the window where I heard the noise come from; it was a ground floor window: I went back to bed, and rang the bell for the servants: I came to the window again. and saw a boy in a blue coat, about the size of the prisoner Deverux. After I had rang the bell a second time, my servant came down; I believe my ringing has alarmed them; they were making off: I believe I saw four of them when they were going away. They had broke the upper sash, in use to give room for the screw to go up, and they has broke two panes intirely to pieces, the others were cracked. They had broke the window shutter in two or three places, and the sash me thrown up. I never saw any of them before, so I can't sware to them.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Tompkins. I am wife to the last witness. When we searched the prisoner's box, we found those things of ours that are laid in the indictment. [producing them.]</p>

               <p>Tompkins. On account of the sugar; and Mrs. Jubello had missed her ruffles: so I insisted upon the maid's boxes being searched. She said very little for herself; hardly any thing at all. She lived with me three months, and behaved very well; we had a good character with her, and I hope this is her first offence. Her father and mother are honest, industrious people.</p>

             the elder. I am mother to the child that has been abused; she was ten years old the fifth of October. The day after St. Luke's day she drew beer for Mr. Ivory. Her master came down to the place where I work to acquaint me that my child had been abused by the prisoner. I went to her; she was in a bad condition; her private parts were swelled to a great degree, and there was blood and nastiness upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear as if a man had lain with her?</p>
               <p>Matthews. She did; she has been at the hospital for the force. Mr. Gloster, the surgeon, examined her, but he would not come to give evidence without I subpoena'd him, and it was not in my power to subpoena him. I am a very poor woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the child tell you how she came to be in that condition?</p>
               <p>Matthews. She told me the prisoner threatened to kill her if she told it to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any disease upon her besides the force?</p>
               <p>Matthews. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had your girl been there to draw beer?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Near six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. She is very young, but I suppose you have taught her her catechism and the like?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a married woman, now having examined the child, can you take upon you to sware that she had been laid with by a man?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I found her body so that she must have been lain with by a man.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray is there not a boy draws beer at this house.</p>
               <p>Matthews. No, there is none.</p>

             the younger. I draw beer at Mr. Ivory's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath. Now if you was to sware that which is not true, what do you think would become of you?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I should go to hell. The prisoner lodged at my master's: one morning when my master had called me, I opened the door to answer him; the prisoner bursted into the room; he said if I cried out he would knock me down and kill me that minute; he flung me down upon the bed, and put his private parts into my belly; he hurt me very much, and their was blood and nastiness came from me; he said if I told any thing of it, he would kill me that minute. I was afraid to tell my master or mistress for fear of losing my place, and my daddy and mammy beating me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050024"/>Q. Did you perceive any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived there at that time?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Almost six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>
               <p>Matthews. The maid went away on Thursday night, this was done on Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie with the maid before?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Yes. After he had done what he pleased with me, he said if I told any body of it, he would kill me, and then he went out of the room. About a day or two afterwards, I went into his room in the morning for his candlestick; I was to get them out of all the lodgers rooms to clean: he took his candlestick up and flung it at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to use you so again?</p>
               <p>Matthews. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you tell of it?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I was afraid to tell; the maid found it out by the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was that?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I don't know rightly: my master can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after his throwing the candlestick at you?</p>
               <p>Matthews. About three days after that, the maid went up to make the bed, and found the sheets in a bad condition. I was out a getting in the pots; when I came in my mistress asked me what was the matter with me; I did not know what to say; I told her at last; my master went directly to my mummy; she came and examined me; and then we went before the justice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a boy at your master's at that time, that drew beer?</p>
               <p>Matthews. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie by yourself any time?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Yes, every time my master had no maid.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had the maid lain with you before she discovered the nastiness you speak of upon the sheets.</p>
               <p>Matthews. Two nights.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ivory: I came there on Wednesday the seventh of last month; I lay along with this girl that night. When I made the bed the next morning, I found the under sheet in a very bad situation; it was all over matter; I did not know what might have happened; I took no manner of notice, but when I went to make the prisoner's bed, I found it in the same condition, only not so bad as hers. Finding the sheets in that condition, I turned the feet part up to the head to lay myself and the child clean. Not knowing what it was, next morning I found it a great deal worse all where the child lay; I went directly and acquainted my mistress with it; being a mother of children, it shocked me very much. I desired her to examine the child, for I was afraid somebody had injured her. My mistress came up and saw the situation the sheets were in from the running. The place on the sheets was as broad as the palm of my hand; the matter was yellow and white. My mistress<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050025"/> asked her what was the matter with her; she bursted out a crying and said, it was the children. She said he burssed into her room and threw her upon the bed, and told her if she resisted he would kill her. Her shift stood alone with matter</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the prisoner's bed after that</p>
               <p>Mead. It was always in the same condition</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner's bed appear in the same condition as the child's.</p>
               <p>Mead. There was more, mixture in his, his was a sort of yellow and green.</p>

            . I examined the child on the nineteenth of November last, in the presence of Mr. Howard, Mr. Gloster, and the house surgeon of the Infirmary. We found upon inspection of the parts, that there was a discharge; we did not take it to be venereal, but the fluor albus; there did not seem to be any mark of violation, on the contrary, the hymen, which is the test of virginity, was almost entire; the passage was very straight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hymen partly broke?</p>
               <p>Purdue. Only that part that generally breaks to allow for the fluor albus to issue through; the passage was so straight as hardly to receive a finger. I had a letter from the commanding officer of the regiment to examine the prisoner, who was said to have the foul distemper. I went to him to Tothill Fields Bridewell, and I examined him and found him intirely sound. I examined him the eighteenth, the day before I examined the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do you, or do you not, believe that she had been entered and defiled?</p>
               <p>Purdue. I think it was impossible; I believe she had never been defiled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if there had been any attempt of that sort?</p>
               <p>Purdue. I did not see any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no swelling, or any other signs?</p>
               <p>Purdue. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But this was a month afterwards?</p>
               <p>Purdue. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not all these symptoms have disappeared in a month's time?</p>
               <p>Purdue. If there was any inflammation or swelling, it would have disappeared in that time. If she had been entered, I should have imagined the passsage would have been much more open than I found it: the passage must have been more open if she had been entered by a man.</p>
               <p>Q. If all the swelling that was occasioned by the force had disappeared, could you form a sufficient judgement, whether she had or not been known by a man?</p>
               <p>Purdue. To the best of my judgment I think she had never been defiled: the hymen, as I said before, which is the test of virginity, was most intire.</p>
               <p>Q. It must be a complete month between the act done and your inspection: you have heard the act. Might the swellings and the appearances of force have disappeared in that time?</p>
               <p>Purdue. I should think it might; I should think she never could have been penetrated by any man: the discharge was quite a vicid: when I saw it, it had the appearance of the fluor albus, not of the venereal infection. I am certain there had been no laceration from the beginning, for if there had there must have been some mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the fluor albus incident to all ages of the female sex?</p>
               <p>Purdue. Yes, more or less.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fordyce. In August last, the last Tuesday in the month, save one, coming from my house at Roehampton to London, between eight and nine at night, my coach was stopped: I saw three, my servants told me there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050026"/> six or seven of them; they desired to have our money; I saw two on one side of the coach and one on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of their persons?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. It was between light and dark, I could not see them distinctly; I delivered my money, so did my wife; I gave them, I believe, seven or eight guineas; they afterwards demanded my watch; my wife and I both gave our watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they produce any fire arms, or any thing of that kind?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. There were three pistols in the coach at one time; they put a pistol to my head, and another to my wife, the third pistol was pointed to a gentleman sitting on the other side of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them then?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. They went away precipitately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any pursuit after them?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard of your watch again?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen your wife's watch?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. Lady Margaret (my wife) was robbed of her money and watch, and some things hanging to the watch at the same time; that watch I have seen, since it was sold to a watchmaker of credit open Ludgate-hill: I have seen one of the rings that was fixed to Lady Margaret's watch; I don't know the number of the watch, but I know the watch, it is a gold repeater; it was made by my particular directions: I saw the prisoners at Sir

               <p>Fordyce. Sir John asked me whether I thought I knew the man; I said I had been robbed by a man very much resembling Clark, and dressed much as he was at that time: the prisoner Clark has a particular face, * and I thought I recollected him to be one of those men that robbed me. I would not speak positively where the life of a fellow creature is at stake. I believe he is the man.</p>

            . I am cook and clerk of the kitchen to several noblemen; the prisoners, being in company with me, produced two rings; questions were asked them how they came by them; they did not scruple to declare that they robbed Mr. Fordyce of them: they were both in company together; one of them wore one ring, the other wore the other ring; one was a large cornelian; they shewed me them to appoint a value.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known these people before?</p>
               <p>Stamford. About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Stamford. At Marylebone, at a private house where they dined. I asked them how they came by them; they said upon the road. Mr. Fordyce's robbery had been mentioned in the papers. I asked them from whom they got the rings.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Stamford. I believe in August.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give any account of this?</p>

               <p>Q. How come you to be there?</p>
               <p>Stamford. I was taken out of a house where girls at the town used to live, and was chiefly inhabited by them. Clark was taken at that time, but he was acquainted of that charge: Clark and Defoe were afterwards apprehended, then I appeared against them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lodge at that house?</p>
               <p>Stamford. No, I did not; but I was there about ten or eleven days.</p>

               <p>Stamford. I can't tell the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. To Vine. Did you ever hear the prisoners talk of this robbery?</p>
               <p>Vine. They made a common practice of robbing; they got their bread by it; they talked of their robberies; I can't say particularly as to this robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. To Stamford. Was it before or after the robbery of Mr. Fordyce, that they talked in this manner to you?</p>

When he was brought back, an made a spring to the fore door, and got upon the first stair; I brought him back again. Mr. Scott assisted me, we had a struggle for about ten minutes I believe. At last we got the better of him, and tied his hands; then I staid with the prisoner whilst Halliburton searched the house: they went down into the cellar and brought up this engine and these two dyes (produced in court.)

            . I searched this house along with the last witness. We found the engine fixed upon a square piece of timber, tied upon a post, about two foot over, and the square piece of timber was fixed upon that, the large fly was upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find these?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. In a back cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else there?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. There were many other things which they call dies and dabs and bolsters; I am unacquainted with that trade: here is some sort of metal that I found which has been stamped, and here is a great deal of solder (producing it.) I found this bad shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other engines found?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. There was a small one which is here also (producing it.) The prisoner said the things belonged to one Lewis and were not his property.</p>

These things I was unacquainted with, therefore I took little notice of them; the small engine was all to pieces, we have had it put together since. The die was in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of it?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. I can't tell what part, I did not believe then that it was a die.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it loose upon the ground, or where?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. I cannot tell that: I did not know the use of any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that it was Lee's house, did you?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. I can't tell that he was in the house when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your warrant?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. To search No. 2. Mr. Scott had not got the name; they had been there but a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's trade?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not produce the dies upon the first examination?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. I did not know that there were any gentlemen belonging to the Tower there.</p>

               <p>Q. What is that engine?</p>

               <p>Q. What is the other engine?</p>
               <p>Sage. That is a cutting engine, this is a dab, and this is a bolster, and this is a die (pointing to them.)</p>
               <p>Q. A die, for what?</p>
               <p>Sage. It appears to me as if there had been feint shillings raised by it.</p>

               <p>Sage. No, the engraver in the Mint knows more of these things: I know this is a press, and that appears to me to have been a die for a feint impression of a shilling.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lewis came, and said this apartment would do for him: he came in and looked at the kitchen parlour and wash-house; he said it would do very well; he would not go up stairs; he said the lower apartment would do.</p>

               <p>Tithes. I can't tell justly whether it was him or the other man; I did not take notice at the time.</p>

               <p>Winter. I am a watch-key maker.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you use such a kind of press?</p>
               <p>Winter. I do, for stamping watch-keys: they use one much in the same manner for stamping buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that press an instrument made use of by different people, in their different trades?</p>
               <p>Winter. They cannot do without one.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you make use of such a flie as that?</p>

               <p>Q. You know the prisoner very well?</p>
               <p>Winter. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade is he?</p>
               <p>Winter. He was a <rs id="t17701205-41-deflabel182" type="occupation">publican</rs>

               <p>Q. He is nothing in the button way?</p>
               <p>Winter. No, this press will stamp any thing round.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it would stamp a farthing?</p>
               <p>Winter. I believe it would, if it was flat, and laid upon an impression.</p>
               <p>Q. Look if you can find any thing among these things used in the watch-case or key way?</p>
               <p>Winter. Here is nothing that can be of service in the watch-key way.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the prisoner before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Winter. I believe it might be two months before; I had never been at his new house.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the difference between a press and a stamp for that purpose; which is made use of?</p>
               <p>Winter. There must be both; they can't be made by a stamp without a press; it is impossible; you cannot make the case without the thing is as large as this.</p>

               <p>Wyatt. I saw him in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him in the cellar?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner's Council. Did you ever see him have any thing for making buttons?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No; I thought he was a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever employed to search this house for any thing?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. After Mr. Lee was in trouble, Mrs. Martin sent for me to come to her; that was the person that lived with him. I went to her in Bridewell; there she delivered the chest that was taken out of the house, which Sir John had returned to her; I found that thing in searching the house [it appeared to be the face of a button.]</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the prisoner was in trouble?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. A few days; I was desired to go to the house to take care of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bid you look at this particular place?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I moved every thing; I was not desired to look in any particular place.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the key of the house?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Mrs. Martin gave me the key on Friday night; Mrs. Martin and Mr. Lee were both committed together.</p>

I had two keys in my hand; I struck him on the face with them; I had my other hand upon the bundle; upon my striking him he let it go, and struck me on the right-side of my head.</p>

               <p>Gill. Upon the side of his face, very trifling; he tore my cap from my head, and pulled my hair in a dreadful manner. I cried out murder: there were some people gathering potatoes in an adjoining field came out to my assitance, and the prisoners ran away.</p>

               <p>Hewett. He was the <rs id="t17701205-43-deflabel192" type="occupation">Custom-house officer</rs>

They came upon the main deck and began to hustle one another about, but there was no blows; the deceased got the prisoner up against the main shrowds; I took hold of Atkinson's arm, but I could not pacify him. The prisoner got clear from him and ran from the quarter deck to the main deck, and took a capston bar out of the long-boat, which was standing upon the main deck, and held it up and swore he would knock down the first man that came near him. The deceased ran towards him and endeavoured to get a hand-spike out of the long-boat.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a dangerous weapon, is it not?</p>
               <p>Hewett. Yes. Before he got the handspike out of the boat, Newton struck him on the side of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the quarrel began about?</p>
               <p>Hewett. No, I was not there. Atkinson made a stagger towards the long-boat; he recovered and then made towards the prisoner again: Newton struck him the second time upon his head, and that knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner apprehensive that the deceased was going to strike him with the bar?</p>

               <p>Newlove. Atkinson and I left the ship in Yarmouth Roads; Atkinson and I went to get some gin and wine we had on board, the rest of the ship's company had had that favour granted them. We found the prisoner in my bed; we asked him to let us take our property on shore; he seemed to growl at it; the deceased told him to turn out, he had no business there; he said to him come upon deck and drink; they went upon deck; then Newton challenged the deceased to lick him; I was not upon deck when he received the blow.</p>

I took hold of a piece of wood and swore I would knock down the first man that came nigh me: he flung himself from the captain and run up to me; I struck him over the arm; the boat is very high, it is in a bed they have made on purpose for it; there are hand-spikes lying there; he took hold of a hand-spike and had got it above his head; I struck at him immediately, and he fell with his head against the place. Newlove immediately made a blow at me: I had not power to strike; the mate came up; I cried out murder; there were two or three boats same along-side us, I suppose to take the liquor away, When Newlove found he could not get them away, he went next morning and gave an information of the liquor, and they came down from the Custom-house next morning and took away twenty-two half anchors. When Newlove had got into the boat a going from the ship, he said to the captain, d - n you, you dog, I will do for you: Newlove came back again to me, and said he would give me four guineas to let him have his liquor away.

               <p>Funter. When Mr. Burnell applied to me, I advised him otherwise; but he said he was determined he should be arrested. I believe Mr. Burnell is a very honest man. I know of no application made to Mr. Pyefinch for the payment, except what Mr. Burnell told me.</p>

            . My house was burnt down some years ago; I was to build it up again. I was to lay out a certain sum, and to employ who I pleased. I employed Mr. Holland, the builder, to take the whole trouble of the building upon himself; the agreement with him was made in writing. I saw that writing executed; (the agreement is read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Holland begin to build the house?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. He did.</p>

            ; I did not know him till some months after he was employed by Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bills for Smith's work delivered in by themselves?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. They were brought by the builder. I paid all the accounts to the builder, and not to the particular workmen. I have all the bills here (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is the date of the last receipt?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. The last receipt is for 131 l. but there is no date to it. There is a receipt dated 29 June 1767; that is the last bill. The first bill was for carcasing the house. The whole of these bills were for Smith's work. The pavement before the house was lowered, and the iron bars were lengthened: the order was given immediately to the proper Smith who had made that iron work to make an addition to it: it was given to Mr. Burnell; it was made directly; I should have left it as it was; the bills would have been brought me in, but the builder came himself, and said it was done in so bad a manner that he was ashamed of it; and said his son should draw me a fresh draught of a complete sett, and he would make Burnell take the iron work again. I was not to pay for any thing that did not please me; I had paid for the first sell that was put up, and not the present one.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that charged?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. All that I have paid for is the first sett of irons that were put up before the pavement was changed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bills delivered by Mr. Holland between your first and second iron work being put up?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I think I had not the bills in till afterwards; the building had been completed but a very little time; I don't believe the Smith's work was even done then. I did not hear that Mr. Burnell had any bill against me for at least twelve months; I believe I have that bill; I am not clear whether it is quite the same; the amount of this bill is 4 l. 18 s. 6 d. Mr. Burnell gave me this bill a little before the cause in the Sheriff's court after the arrest; the amount in the first bill was something about the same sum; I sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050036"/> the first bill back, I had nothing to do with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Burnell been allowed for these alterations by Mr. Holland?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. He will answer that, if Mr. Holland had brought me in that account, I should have paid it immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Burnell was to be paid by somebody; Did not he make more than one application for the money?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. Two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not apply ten or twelve times?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. No; nor half the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any expression you made use of at that time?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I knew Mr. Burnell then, and did not believe he could have used me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time the paviors came over against your door?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time Holland's bill came in?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. No, I paid it in June, the bill was delivered about two months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this (shewing him a drawing) is this the nature of the alteration?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I believe it was, but not quite so handsome.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Holland has charged for any more iron work than this?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I can't tell one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct Mr. Burnell?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I did give him particular directions to have the place stopped up. I can point you out four or five things in the bill that even Mr. Holland did not know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nothing said about an application being made to Mr. Holland concerning this alteration?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I don't know that there was.</p>
               <p>Council for the prosecutor. I understand you, that you was to give directions to the particular people?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I was, and I did give directions throughout the whole building.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether the agreement between Mr. Holland and you was made known to Mr. Burnell.</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I can't say; but Mr. Burnell must certainly know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know that fact?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I have no doubt of it, in my opinion.</p>

            . I was employed by Mr. Pyefinch to do all the work in his house; my son was the acting person; I stood security for him; I left it all to my son; he received and paid, and I believe Mr. Pyefinch was very well satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to do the Smith's work?</p>
               <p>Holland. Mr. Burnell was employed by my son to do part of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about this affair of Mr. Burnell's.</p>
               <p>Holland. I do, by accident. I saw the work, it was very badly done; I bid my son at his own expence take it down and put up something that was handsome, which he did; in about half a year after Mr. Burnell came to settle the account with my son and some other business, he brought in no such bill as that read; he did not make a charge of that alteration till a considerable time after, Mr. Burnell said he had called upon Mr. Pyefinch, and he would not pay it, and said he had no right to pay it. Mr. Burnell said that it was a job of his own, that he would have it made immediately, and would not consult Holland about it, for he wanted it done in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no account made by your son to Mr. Pyefinch for this alteration?</p>
               <p>Holland. He never asked it, Mr. Burnell gave credit for the old iron work; my son paid him about seven guineas, which he was out of pocket, to make a pretty thing to please Mr. Pyefinch, for the first jobb before it was altered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mr. Burnell, allowed by your son for the alteration, for if I understand right, the old rails were taken away.</p>
               <p>Holland. Mr. Burnell allowed for them, they were longer and more expensive; he was paid for these rails the last time out of my son's pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Mr. Burnell paid so by your son as to include the alteration of the rails?</p>
               <p>Holland. No, not a halfpenny, it was the alteration that Mr. Pyefinch gave himself; my son knew nothing of it for half a year: the bill for the first railing was carried in to Mr. Pyefinch, the alteration was never known to me nor my son, till all the accounts were closed; the old railing was taken down and allowed for as old iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Burnell ever been paid by your son for that?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. No.</p>
               <p>Court. It cannot be material after what has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050037"/> passed, to enquire whether Mr. Burnell can be guilty of perjury; the truth of the matter is this, the bill for this alteration was never carried into Mr. Holland; there can be no colour for a charge of perjury; Mr. Burnell should not have attended Mr. Pyefinch, it was indecent to be sure. On the other hand, this prosecution is worse, because it is a serious thing to bring an indictment for perjury; this is always the case, when people do their business with warmth and without temper.</p>

            , in Spital-fields. I was one of the members of the house of call in Spital-fields. About the beginning of December last, a circular letter was sent to the society I belong to, desiring the society to send a representative to meet the Town at the sign of the Maidenhead in Ram Alley, Fleet-street. No attention being paid to this, about the middle of December last a second was sent, containing words to the following purport:</p>
               <p>"That several journeymen taylors had assembled to work piece-work, and upon other business of importance" signed, the Town. After the letter had been read in the society, they desired me to go and meet the Town as their representative, and deputed me to act for them. I went to the Maidenhead next evening, that was Wednesday; there were about nine journeymen there; they desired to know what wages we had, they said they had 3 s. a day, and plenty of work. He called to the representative of Westminster and places adjacent to know what wages they had; they made that answer. Then he called for those that represented the city of London to give instructions; he called to me to advance; I did, and desired to know the cause of that meeting; he told me he supposed I had heard or seen the note that had been sent, about the taylors that worked piece-work in Long-acre; he then gave me instructions, which was these: that it would be a great prejudice to those journeymen that had assembled there and that the taylors of Westminster had com to a unanimous resolution not to work piece-work or over hours, and those that did it were to be excluded from the society; and they were to pay a fine of 5 s. upon reenterance; and that they should not work or be re-entered till the fine was paid: these were the instructions that I was to deliver to the society I represented. They agreed to work with no matter that work'd by the piece, nor with any that gave work for over hours; nor with those that worked over hours; and any that should act contrary thereto, were to be fined 10 s. 6 d. and I was to bring the conditions of the society, I represented, to them at their next meeting. I desired leave from them to make remarks upon their proceedings: I told them that I highly disapproved of their meetings, as it might be attended with fatal consequences. After I had represented it to the society, they all agreed to work for the wages allowed by law. We continued till the 4th of January, when we received a note, desiring as to meet at the Poulterer's Arms in Honey-lane market; it was signed The Town. The contents of it were, that the journeymen in Westminster had agreed to strike off on the 8th of January, and they wanted to know whether the other societies were willing to do the same. It was put to the vote, eleven agreed to it, and ten opposed it; they were to meet on the 7th of January in the evening, and were to strike upon the 8th. On Saturday the 6th I desired the members of the society to be together, and we agreed not to take any notice of the Town; and we agreed to work on Monday the 8th for the wages allowed by law. We continued to work without being molested till the 16th, and then about half past Six, four men came up into the shop, and went to the right hand side of the board, and required of the men to leave off work, pulling sticks from under their coats, with many imprecations, threatening revenge to those that would not directly comply. They fell upon one

            , he not knowing what they said; one of them gave him a violent blow upon the side. Then they came on the other side of the shop, where I was working, and desired me to leave off directly. It was very hard to leave off that moment, as my master had some things in a hurry; I desired we might work till one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050038"/> o'clock, and then we would strike. They said it was in vain, we must strike directly. I replied, that I would not consent to their demands be the consequence what it would. I pretended to leave off work. I got upon the board, and took an iron in one hand and a plank in the other, and defended myself. I seized one in the shop, and Mr. Clann, my master, secured another; but for want of an officer they made their escape. The next night I went to the Blue Last in Salisbury Court, and remonstrated with James-Cargill on the ill consequence of their proceedings. He replied to me, that it could not be avoided, we should comply with the Town, and then such things would not happen. He said, you have it now in your power to have 3 s. a day, and to force the masters to give it; and I request that you would persuade others, and then the scarcity of hands will make them give more wages; and I recommend it to you in general, that all men that work at under wages you do keep to the original fine.</p>

            . I am a journeyman taylor, I know the prisoners Dixon and Longland, I know the others by sight.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any general meeting of the journeymen taylors, called the Town?</p>
               <p>Evans. I have known several that have been sent as representatives to meet the Town.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect one in the Minories?</p>
               <p>Evans. There were several, but none in particular at that time; I know the society in the Minories, at which Frazer acted as Clerk; I was present at that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do?</p>
               <p>Evans. Mr. Frazer and I were shop-mates, on the 10th of January last, he told me that an order was issued out by the clerk of the committee, that all journeymen taylors should strike for 3 s. and he said that if we did not all agree to strike, we should be very ill used at night. I therefore thought myself under a necessity to comply with it; six of us did strike, I went the same afternoon to the Marshal and Anchor, where I found none that had struck for wages; about seven at night there might be I believe, about twenty or twenty-five that were determined to strike according to the order of the clerk of the committee: on the 15th, when I went into the house aforesaid, about eight o'clock, Dixon, Frazer and Longland were present; Dixon rose up, d - d my blood, and asked me where I had been that I had not attended the house to know what they should consult about for that time. I told them I had been doing a little business for my uncle; then he and Frazer seized me by the collar and bid me sign a paper they had got, in order to go and search Mr. Neale's men and Mr. Thompson's and Clann's in Spital-fields. I declared I could not agree to it nor sign it; they d - d me again, and asked me why I would not be agreeable with the rest of the men, for that many of the men had signed that paper in order to meet him at five in the morning precisely, and they were to bring sticks in their hands and stones in their pockets; part were to meet at the Angel in the Minories, and part at the Pea-hen in Bishopsgate-street, and they said d - n their journeymen's fouls, if they will not agree with the Town to raise the wages to three shillings and three halfpence per day, we will break their arms and fingers, and knock out some of their eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said this?</p>
               <p>Evans. Dixon, Longland and Frazer; they said they would break their arms and fingers, &amp;c. and then they were sure they could not turn doings; by these mean they obliged me to agree to sign that paper. I told then they might put my name down, and if I did not meet them I would pay any fine that they should fix upon me; and as the Pea-hen was a house of call, I made in my business to call there, and I found about six there that were all entire strangers to me; they asked me what house I belonged to, and asked me if I would meet them in the morning; I told them I knew nothing to the contrary; they were preparing themselves with sticks, and they wanted to know where they could get stones; one said there was enough in Moor-fields, and they could get them as they went along, and also they said they hoped that every man would have conduct enough not to call any man he knew by his right name, for it might be dangerous: before we went, after I had left that house, I took an opportunity to give an information of it to a servant of Mr.

            's, and he and I went to his master. Mr. Neale's was in bed; we went to his uncle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050039"/> and by his order we went to the constable of the night to get him to prepare men to guard the men to work in the morning. On the 16th of January, about eight at night, I went to the house of call: Dixon and Frazer were present, they both d - d my blood, and said, they had been at my apartments to enquire after me; they said I had been to give information against them, I said I had not. Dixon took up a case knife that lay on the table, and said, d - n my blood, if I was sure that you had been to give information, I would cut your throat from ear to ear before you get out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing any other of the prisoners conversant in this matter?</p>
               <p>Evans. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many houses were they to have attacked?</p>
               <p>Evans. Three, Mr. Neale's, Mr. Thompson's, and Mr. Clann's in Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. From Dixon. What time was it I offered you this violence?</p>
               <p>Evans. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. From Longland. Whether I was present at the last meeting?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Longland's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never heard any thing of the persuasion; I have nothing else to say.</p>
               <p>Dixon's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw the paper till a fortnight afterwards; there never was any animosity between us; I sold him a pair of breeches afterwards.</p>
               <p>For Dixon</p>
               <p>Samuel Carpenter. I keep the Fountain, a house of cast in the Minories; Dixon has used my house about three months; I have sent him to several masters, and I never heard any complaint; we have nothing in my house but what is regular.</p>
               <p>- Ingham. I am a baker, and live in Wells-street, near Wellclose-square. I have known Dixon about two years and a bass. he has a good character; he keeps a house there of twelve pounds a year, and is a good neighbour.</p>
