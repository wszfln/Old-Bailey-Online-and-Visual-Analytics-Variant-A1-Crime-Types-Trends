                  </hi>. On the 5th of December I was clerk to Hodgson and Burton—I am now in the service of Mr. Sandell, of Bread-street. I attended as clerk to Messrs. Hodgson and Burton on the trial of Harris and Pridmore—I recollect the defendant—I have the notes I took of the evidence given by him in Court—I only took his cross-examination—I remember his examination in chief partially—he stated in chief, that on the 15th of August he was desired by Mr. Wood to go to the plaintiff's house and tender the money; that he went to Mr. Harris's house, knocked at the door; the door was opened by Harris; there was nobody present but themselves; he said he had brought a bill, and came to pay some money to him, and pulled it out of his pocket; that he counted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into his hand, and tendered it to Mr. Harris, and Mr. Harris said it was not sufficient, and that he asked no other question—Mr. Burton cross-examined him, and I took down the substance of what he said as well as I could—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"He said he never saw the plaintiff till the day he made the tender; that it was on the 15th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and that no<lb/>body was present; he knocked at the door, and it was opened by the plaintiff; he said he had come to deliver a bill for the defendant, and to</p>

               <p>pay him some rent, and the plaintiff said it was not sufficient; the plaintiff asked no other question; he never saw Mrs. Pridmore in his life; he said he called at Mr. Collier's office when Mr. Wood desired him to make the tender—Mr. Wood is attorney for Collier—he said, I wish you to call and pay this money'—he never saw the plaintiff before"—he was desired by the learned counsel or Mr. Wood to contradict it, saying it was the clerk directed him to pay the money, not Mr. Collier's clerk—I saw Mr. Wood at the time—he was asked if he should know Mr. Harris if he saw him, and Mr. Harris was desired to stand up in Court—I am not quite sure whether it was Mr. Burton or Mr. Thomas that desired him to stand up—on his standing up, he said directly, "Yes, that is the man I tendered the money to"—he did not express any doubt of it at all—he was asked that question again, and the under Sheriff said, "He has already sworn to that fact"—I was at the Court of Queen's Bench on Friday night last, and obtained a rule absolute for a new trial of this cause.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mrs. Pridmore's brother, and am a tailor, residing in Poland-street, Oxford-street. Mr. Harris was on terms of friendship with me and Mr. Pridmore some short time ago, before my sister left, and before the action was brought—we were on visiting terms—I recol<lb/>lect his sending for me respecting my sister about the time she was going to leave—she had been ill for some time previous—I met Mr. Harris in Rathbone-place, with a friend of his—he said he wished to see me concern<lb/>ing my sister continuing in his house, as he was about to let the apartments—I said my sister would be glad to leave as soon as convenient—he said he wished me to communicate to her that she was perfectly at liberty to remain there as a weekly tenant until it was perfectly convenient for her to move, as he would be the last man in the world to take advantage of a female in the absence of her husband; he knew she was too unwell to be spoken to by him, and therefore he wished me to communicate it to her, and that all be expected was the rent to be paid up to the day she left, whether it was a fortnight, a month, or more—I was examined as a witness on the trial—I saw Mr. Harris there after the trial was over, and heard him say, "I will indict Spicer for perjury; I was at Gravesend at the time he says he called on me"—I did not hear Mr. Burton cross-examine Spicer—I was out of Court at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a tailor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps two years—I never kept a shop, and was never apprenticed to any tailor—I never learnt the business—I learnt the cutting, of a person named Folkard, a master-tailor, who lived at No. 17, Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square, at that time—I was a publican previous to that, and before that I was valet to Lord William Lenox for ten years—I have a recommendation from his lordship now—I left him expressly to enter business as a publican—I was a publican about two years—I had two houses—the first was the Queen's Head public-house, in Little Pultney-street, where I staid seven months, I believe—I gave it up because it did not answer my purpose to remain—I then went to the Three Horse Shoes public-house, in Milford-lane—I was there about sixteen months—I left because it did not answer my purpose to remain—I left Lord Lenox in 1835, in March, 1836, I went to the Queen's Head public-house, and in February, 1837, I think, I took the Three Horse Shoes—I left there, I think, in February, 1839—I suc<lb/>ceeded in business at the Queen's Head public-house—it was a very</p>

               <p>good business, but I expected to do better by taking another house, and failed in the attempt—I did not succeed at the Three Hone Shoes—I have known Mr. Wood, I think, two or three years; not longer, I think—I did not know him when I was with Lord Lenox—I became ac<lb/>quainted with him in the first instance through Pridmore's business—he was engaged for Pridmore—I believe Mr. Wood was his man of business in any business he had to transact—he managed the business for an attor<lb/>ney, I understood, as managing clerk—I understood so from himself, a year ago last July.</p>

My husband was defendant in the action of Harris against Pridmore—I lived at Mr. Harris's, in Percy-street—I was very ill for a length of time, and stopped there after the full quarter, as a weekly tenant—Mr. Harris and all my friends knew that—when I left I went to Mr. Harris's room, and of<lb/>fered him the money that was due up to the time I left, and he refused to take it—he said he would not take it—I asked the reason—he said because he would go and see what damage had been done to the rooms, and I gave him the keys, and left that same evening—Mr. Harris knew the whole of the time that I was stopping as a weekly tenant, because my husband was in the country, and of course he knew that directly he came back, and I was able, I should move—it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>husband, and I had been on visiting terms—Mr. and Mrs. Harris some<lb/>times spent an evening in our apartments—if Mr. Harris has sworn that I never offered to pay him any money it is certainly not true—I offered to pay him, and when he refused to take it, I left that same evening, Mr. Pridmore then directed his attorney to pay Mr. Harris the money—my husband is here—Mr. Collier is our attorney, and Mr. Wood—I believe they had been concerned in my husband's affairs before—he kept a public-house in Tottenham Court-road, and they settled our affairs when we left—I left Mr. Harris on the 5th of August—the quarterly rent was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I never paid a whole quarter's rent to Mr. Harris—he always received it by instalments—there was an account between us—Mr. Harris sometimes borrowed money from us.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Bishopsgate-street Without. On Saturday morning last, a little before five o'clock, I was awoke by the breaking of glass—I laid still a few minutes, and then heard a voice say, "Whose beat is it on? why did not you stop them?"—I instantly got up, and on looking through the window, I saw one or two persons on the oppo<lb/>site</p>

               <p>side looking towards my shop—I dressed myself and went down stairs—I heard the clock strike five, a few minutes after I was awoke by the breaking of the glass—I am sure it was five o'clock—when I went down I opened the shop-door, found the bar of the shutter bent very much, two shutters down, and one pane of glass broken quite out—I put the shutters up, and received information that a man was at the station-house—I went there, and found the prisoner in custody, and two dozen pairs of gloves on the table, which I can swear to being mine by the make—I have others that correspond with them now at home—they had not been made particularly for me—I came back to my shop—I found the shutters as I had left them, but I had not time before I went to the station-house to examine the window—I found it had been very much disturbed in the course of the night, and missed three dozen pairs of gloves—the shop was properly se<lb/>cured when I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, the shutters and doors also—I went back to the station-house, and saw the third dozen pairs of gloves, which corresponded with what I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning in question I saw the prisoner enter Devonshire-square, which is fifty or sixty yards from the prosecutor's shop—knowing the square was no thoroughfare at night, I hastened to the spot, and asked the prisoner what he did there—he appeared very drunk—I took him into custody, and in going to the station-house, he dropped a packet of gloves, which I took up—after we got to the station-house another packet, which was a second dozen, was brought in by a country boy not more than half a minute after we got there—I have no doubt the prisoner saw him bring it in—I do not think he heard what he said—I found a third packet of gloves about five minutes after he got to the station-house, part in the prisoner's hat, and part under the seat in the cell he was in—he was quite alone in the cell—the gloves were af<lb/>terwards shown to Mr. Bartholomew—the prisoner appeared to be drunk, but I believe it was put on, for before I got him to the counter, he appeared as sober as I do now—that was about a quarter past six o'clock, after I had got him to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isidor Levinson, a hosier and glover in the Haymarket. One Thursday afternoon, I think the 12th of December, the prisoners, Golden and Baker, came into the shop together—Baker asked me for a pair of white cotton stockings—I showed them some, after looking at him for a minute or two, as he was extremely agi<lb/>tated when I came forward to him—I took the stockings off a shelf—I had no occasion to move from where I stood, as the shelf was within reach—I opened the stockings for them to look at—I looked at the prisoner Baker, and being alone, I did not judge it prudent to accuse him at the moment—there were some handkerchiefs on the counter, and when I produced the stockings, I missed the handkerchiefs—I said, "There were some crimson silk handkerchiefs lying here not a minute before, no person has been in the shop, you must have taken them?"—on which Baker said, "We are respectable young men, we came in here to buy, not to steal, my father's name is Taylor, and I reside in Bond-street"—I asked Baker to take off his hat, which he did instantly—I found nothing there—I then asked him to turn out his pockets, which he did, and I found nothing there—I looked at Golden, and he did something with his hat which he took off, and held before his eyes—I requested him to take off his hat, which he did, and I found nothing—I then saw his left side pocket very bulky, and requested him to turn that out, and I should be satisfied, on which he said something to his companion, which I did not understand, and they instantly rushed out of the shop—my servant came in while I was talking to them, and came round the counter to me, and stood by me till the two prisoners ran away—she ran out after them—I went to the door and called "Stop thief"—I saw Baker go up Norriss-street—Golden ran towards Coventry-street with the pair of stockings naked in his hand—he had tendered me half-a-crown the instant he came into the shop—I had not sold him the stockings—they came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I told him so—he ran away, leaving the half-crown on the counter without waiting for change—I did not see them again till they were in custody at Bow-street—Sergeant Pocock brought the handkerchiefs to my shop afterwards—no<lb/>body had been in the shop after I had seen the handkerchiefs safe on the counter, and nobody had the opportunity of taking them, except one of the two prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Cutler-street, Houndsditch. I have worked for one house of business twenty-one years—I work for two wholesale houses—there is a mart held in Cutler-street, and hundreds of persons are assembled there every day—that is well known—Myers has been in the habit of attending there eight years, regularly every day, buying and selling—it is a place where every description of article is bought and sold—I saw Myers in Cutler-street on Monday, the 30th of December—he bad a black bag under his arm—he said, "Lee, I have got something in my bag that will suit you"—I said I would look at it, and he showed me two remnants of striped serge—the smaller remnant that I saw was much more faded than the large one—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the silk produced</hi>)—I cannot see at night whether this is so—yes, here it is—it is discoloured—this is the serge—it is silk serge—when we buy it we ask for that—I do not know what it is made of—it is silk and serge, not purely silk—it is mixed with a sort of worsted—I should call it silk—I declined to buy it of Myers, on ac<lb/>count of its being faded—I had previously been offered that very same article for sale in the market by another person, and as soon as Myers showed it to me I said I had seen that same silk before, and had declined to buy it on</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Woolley, Son, and Co., tailors, in the Old Jewry. The counting-house of Lord and Hall is at the back of my employers' house—at the close of the day the key is brought, and hung up in our counting-house—on the 16th of January, some time after five o'clock, I heard Churchley and Hunt go away—he had not brought the key—I heard Churchley come back, and go into Lord and Hall's counting-house again—he went in two or three times—he went to the door, then came back, wished us good night, and hung up the key in our counting-house—about five minutes after, a police-inspector knocked at our door—Mr. Plimley went to it—the policeman had White in custody, and a bag with him—he asked if we knew that man White—we said, "No"—when I opened the bag I saw the wool in it—White was detained.</p>

On the 16th of January I was going on duty, and had to pass through the Old Jewry, accompanied by Barnes—I passed White standing opposite Lord and Hall's, in the Old Jewry—he attracted my notice from his appearance, seemingly watching some place opposite—Barnes, who was with me, said something—I halted, and we watched him—in about three minutes he passed over to Lord and Hall's, and received a bag from the bands of a person—I cannot swear, from the distance, that it was Churchley, as I could not see his features, but it was at the door—I kept my eyes on White—he came down towards me on the opposite side—he increased his pace, and at last ran—I pursued and stopped him in Cateaton-street—I asked what he had got in the bag—he said it was his own property—I asked what it was—he refused to say—I asked if he knew any person at No. 9, the door he had just left—he said, "No"—I took him back to the door—the witness came to the door—I asked if he knew him, and to look at him well with the candle in his hand—he said, "No," he never saw him before—I asked him if he</p>

On Saturday evening, the 18th of January, a person named Doughty was given to me on suspi<lb/>cion of stealing bacon—he said it was not him, it was Fox—I went after Fox, and took him—he said, "It was not me, it was Doughty"—I took him to the station-house, and then he said to Doughty, "It was not you stole it; you know who it was;" and when they were before the Magistrate they said it was Leadley—I went and took the prisoner, and they both said it was him that took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Messrs. Copeland and Garratt. On the 10th of January, about four o'clock, I was in Fleet-street with their cart—my coat was in the cart, which had been stopped several times, as the street was very crowded—I was walking by the side of the horses' heads, and saw my coat safe in front of the cart—I did not see who took it, but just as I got below the Bolt-in-Tun public-house I looked round, and it was gone—I do not think it could have dropped off, as it was over a little basket of glass—the prisoner was brought back with it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Friday, the 23rd of Janu<lb/>ary, I saw the prisoner in Vauxhall-bridge-road wheeling a barrow, about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's house—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said some old iron, which he had brought from Pimlico—I let him pass on, and followed him to Rochester-row—I stopped him again, and at the bottom of the barrow I found four pieces of lead concealed under a piece of iron—he said he had been repairing a house for Mr. Harvey at Pimlico—I took him to the station-house, and went to Mr. Harvey—I then returned to the station-house, and the prisoner said he had told me a lie, that he had it from a man at Pimlico, but he would sooner suffer himself than tell me who it was—I went and found he had been at work repairing a roof for Mr. Deacon—I went on the roof of the house, and found the tiles removed, and the lead taken away—I compared the lead with the roof, and it fitted exactly with the nail-holes and other things—I went to his house, and found two more pieces, which made the quantity complete.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mrs. Way<lb/>mouth, the wife of William Way mouth, by a former husband, and live with them at No. 30, Park-street, Islington. The female prisoner came into our service on the 26th of October—on the 23rd of December, about half-past five or a quarter to six o'clock in the evening, I had occasion to go from the upper part of the house to the store-closet in the basement to give out some articles—on passing down stairs I observed that the parlour and street doors were both shut—I was followed down stairs by Toye, who had a candle in her hand—she was in the habit of lighting the passage-lamp every evening at half-past five o'clock—she had not lit it that night—I remained below two or three seconds, and returned up stairs immedi<lb/>ately after—I then found the street-door wide open, and the parlour-door open, with a chair against it—a neighbour came across, and went for a policeman—we examined the premises immediately after, and missed the property stated—the cloaks had hung up in the hall; the writing-desk was on the parlour table; the tea-spoons had been placed in the tea-cups on the parlour table; the umbrellas were in the umbrella-stand in the hall; the table-cover was on the table; and the coats were folded up behind the front-parlour door, in a chair—it was Toye's duty to set the tea-things</p>

               <p>a little before six o'clock—they were set rather earlier than usual that evening—she had no directions to do that—when the discovery was made Toye inquired whether there was any money in the desk—she did not ap<lb/>pear particularly anxious about it—no suspicion attached to her then—we heard nothing more until the 6th of January, when Toye asked leave of absence for the afternoon, and said she should return about nine o'clock in the evening—she had permission to go, and did not return all night—on the following afternoon, between one and two o'clock, a boy with oranges came to ask for the keys of her boxes—I made inquiry of him—he told me from whom he came, and pointed out the male prisoner to me in the street—he was standing nearly opposite the house—one key was given to the boy by the other servant, but the boxes remained—between five and six o'clock that evening the prisoner Heaphy came himself to the house—I immediately knew him to be the person I had seen in the morning—I had seen him several times before at the house, talking to Toye—he took away Toye's boxes that night—I do not know what took place—my mamma was exceedingly ill at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and live in this house. On the 23rd of December I left my great coat, among other things, in the par<lb/>lour—I had been out the whole day—I returned about seven o'clock, and was informed what had happened—Toye asked me whether there was any money in my desk—I afterwards saw one of my coats at the office—I was not at home on the 6th of January when Toye went out—she did not return—on the 7th, about five o'clock, Heaphy came and said he had come from Elizabeth Toye, to say she was very unwell, and was sorry she could not return, but hoped to do so in two or three days, if her mistress liked her to return—(in consequence of suspicion I had procured a policeman to attend at my house—I (opened the door to Heaphy myself, expecting him to come that evening)—I asked him if he knew Elizabeth Toye—he said yes, he had known her some time—I said, "Are you any relative?"—he said, "Well, I have a very great affection for Elizabeth; and, to be candid with you, we have been some time living as man and wife "—this was in the hall—the officer was at this time in the kitchen—I then asked him to go below with me into the kitchen, and I questioned him more parti<lb/>cularly as to where Toye was, and got from him that she was waiting in the street—he said so to Mr. Redpath, a solicitor, who was in the house at the time—I sent for Toye, to where Heaphy said she was, and Mr. Red<lb/>path brought her back—her boxes were searched, by her consent—Heaphy manifested great willingness to have them searched before she came in, but I thought it right she should be present—I asked Heaphy where Toye was on the night she left—he said the reason was they had been to Drury-lane, and had a little too much to drink, having been at a raffle, and she could not return—she was present—they were afterwards allowed</p>

On Wednesday, the 8th of January, a little after six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner Heaphy came to my house with another man—I cannot say whether it was Connor—I saw them go past the bar up stairs to the first-floor—I do not remember seeing Toye—I did not see any body else go up stairs—I saw one of the party go out at the door afterwards—I just saw his back in going out—I heard him come down stairs, and there was another came down at the same time—my boy came, and gave me information, and I went up to the first-floor front room three or four minutes after I had seen the man go away—I missed from that room a decanter and four salts, and from the adjoining room nine ivory balls, which have been used for bagatelle, but not since I have been there.</p>

I was before the Magistrate, who said; "I forbid you to make application to any gentleman's service"—I said, "What am I to do, sir, to live honestly?"

                  </hi>. I live in Harris's-court, Ratcliffe, the prisoner lives next door to me. On the 31st of December, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I came in, and as I went in, I heard the prisoner at my door abusing me very much—I made him no answer—I think he was very much intoxi<lb/>cated, from what I could learn—I went out and came in again at half-past twelve o'clock—I asked my wife if he was in bed—she said she believed he was, but I heard him say, "I am not in bed, you Scotch b——, I will be the death of you this night"—I said, "Go to bed, and I will answer you in, the morning, I never did you any harm in my life"—he said, "So I will, old man, I will go to bed," and he wished me good night—about five minutes after, he came and rapped at my shutters, and said, "Come out here, I want you"—I said, "Just let me alone, I am not well"—he said, I want to speak to you"—I went out, and he stood at his own door—I went up to his door—he caught hold of me round the neck, and struck me on the head with a hammer—the first blow almost knocked me senseless—the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> flew from my eyes, and I thought they were knocked out of my head—the first blow was struck just at the top of my head—I said to him, "Craven, what do you mean by this? I thought you would have been the last man to use me in this form; do you mean to murder me?"—he said, "Yes, you Scotch b——, I mean to murder you"—he took me, and was dragging me into his own house, beating me on the head repeatedly with the hammer—his daughter said to him, 'Father, don't pull him in here, see his blood is lying on the threshold of the door"—he made a tremendous blow at me, which I kept off with my hand, or it would have killed me—he then handed the hammer over his</p>

               <p>shoulder to his daughter, and she concealed it—the policeman came directly after, and took him into custody, and I went home to my own house as well as I could—I received between eight and nine cuts on the head from him—it was a two-clawed hammer, about a pound and a half weight—I have had the hammer in my hand many times—he struck me with both parts of it—where he struck with the claw part, it made two wounds, and the other part made only one—I went to the hospital imme<lb/>diately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's daughter, and live with him. I was in bed when the prisoner called my father to the door—I heard my father go to the door—I instantly ran down stairs in my night-dress—before I could get down he had got to the door, and the door was opened—my father was on the threshold of the door then, just going out, when I got to the door the prisoner had got one arm round my father's neck, and with the other arm he was striking blows on his head with the hammer—he said, "You Scotch b—, I will do for you now"—he was still striking blows on my father's head with the hammer—I screamed out, "Murder"—my father said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi>, it is murder you mean, is it?—the prisoner said, "Yes, I will do for you this night"—he was trying to drag my father into his own house, and his daughter said, "Oh, father, don't drag him into your own house, for see at the blood on the threshold of the door now"—the policeman then came up and took the prisoner away, and my mother and I led my father in-doors.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pupil at the London Hospital. The prosecutor was brought there about two or three o'clock in the morning—his wounds were dressed when he came, and I did not undo the dressings till the next morning—he slept in the hospital that night—I found eight or nine wounds on the head and forehead—they were such as might have been made by the claw-end of a hammer—I did not probe them—I cannot tell whether the skull was fractured—no portion of the bone was displaced, that I am aware of, but it might have been—I should say the wounds were not very severe—they were dangerous—I apprehended erysipelas from them—he had erysipelas subsequently—I attribute that partly to the wounds, but I think exposure to the cold air at the police-office might hare had something to do with it—at one time his life was in danger—I cannot say whether the wounds went to the bone, not having been the first person to dress them.</p>

               <p>received directions to be in their store-room in the evening, in consequence of having made a report of some being lost—the prisoner was in their employ, and had been so nearly three years, as a private watchman—there are two store-rooms—one of them has three doors, one of which leads into the counting-house, but it was locked—when we went into the store-room the foreman locked us in, and put the key where it was usually put, in a drawer in the counting-house—this was about seven o'clock in the evening—about half-past eight o'clock I heard some one unlock the door, and the prisoner came in at the door which led to the lobby of the small store-room, with a lantern in his hand with a lighted lamp in it—he went direct to the place where the copper was deposited, and took one piece, as I ascertained afterwards—he returned in the same direction, locked the first and second doors, and went out—I got out of the place where I was concealed, and opened another door which has no lock on, went out, and detected him a few yards from the last door—Chivers came up while I had hold of him—he had this piece of copper with him, which is 15 1/2lbs., and it worth about 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—I collared him, and said, "I want you, old fellow; I am very sorry I have been obliged to watch to detect you"—he did not know who I was—he was in a kind of stupor, but afterwards he asked who I was, and begged me to say nothing about it—Chivers came up, and took the copper from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the King's Head tavern, in the Old Jewry. On Sunday evening, the 26th of January, I was in Hackney-road, about half-past eleven o'clock—the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to go with her—I went to Caroline-street, Hackney-road, to a lower room—I sat and talked with her—I had 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my right-hand breeches-pocket, and among it was a half-crown—I know it was secure when I went into the house—she sat on my right-hand side—I was sober—(I had been at home till the evening, and then went out for a walk to the Eagle)—I gave her a shilling before I went into the house, but I did not like the situation I was in, and got up to go away—I had taken no liberties with her at all—when I got to the door of the room I missed my money, and told her she had got it—she denied it—I told her she had robbed me of my money—she said she had not—the policeman was pass<lb/>ing, and heard us—he took her—she said she had not got the money, nor had she taken it—the policeman found a half-crown and three shillings in the grate, which, I believe was part of what I had lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I was lately an officer in the army, but have retired, and live at Sandhurst. On Tuesday, the 2nd of January, I was leav<lb/>ing London, by the Black water coach on the Western road—I was an inside passenger, and this property was in a portmanteau, which I saw safely put on the coach in Charles-street, and strapped down under, a tarpaulin—I had no doubt of its security—I missed the portmanteau on arriving at Blackwater, which is thirty miles from town—but taking it for granted that it had been taken off to shift the luggage at Piccadilly, I supposed it had been left there, and told the coachman to inquire about it—on the Saturday morning when he came to Staines, he made a discovery, and I went and identified my portmanteau—I have found but a small portion of my property.</p>

On the 21st of January, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was in the Almonry, Westminster—the prisoner Stirrup, came up to me, and wrested my stick from my hand—he then commenced beating me—the prisoner Smith assisted him—they beat me with their fists, one before me, and one behind—I was making away as fast as I was able—I never saw them before—by the violent blows I received from them I fell on the ground on my hands—Smith took my hat and stick, and ran off with them—I called the police—a policeman came up the street, and took Smith—I did not see him taken, but I found him in custody shortly after<lb/>wards—I also lost a handkerchief and glove.</p>

This watch was pawned on Saturday night last, between eight and nine o'clock, by Carter—after she gave it me Wilson came in—I asked Carter where she got the watch from—she told me it was all right—he wanted 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, and I advanced it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Carter's Defence</hi>. I was in the Red Lion public-house—the prosecutor gave me a glass of gin, and asked where I lived, I said in Red Lion-court;—he went with me; his jacket and hat were all wet, and I dried them; he asked me to pull his shoes off. I asked him what he was going to give me; he asked if T would trust him, I said, "No;" he said he had no money, but he would give me his watch, and he pulled it out—I took it to Mr. France's, and got 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Cosmorama, in Re<lb/>gent-street, and live in Alfred-place, Bedford-square. On the 25th of September, 1889, I saw this advertisement in the "Morning Herald"—(reads)—"Situation of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, besides rent, coals, and candles, may be obtained by any respectable man who can write a good hand, keep accounts, and refer to two respectable housekeepers as to honesty and sober habits. None need apply who cannot command 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Address, post paid, to Mr. James Barlow, 23, Alfred-street, Bedford-square, with right name and address."—In consequence of that advertisement I went to the address referred to on the same day—I found the name of Barlow on the door—I was introduced to the prisoner Shelford as the advertiser—he was in the first-floor front-room, alone, and I went alone—(there were four or five persons waiting in the passage)—he had several papers and letters before him—I told him that I called respecting the situation—he asked me how I knew of it—I told him I had seen it in the paper that morn<lb/>ing—he asked which paper—I told him in the "Morning Herald"—he asked what was my situation in life—I told him that I was a clerk in the service of a gentleman in Regent-street—he said, "Well, you know the particulars of the advertisement; are you prepared with a sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I told him I could be—he said, "The situation is on a rail-road;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184002030129"/>
               <p>have you any objection to leave London?"—I told him that I had not—he said, "In this stage of the proceeding I shall not say at which rail-road, but it is one of the best in the country, and you may guess which"—he said, "Now, don't deceive yourself and me; have you the sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at your command, or shall you have to go from friend to friend to raise it? that will not do; you are aware that in these cases the utmost secrecy is requisite; you ought not even to tell your own wife; a man may be a friend to-day and your enemy to-morrow"—I told him that I could be prepared with 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a given time, if I was satisfied that he could obtain me the situation—he said that he had the influence of a director, whose turn it was to nominate to an appointment, and the person that he recommended would have the situation—he said, "If I select you, the transaction will be between you and me"—he said that I should have to receive the money paid by the passengers, and to forward it to London—he said he had several applications for the situation, and if he selected me, I should hear from him on the following Saturday—I then left the house—he was dressed in a black frock coat, a double-breasted waistcoat, black trowsers, a black curly wig, no whiskers, and a white cravat—I saw him again on the following Saturday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, at my own house—he called on me—he was dressed as before—he said, "I am happy, sir, to say I have obtained the appointment for you, and in fact, I should have had the appointment made out for you, but you forgot to give me your Christian names in full, and also the name of the parish you reside in"—I wrote down those particulars, and gave them to him—he then asked me if I was prepared with the money—I told him that I had it in the house, but I expected, before I paid it to him, that he would introduce me to the secretary or the board of directors—he said, "Sir, if you have any doubt of me, matters are at an end between us, and I can fill up the situation not a hundred yards from this house; you are not aware how these matters are managed; if a man obtains a situation under government, he does not see the party who introduces him to it; and the same in the India House, except that there a man is sworn to the performance of certain duties"—he said, "What more satisfaction can you have? I will give you a printed document, headed by the name of the rail-road, and under Act of Parliament; it will be filled up with your name, and the particulars of the situation, signed by four directors, and countersigned by an eminent banker; I don't want to touch a farthing of your money till I give you the appointment"—he was to bring it to me on the following Monday, which he did, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—my wife was then in the room—he said, "I am happy, sir, to say that I have your appointment, are you prepared with the money?"—I said I was, and be gave the appointment into my hands—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said it was on the Birmingham railway—after I had read it I said, "It seems all right, I will go and get you the money"—I left the room, and returned with a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I opened the note, and said, "Here is a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note," and gave it into his bands—he then said, "Your station will be at Birmingham—there will be another clerk with you—your regular duty will be six hours a day each, but by one doing duty for the other, you may be absent at any time"—he then asked me when I should be prepared to commence duty—I told him that day week, the following Monday—he said he would meet me on the following morning at the Euston-square station, that he would introduce me to the secretary,</p>

               <p>and go with me to my station at Birmingham—my wife asked if the might accompany us—he said, yes, it was an understood thing that the ser<lb/>vants of the Company could travel on the rail-road free of expense—he then left with my 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and left me this paper—(<hi rend="italic">Thomas Phillips, a clerk in the Bank of England, here produced a</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">note</hi>)—that is the note I gave the prisoner—I parted with it in consequence of bis giving me that ap<lb/>point ment to the situation—I believed that it was a genuine one, and believed his representations to be true—I went the same day to the Eus<lb/>ton-square station, and made inquiries—I saw the chief clerk—I also went the following day, but did not see Shelford—I had no idea of meeting him, from what I had learnt there—I did not see him again till the 6th of De<lb/>cember, when I gave him into custody, in Holborn—his hair was then something the same as it is now—he had no wig on, and he wore whiskers—he was taken before the Magistrate, and remanded, several times—I gave notice to the Bank respecting the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note the same day that I paid it, and on Friday, the 4th of October, I received a communication from the Bank, which led me to the house of Holland, a cheesemonger, in Drury-lane—I made inquiries of him, in consequence of which I went with Shaw and Thornton, the officers, to the house of the prisoner Rickaby, on Satur<lb/>day, the 5th of October, at No. 1, Bridgehouse-place, Newington-causeway—it is a broker's shop—the name of Rickards was on the side of the house—we found Rickaby there, and asked him how he became possessed of a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that he had changed at Mr. Holland's, in Drury-lane—he said that he was standing at his door last Monday afternoon, about three o'clock, (that would be Monday, the 80th of September, the day on which I parted with the note;) that a tall thin man came up to him, who was a stranger to him, and asked him if he could give him change for a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Rickaby said that he told him he could not; that the man then said to Rickaby, "You know Mr. Gullen, do you not? he owes you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., does he not?" he said he did; the man said, "Well, I have called to pay those 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you will give me change for a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—Rickaby said that he took the note from the man's hands, examined it, looked at the water-mark, and thought it was a good one—he then asked us if it was a forgery—we gave him no answer—we asked him again to describe the man, and he said it was a stout man, with a pale face, black hair, and no whiskers—he repeated two or three times the fact of his having no whiskers—we then asked him how he was dressed—he said he had a black frock-coat, a double-breasted waistcoat, black trowsers, and, he thought, a black cravat—we asked him if he went to any of his neighbours to try to get the change—he said he did not; that he told the man he would go to the Bank to get it changed; that the man objected to that, and said he was going westward; he told the man he was going that way also, and he would get him the change—he said the man went with him to Waterloo-bridge, and that he (Rickaby) went to Hol<lb/>land's, in Drury-lane, to purchase some goods, and got change there—we asked him if he then came back to Waterloo-bridge to give the man the change—he said he did not, because the man went with him to Holland's, and he gave him the change in the street—we asked him how he gave him the change, if in gold or notes—he said, in gold and notes—we asked him if he knew the numbers of the notes—he said he did not—we asked him if there were any fives or tens, or was one of them a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said, "I gave him twenty-eight sovereigns and a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—we asked him if he knew the number of that note—he said he did not—we asked him if he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184002030131"/>
               <p>knew Mr. Gullen well—he said, "Very well—we asked what he was—he said that he was a solicitor; that he was living at Sunbury; that he had had several transactions with him in the way of business—we asked him what the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing for—he said, for business done for Mr. Gullen—we asked him for what specific business, and he said, "For a valuation"—we asked him when the valuation was made—he said, about eight months back—we asked him if he had given the strange man any acknowledg<lb/>ment for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had paid on account of Mr. Gullen—he said he had not—we asked him what day it was that he changed the note, if he was positive it was on the Monday, and He said he was—we asked him what goods he had purchased at Holland's—he said he could not say exactly, but they were articles in cheesemongery—we asked him if he could not name any particular article—he said be could not—we asked if he could say to what amount the goods were—he said he could not—we asked him again if he knew Mr. Gullen well—he said, "Very well," that he was living at Sunbury—I asked him, "Do you say Sunbury or Sudbury?"—he said, "Sunbury, in Middlesex"—I took out my pencil, he spelt the name and address letter by letter, and I took it down, and also wrote his name under it—we asked what address the man had given with the note—he said, "John Brown, No. 22, Grafton-street"—he asked us if we did not see that address on the note—we told him we did—we then left the house, but without losing sight of the shop-front where we had been talking—we went about two or three hundred yards from the house, and from something which occurred to us we went back again—Rickaby was not then at home—there is a side-door to his house which leads into an adjoining street, and he might have gone out that way—on finding he was not there, we went to the nearest coo-stand, took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went at a good pace to Holland's, in Drury-lane, where we found Rickaby, in conversation with Holland—Rickaby said that Holland was his brother-in-law—we asked Holland, in Rickaby's presence, how he gave the change to Rickaby—he said, "In gold and notes"—Rickaby said, "You gave me twenty-eight sovereigns and a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, did you not, Mr. Holland?"—Holland said, "Yes, I did"—we then asked Rickaby what goods he had purchased at Mr. Holland's when he got the change—he said "Half a side of bacon, a Dutch cheese, six pounds of butter, and some eggs; did I not, Mr. Holland?" and Holland said, "You did"—Rickaby then left the shop, and we followed him to an adjoining street—we then entered into conversation again, and Rickaby said, "I do not know who you are, gents., or on what authority you are asking me these questions" Thornton then told him that he was a constable, showed him his staff, and explained to him that 1 bad been defrauded of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that that was the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that had been traced to him—he said, "Now that I know there is something wrong, if I can meet with the man I will give him into custody, so help me G—d!"—he then asked Thornton for his address, which be gave him—we hen went to a public-house, and had something to drink, which I paid for—we again asked him if he knew Mr. Gullen well, and Shaw wrote down Gullen's name and address from his spelling—we then parted from him—I saw Rickaby two or three times afterwards, previous to the 6th of December last, but nothing passed between us.</p>

               <p>the advertisement in—Shelford was respectably dressed when I saw him in Alfred-street—I am sure he had no whiskers—he had a large black wig—I am sure it did not hide his whiskers—I am quite sure he bad none—the first time I saw him was on Wednesday, the 25th, between eleven and twelve o'clock, in Alfred-street—the second was on the following Saturday about the same time at my house, and the third on Monday at my house, between nine and ten o'clock—he stopped about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes on the second and third occasions—I did not see him on the Sunday—my wife was present on the Monday—she is in Court now—on the last occasion I asked the prisoner his name—he said, "Mr. Barlow"—he did not give me a Christian name—I said to him, "Your name is Barlow," and he said, "It is"—our first interview lasted about twenty minutes—it was somewhere about that time on all three occasions—those were the only times I ever saw him until he was taken into custody—every time I saw him he had the same sort of wig, the same absence of whis<lb/>kers, and the same dress—he seemed in good health and spoke very well, not at all as if affected by any complaint that I heard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at the Green Man public-house, Blackheath, in the parish of Lewisham, which is kept by Thomas Henry Whitmarsh. On Thursday afternoon, the 9th of January, I was in the laundry, which is in the garden—I cannot get to it from the dwelling-house without going into the open air—it is partly under the ball-room—after pass<lb/>ing the great entrance of the house, there is a paling, which goes entirely round the premises, enclosing the whole building, till you come to Dartmouth-road and round to the great entrance again—the laundry-door opens into a small yard and you go out of that yard into the garden—a man could get over the paling I should think—the yard is in the garden, only separated by a gate—the fence goes all round the garden—my master's and mistress's linen, and some shirts, and waistcoats, and a bag, belonging to Mr. Thomas Whitmarsh, who is the father of Thomas Henry Whitmarsh, was in the laundry that afternoon—it was there to air—the policeman has since produced a bundle to me containing these articles—tome were marked in full, and some in initials—I left the laundry between four and five o'clock.</p>

My father's name is Thomas—he does not reside with me, and is not a partner at all—it is in the parish of Lewisham—the laundry is under the ball-room and is part of the building—there is no access to it but going through the garden and yard—the laundry-door opens into a small yard close to the scullery—this yard is enclosed, and the garden is enclosed by pales six or seven feet high.</p>

                  </hi>. I am laundry-maid at the Green Man public-house. On Thursday afternoon, the 9th of January, I was in the laundry till half-past six o'clock—there is a window to the laundry—one of the</p>

               <p>panes of glass was broken—I secured the window when I left it by a hasp which kept it close—the hasp is about half-way up the window—it is only one sash—it opens inward on a catch with a hasp—the broken pane was not in the sash, but just under the hasp—it is a large window, which goes nearly all round the laundry, but the part which opens is about four panes—I saw the window next morning, Friday—the broken pane was not broken more than before—the opening on Thursday was large enough to admit the hand of a man who could then reach the hasp and open the window—a part of the window had been mended with wood—I found that broken much more in the morning—it is part of the frame-work; where it opens was broken, it had been repaired, and next morning it was found broken much worse—a piece of wood had been placed there instead of glass—one of the panes in the sash which opened was wood, and the other three were glass—the wooden pane had been broken partly out close by the hasp—the sash could be opened by putting a hand through the pane which was broken underneath—I do not think he could do it by putting his hand through the broken wood—the window could not be opened from outside without lifting the hasp.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>morning, the 10th of January, in the neighbourhood of Dartmouth-terrace, which is in the road coming from the Green Man public-house, about half-past two o'clock in the morning—I met the two prisoners, just at the top of Dartmouth-terrace, about seven hundred yards from the Green Man public-house—Perry was carrying a bundle on his back—I heard something, turned my lantern on, and could see them quite plain, twenty or thirty yards from me—when I saw the bundle I said, "Halloo, my lads, what are you loaded with?"—Anthony answered me, <hi rend="italic">"Kit"</hi> that is all—I then passed down to the foot of the hill, they on one side of the road, and I the other—I then crossed over, went up to them, and told Anthony I must see what the <hi rend="italic">kit</hi> was, and asked him what it was, he said, some things—I asked what things—he said, "A shirt or two, some stockings, and other things;" that he was going to work at Norwood—I took hold of the bundle Perry had on his back, and said, "I must look what these shirts are before you pass me, as it is a very un<lb/>seasonable time at night"—when I took hold of the bundle he pulled himself on one side, and said, "What, do you think we stole it?"—I said, I did not know, but I must see what he had got, or I should take them to the station-house—I drew my staff, and took Perry—he said, if I took him to the station-house, I should take the bundle myself, and carry it to the sta<lb/>tion-house—he gave it into my hand—as soon as I got hold of it they tried to escape from me—they spoke together as they crossed the road with me, as I was taking the bundle, but I could not hear what they said—they tried to run away—I caught hold of Perry, and he and I fell into a ditch by the side of the road—I got up again, and caught hold of Burt, and we tustled together on the road—Perry assisted him, and I had a tustle on the road with them both—I struck Anthony with my staff, and knocked his hat in—it fell off on the footpath—he ran and picked it up, ran along, and I pur<lb/>sued him to a chalk-pit—Perry had escaped—I pursued Anthony two or three hundred yards—he got away, and ran into a field—I pursued him, and I fell into a chalk-pit, seven or eight feet deep—I do not know what be<lb/>came of his hat—as far as I know, he took it away with him—I never saw it afterwards—he got away—I afterwards returned to the spot where I had thrown the bundle down on their attempting to escape—I found it lying on the road where I had left it—I had sprang my rattle, but got no assistance for some time—I took the bundle on my back, and crossed over Blackheath-road, to go to the station-house—I then heard somebody coming down the hill, I threw the bundle down on the road, and walked up the hill, in the direction of the footsteps I heard, and a few yards further I met Perry—I said nothing to him, but jumped in upon him, collared him by his handker-chief, and said, "I want you"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "On suspi<lb/>cion of stealing the bundle you had just now"—He said, "You have not got me yet"—we tustled, and I threw him in the gutter, and, by the assist<lb/>ance of two men who were going to work, I secured him—having sprung my rattle two constables came to my assistance—I took him to the station-house, found a key, a buckle, a piece of pencil, and a staple or small hasp, on him—I am certain he is the man who was carrying the bundle when I first stopped the two men—I saw Burt at the station-house afterwards, about five o'clock—he gave his name as Thomas Anthony at the station-house—he went by that name until Cockett, the porter, was produced—he then said his name was Burt, but Thomas Anthony Burt was his name, he was called Thomas Burt, for shortness—I had bent his hat right in with my staff, and broke the crown in.</p>

On Friday morning, the 10th of January, between two and three o'clock, I met Anthony on the Blackheath road, about a quarter of a mile from the Green Man, and half a mile from Dartmouth-terrace—he was without a hat, and had a handkerchief tied round his head—I stopped him, and observed he seemed rather confused as I passed him—I said, "Halloo, master, what is the matter?"—he said, "I have been to the Ordnance Arms with some friends, spending the evening—we got quarrelling, and from that got fighting—I lost my hat in the scuffle, and was very glad to escape without it"—I had heard nothing of the robbery then, and let him go by—I heard a rattle spring soon after<lb/>wards, as I went towards Blackheath-hill—I ran to where the sound came from, and found a bundle lying in the road—I took it up, and saw Sole holding Perry by the collar, taking him to the station-house—he was thirty or forty yards from the bundle—I produce the bundle—I did not know Burt before.</p>

The only evidence affecting me is that of Mr. Churchill, who swears he possesses a perfect knowledge of my writing, from having received letters from me; the date of the last letter is the 9th of May; I would ask whether a person's handwriting would not undergo some considerable change in that space, and how could a person, looking at that, say it was the offspring of my pen? He said before the Magistrate, that such was the fallibility of human evidence on hand-writing, that he would not be able to swear to his own writing two hours after he had written it. He admits it is like my writing, and not an attempt to imitate his. I leave it in your hands to say whether a charge of forgery is established.</p>

               <p>—there was nobody left in the house but me—I fastened the door after him, and barred it—about a quarter of an hour after he was gone some man came to the window, and asked me to let him in to have some beer—he swore, if I did not let them in, he would break the window—I let him in—he took the candle away from me, and went to the till where the half-pence were, laid hold of a handful of halfpence, took four pence, and pitched the rest back—he took hold of me, and <hi rend="italic">ruffled</hi> me about, while the two pri<lb/>soners got in—I had seen them in the house before several days, and am sure they are the boys—I had seen them there that afternoon and evening, and several times—I did not hear either of them say any thing to the prosecutor before he went away—I do not know the name of the man that came in—when the prisoners came in the man had half a quartern of gin, and wanted me to give <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> (Fleming) a glass of gin to keep him warm—I refused—he told me <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> had to be out all night—I then went to bed, but two po<lb/>licemen came first—the prisoners were gone then—I saw them go out before the policemen came—I fastened the house up again, and went to bed—it was about a quarter to twelve o'clock then—I did not see the two prisoners go out—I saw the man go out, but not the prisoners—I do not know whether or not they went out before I went to bed—I did not search round the house to see if all the company were gone—I was disturbed about four o'clock in the morning by a noise as if a cinder was trod upon in the tap-room—I slept in a little room behind the bar—I had not noticed Baster's clothes there before I went to bed—I got up, and went to look who it was, and the two prisoners ran out—there was a gas-light burning in the tap-room, and a little light in the bar—Baster always leaves the gas burning to get a light in the morning—I am quite sure it was the two prisoners—there was plenty of light from the gas to see them—I saw Mucklestone run out with his hands before him, as if holding something, and Fleming opened the street-door while he went out—I cannot say whether Mucklestone had any thing in his hands, but they were held out—I saw both their faces—after they ran out I saw a man standing against the river looking at the tide, and that man went and called a policeman, and one came and stopped till half-past six o'clock—the two prisoners then came to the door—I told the policeman they were the two prisoners, and he took them—the property had not been found then—I found the two aprons in the tap-room, and the nightcap in the passage leading from the tap-room to the street-door, about half-past seven o'clock, after they were taken—when I went into the tap-room at four o'clock I found a fire there, and the gas-light burning—there is only one gas-light in the tap-room, and the one in the bar was lighted—when I went to bed the fire and gas-lights were out—I went to the station-house about eight o'clock, I think, but did not see the prisoners there—I never had any conversation with Fleming about the goods—I am sure of that—I was examined before the Magistrate the same day—Fleming said to me, "If you don't say much, I will get you the things back, because I am sure to be transported"—that was on Saturday, when I was waiting to go before the Magistrate, as I was sitting in the box where the people wait till they are called—we were both sitting together—I was alongside of them—it was before I was examined—I had not seen the aprons and nightcap dropped by any body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live in Little Suffolk-street with my grandmother. The prisoner Richardson lodged at my grandmother's at the time in question, but not Manning—he came there with Richardson when the stolen property was brought to our place, and I had seen him about the street two or three times before. On Saturday, the 11th of January, I went with my grandmother after some money, and when I came home to the corner of the street, the prisoners and a boy named Robert Wheeler ran by me—Richardson had a bundle on his head—they were running towards our place, and ran in-doors—the bundle was very large, wrapped up in a kind of apron—I was standing still, and they ran close by me—it *was between seven and eight o'clock—I went in-doors, asked for a light directly, and went up stairs to Richard<lb/>son's room, in consequence of what a woman said, and found him there—I asked him for the light—he would not let me have it till he had done with it—Manning and Wheeler were in the room with him—Richardson put his foot against the door, but I forced my way in—there was a light there—I saw a number of clean things in the room, a shirt, shift, and half a coloured handkerchief, and a number of towels and aprons—the thing they had been wrapped in seemed to be a coloured apron—I said, "Halloo, Richardson, how did you come by them?"—he said they were his sister's—I took the light from him directly—the things were on the floor—Richardson held up the towels and said, "Them towels are of no use to us; they will only <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> us from selling them"—nothing more passed—I went down with the light, and they came just after me—I was not in the room again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker. The prisoner lodged with me for nearly twelve months, at No. 8, Queen-street, Mint, in the Borough. On the 28th of December, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I went up stairs to a room on the third floor, for a bed, which I had lent to two young women five or six weeks before, as they had none to lie on—they were no relations of the prisoner, nor did they live with him—he lodged in the same room With me on the first floor—when I went up I found the door shut—I knocked at it, and was answered by the prisoner, and he said, "I will get the bed immediately"—in five or six minutes be opened the door, and said, "Here is your b——bed"—the bed was then rolled down stairs, and he held a light in his hand, and said, "Come, you can come in and see if she is here"—I went in and told him it made no matter to me where she was, but he should be ashamed to commit such nastiness in a house where so many people lived—(I had been told that he and the young woman Mary Hurley had been in bed together that night, which made me go up for the bed)—there was no woman in the room then—there was a candle in the room, and a fire too—the prisoner had the candle in his hand—he said, "There are so and so bad in the house," alluding to other lodgers—I came down to my own room—I went up again in a minute or two afterwards, and when I got very near the door the prisoner threw the candlestick from his hand into the room—he was inside the room—I observed the light</p>

               <p>down on the floor at the time—I did not observe how he came there—he fell right in the moment he entered the room, and the prisoner fell on the top of him—I did not hear a word spoken—Fitzgerald lifted Mahoney up, and was carrying him down stairs, and then I saw the prisoner take and kick him either about the shoulders or head, I cannot say which—it was a kick with his foot, not a blow—after the prosecutor was brought down I went up again with a light, and saw blood on the floor in two or three places, but it had been wiped up—I could see the places where it had been—there were two big places—Mahoney was in a dreadful state when he was brought down—I thought his bowels were in his small clothes—he was very in<lb/>sensible—we could make nothing of him—he was taken to the hospital in about half-an-hour—he got his senses a little before he went, but not much, I think—I cannot say whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand at the time he hit him—I did not see any instrument till I saw a piece of a knife produced next morning, which was found by the police in the next garret.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. White, Greenwood, and Co., linen-drapers, in Black friars-road. On the 10th of January both the prisoners came in, about four o'clock in the afternoon—they sat down, and one of them, I cannot say which, asked to look at some white jean—I cut off two yards from one piece—one of them asked to look at some ribbon—I produced several boxes, five different lengths were cut off, and they were put together—I think I produced three boxes to them, and in one of them was a particular piece of rose-coloured ribbon, which I recommended to them—it was the only one of that sort we had—when I had cut off the other ribbon I went to take up that ribbon to show to them again, and missed it—it had been in the third box which I showed them—amongst the five pieces which they had bought then some of them were ribbons for strings—one of them, I cannot say which, asked for edging—I left the spot where I was for the purpose of getting it, and as I returned with the box they were sit<lb/>ting side by side, and I observed Williams give something to Blundell—I took no notice, but produced the box of edging—it would not suit, one of them asked to look at some better; and one of them, I think it was Blundell, asked me to leave that box there—I said I was subject to a fine</p>

I was called into the counting-house on the 10th of January—I went in with Mr. Hubbard, the two prisoners, and Mr. Miles—Mr. Hubbard accused them of stealing some goods—they said they were innocent, and at the time Williams dropped three cards of lace I saw them on the floor—after the lace was found on the floor, Miles accused Blunden of having a piece of ribbon—she said she was innocent—she moved a little aside, and I saw the piece of ribbon under the place where she was—I am sure that when I went in the ribbon was not there—I did not mark it, but I saw it marked—this is the piece, and these are the three cards of lace—(<hi rend="italic">examin<lb/>ing them</hi>)—the prisoners said they would pay the amount, be it what it would, as they had sufficient money in their pockets—they begged to be forgiven, and wished to go home—Blundell said she was a respectable married woman, and begged to be let go home to her family—they said they were not aware how the goods came into their possession—Mr. Miles was part of the time in the counting-house, and part out—I think he was not in at the time I saw the cards of lace.</p>

The prisoner was employed there—on the evening of the 21st of January he was on the premises—my master stopped him, and de<lb/>sired me to search him—I took this bundle from his pocket, which con<lb/>tained three pairs of upper leathers for shoes—I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodging, at No. 2, Cherry Garden-street, where I found some pieces of leather, which are my master's.</p>

It is not so—my master has every thing entered previous to leaving the premises—the prisoner's wife had eight pairs by her at that time—this property found at his lodging he had no right to have—I remember any master buying twenty dozen of these skins—they were given to me, and I gave them out, as they were wanted to be cut up.</p>
