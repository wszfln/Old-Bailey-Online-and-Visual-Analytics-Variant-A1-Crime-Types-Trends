Where did he get the hanger? - He got it in a moment, he must have got it off the bed; we got that from him, and the candles were knocked out, I immediately took the pistol and cut him over the head, we got him out of that room and brought him into the other room, and I says to my partners, Crosby and one Lebar, good God! what is become of the other man? says he, he is gone; says I, what did you let him go for? The other man escaped; the woman prisoner put the candles out.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of a coat did the prisoner put on afterwards? - A brown coat.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other coloured coat he had there? - No; I brought him away immediately as fast as I could; I did not search for any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You found no goods there? - No, I had enough to do to take care of him.</p>

               <p>(Deposes to the blue coat.)</p>
               <p>I know it from the particular buttons and stile of making, if you observe, it is peculiar half lappelled, and the sleeves a size peculiar to myself, neither lady's nor man's size; these are stockings with my mark, T. R. here are five pair, here is a silver salt spoon, the fellow of which I have brought.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, upon your oath, what do you take to be the value of those things? - The six pair of stockings cost me six shillings a pair, I think I might say one pound one shilling for them and the coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you state the whole at a guinea? - I state the whole at a guinea, the six pair of stockings and the coat, the coat cost me three guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. What do you value your stockings at, and what do you value your coat at? - I value the stockings at half a guinea, and the coat at half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. Were these things, the coat and stockings, at your house the 12th of September? - They were, I double locked the door where they were before I went.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When had you left them there? - The 30th of July last.</p>
               <p>Then from July to the 13th of September, you do not know whether they were there or no? - I do not, I was abroad at the German Spa.</p>
               <p>Court. You left them the 30th of July, in the escrutoir, in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What room was that in? - In the front room up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Falkner. Do you know the escrutoir that Mr. Read speaks of, in which the things were, in the front room up one pair of stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before these people came into the house, were the locks of that escrutoir safe? - I do not know, I never was in that room before then.</p>
               <p>Before these people came in, was the door of that room safe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not broke? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you find it broke after they went away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. How soon after they went away did you find the door broke? - When the people came to my assistance, they searched the house.</p>
               <p>How soon did you yourself see the door open? - After the people came into the house to my assistance I saw it.</p>
               <p>Did you see it open at the time when they first came into the house? - I did.</p>
               <p>- DICKSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I found these things at Smith's, at the lodgings of the prisoner, in Church-yard-alley, on the 13th, the day after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court to Read. Look at a few of the things of the most value that you can swear to? - Here is nothing here but stockings.</p>
               <p>Dickson. This petticoat and gown were brought here, because the girl said the woman prisoner had it on at the time she came to the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Read. Here are five pair more.</p>
               <p>What do you value them at? - At half a guinea more.</p>

               <p>Court. What is the value of them? - About half a crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, as to the capital part, there seems to be no breaking, it is not like a burglary in the night, there must be an actual breaking of the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080007"/>Mr. Macnally. My Lord, they got into the house with a felonious intent.</p>
               <p>Court to Falkner. Was there any other room in the house broke open besides that? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did the people come first to you, or did they go up stairs before they carried you? - They came first to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I have always understood, that to constitute this particular offence, there must be an actual breaking into the house, not afterwards a breaking when in the house, and that is the distinction between this and burglary, because in burglary they may first get in by fraud.</p>

               <p>Court to Read. You have swore to the value of these things that were found, you have sworn very tenderly as to the value; you have lost a great many other things, can you name any of the other things? - Yes, I lost sixteen callico shirts, and about twelve or more linen ones, I lost several coats, and nine silver spoons; the callico shirts I value at eight guineas, four coats at a guinea a piece, and divers other things.</p>
               <p>Court. Who had the key of this room? - An acquaintance of mine in York-street.</p>
               <p>Court. You need not call any people to the woman's character, there seems to be sufficient evidence before you to induce you to believe she is the man's wife.</p>
               <p>The prisoner James called four witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. It is for your consideration, whether this prisoner is not guilty of stealing the rest of the things which the prosecutor lost, as well as those which are produced.</p>

               <p>About eight on Monday evening I was let in by the prisoners to the house of Mr. Holland, which my wife and I at that time took care of, when immediately as I got in the door was shut, and I was surprized by the prisoner presenting a pistol to my head and swearing he would blow my brains out if I made any resistance, at that instant his partner who was in the back parlour rushed out with a drawn cutlass in his hand, they secured me and conducted me into the parlour, and tied my hands behind my back, and made me follow them all over the house, leaving my wife and sister lock'd in the parlour, till such time as they had plundered the house of every think they thought of value, I saw them break the locks of Mr. Holland's book case and from it take gold, bank notes, table and tea spoons, buckles and many other things; from a plate chest below, I saw them take a silver tea urn, three silver tea cannisters, some table spoons, knives and forks, and other things, but I could not tell what, they strove to prevent my seeing as much as lay in their power, they put them into a long bandbox which they brought with them for the purpose of carrying them away; after that they made me go where my wife and sister were, they took my garters off my legs, and with one they tied my hands and the other my legs, they then lock'd the door; they made strong threats against our lives if we made any noise or appeared against them; and then in about ten minutes after they left the house.</p>

               <p>This handkerchief I am sure of, I have had it so many years, and I have only one of that sort which I lost that night, I have had it ever since the year 1776. It is a muslin handkerchief, I lost another, it has my mark upon it, and I have little doubt of it; I have obtained no other part of my property, the instruments they made use of in breaking open the place were taken on them, and a cutlass, a pistol, and an iron crow, they were taken afterwards.</p>

            ; the prisoner Wood, keeps a house at Kentish Town; the prisoner Brown, is a man I believe of no employment whatever, the account he gave of himself was, that he got a shilling as he could; the circumstances on which this charge against the prisoners is founded are these; on the 11th of October last, about five o'clock, as Sir Thomas was riding from Marlow, where he had been some time, his coach with post horses, and some of his servants being gone before, he followed in his chariot, attended by only one servant on horseback, and as he came along the Edgware road, about five miles from his own house, two men rode past the carriage, and the coachman thought from their appearance, that they meant to rob his master, he particularly looked at them as they passed the carriage, and at that time there was not any thing over their faces, nor any disguise, they were dressed in round hats, one a very good one, the other a common felt hat; they ordered the servant to alight and hold his horse, then they took their two handkerchiefs and tied them tolerably loose, and pulled them up at the bottom of their faces, then they went to the carriage, the short man to the right side, where lady Davenport sat, and the short man called out to the tall one, damn you, if you flinch I will blow your brains out, he seemed to be the commanding officer, he ordered the coachman to stop, the tall one put in his pistol, and asked Sir Thomas for his money, which he gave him, the short one attacked Lady Davenport, and asked her for her money, which she gave: at this time being five o'clock the sun was setting, and shone full in the face of the short man, his face was directly opposite to Lady Davenport and Sir Thomas; after they had taken their money, they asked for their watches, and they perceived that Lady Davenport was in the act of concealing her watch, upon which the short one swore if she concealed any thing, he would get off his horse,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080010"/> search the carriage, and if he found any thing concealed, by God he would blow her brains out, and he called out to the tall one to come and hold his horse; he stood upon his stirrups as if going to get off his horse; this threat had its desired effect, the tall one then said, your pocket books, aye, says the short one, that is right, your pocket books; while he was threatening Lady Davenport, the handkerchief fell from his face, Sir Thomas, whose attention was more to that man, because he thought his lady was in danger, observed him, and saw his face very plain, the robbery was ten minutes committing, they were in no hurry, they very deliberately rode away, and rode up to the servant who was some distance behind; Sir Thomas then looked through the back of the carriage and observed their size, their height, and their manner of riding; when they came up to the servant, says the tall one to the short one, give the man half a guinea; the tall man then, as the servant of the other, gave him, in the presence of the footman, the watches he had received, and he looked at the purse, says he, what is this, here is not much money in this, and he put it into his pocket, they then took off their handkerchiefs, and very deliberately rode away; Sir Thomas went home, and sent a description of the robbery and of their persons to Bow-street, but no information of any thing was received at the office: on the 10th of November, as Sir Thomas was walking from Westminster to his own house in Bloomsbury, going up St. Martin's Lane he observed these two men; their dress, their size, and one of the horses manner of going, every thing struck him that these were the two men that had committed the robbery, upon which he followed them, and got before them, and the instant he saw their faces, he had no doubt in his own mind that these were the two men, upon which he followed them till he came to the siable yard in Chaple street; having this clue to go by, the prisoner Brown was apprehended by the officers in Bow street, and as the two men had got the same coloured great coats, he was desired to bring his great coat with him, but that could not be, for he declared he had no great coat, a note was sent by the magistrates to Wood, to desire him to attend, Wood made some excuse and could not attend, upon which Sir Thomas, with the officers, went to Kentish Town, where they supposed this man was; Macmanus, who understands his business very well, says, if I go in, it may create suspicion, let the servant go in; the servant went in, and as soon as ever he went in, he saw the prisoner Wood in the bar; as soon as he saw him, he turned round and went to Macmanus, why says he, the man that robbed my mistress is in the bar now, I am sure of it; well says Macmanus, go in, the man went in; how do you do Mr. Wood, I hope you are very well; Wood hesitated a little, says he, how do you do Mr. Coachman, will you have something to drink, he wanted to go and make some punch, no, says the man, you must not go away, a signal was given, and Macmanus came in, says he you must go to Bow street, says the coachman, take your hat with you, says he to the maid, give me such a hat, mentioning a particular hat; says the coachman, that is not the hat you stopped my master in, says he, I have but this one, then says the coachman, put your great coat on? says he, I have no great coat, I chuse to go without one; so without the great coat he came, and was taken to Bow street; Sir Thomas was examined, and he, in his own mind, had no doubt but these were the two men that robbed him, that Wood was the man that robbed Lady Davenport, and that Brown was the person that stood on his side the carriage and robbed him, one of the horses was seen to ride up St. Martin's Lane, and shewn to Sir Thomas and the servants; Sir Thomas said as much as a man can swear to a horse, that is the horse, the coachman who had a better opportunity, immediately identified the horse, and said, that was the horse the man rode on the day his master was robbed; upon application to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080011"/> Wood, says he, this is my horse, it is a blood horse, he has won a plate, I have had it some time, therefore the question is, whether the man who rode that horse on that day, was Wood or not, because that horse is identified to be the horse on which the robbery was committed; another circumstance that will appear, is this, a few minutes before the robbery was committed on Sir

            , these two men were seen on that road; you will therefore be to judge, whether or no these are, or are not the men that committed the robbery, you will judge by the situation of the place; for it is not above forty minutes ride from the place where Sir Thomas was robbed, to the house of Wood, it is exactly seven miles, therefore it is possible he might have gone from his house at four, and returned at six; therefore the only question for him to account for will be between the hours of four and six; you will confin e your attention to that part of the defence, from the hour of four to six, and if he does not account for that time, you will conceive they are the persons: Gentlemen, it is a little remarkable, they should not chuse to produce the great coats: however as for Sir Thomas, he only wishes the whole circumstance of the case should be laid before you in evidence, in order that you may judge of the guilt, or innocence of these men; and if it can be made out, that they were not the men that actually committed the robbery, I am sure he will rejoice with me and with you; but if they are the men, it is a justice he owes his country, to bring them in before you: Gentlemen, these are the circumstances I have shortly opened to you, if upon the whole of the testimony they satisfy your minds these are the men that committed the robbery, you will find no difficulty in pronouncing the prisoners guilty.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Marlow at Cranford, I staid while the horses baited, I had a coach and four horses, and my own charriot, the coach went on before, when we came to Uxbridge road, we turned to Acton, I looked at my watch at <placeName id="t17841208-2-crimeloc20">Acton</placeName>

             the lesser man arose up upon the stirrups, then he had his horse's face pretty near to the window, as he arose up, his handkerchief dropped a little, and he pulled it up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080012"/> it seemed to me as if he held it at a little distance from his mouth, that he might speak plainer; he kept so fronting me in such a position as to see whether any thing was concealed or not, therefore I suppose he had observed my wife attempting to conceal the watch, he then held the handkerchief at a little distance and said you are going to conceal something, and he called to the other, and said, come here and hold my horse, and then lifted the off leg from me, out of the stirrup, he did not get of, but said to me, I shall search the charriot, and if I find any thing concealed, by God I will blow your brains out; I looked very ernestly at him, and he made a very considerable impression on me, so that I think I cannot be mistaken; I said, he seems a very firm, determined man, for God's sake give him your watch; the other man did not come round as he was bid, it appeared so as if Brown, who was on my side, was under some sort of command from the other, he to me appeared frightened a good deal, on my saying so, the other was very deliberate as I think he could be in any act, I gave my watch to Brown just before I gave it he said damn you, you have more money and felt my right hand pocket, my wife gave her watch also, hers was a gold watch that had a chased outside case, but then had a shagreen or seal skin, a steel chain, two seals and some other little ornaments I did not know, her seal was a family seal and one seal smaller; my watch was a gold watch, made by Mudge and Dutton, it had a gold cap upon it, a gold inside and outside case it was very heavy, I think I paid thirty three guineas for it, a plain steel chain and two seals, all this while the light of the sun was very strong in both their faces, so that I suppose the whole time, as near as I can guess in such a situation, could not be less then six or seven minutes, during which time I had made such observations that I was convinced in my own mind I should know the persons of both of them, any where: after a little pause, the taller man with a low softish voice says your pocket book, I told them I had no pocket book, the lesser man on my wife's side said aye, right, your pocket book, with a sharper voice and a rougher one; my wife said she had not one, after being so frightened and alarmed by their threats about the watch, she said I have none upon my honour Sir, and was making excuses, the lesser man said do not be frightened Lady, you shall not be hurt, there was some little deliberation, I sat in my seat very quietly, and my eyes almost intirely fixed on Wood, after he had made these threats, thinking if he put in his pistol or any thing of that sort, that I would give what assistance I could in warding it, or snatching it, the men went behind and I immediately looked thro' the back glasses, and there I saw, about the distance of twenty or thirty yards, my footman dismounted, standing and holding his horse, the two men were not then come up to him, as to the horse I only saw it was a bay or between a bay and a brown, and white on his face; the other appeared to me much darker, whether it was dark brown or black I could not tell, it stood in such a situation to me, there was a hedge directly behind him so that there was a shade, the other was in an open spot, but as to his marks I could not see at all; the two men before they got up to my footman met in the middle of the road and there seemed to me some stop, I could not tell what they did there, my footman must have seen it and possibly can describe it; then they went up, and seemed to say something, and went on with their head towards Acton, I should think if it was five mile to Paddington, it must be the outside, it seemed to be a good trotting horse, and he he could go in less than forty minutes to London, across the new Road; where I was, I was six miles from home and we were about an hour going home, and there were two hills that would delay five or ten minutes, if I had been going a level road, I was going at the rate of six miles an hour, I sent to town that night, but there was nobody at the office, and the next morning my servant gave intelligence and the watches were put into the hue and cry,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080013"/> but I heard nothing of them or the men until Wednesday the 10th of November, on a mizzling sort of a day, it was dirty, I was coming from Westminster towards the upper end of St. Martin's Lane, I saw these two men very distinctly and the moment I saw them I had the same impression I had at the time of the robbery, the lesser man had then on a brown coat, his hair round not powdered, a handkerchief tied round his neck which appeared to me to be of the same sort as the one about his face, the coat he had on was a darkish drab colour, and an old hat of the sort and kind he had on at the robbery.</p>

               <p>Court. How were they dressed at the time of the robbery? - They had both great coats on of the drab kind, one dirtier than the other, two large horseman's coats buttoned, so that I never saw their under dress, nor did I know till I came to Bow Street, what dress they had on, but your lordship will hear what dress they had on when their coats were seen unbuttoned; having made these observations and being perfectly convinced in my own mind and having no doubt about them, I took the pains to follow them through several streets; at that time my recollection seemed perfectly fresh about them, I followed them till they turned down what appeared to me to be a stable yard, it was wrote over Green Street, coming from Theobald's Road, and in a small passage leading into Chapel Street nearly opposite the Chapel, I saw them alight and put up their horses, I did not know either of their situations in life, but I thought my duty to the public required me as soon as possible to give information at the public office, there I met with three people, I desired they would make enquiry into the relative situations in life of these men; it struck me so forcibly at the time I had observed their height, one was about five foot six or seven, and the other five foot nine or nine and a half, that seemed to be exactly at the time the proportion of the relative height that they bore to one another, the taller man stooped a little on his horse, more of a lounging, and the other was erect; the next morning Carpmeal came to me and we went to Bow Street about three, and I looked at Brown, and I thought then as I do now that he is one of the men; a message was sent to Wood to Kentish Town to come to Bow Street, and the purport of his answer was that his wife was in Town and he could not come, however he was fetched to Bow Street, and the next day I saw him, and then and now, and at the former time, I did and do believe him to be the man: it struck me exactly with the same impression it does now and did at first, he was afterwards fully committed, and from the conviction I had, I thought it my duty to the public, that they should clear themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How many miles is it from Kentish Town to the place where you was robbed? - I should guess six or seven miles, I think I could ride it in three quarters of an hour, I very often ride seven or eight miles an hour.</p>

               <p>You lost watches of peculiar good makers, and seals with arms, and they were immediately inserted in the hue and cry? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Wood. I beg Sir Thomas might withdraw while his servant is examined.</p>
               <p>Riley. My master was stopped by two men, who passed us and did not say a word, they rode to the footman and made him get off his horse, they pulled their handkerchiefs over their faces, one on one side and the other on the other, they ordered me to stop, I did not pull up directly, they began to be enraged with me and swore and called me an impudent fellow for not stopping, they said if I did not stop they would blow my brains out and I stopped, immediately one came on each side, Wood came on my Lady's side and they demanded the watches and money, my Lady gave him her purse and he demanded her watch and pocket book, she told him she had none, and he threatened very much, and I saw the watch and purse in Wood's hand, then they demanded the pocket books, my Lady said they had neither of them pocket books, then he threatened to get off his horse and told the other to hold his horse, while he got off, and if he found any thing in the coach he would blow their brains out; as soon as she began to scream he pushed too the door, and told her not to be frightned she should not be hurt, so they rode off, they told me to drive on, they went to the footman and made him get down.</p>
               <p>Did you make observation either on the persons or horses of the two men? - Not so much when they first came up as after I leaned on that side that the person robbed my Lady on, I took more notice of Wood, than the other.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He had a kind of drabbish great coat on, and round hat and his hair hanging down about his ears, and his handkerchief tied round his face, I did see him as I turned my head, it hung down before; information was given at Bow Street, I observed the horse, it was a mare about fifteen hands and a half high, or thereabouts, I have seen her since at Bow Street, she looks to be the same mare.</p>
               <p>Court. What colour? - It was a bay mare with a switch tail, a kind of blood mare, two white feet, with a kind of a white slit and star, she seemed to be rather low in flesh.</p>
               <p>Is that the mare that the man rode who robbed your mistress? - To the best of my knowledge it is.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of the other man Brown? - Nothing that I could be so sure of him as the other, I looked behind me, and I took him to be the person, but not so positive to him as to Wood who robbed my Lady; he had the same sort of great coat on as the other, his horse was rather darker, but they sweat so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did they look as if they had been rode hard? - Yes, very hard; after this I went with Macmanus, or some of the officers, to Kentish Town, on Thursday the 11th of November, and Macmanus told me to go in first, and see if I saw such a person there as was on the road, and I went to the door, and saw Wood in the bar, I went back and told Macmanus that was the person, so I went up stairs and called for sixpennyworth of rum and water, we drank it, and he was sixpence; when we got into the room, we began talking to one another about the weather, we asked him if he had not a note from Bow-street; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080015"/> he had, he could not come, his house was full of company, and there was no name to the note; Macmanus said there was the sitting Magistrate's name; he said if he had known such a thing as that, he would have come at first, so we had a shillings-worth and came away; nothing passed at that time: he said if he could do any good, he would come directly. I asked him for sixpenny-worth at first, and told him to be quick; I asked him for a room, he said he believed he had not one above or below; he was not resolute at all, he came with us freely.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him, or he to you? - Not the least word in the world, he began to say that Brown was a very honest young man, and all that, speaking in behalf of Brown; we did not mention to him any thing that we were about: he was dressed in a brown coat.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations to him about his dress? - We asked him if he had never a great coat, he said he had lent his great coat out that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, coachman, first, as to Mr. Brown being in custody; he was just as much in custody as I am, or any of the Jury are. - If Macmanus was the constable, he must be in custody.</p>
               <p>Was this the note that was sent by Mr. Gilbert? (Shews him a note.) - I never saw the note.</p>
               <p>When was the first message sent to Wood? - It was about six or seven, I cannot rightly tell which, an old man went with it.</p>
               <p>When did you and Macmanus go to him? - The very same night, about half after nine.</p>
               <p>So that at any rate he had had four or five hours notice that you intended to visit him? - Yes, I suppose he had.</p>
               <p>Had you your coachman's great coat on? - I had this great coat on.</p>
               <p>So the first man you saw was Mr. Wood? - Yes, he was in the bar; they told us to go for Mr. Wood, the landlord: Sir Thomas came home, and said he saw the two men that had robbed them; that is, he told my fellow servant, and my fellow servant told me.</p>
               <p>You know it would have been uncivil to have differed from Sir Thomas in his opinion; it would have been rude, therefore, of course, you concurred in it: do you remember being at the

               <p>Describe the manner in which the handkerchiefs were tied over the faces? - They were brought under the head, and covered one of the eyes, and so came down to the mouth; they had only one eye that they could see out of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The Gentlemen of the Jury will observe, that one of the eyes was compleatly covered.</p>

            's being robbed? - Yes; when I first saw them, they were coming to meet the chariot, they did not take any notice when they first passed it: they came up to me and stopped me first, they made me get off my horse, then they put handkerchiefs over their faces, and rode back to the chariot; they stopped the chariot.</p>
               <p>How far from the chariot was you whilst they were robbing it? - About five or six yards; they went up and stopped the coachman, and demanded my lady's watch and money directly.</p>
               <p>After they had robbed your master and mistress, which way did they go? - They came back to me, and desired me to get on the horse again.</p>
               <p>Had you not an opportunity to make any observation as to their persons? - Yes, I took as much notice of them as I could the short time they were with me, they made me get off my horse, and after I was off my horse, they wore large handkerchiefs tied round their necks, and they unbuttoned their waistoats, and put them across their faces under their hats.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing the whole of their faces? - Yes, Sir, and after they pulled them off again.</p>
               <p>Should you know the men again if you were to see them? - I should know one of them, the other I cannot say I should know his face, because the great coat came up so high and the hat so low.</p>
               <p>Which of these two men is it that you think you should know? - The tallest.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively? - Yes, to the best judgment that I can form, that is the man; I saw my lady give her purse and money: they had both got great coats, Brown had a coat much like this, the other was not so good a one as this; I saw the horses, Brown's horse was either a very dark brown, or black; the other horse can be produced, which is in the stable; it is a bay horse, there is a large star in the forehead, and white slip on his nose; I have seen that horse since at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Was the horse you saw at Bow-street the same horse the robbery was committed on? - Yes, I can swear that is the horse the little man rode that robbed my lady.</p>
               <p>What dress were they in when they came into Bow-street? - Brown had a brown coat on, a kind of a drab coat.</p>
               <p>Court. That cannot be of much consequence; did you take notice of their clothes besides their great coats? - I had not a proper sight of the coat, but what I saw of the great coat, was the same coat they appeared in at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say Wood's coat was muffled up about him so high, and the hat so low, and the handkerchief over his face; was Brown's hat in the same way? - When they committed the robbery, there was nothing visible in the face of either of them, but one eye, and that was the right eye, that was uncovered as nigh as I can guess, I am sure it was the right eye.</p>
               <p>Have you ever since seen either of the great coats the prisoners had on? - No.</p>
               <p>You made no other observation on the horse, but that it had a star on the forehead and a slit on the nose? - Yes, I saw it was a kind of a blood horse, the tail just docked; it was a mare.</p>
               <p>How long might this robbery be in committing?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080017"/> - Their time with me and my lady, I suppose, might be ten minutes at least.</p>
               <p>You observed all these marks particularly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Sir Thomas saw these two men afterwards? - He came down and asked me if I could swear to the men if I saw them; I said I believed I could swear to the tall man; he told me he had traced two men to the livery stables, and saw them shut themselves in the stable.</p>
               <p>The next day you was told you was to go to Bow-street and see them? - I expected to find Brown there; I did find him there.</p>
               <p>Was you examined before Sir Thomas? - He was taken in first.</p>
               <p>After that, I take it for granted, you swore to him too? - I saw him before Sir Thomas saw him.</p>
               <p>You have said to the best of your judgment he is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that if you had met him, you should have known him to be the man? - I knew him at the Office.</p>
               <p>But then you knew he was the man that had commited the robbery? - I was sure of it.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had met this man any where but at the Office? - Let me have met him where I would I should have known him to be the man, I took so much notice of him.</p>

Mr. Wood, of Kentish Town; he said they went over Westminster-bridge, and came home that way, as near as I can recollect; he asked him where the horse was that Wood rode yesterday; he said he was gone to grass; says I to him, we want you for a highway robbery; says he, I never did such a thing in my life; says I, you must go down to Bow-street; says he, let me go into my house; says I, by all means: Clarke and Jealous went to look for Sir Thomas, I sat five or six minutes with Brown, I told him, you must come away, I cannot stay any longer; I took him to Bow-street, and put him into a back parlour, and went over the way and told Mr. Bond; I saw

               <p>Court. You mean to say, that she knew you was coming to take up her husband? - I apprehended so, because she was at Bow-street when Brown was fully committed, and she was at home when I got there; so I suppose she told her husband: Wood, said, Gentlemen, do not make any noise or disturbance here, there is a club in my house, and I went up stairs, and I suppose we might stop best part of half an hour, during that time the bell rung once or twice, and Wood wanted to go out, no, says I, you cannot, for Brown is fully committed, and I am accountable for you; so he did not ask to go out any more till we came to Bow-street: I asked him to get his great coat, and he said it was not at home: then we brought him to Bow-street; I know of nothing passing at the

             has too good a heart to attempt to take away the life of an innocent man; therefore I have no doubt but he believes me to be one of the men who robbed his Lady: but I trust your Lordship's candour and goodness will not admit any kind of prejudice to bear away your opinions in this business, until you have fully heard the witnesses I shall call to prove where I was on the evening of the 11th of October, and also to speak to my character; God knows it is the first time I ever was deprived of my liberty, and though brought before you in irons as a felon, the integrity of my heart still administers comfort: on my second examination in Bow-street, many people attended who had been robbed on the 12th of October, near Twickenham, by two men; a short man and a tall one, disguised with silk handkerchiefs, they viewed me but all agreed I was not the person; strange would it have been if they had, for that was the day I waited on my friends, which I had at my house; I mention this circumstance, because it is possible those that robbed Sir Thomas on the 11th, are the same who robbed on the 12th near Twickenham, for they declare them to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080020"/> disguised with silk handkerchiefs, as Sir

               <p>I am so unfortunate as to stand before this tribunal, charged with a crime of which I most solemnly declare I am not guilty; however respectable the charcter of my prosecutors may be, however great their veracity, they are unquestionably mistaken as to my being one one of the persons who robbed them. - Similitude of persons may have deceived the prosecutors, unhappily in regard to me; such instances I am afraid have too often occured. - My parents in my infancy instructed and educated me in habits of honesty, industry, and integrity; and I have religiously observed their good instructions, without deviating from those paths. - My situation, and the circumstances in life of my parents being far from necessitous, under whose immediate inspection I have been hitherto brought up, I never was induced by any unlawful means to defraud or deceive any man, however easy it might have been effected, and how remote soever the detection of such crimes might be; much less could I, in the face of the sun be guilty of such an atrocious crime as I am now charged with. - I challenge all mankind who know me, to charge me with the commission of any dishonest act, and I again solemnly declare, I am not one of the persons who committed the crime, I am now arraigned for; and I trust that by the aid of that Divine Providence, who guards and protects the innocent, I shall prove to the satisfaction of the Court and Jury, by witnesses of credit and veracity, that on the day, and at the time the prosecutors charge the robbery to have been committed, I was in my mother's house; and that by testimony of a great number of respectable witnesses, my innocence will be so fully and effectually proved, that I shall be by this Honourable Court and Jury, acquitted of the crime laid to my charge, and dismissed from the bar as an injured innocent young man.</p>

               <p>Court. What day of the week? - It was of a Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you be positively sure, from the time your husband came in, Wood was never out of your sight? - He was never out of my presence from five, till after my husband went away, not for five minutes; my husband had a pint of beer, and Mr. Wood asked me to make him some Hollands and water, as he was cold with bottling the wine, and had not been well for some days before.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing Mrs. Sanders there? - Yes, she came in as near as I can recollect, about a quarter past five, I cannot speak to a minute, she came in to pay Mr. Wood for some rum she had had.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing remarkable in the conversation between them? - She asked Mr. Wood how he did, she is the wife of the apothecary in that neighbourhood; he told her he was obliged to her, he was better than he had been, she said she came to pay him a trifle, she gave him half a guinea to change, and she was rather angry with Mr. Wood, for not employing Mr. Sanders as his apothecary in preference to Mr. Freke; he said he was not fond of doctors, she said, if you are not fond of doctors, they need not be fond of your beer: Mr. Sanders was there all the time at the door waiting for his wife, this was about a quarter after five, and she was there about a quarter of an hour, Mrs. Wood was gone to town to order things for the feast the next day, at that time there was no maid servant, she went away on old Michaelmas day, which was the day before, it was the last feast that Mr. Wood ever had till last week.</p>
               <p>What became of Wood after that? - He and I sat in the bar till such time as Mrs. Wood came back, he was not ten minutes out of my presence, from that time till I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are a married woman? - Yes, my husband is servant to Mr. Kendall the banker; the family consisted of Mr. Wood, his wife, and two children by the first husband.</p>
               <p>Did you set down this conversation? - I recollected every circumstance in my own mind.</p>
               <p>What makes you recollect so positively? - Having a feast the next day, a particular friend of Mrs. Sanders's dined there the next day, I can recollect it, Sir, exceeding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080023"/> well, in those cases, people have a right to endeavour to recollect every thing; it was the day after old Michaelmas day, he had been ill, and had not been from home some days before nor after.</p>
               <p>Was there a receipt given for this rum? - There was no occasion, it was not booked, it was chalked.</p>
               <p>If he was at home so many days before it, and so many days after, how come you to recollect just that particular day? - I particularly recollect Mrs. Wood being without a servant, I am positive of it being the 10th of October, the feast was on the 12th, a feast at Mr. Wood's of his tradesmen.</p>
               <p>Who told you it was on the 11th, that the robbery was charged to be committed? - I did not want to be told, I know he was at home the 11th of October, Mr. Wood had a note from Bow Street, to appear, and there was the 11th of October dated in that note, but if not whether or no, he was at home that day, the 11th of October was dated in that note, I do not recollect from that note I know when the 11th of October was.</p>
               <p>From whom did you hear first of all that the robbery was committed on the 11th of October? - Mrs. Wood came home and said a robbery had been committed, and he and Brown would be accused.</p>
               <p>(A note handed up.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. It is a mistake in the note, for it is dated the 11th of October, instead of November? - The 11th of October was dated in that note, I saw the note, I know it was the day after Michaelmas-Day, that the servant was gone.</p>
               <p>Where was Mr. Wood on the 18th of October? - It is the feast makes me recollect it was the 11th of October, and being without a maid servant, this is the day after the servant left him.</p>
               <p>What had Mr. Wood to do on the 11th? - He bottled wine in the morning, and he was not well, he had received a blow.</p>
               <p>This wine was bottling for the feast; - I cannot say what it was for.</p>
               <p>Had he any body to assist him in the bottling this wine? - The waiter, he was to leave him as soon as the feast was over, he was not well, he was in the bar all the time, except a few minutes, Mr. Sanders waited at the door and said to his wife, come we shall be too late, he was going to drink tea at Mrs. Evans's in the Town.</p>
               <p>What makes you so particular as to the time? - I cannot be particular to a minute, my husband said he must be going home, he is a servant, I said stay and have a cup of tea, Mr. Sanders waited at the door a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Is not this mare a little mare with a switch tail? - I do not know any thing about the tail, it was lame; I went to the stable door with my husband when he went away.</p>
               <p>What clothes does Mr. Wood generally wear? - Black and brown and light-coloured.</p>
               <p>I suppose he had a great coat on that day? - I never saw him in a great coat in my life, he had no gr eat coat, I never saw a great coat of his in the house.</p>
               <p>You do not believe he had a great coat? - I have heard gentlemen ask him, and I have heard him say he was sorry he could not lend them one; he had not one to lend; I was up two pair of stairs when Macmanus came, when I came down I saw two gentlemen in the room, I went down to the bar; the Monday after I was in town, and came home by the stage, when I came home he was gone to the Bull and Gate, in the town.</p>

               <p>Do you remember being at the house of Mr. Wood, on the 11th of October? - Yes, Sir, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>What day of the week? - Monday.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - At a quarter past five, I was going a visiting, to spend the evening with Mrs. Evans, in Chapel-row, Mr. Sanders was with me, I owed Mr.

             a small trifle, about a couple of shillings, I went to pay him, he gave me no receipt, I did not think it required a receipt.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any conversation that passed between you and Mr. Wood? - Yes, perfectly well, Mr. Wood has not been long at the Assembly-house; when he come round to Mr. Sanders for his business, Mr. Sanders told him, certainly he should continue at the house; Mr. Wood had some accident and was ill, I heard of it, and I thought it unkind of him not to employ Mr. Sanders, I thought I would tell him of it myself; I do not come out of any prejudice to Mr. Wood, but merely to do justice; as Mr. Sanders thought I staid long, he came to fetch me out, he walked on the road and waited for me, he told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080025"/> not to stop, I told him I chose to stop to speak to Mr. Wood, who gave me change for half a guinea; I suppose I was at the side of Mr. Wood's bar for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. I think I may very well guess the time of the day, by our going to tea; I am sure of the time from Mr. Sanders's books, and, besides, I am as regular as clock-work.</p>

               <p>Are you sure from that regularity that that was the day? - Yes, I am perfectly sure, I have other proofs, I wash regularly once in three weeks, and I walked with a friend to London on the 9th, and she went to see a friend, who died in her arms on Saturday, which precedes the Monday; there is a grecer can justify all I said of Mr. Wood being ungrateful to Mr. Sanders: I remember seeing a woman and a man there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are as regular as clock-work; perhaps you put down where you drink tea? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. How does it appear by Mr. Sanders's books? - Why Monday the 11th of October.</p>
               <p>You did not set down in the books those expences for the rum and beer? - No, Sir, we did not; Mr. Sanders set some things down on the day we went to drink tea with Mr. Evans; Mr. Sanders attends the family as apothecary. I have reason to know it is the 11th of October, I have given my reason, I am very just in my reasons that I paid for it the 11th of October, because Mr. Wood had a feast the next day, and the grocer I deal with had told me on the Saturday before, when I was in town, of Mr. Wood having employed another apothecary; I am certain to the time, I have no other account of it.</p>

               <p>Court. How does it appear by the books? - It appears to me by my being in town on the 9th of October, which was Saturday, and I paid Mr. Wood on the 11th, which was the Monday after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. But how does that appear? - It appears to me in my own breast, as you ask me so many questions.</p>
               <p>Then the books have nothing to do with it? - You may cross me as much as you please, I am sure of the time.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was that time of the day? - I looked at my clock when I went out.</p>
               <p>That is a remarkable thing I suppose? - I do not know that it is, I have reason, my girl told me I was to go soon, I go very early to drink tea with that lady.</p>
               <p>The maid told you, you should lose your tea? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to delay at this publick house? - I chose it, and I should not have had an opportunity another time.</p>
               <p>Well, but as the maid told you, you are too late, yet you stay a quarter of an hour at the publick house to pay this two shilling bill? - Suppose I did, my husband would not think I was wrong, I do not think you have any right to ask me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wood had been poorly? - He had been ill.</p>
               <p>Was not he poorly then? - I cannot tell, I did not ask him; I had no right to deal with him, as he did not employ Mr. Sanders.</p>
               <p>Had he a great coat, buttoned up? - I do not know that he had a great coat on.</p>
               <p>Was his face wrapped up? - I do not know that he had any thing about his face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Sanders, if I understood you right, that on the Saturday when you was in town, your grocer told you that he was going to a feast, and that Wood had employed another apothecary? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you remember that you was in town on the 9th; - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>You do not go out to tea at three in the afternoon, I suppose? - I do not.</p>
               <p>No, I thought not.</p>

               <p>I am an apothecary at Kentish Town; I remember going with Mrs. Sanders to Mrs. Evans's on the 11th of October, my wife called at Mr. Wood's, she went in first, and she staid I imagine about a quarter of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080026"/> an hour, I went in thinking she was rather tedious, and we should be too late where we were going to tea; we went away together, when I went in I saw Mr. Wood and a woman at the bar, a Mrs. Wilson.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing any other person? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect with certainty that this was on the 11th of October? - Yes, with great certainty.</p>
               <p>State to the Jury, by what circumstance you are certain it was that day? - On the 10th, we dined at home, and on the 11th we had a message to invite us to tea; I had been at Mrs. Evans's the Sunday before, and she was rather indisposed, I wanted her to come and see us, she said, she could not come, but on the Monday she sent up a message, to desire to see us.</p>
               <p>Now are you quite certain? - Quite certain, positive.</p>
               <p>Do your books assist you? - I am perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did you go out? - About a quarter past five.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shephard. Your family and Mrs. Evans are very intimate? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Why do you recollect particularly, that you visited on the 11th of October? - We visited only once since, that was on the 19th of October.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it, that you recollected so particularly you had been there on the 11th, you did not think of it every day? - No, Sir, but I have things in my book that reminded me, Mrs. Evans was poorly.</p>
               <p>What induced you to recollect particularly being there on the 11th? - I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Did you ever positively, recollect that you had been there on the 11th till you heard of the robbery? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>What induced you to recollect it so particularly? - By looking in my books.</p>
               <p>What appeared in your books to assist your memory? - Mrs. Evans was poorly, and had a bottle of medicine on the 9th; I went to see her on the Sunday, and also on the Monday, and she had no more.</p>
               <p>There were no medicines on the 11th? - There were no medicines on the 10th, or 11th, or 12th, but I know it in my own mind, I sent a medicine two days before, on the 9th, which was Saturday, to a young Lady there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now this Gentleman asks you when you began to recollect it, I take it for granted you always knew it, and you began to recollect it when Mr. Wood was taken up? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a gardener at Kentish town.</p>
               <p>Do you remember being employed by Wood at any time about old Michelmas day? - I remember I was employed on Monday the 11th of October, I was at work in Mr. Wood's garden, till it was far advanced in the afternoon, and I had finished my job about sixteen or seventeen minutes after four o'clock, I work by the day, and I charge according to my time; I did not do a whole day's work, I said to myself, a very honest three quarters of a day's work.</p>
               <p>You say you was at work, meal times excepted? - I had my meals in Mr. Wood's house, my dinner a little after two o'clock, I saw Mr. Wood at the time I had my dinner, when I left off work I went directly in doors, and I met Mr. Wood in the passage, I told him I had earthed up his asparagus beds, and done up his garden ready for the reception of his trades-people tomorrow; the trades-people were to be there the next day; after I had done, I sat down and had some beer, Mrs. Wilson said, she should want some herbs; says I, do you want them directly, no, says she, any time this evening; I staid in the house till I heard Mr. Wood call Mrs. Wilson to get some tea, I thought it was a very early time, the clock wanted about a minute of five; Mr. Wood called again to Mrs. Wilson to make haste and get tea; as Mr. Wilson was going home, I went out to the garden for a quarter of an hour, when I came in again, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080027"/> was Mr. Wood and Mrs. Wilson in the bar, and tea things, but I did not see them drink any tea; I went into the kitchen, I heard somebody come in whose voice I knew very well, a boy came into the kitchen, says I, who is that? he said, Mrs. Saunders is paying my master his score; I did not see her, I knew her voice, and I recollected it when the boy told me; I continued in the house from that time till about half after seven, and then I went to bed; I lodge under the assembly room at Mr. Wood's.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Wood out of his house for any length of time amounting to ten minutes from the time you finished your work? - If ever he was out of the house, it was the little time I went into the garden, to get the herbs, I had the opportunity of seeing him, I did in fact see him every two or three minutes; I heard him calling the boys, Mrs. Wood was gone to London, to bespeak some things for the dinner the next day, so he told me; I asked him why he did not come into the garden, to see me do the work, and he said, he was not well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He was ill at that time? - He had been ill, and continued to be poorly, I do not know what was the matter with him.</p>
               <p>Was he muffled up? - He was, I think he had a great coat on, as he walked through the passage; but I will not be positive on it, whether he had or had not, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What coloured great coat coat does he generally wear, blue is not it? - I cannot remember any thing about it, he was somehow muffled up, but I cannot say, I cannot recollect whether he drank tea; I heard no particular complaint but that Mr. Wood was ill, he did not come into the garden to me.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect the colour of his great coat? - I do not remember any thing particular, I do not know that ever I saw him wear a great coat.</p>

               <p>Did you see the servant of the house there? - Yes, he came in, and sat with his side to the fire; I says to the girl, George will cut but a poor figure in the club, this was a lottery club; I said to the girl, I believe George is done enough on that side, get a bit of butter and baste him.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue there? - But a very little while, the maid desired him to go to bed, and went away with him to get him to bed, as I understood; it must be past six, I had been there near an hour; I am sure he was there at that time.</p>
               <p>How do you recollect it was the 11th of October? - Because there was a lottery club, I do not belong to it.</p>

               <p>I am servant to this young man's mother, I have lived in the family about ten months, there is a lottery club meets at our house once a fortnight, always of a Monday night, I recollect it met on the 11th of October.</p>
               <p>Do you remember whether the prisoner at the bar was there? - Yes Sir, he was at home but not at the club, the club met generally about eight.</p>
               <p>How happened it that he was not at the club? - He was rather intoxicated in liquor, and did not chuse to go in.</p>
               <p>Wh ere was he when the club met? - He was in bed, he went to bed about seven, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing Mr. Green there? - Yes, Brown went into the room to Mr. Green, and sat down some time with him, and he dropped asleep, he was rather near the fire, and Mr. Green said to me, you had better bring a lump of butter and baste George, for he is roasted enough on that side.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening might that be? - That was about six, as far as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>How long had he been sitting there before that time? - The value of half an hour.</p>

               <p>What is it that makes you sure of it? - I recollect his coming in about a quarter after three, we had all dined, and he had a red herring for his dinner, and my mistress told him he need not have a red herring, for she thought he had had liquor enough, without eating herrings to make him drier.</p>
               <p>Did he continue in the house from that time? - He never was absent from his mother's premises till the time he went to bed.</p>
               <p>Is the young man usually at home in his mother's business? - Yes, he is, he officiates as master; he continued in the business, till he was taken up, ever since I was in the family.</p>

               <p>Had he been out on horseback that day? - Not to my remembrance, he was not in the afternoon; the hostler might stay three quarters of an hour, and then he went in to Mr. Green, I was about the house about my business.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a hostler, I know the prisoner Brown very well, I remember being at his mother's house on a Monday in October; I remember seeing him in his mother's house on the 11th of October, the first time I saw him I recollect I came through the passage in my way to the kitchen, to see what it was o'clock; to water my horses, and I went into the kitchen with a halfpenny-worth of apples, and asked him to eat one, and he knocked the apple out of my hand under the grate; then I called for a pint of beer and asked him to drink, this was about four, or between four and five; I suppose I staid half an hour, or three-quarters of an hour, in his company in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be perfectly sober, as he is in general, or was there any thing particular in his appearance? - As far as I could see of him, he seemed to be rather intoxicated with liquor; I saw him again in the course of the evening, I staid till about five, and then went to water my horses at my usual time, between four and five, and about five, or half after, I came in again, and went to look at the dial, which I generally did, there was a lame gentleman, a stay-maker, his name is Green, as they tell me, that is the man; Brown was then sitting in a sleepy posture when I went to see what it was o'clock, I shut the door immediately; I was there as near as I can guess about a quarter before seven, and saw him in the back part, between the back room and the wash-house, he seemed to say he was going to bed, the maid servant was with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Who are you hostler to? - I was hostler to Mr. Farren, a gentleman that rents stables on these premises; the publick house is a house that my master used always; Mr. Farren keeps horses to let out, I have lived with Mr. Farren three quarters of a year, I have used this house every evening, I knew Mr. Green very well by person, and by name as I have heard say.</p>

               <p>Did Brown hire horses of your master? - I never knew the prisoner hire a horse of my master, he had not that day to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had he boots on? - Not as I know, I did not take any notice about it, I came in at four, and again at five, because I mistook the clock; in October I water the horses between four and five.</p>
               <p>What made you know the day? - No further than I heard the men in the lottery club talking of it; they met about half after seven or eight.</p>
               <p>What was Brown dressed in? - In a kind of a light coloured coat, a close bodied coat.</p>

               <p>On the 31st of July, on Saturday evening, I had been into the city on a little business, and as I was on my return, I was accosted by a gentleman in the middle of the street, he said if I would stop a minute, I should see the shop-lifters, I was accosted opposite a butcher's, at the beginning of New-street, Covent-garden; I went with him, and saw two men in Mr. Thelwall's shop, it was candle-light, I was about a dozen yards off; the prisoner was not one of the two; there were three or four men, and the prisoner was one of them, they stood at the turning of the corner in King-street, he was looking through the window; and in about six minutes he went right into the shop; these two men were in the shop, looking at different things on the right-hand counter; there were two women behind the counter, I saw the prisoner go behind the counter and take this bundle of stockings, he concealed it under his great coat, that he had across his arm.</p>
               <p>At what distance was you? - I was standing on the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>Could you see the prisoner's face? - Yes, he walked immediately from thence to two men that were by the counter, and put his head between the two men's shoulders, then he turned his face, and was coming out; I said to the gentleman that was before me, that it was a sin that he should go out with the property, I immediately ran and took hold of his collar, he dropped the stockings on my shoe, and said the other man had got them in his possession, and they turned round and gave him some abusive language; the other man ran off: the gentleman came to my assistance about two minutes after I had hold of him.</p>
               <p>(The stockings produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know them from the mode of their being done up, and marked with my own hand writing.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - Thirty shillings they cost me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In what manner was the shop situated? he says he stood on the other side of the way; whether or no there was a light in that window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there two counters or one? - Two counters.</p>
               <p>Was there any light at the counter where you saw me take the bundle from? - No.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I hope you will take it into consideration, I had been to one Mr. Thompson's, in the Haymarket, coming down New-street, I called for a hair ribbon, I went into this shop for one, and there were three people in the shop; I had not been in the shop the space of two minutes, before two men came in and said there were thieves in the shop, and immediately the other people rushed out of the shop; I never offered to run away, they took me, and said I had taken something, I said I had not; he took the candle off the counter, and found the stockings on the ground by the door; I have not a friend in the world.</p>

               <p>How soon after you saw him come out of his house with a bag, was it that your brother came and told you that there was a sheep lost? - My brother came just after, and I told my brother, I suspected the sheep, was in the bag, my brother got a search warrant, and went into the out-house to search for it, in the course of the afternoon, I found this bag, and the flesh of a sheep, (the bag produced) there were four quarters of mutton, and some stakes cut off the loin, two loins were cut together, this is the bag, the prisoner was not at home when we searched; I found the skin directly behind his house, in a meadow of a Mr. Jones's premises, which the prisoner lived in, about a hundred yards from the prisoner's house or not so much, (the skin produced, marked G.

               <p>Did you live there in October last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you there the 18th of October last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was in the house besides yourself? - A maid servant, the housekeeper, and Mr. Truscot.</p>
               <p>Who was up last that night? - I was.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - Between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Where the doors fast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you fasten the outer door of the court yard at the back of the house? - It was fastened with a cross wooden bar and two iron bolts.</p>
               <p>Did you fasten the front door of the house too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were all the lower windows fast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you get up in the morning? - At seven, I was the first up, and when I came down the back doors were all open, the front of the house was never touched, the back court yard door had a hole cut in it.</p>
               <p>Have you the pieces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Produce them. - This is the hole, it was cut about the middle of the door, there was a bolt about six inches.</p>
               <p>What was done to the iron bolts? - There were two iron bolts, and both the staples were forced out; as soon as I came down I went up to the housekeeper, and to Mr. Truscot, I told them? when I went out into the yard I saw a lamp-lighter's ladder out in the yard.</p>
               <p>Was it there the night before, when you went to bed? - No; I saw the pistole were gone, they were there the night before, I saw them when I went to bed, they laid inside the kitchen door on the right-hand, the pistols were Mr. Truscot's; I found six tea spoons and the cream jug missing, that is all I know that was missing; Mr. Truscot, I believe, knows of the rest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is the situation of this court yard door that you have been talking of, with respect to the house? - It comes into the passage that leads to the kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Is that passage a covered one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is over it? - It was the courtyard door to the house.</p>
               <p>This was the night of the 18th of October? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean it was the night between the 17th and the 18th, or between the 18th and 19th? - Between the 18th and 19th, I am sure of that; I cannot say any thing of the pistols, I never found the spoons and jug again.</p>

             called in again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fearnley. Do you remember any advertisement coming out from Bow-street? - Yes, I received that advertisement half an hour after I took in the pistols, this was the paper, these are the pistols, they have not been out of my possession; I received them from the prisoner at the bar, I know him.</p>
               <p>Had you much conversation with him? - Not as conversation.</p>

               <p>Did he say whose they were? - No.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In the passage leading into Tothill-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You remember the day by these papers I take it for granted? - That is what I go by.</p>
               <p>You received them the day this handbill was issued, which you take to be the 18th? - Yes, it is the 18th.</p>
               <p>And it is by this paper that you understood it was the 18th; do not you keep books? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you referred to them? - No, I was guided by the hand-bill.</p>

               <p>Court. How comes it, that in all this time, when this was discovered, that you have never looked at your own books to see when you received these pistols? - I went by the hand-bill; I was in a hurry to go to Bow-street, as it was my duty to do, and they gave me directions to go to Mr. Masterman's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you receive the handbill after the pistols? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then that is no apology for your not setting them down; did you give a duplicate? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you make a ticket? - I do not know where it is.</p>
               <p>Is not it your constant practice, and is not it your bounden duty to make a ticket and tie it to the articles? - Most undoubtedly;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080043"/> I have not a ticket, I do not know where it is.</p>
               <p>There is no entry in your book I take it for granted? - Really, upon my oath, I am not able to say whether they were booked or not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that going to Bow-street, in consequence of this advertisement, and knowing that you were to be examined, you made no entry; it seems to me to be peculiarly the object of an entry; you are quite sure it was the 18th?? - Yes, I go by the hand-bill, I do take it to be the 18th.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - On a Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was on the Monday? - We always receive the papers on a Monday as early as possible.</p>
               <p>You went immediately to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know a woman of the name of M'Carty? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know a woman of the name of

            .</p>
               <p>How soon did you see her after you took in these pistols? - She came on Saturday night, about a fortnight or a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in custody then? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any conversation that passed between you and her? - She asked me to let her have the pistols, I told her it was not in my power.</p>
               <p>Did you tell her you had given information? - I might say the information was given.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not? - I cannot directly say.</p>
               <p>You think you did? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Do you think you told her this man, Stewart, had better get out of the way? - Stewart was along with her, I told her if he did not get out of the way, I should stop him.</p>
               <p>What, the man against whom you had given evidence, and was to be prosecuted for burglary? - I told him he must go, or I should stop him.</p>
               <p>Now, I believe, you have a sort of private intimation in your shops, by which you can send for a constable, without any body knowing it? - If we find a ground or reason to send, we certainly do send.</p>
               <p>Have not you, a private sign, by which you communicate with the persons in your business to go for a peace officer, without giving an open order? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>So you told him he had better get out of the way; what did Maddocks say about it? I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Recollect a little? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was the prisoner taken? - It might be in the course of the ensuing week; I believe it rested a fortnight after the information was given.</p>
               <p>What day in the week was he taken? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect what day you attended? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fearnley. You received that paper, have you any reason to know the particular day on which you received the pistols, excepting that paper? - It is from that paper I speak as to the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Do you know who this Mrs. Maddocks is? - I believe her to be a girl of the town.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN TRUSCOT sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of October, I lodged at Mr. Masterman's, in Red-lion-square, I had a pair of pistols at Mr. Masterman's on the 18th of October.</p>
               <p>Were they in his house that night? - I am sure they were, I saw them there when I went to my bed, I passed by the chest where my pistols lay, and looked at them, and took one of them in my hand; about seven the next morning the boy came in and told me the house was broke open; my pistols were gone. I gave information at Bow-street the next morning, which was on the 19th.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear of your pistols again? - On Monday the 25th, I went to Woolwich, and returned again the Thursday after, the servant went to Mr. Wright's and saw my pistols. ( Looks at them.) These are my pistols, I saw them at Mr. Wright's.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080044"/>Court. How long after you returned from Woolwich was the prisoner apprehended? - About ten days or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had not all Sir Sampson Wright's men with you? - I think not.</p>
               <p>Did you apprehend this man or they?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fearnley. Did you desire the prisoner might not be apprehended? - I desired he might not till I had written to Mr. Masterman, unless he came for the pistols.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Why, Captain, these appear to me to be as plain pistols as ever I saw in my life? - Yes, Sir, here is the maker's name, I had a particular mark on those pistols.</p>
               <p>What, that you had observed before? - In the firing them, which I could swear to them by; not only that, but the wood they are mounted on, one is a paler kind than the other.</p>
               <p>Why, Captain, they are hardly ever similar, the using one more than the other, makes them paler or deeper? - Here is a bit of one broke in the firing.</p>
               <p>Yes, I remember that I have one of my own broke just like it, it happens nine times in ten to these Birmingham made pistols.</p>

               <p>Court. Was it day break at that time? - When I had the information, but the apprentice got up at six, and a large dog of great value, which I highly esteemed, was poisoned, and my shed, which is over my shop, and my shop were broke open and robbed, there is a stair case from my shed to my shop, and there is no communication from the shed but that; I was also informed that the back door of the shop was broke open, which I perceived was bolted the night before, the door goes into a little yard we have, which yard adjoins to a stone mason's yard; when I went into the shop I found three dozen of calf skins, worth about 12 l. 18 s. I have estimated them moderately, and three dozen of seal skins, worth 12 l. and some leather shoulders, worth about 7 l. 10 s. I imagined they carried the goods out by the back door, because we found a considerable part of the goods left in the stone mason's yard the next morning, this leather was half curried, that is, not finished or dressed, the back door was broke open by the middle bolt of the door being wrenched entirely open, and the door forced; I advertised some of the property which I did not get, and put a reward of five guineas.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of November I was at the Hind in Redcross-street, about twelve at night, and the two prisoners and another man there, I knew them a good bit before, I was drinking at the same time, and I heard these two men ask another man, whether he would go into Blue Anchor-alley, Bunhill-row, they said they knew a place that would come to about forty or fifty pounds, they said it was to nabb some skins at a Currier's.</p>
               <p>How came they to say that, so as you could hear it? - They said it at the house, and there was a large dog, and they had got some poison to poison him.</p>
               <p>Court. I should think you was part of the gang? - No, Sir, I was not, I followed them, they did not see me, I stood at the fore-part of Mr. Powell's house, they did not see me at all, and I saw the prisoner Ellis pulling down something, and the dog barked, I heard a great noise, I was by the fore part of the house by Blue Anchor alley, there is a chandler's shop right facing Mr. Powell's house.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon this, did you cry out thieves, or what did you do? - I was afraid they poisoned the dog first.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because they said they would, I heard one of these men say to the other, damn my eyes, a bit of butter will make it slip down easy, I cannot tell which it was that said it.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you stay in the front of the house? - When they said that word, they said let us leave the place for place for two hours, for they said the dog will not be dead a good while, the y had not enough stuff.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - Half an hour after twelve, I stayed all the time, my cousin used to live in that alley.</p>
               <p>Is your cousin a male or female? - A female.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080047"/>So you went to your female cousin? - They came back in an hour and a half, I staid there all the time, when they came back I heard a great noise, I cannot tell what it was, nor who it was that did it.</p>

               <p>How near might you be to them then.? - About ten or fifteen yards off, I could not tell how far they were off.</p>
               <p>How came you to stay in November to watch these people? - Because they said so; I heard Mr. Pool the constable had found the skin, and Mr. Pool is a barber and constable, and he said he had found so and so in that young man's lodgings, Towley Scraggs, Astill we call him now, then I discovered this to Mr. Pool a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you see them remove the skins into the man's yard? - No, I heard something tumble, I cannot tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Astill. Upon examination at Justice Wilmot's, he said he could positively swear to Ellis's giving the dog poison.</p>
               <p>Alvey. I heard one of them say, damn my eyes, if I had old Dr. Stone here, I would stick the knife into him, because he has not given us stuff enough to kill the dog.</p>
               <p>Court. Who Dr. Stone is, I cannot tell? - He comes to the Hind in Redcross-street; the next morning after the robbery was done, I was at the Hind, and they came into the Hind, I was there a sitting by myself about eleven.</p>
               <p>You had not been in bed all that night? - Yes, about half after two, I live in Grubb-street, the other man came in just after, they then asked if old Dr. Stone had been there, and the man of the house said no, and they said, damn my eyes if we had had him last night, if we should not have killed him, we would have been damned, for not giving poison enough to poison the dog; he came in about half an hour after, and they hit him a spank of the head, and they told him so.</p>
               <p>Who is Dr. Stone? - He is a horse farrier.</p>
               <p>Court. These seem to be a pretty set; how came you there? - I used to be drinking along with my uncle, he is a porter; they said, you gallows old thief you did not give us poison enough to poison the dog.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the man's name that keeps this remarkable house? - Casey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. How long had you been in this house this evening? - I went at six, and staid from six to twelve.</p>

               <p>You went to the front of the house? - Yes, they talked very loud about the poison, and they wished for a bit of butter.</p>
               <p>You heard that? - I was just at the corner of the turning.</p>
               <p>Did not you know there was a reward for taking people for burglaries? - No Sir, Mr. Pool told me it was in the papers.</p>
               <p>You do not know there is a reward? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear there was forty pounds reward? - No Sir, I heard there was forty pounds for hanging a man, I never was told that only since they have been in trouble.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear it in Newgate? - No Sir, I heard for highway robberies, or for hanging a man.</p>
               <p>How long did they wait the first time? - About a quarter of on hour.</p>
               <p>Then you walked down to your relations? - Yes, I waited in the alley above two hours, when I came up the alley again they were gone.</p>

               <p>What did you wait two hours for? - Because they said they were coming back again, I saw them when they came back again, but they did not see me.</p>
               <p>Were there no watchmen? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you alarm the family? - No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080048"/>How came you not to do this? - For fear of their hurting me.</p>
               <p>What did you wait the two hours for, was it with intention of being an evidence? - It was with intention of telling somebody or other.</p>
               <p>Did you the next day tell any body? - Yes, I believe it was the next day I told Mr. Pool, that there was another robbery done in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Mr. Powell's house that had been robbed? - No, because I thought it was best to tell Mr. Newman.</p>
               <p>You thought Mr. Newman could put you in a better way of getting the forty pounds? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>And this conversation happened publickly in the tap room? - There was only them three and me.</p>
               <p>It is a wonder they were not afraid of you? - They were not.</p>
               <p>They never spoke a word to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. How long is it since you have been out of Newgate? - Two years, a man may be bad one time, but he must not always remain such.</p>
               <p>Court. It is no proof of your amendment to frequent the Hind; so the next morning they talked about the dog? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Publickly? - Yes.</p>

             who was with me came out, he is bad in bed now; the prisoner followed us, we went to the George, and called for a pint of beer there, and they came in there, we got the beer and paid for it and went out, we staid about half or three quarters of an hour at the George, we went out together, and they followed us again.</p>
               <p>Court. After you left the George, did you observe them following you before they struck you? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not? - No.</p>
               <p>What effect had the blow upon you? - It knocked me down.</p>
               <p>How do you know who struck you? - I got up and run after him, I saw his face when he knocked me down, he put his knee upon my breast, the other said, you secure that other bugger, and he went to make a blow at the lad, and the lad fell down, he did not knock him down, he demanded my money or my life, and I bid him take it; he took a guinea in gold, and half a crown and four and sixpence, and eight halfpence, and four farthings; I knew what money I had about me, because I changed it just before, they had all the money I had; after he robbed me he run away, and I got up and run after him till I fell down, I could run no further; and then two rope-makers overtook him, I saw them stop him, he was out of my sight about a minute or two; I was led home by two persons, I was so much hurt by the fall, and the blow he gave me; Rutter got clear off, Harrington run after him, but could not catch him, he was taken the next day in his mother's bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Council. You are sure as to the time this happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Quite sure of that? - Yes, it was on Monday the 22d of August.</p>
               <p>You mean to stick to that? - I do stick to it.</p>
               <p>How happened that these lads were not committed till the 26th of October? - I do not know for that.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Harrington? - He went the voyage<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080051"/> with me, the prisoners pretended to be acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>How long have you used the Barley-mow? - I never used it before, it was as likely to fall into my hands as any other.</p>
               <p>You have been pretty well acquainted with the Barley-mow? - I never was yet; I do not know what I may be.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the Barley-mow to the George? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Guess a little; you were leaky vessels, you wanted wetting very often? - We had a pint of ale at the George, a pot of beer at the Barley-mow, it is between a quarter of a mile and half a mile.</p>
               <p>A pint of ale, and a pot of beer? - That is nothing of a working day; it is the day I went up to be bound; I had been at work for my master.</p>
               <p>Whose house have you lived in since this happened? - My master's sister's.</p>
               <p>What is her name? - Stoddert.</p>
               <p>Which of the thief-takers is it, that you are so well acquainted with? - I am not acquainted with them, I never lived with one of them in my life, nor lay in their house a night, I have seen one of them every day I have been here, his name is Forrester.</p>
               <p>How often in the course of a week? - I cannot rightly tell, some weeks I have not seen him at all; I can swear I have not seen him every week upon my oath, some weeks two or three times a week only.</p>
               <p>How much of the reward is Mr. Forrester to have? - I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Is there any reward? - I know I am to get my own money, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard there is eighty pounds to be got by the death of these two lads? - I have not, I have never heard that.</p>
               <p>You may swear it is if you chuse? - Then I chuse to swear it, I do not know it, I never heard so from any body.</p>
               <p>When did you see Harrington last? - I saw him on Sunday last.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - In Farmer-street, he was taken ill on Monday last, this day week, he keeps his bed, I do not know his complaint; I went to him and asked him if he was coming, and he said, he was not well, and was not able to come; I never asked him what was the matter with him.</p>
               <p>Was Patch drunk or sober? - Sober.</p>
               <p>What was the expression they used? - He told me to demand my money or my life.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Mr. Forrester about that? - No, I suppose I had walked a hundred yards, these boys followed me, and I did not know it, Harrington immediately said, there were the boys that were drinking with us.</p>
               <p>What were you doing in the fields? - We were walking in the fields for our own pleasure.</p>
               <p>Court. Why my boy, do you know what Month it was in? - October.</p>
               <p>What made you say August? - It is only what happened to slip out, I know it was October, because I was bound that day.</p>
               <p>What words did Patch make use of? - He knocked me down, and demanded my money or my life.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He demanded my money or my life.</p>
               <p>He said some words to you? - He demanded my money or my life.</p>
               <p>But I want to know, in what words he demanded it, what were the very words he said? - These were the very words he said, he expressed it in that manner, he came up and gave me a blow and knocked me down, and says he, your money or your life.</p>

             and I went and said, where is the money you took from the lad; says he, I have got non e; says I, you have, says he, I have only seven or eight shillings, that is all I took from them, I am sure that was what he said, we walked along with him, and asked him what he was, he said, he was a scamp, and if he was at liberty, he would let us know what he was.</p>
               <p>Court. What does that mean? - About our way, they call it a thief.</p>
               <p>What, he said so himself? - Yes, says he, I believe you are going to take me to Green's, we said, yes, we went to the Lebeck's-head, and he pulled out some silver and halfpence, and laid it on the table, and said, that was all he had; Mr. Rosewell, the Justice's clerk, was drinking in that house or the next; they took him into the back room and searched him, and the guinea fell from under his shirt.</p>
               <p>Did you see that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The two prisoners run very fast? - They were running from us.</p>
               <p>It was the boys Harrington and Rollings that were stamping with their feet? - Yes, about three or four minutes, they had got three or four hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Did they get out of sight of the boys before Patch was stopped? - Near a quarter of a mile out of sight.</p>
               <p>How soon after was it, before Rollings came up to you? - We brought him back to Rollings, I never saw the lads before.</p>
               <p>How long had they been playing the rogue together before this happened? - I do not know, I saw them altogether, when I saw them first; it was only while I was making the thread fast; I saw neither of them knocked down, I saw none of them down.</p>
               <p>How often have you seen Harrington since? - Only once, about a fortnight ago, he is bad they tell me.</p>
               <p>Who told you so? - Rollings.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath Mr. Burton, what was that that Rollings said to you, abot the reward yesterday, in the hearing of Forreter, at the Pitt's head? - He said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Mind what you say, what conversation passed yesterday upon the subject of the reward? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Did Rollings say any thing about the reward? - I never heard, I did hear, I never knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard that there was a reward of eighty pounds for convicting these boys, blood money, perhaps you know that better? - No, Sir, I never heard it, nor do not know it.</p>
               <p>Court. Speak with caution, now give it an answer, after you have considered it? - Upon my oath, I never heard of no such thing.</p>

               <p>Nor have never heard it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Why young man, have you never heard at any time or from any body, that there was a reward for convicting of highway-men? - No, Sir, I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Nor you never heard there was to be any reward for convicting these two young men? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Why do you hesitate so much? - Mr. Green's clerk told me I should be paid for my trouble for coming up, for my day's work.</p>
               <p>How long have you attended this business as a witness? - Three days, and Monday at Hick's-hall.</p>
               <p>Who has paid your expences? - Forrester.</p>
               <p>Did Rollings run after these two prisoners at all before you pursued them? - I saw them running, both Rollings and young Harrington running after the other, they began to run when we began to run, and not before.</p>

               <p>After you said to him, or before you said to him, we will pursue them, had either of you asked any questions of the other two lads? - Yes, I asked them what they had robbed him of, and they said 28 s.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me just now, that you had taken no notice of the other two lads? - When I first looked, I saw two boys, which were Rollings and Harrington, they were crying out, stop thief! the boys were doing nothing but running and crying stop thief.</p>
               <p>When did you first see the other two? - We saw them after we had asked the boys what they were robbed of, then we saw the other men running across the field.</p>
               <p>And Burton and you took different ways? - We took different ways, I ran up the field that I work in, and the other up a gentleman's ground; I pursued Patch, and a man held up his stick, and I ran and caught him by the collar directly; the two boys remained in the ground that we worked in, we were three hundred yards off the boys when we stopped Patch.</p>
               <p>Then the two boys did not pursue at all after you and Burton? - No, not after we were gone.</p>

               <p>You walked quietly back again, I suppose? - They were at the upper end of the grounds, they had not a quarter of a mile to go, it might be between six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>What were the two boys doing? - I cannot tell, Patch and the other lad ran abreast of each other, one ran before, the other behind, but they were near together; one parted from Patch, and made off another way.</p>
               <p>How many days have you been attending here? - Three days.</p>

As soon as I spoke to them at the tail of the cart, they dropped my fork immediately, and came up to me, the other came before me, and lifted a stick over my head, and swore if I did not deliver my money, he would dash my brains out; I pulled out my purse, containing four guineas and two shillings and sixpence; one of the guineas I can swear to, as I had refused it: the moon was up, but it was rather cloudy, I am punctual to the prisoner Williams, as to Hanks, he stood rather behind me, I had very little sight of him, I should not care to say any thing about Hanks, as he was behind me; they followed on the outside, and followed some time, and swore I had more money, I told them I had an iron key, and they should have it if they would, and they demanded it immediately; they said, damn your eyes, here is your dung-fork; I ran on, I did not come back for it, I ran on to where I was to sleep, I left my team, and went to the door and called the landlord and the hostler, the landlord and I pursued them up to Tyburn; in a very few minutes we met the patrol, and we sent two or three one way, and two or three another, and I and these two gentlemen went down the Edgware road, and there we met these two men coming along, one was at a distance from the other eight or ten yards: I suppose it was near upon an hour upon the Edgware road that we met them; they went away over the field for the Edgware road, they went over the hedges and ditches; as soon as we met Williams, I says to one of these gentlemen, that is the man I am sure that robbed me; we took them into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080055"/> tallow-chandler's shop there, that gentleman pulled out my money, the four guineas, and two sixpences, four bad shillings, and three pence, a key, and a knife; Williams had the money, the man that took it from me; as soon as he pulled out the money, I said that is my guinea, I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>On the 10th of November in the morning between four and five my house was broke open, I had not been long asleep, I did not come home till late, and I heard a noise as if some panes were broke, I listened a little while before I went down, my wife went down directly, she thought it was the china broke, I heard her go to the maid, and say, you nasty toad you have not shut the outer door; no madam, says she, I did not, there are two doors, one was upon the latch, and the other was open, she came up stairs again and came to bed; in a little while the maid came up to me, and called Master, Master, I am robbed, I dressed myself, and went down directly, and in the little breakfast room towards the garden, I found every thing was taken away, and the small silver that was left behind, and the china were moved on the floor; then we went to the fore parlour, there was broke one clothes press, and one corner cupboard, the glass broke, but nothing taken out from there, they took out a mahogany drawer full of clothes, and they were every hit taken away, and after that we began to search about the house, and we found in the back part, which was a little open, about seven feet deep under a gateway, an old sash about seven foot high, which gave light, that was cut across with a knife, and the wall in the middle was broke through, so that a man could get through by all means; then I searched about the house, and I found an old black coat, the thief had cloathed himself in my clothes, and left all his old clothes behind, and in this coat I found a letter which a man in Clerkenwell wrote to his wife in Hatton Garden; I sent my son and another down to the workhouse, to make an enquiry in consequence of this letter, whether there was such a woman in the workhouse, and I went to Justice Green, and he gave an order for two of his officers to go and fetch the man from Clerkenwell; I knew the man when he was brought to my house, he lodged in my house nine months before, I believe for seven or eight weeks.</p>

               <p>Look at these buckles? - As to knowing the buckles I do not, I did not sell them; on the 10th of November, to the best of my knowledge, the prisoner came to our house in the morning with a pair of silver salts gilt inside, an old fashion milk pot, a pepper box, and three odd tea spoons, the whole amounted to two pounds fifteen shillings, I was behind the counter, and reckoned them up; we estimated the value by the weight; the salts being foreign made, was four and ten pence, and the rest of the plate being hall marked, was five shillings; I did not know him before, we asked him how he came by them, and he was very much affronted at it, he said they were his own property, he brought them from Gibralter, he said he should hardly bring them for sale, if they were not his property, he bought a pair of shoe and knee buckles, to the best of my remembrance it was the prisoner at the bar, and a gold breast buckle.</p>
               <p>Can you upon your oath positively swear that the prisoner was the person? - No Sir, I think it is, but I cannot swear to him, I did not take particular notice of him, I was reckoning up, I do really think it is the same man, I cannot positively swear to him.</p>

               <p>- WEST sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a coachman, I was on foot when I saw this, coming by the Bell Savage Inn on Ludgate-hill, between six and seven, I cannot say to a minute, I saw five or six men behind the carriage, I thought the man had a restive horse that they were pushing behind, and in half a minute I saw the man take the trunk from the carriage, three or four were helping it on the shoulders of one, I called out to the coachman, but he did not hear me; I stept about two or three steps to them and made an alarm; I called out, you have taken the trunk from the gentleman's carriage and you shall not have it, and they dropped it on the edge of the stones, and after they had dropped the trunk, they shuffled round one another, and I called, stop thief! and the witness Warren ran up and caught the prisoner, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish any of these four or five men that were round the carriage? - That was one of the men that was with them, the man that had the trunk in his arms was a taller man, he was not the man on whom they were putting it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was a dark night? - No, it was not very dark.</p>
               <p>Did you see his face? - Yes, I saw them all, they were round me when I spoke, the prisoner was brought back in a minute to the shop door where we threw the trunk in, and I said that was one of the men, he was dressed as he is now, only he had a silk handkerchief tied round his neck.</p>
               <p>Were people going by at the time, or was the street quiet? - There were plenty of people walking on both sides of the way, I suppose there were thirty or forty people round the carriage, when I called stop thief, in an instant.</p>
               <p>How long did you see them round the carriage? - Not half a minute.</p>
               <p>You had not observed the young man at the bar till the people ran after, and you cried out stop thief? - Yes, I had, the people were all round.</p>
               <p>Several of them ran, after the people ran away? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know the direct contrary, that a great number of the bye-standers ran after those they supposed thieves? - I stood by the trunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080063"/>Answer my question upon you oath; do not you know, that great numbers of the bye-standers, as well as Mr. Warren, ran after those they supposed to be thieves? - I cannot say whether they did or not, I know that the men that were taking the trunk all run.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it Mr. Warren run after these people, or did other people run? - Mr. Warren, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That will not do, I will not be so answered; do you mean to swear that nobody but Warren run after these men? - There might be.</p>
               <p>Do you not know that there were? - I do not know, there might be other people run probably.</p>
               <p>Court. Then why did not you say that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you always been in this story, Mr. West? - Yes, Sir, I speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Yes, yes, I know you do, that is for the Jury to judge of though a little; you have always told the same story when you have been talking about this robbery? - I saw that he was one of the men that was there, and run away.</p>
               <p>Have you always said that, Mr. West? - I do not know what you mean, I never was on such an affair.</p>
               <p>Yes, you have. - No, never.</p>
               <p>Have you always given the same account? - I do not know but I have, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Then I will help you a little; you have always swore positively to the prisoner, do you remember being examined before my Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember my Lord Mayor asking you, if somebody had not bribed you for the prisoner? - Yes, because I was loth to swear.</p>
               <p>Then you did not swear to him? - I swore that he was in company.</p>
               <p>Mind what you are about, Sir, as I know the Short-hand Writer will take down very accurately what you say, for I promise you shall hear of it again. - He was one of the people.</p>
               <p>I ask you this, did you, before the Lord Mayor, swear he was one of the persons? - He was one of the people round the carriage.</p>
               <p>Did you swear so before the Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively that the prisoner is one of the persons? - One of the persons.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you swear that before the Lord Mayor? - I could not swear that he was the man that took the trunk from the carriage, I swore that he was one of the men that was round there, and that he ran away, and that Mr. Warren took him back.</p>
               <p>Did you swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to swear, Sir, now, that was the account you gave before the Lord Mayor? - As near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Let us have something positive, some one thing that we can lay hold of that is not true; did you before the Lord Mayor say, he was one of the men? - I could not swear positive he was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Did you swear that? - I did.</p>
               <p>You mean now to swear positively, that you told the Lord Mayor he was one of the five or six? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it induced the Lord Mayor to ask you, if you was not bribed by the prisoner, was not it because you would not swear positively to him, and because you equivocated so much? - My Lord told me I was upon a right cause, and told me to speak the truth; I told him I would.</p>
               <p>Then you did not first swear positively to the young man at the bar? - I swore he was one of the five or six, I would not swear at once.</p>
               <p>How soon after the trunk was stolen was you at the Lord Mayor's? - The next morning.</p>
               <p>Then you could not swear positively that he was one of the five or six? - I could swear that he was one of the five or six that ran away; my Lord Mayor asked me if I had been bribed or threatened, I told him I had not, I said I could not swear he was the man that took the trunk, but that he was in company.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080064"/>Have not you told th e Lord Mayor, that you could not swear positively that he was there? - I knew he was there, and saw him run.</p>
               <p>I must have an answer? - It is clear he was there, by the mens bringing him back; I meant I could not say he was the man that took the trunk.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, say to the Lord Mayor, he was one of the five or six persons? - That was what my Lord Mayor made me swear.</p>
               <p>My Lord Mayor cautioned you to speak the truth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had not you hesitated a little about this young man being one of the party? - I could not swear he was the young man that took the trunk.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the last day of November, I was going down Ludgate-hill in the evening (I live in Stationers-alley ) I saw two or three men following a post-chaise, I rather made a bit of a stop to look, and went on a little further, and I saw the same men brush by me, and one of them said, damn my eyes it will do; and I saw them run into the highway, after the post-chaise, I immediately crossed the way, and run up Ludgate-hill after them; and just before I got to them, I saw the person that was examined just now, had hold of the handle of the trunk, and they were all round the trunk, five or six men; and he said, they should not have it; they had taken it from the post-chaise that went up the hill, and he said your are all thieves, and he cried stop thief! and they all run away; and I ran after the prisoner and took him.</p>
               <p>Court. When all these people were about West, was the prisoner one of those? - He was one that was amongst them, and as soon as he cried stop thief he ran off, and I ran after him and took him; I am confident he was one of the five or six.</p>
               <p>Did you see him quit West and run off? Yes, I did, and he run up against the side of a house, and went to creep under a woman's elbow that I might miss him, but I took him.</p>
               <p>Did you never lose sight of him, till you took him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How far might he run before you seized him? - Three, four, or five doors at the most.</p>
               <p>Was there a croud of people, or was he single? - Just as he hallooed out you are all thieves, I got as near to them as I am to this table, then I run after him and took him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take it for granted, you do not mean to say, that all the persons that were round West, were concerned in the intention of robbing the chaise? - They might be drawn by curiosity, but I think their intention was to hoist off the box; I saw two or three of them behind the chaise, I really think they wore all of them concerned; there were a good number of persons round.</p>
               <p>It was very dark? - No, Sir, there were very great lights from two shops in particular, I saw no other person running after him; some run across the way, some up the hill, and he turned round and run down the hill.</p>
               <p>(The box produced and the things deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I was coming from Fleet-market, and was going to Friday-street to an acquainance, I saw a great croud of people round this trunk, and I stopped, and this gentleman came and laid hold of me, and took me into a shop; I told him I would go with him any where, I have no witnesses, because I did not know of being tried to day, they told me in Newgate I should not be tried.</p>

               <p>What did you sell her to him for? - I had a pig of him, and the difference was about two guineas, I was to give him a guinea and a half for the pig, and he gave me half a guinea and took the mare.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Chaddick, do you know what you have been swearing all this time? - Swearing!</p>
               <p>Aye, swearing that this horse was not worth a guinea? - I would not have had him of a gift.</p>
               <p>How came you to sell him for so much? - He charged me rather too much for the pig, and I charged him rather too much for the mare.</p>
               <p>I suppose you gave a guinea and a half for a pig, that was not worth nineteen shillings? - I believe he charged me too much for the pig.</p>
               <p>And how come you to sell it? - It did not suit me, as soon as I see them I can tell whether they are workmen or no.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the horse-dealing line? - I only buy for my own use.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that horse was not worth a guinea? - I do not say he was not worth a guinea.</p>
               <p>But you have said it was not a cheap horse at two guineas? - No Sir, and the owner will say so.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you hear the horse had been stolen? - I believe it was seven or eight days before I heard of it.</p>
               <p>Do you usually buy horses in this way? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Of a stranger in the road and know nothing about him? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did he come to your house to take the money? - No, Sir, he took it at the house where he used to sleep at, he sent for me.</p>
               <p>And took the money before witnesses? - Yes, he was at his dinner, other people present, and two days after the sale he took the money for the horse.</p>
               <p>Has this young man been employed in conducting strings of horses, as they are called, to this town? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any other witnesses? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is no evidence at all, there is no proof, that this horse that this man bought is the same horse.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Lucas, on the 29th of October about five, there were two plate warmers in the shop for sale, in about a quarter of an hour after a woman called into the shop, Sir! somebody has robbed you; I went out and met the last witness, and the prisoner with a plate warmer, it is Mr. Lucas's; there were two in the shop, and there was one missing, they were not marked, they had not been long come in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shall not presume to trouble the Court with a defence after this evidence, but I trust in your Lordship; I did not know that my trial would come on, though there are many respectable people in the Court I believe that know me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for the Prisoner. You did not find any offensive weapons on this young man? - Nothing at all, on searching the prisoner I found a gold seal and key, we found nothing else upon him.</p>

               <p>Had you any thing fastened to the ribband besides the seal and key? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>What was the impression on the seal? - I believe it is a Shakespeare's head, but I will not swear to it, the key is an upright<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080071"/> key, there has been a hook in the key originally, which is broke out, and which I think made the key particular, as I could safely swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that key? - This is the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Davis. Begnigge-wells we all know is a place much frequented by young gentlemen that are in business in town? - It is.</p>
               <p>Is it usual, when they stay late, to make parties to come home together? - I never go into the room, but many people go home together.</p>

               <p>What did you lose? - I had about two or three shillings in my pocket, and some halfpence, a particular rule with tables upon it, and two glass drops in my pocket, one of which was off; there was an old knife, and there was a paper of tacks, and a particular bad half-penny, there was a piece of the side of the woman off the left hand as she fits, it is a base metal half-penny; I had a little favourite dog followed them, and kept barking at them, and I told my wife I would follow them; I pursued them fifteen or twenty yards distance, and kept sight of them, they kept together and kept the foot path, and I heard them at last say hush, and several little trifling words; after sometime following them softly, I heard the patrol, I saw three men meet him, I heard one of the patrol whom I know by the gruffness of his voice, say who are you? I then went up and said, you are the man that robbed me; I then told the patrol to hold them, and they took them to the public house and searched them; and Tabbs said to me, when they were taken, we did not use you ill, did we, I told him not so much as he might think of, for my wife was almost dead; then they were searched, and upon Shaw there was the bill of a sale, part of it, and it seemed as if it had been torn, and the bad half-penny; on Tubbs and Buttledoze, I believe the rest of the property was found, but I was not in the room while they searched them.</p>
               <p>Then by your account, these men kept together, and never were out of your sight till the patrol stopped them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did these persons overtake you, or meet you? - Overtook me when they were coming down the hill, they were coming the same way that we were, but walked very quick, we were going from town to Pancras.</p>
               <p>I was a very hazy night you say? - Not very, it was rather darkish, we could see the lamps, Tabbs first laid hold of me, I know Shaw's face, for he on a white drabish coat.</p>
               <p>If you had seen the parties, any of them next day, should you have known them? - Yes, if I had seen the faces of them I might; but I did not see the faces of any of them when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>It was about ten? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A great many of the Bagnigge-wells people were on the road I suppose? - I met the foot patrol a few minutes before, I saw no other persons.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect to a certainty, the number of persons that were about you and your wife? - Yes, I should think there must be more rather than less.</p>
               <p>And you ventured to follow these five fellows, whosoever they were, that robbed you, at the distance of fifteen yards? - I did, my wife at the same time said to me, they would turn round and murder me, I said, if they turned round I could run faster than they.</p>
               <p>What for the sake of two shillings? - Perhaps to have them punished for frightening my wife, for she has since had a dead child on the occasion, I did not lose sight of them at all.</p>
               <p>It seems you was under some suspicion from the patrol yourself? - I have come that way late.</p>
               <p>They never took you to any place of safety? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Did any of them attempt to escape of this cluster that you followed? - No, they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080073"/> all close together, they made no attempt to escape, they had no notion of my being so near them, I saw no other persons coming on the road.</p>
               <p>If any person met them, could you see through them? - They could not meet them, because I was so close to them, none of them were out of my sight.</p>

               <p>Was you, who was behind your husband, near enough to see them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they ever get out of your sight before the patrol met them? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they keep all together? - They seemingly kept together, they were very merry and jovial till the patrol met them, and my husband said, that he heard one of the patrol's voices, and he immediately ran after them.</p>
               <p>Did they remain so in your sight, that you could see whether they continued in the same party, or whether some went off and others came? - No, they all continued in the same party, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You have only a general recollection of their faces? - No more.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing any persons cross over the way, about the time that the patrol surrounded the parties that you followed? - No.</p>
               <p>To your knowledge or observation, did any person meet them, or in any direction come near them? - No, Sir, none that I observed, not one.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol, I stopped these men near the Bull, Battle-bridge, near the rope walk belonging to Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>Did you meet them, or follow them? - Met them, we had just come down from Pancras, there were four of us, and we four met them five; there were three first, and two directly after them, not five yards from them, partly altogether, as they could come along upon the foot path; we suspected them, we immediately surrounded them, and took them to the Bull, at Battle-bridge, and searched them; but before we got to the public house, up came Mr. and Mrs. Francis, and said, they had been robbed, I searched Buttledoze, and on him I found this knife, under his stockings and breeches; the prosecutor owned the knife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did you take Buttledoze? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. This seems to be the very knife I used to have in my pocket, here is a very trifling mark at this end, I have taken notice of the knife; I found it going to Pancras, and I had a thought of engraving my name upon it, but I do not attempt to swear it, it is only like that which I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take notice of that flaw at the end of it? - I think I did, to the best of my knowledge, and I have known it for three or four months; I think I might, but I will not be positive, I took notice of no mark on the blade of it, I cannot say positively, but to the best of my knowledge it is mine.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of November last, I and three more of the patrol met the prisoners at the bar all together, as close as they could walk; we surrounded them and took them, and just as we had taken them, the prosecutor and his wife came up just behind them; he said, hold them fast, they have just robbed me and my wife; we took them into the Bull, at Battle-bridge, and I searched Tabbs, and found this rule and two drops, and two papers of little tacks, which the prosecutor swears to be his property; I searched Harris, there was nothing found upon him that the prosecutor owned.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This particular rule I know to be mine by the tables, a pence-table, a multiplication table, and a numeration table; I never have seen another like it, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080074"/> makes me think it is mine, there may be others like it, but I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Court. This is not so uncommon as the knife by far, there are hundreds such as that; from the general appearance of it, do you believe it to be your's? - I do, these two glass drops, one of them has a little eye off it, we were working at them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not find any offensive weapon on Shaw? - No.</p>
               <p>Or any knife? - No, only a common walking stick.</p>

               <p>How many sticks had they got among them? - Two or three.</p>
               <p>Court to Francis.

               <p>Is that the paper? - This is the paper, I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>The Indictment was opened by Mr. Silverster, and the Case by Mr. Sollicitor General, as follows.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury. I must upon this occasion bespeak your most serious attention, inasmuch as this case is of infinite importance to the public, being the first of the kind, and having very extensive consequences; but when I call your attention to the importance of the case, I do it simply for the purpose of fixing that attention, and in no degree to raise your resentment; far be it from me to do so, for I need not tell you, what you already know; that there cannot be any thing of equal importance to the life of a subject; yet as the public good is so materially interested in this case, I am to request a degree of your attention, and perhaps a little more than is necessary in many ordinary cases: you Gentlemen very well know, that the legislature has thought it necessary to impose a duty on receipts for all sums exceeding forty shillings, and not exceeding twenty pounds. The charge against the prisoner is, that he exposed to sale, or sold, a number of counterfeit receipts amounting to three or four thousand, importing the payment of a twopenny duty according to act of parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080077"/>Gentlemen, it is very plain that if such a fraud as this is not vigilantly checked in its commencement, the security of people's affairs will be very bad indeed, because if their receipts are not legally and properly stamped, they can be no evidence against a second demand; you easily see therefore, how very extensive the mischief must be, and now if a well proved instance should be laid before you, you will give it the attention it deserves, because in the present hour there hardly has been any inducement to counterfeit stamps whatever; stamps are things not very often used by a man in the course of his lifetime, therefore no extraordinary sale was expected, but now that every one for his own security must have a great number by him, consequently very large parcels might be forged, and may be sold: in the next place, the price for which they were sold is infinitely below the value for such a number of such stamps; for you will find, that these amounting to between three and four thousand were sold for fourteen guineas, not half the value; you see the temptation to persons to purchase them at half price, and afterwards to sell them to others: such is the nature of the crime with which this prisoner is charged, such is the mischief, and consequently such the necessity of the board to lay before a Court and Jury, the first clear instance in which it has been detected; when I say clear instance Gentlemen, you will naturally suppose I speak from my instructions; it is for you to decide; but according to the evidence in my hand, if it turns out according to my expectations, I think not much doubt will remain on your minds of the guilt of the prisoner.

Mrs. Gabriel did not very well understand the meaning of that expression; she asked him what he meant, his answer was, that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080078"/> stamps came from Dunstable, and he must send the guinea and the things that he had purchased there; this occasioned in her mind, a considerable degree of doubt about these stamps; she asked him if they were good, he told her they were: between seven and eight he came again the same day, and brought the remainder of the stamps, making together three thousand and some hundred; when they began to talk about price, he insisted on twenty pounds, she refused, but she paid him nine guineas and a half and some silver; this with the sum paid before, amounted in the whole to fourteen guineas; he told her he was going to the country, but might be heard of at the Bull Inn in Holborn; Mrs. Gabriel afterwards finding that these stamps were all bad, on Sunday evening she delivered them to her servant

Gentlemen, it will be necessary for me, having stated this shortly to you, to call the witnesses; this case must be introduced, by proving to you the commission under which the officers of the stamps act, next their order to make such stamps, and then that that stamp was used for such purposes, and that these stamps are not the genuine stamps struck by this instrument, so made from proper authority, that authority too bottomed on an act of parliament. Gentlemen this is a short state of the case, and if it is proved to your satisfaction, you will then be under the disagreeable necessity of finding the prisoner guilty; on the other hand, he will undoubtedly receive from the Court that protection, which every man on his trial has a right to, and I have no sort of doubt but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080079"/> you will do that duty to the public on the one hand, and to the individual on the other, which is necessary for the administration of public justice, and peculiarly necessary in a case carried on by public prosecution.</p>

               <p>Did you give him that guinea? - I did, I asked him then three or four times if they were good, and he said they were very good.</p>
               <p>When did you next see the prisoner? - He came between day and night the same evening, and before I paid him the money, I asked him if they were good, and he said he would hang as high as Haman if they were not, I paid him the whole money, fourteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards discover any thing particular about these stamps? - I enquired several times, and shewed them to several people, and they said they were good.</p>

            , with these stamps to the Bull, to see if he was there.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you he came from the country? - He said he came from the country, and was going there again directly, but was to be found at the Bull Inn in Holborn, on the Sunday following, or any Sunday, I told the maid to go to the Bull, and ask for Holland Farmer, that was the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>When did you first learn that these stamps were bad? - About Thursday.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the stamps? - She took them with her.</p>
               <p>Who put up these stamps for her, who packed them up at the time you gave them to the maid? - I did, I took them from the prisoner's handkerchief, and put them into my own handkerchief, I saw the prisoner no more till he was taken.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I do not know rightly the day of the month when he was taken, it was just a week after I sent my maid with these stamps to the Bull.</p>
               <p>Court. This man was a stranger to you, only saying he came recommended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do you deal in? - In old clothes.</p>
               <p>What occasion had you for such a number as three thousand stamps? - For to sell them again.</p>
               <p>You bought them as two-penny stamps? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Did you know how much three thousand two-penny stamps were worth? - I did not reckon it up.</p>
               <p>You know that two-pence must have been paid for each of these stamps, if they were genuine? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He asked you at first I think twenty guineas, there was three thousand some odd hundred? - About seven or eight hundred.</p>
               <p>Then how could you suppose if these stamps were good, that the man could sell them for less than they must cost himself? - That I do not know, I bought them to get something by them.</p>
               <p>Yes, but how came you to suppose that this man would take less for these stamps than he himself had paid for them? - I do not know what he had paid for them.</p>

               <p>Continuation of the Trial of Holland Palmer.</p>
               <p>You understand my question, but you do not like to answer it; how could you suppose that this man would come to sell stamps to you for less than he paid for them himself? - I do not know, I am sure.</p>
               <p>You supposed them to be good when you bought them, did not you? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>And you knew if they were good, he could not have got them for less than two-pence apiece? - He said he had them from the country.</p>
               <p>But you knew they would come to twenty-five pounds; then unless you supposed these stamps were either forged, or stolen, how could you suppose that he would take fourteen guineas, which was not a great deal more than a penny apiece? - I do not know, he said he got them of a friend in the country.</p>
               <p>But that friend could not have come by them honestly? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You did not trouble your head how he came by them, or whether they were forged or stolen, for he could not himself have got them for less than twenty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My head is so very bad, I have had a blow by some of the prisoners, I told her husband my name was Farmer, and that this man sent me to sell them for him, I never was at the Bull Inn, in Holborn, in my life.</p>

               <p>What day of the week was it? - I believe it was on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him there, did you hear him say any thing? - He brought some stamped papers.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what number? - It was a great many, he wanted to sell them to my mistress, Mrs. Gabriel, and she bought them.</p>
               <p>What passed between your mistress and him, when you first saw him there? - She bought the stamps.</p>
               <p>What was she to give for them? - When she gave him the last money, she said that makes fourteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Remember you are upon your oath, you have swore falsly already.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080083"/>Mr. Wilson. Do you know how many there were? - No, there were a great number.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing about the number? - No, I did not, I saw him backwards three or four times, he came three or four times in one day once, but I cannot rightly tell what day it was; he was once there, and she gave him two or three guineas, I do not know which, he bought some clothes at our house, he bought a hat, and handkerchief, and stockings, and a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>You do not remember particularly any conversation, otherwise than that your mistress bought these things? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you ever these things? - My mistress found they were good for nothing, and she sent me to bring them to the Bull Inn, in Holborn, that was the Sunday about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you go with them? - Yes, I went with them, and at the bottom of Chick-lane I was stopped.</p>
               <p>Who stopped you? - Lucas.</p>
               <p>Did he afterwards let you go to the Bull Inn? - No, he took me to prison.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner at the bar after? - I saw him at Guildhall, no where else.</p>
               <p>Court. What did your mistress desire you to do with them at the Bull in Holborn? - I was to ask for Holland Farmer, and to leave them there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She tells the same story as her mistress. Did you hear me mention any thing of the Bull in Holborn? - Yes, he said at our house, you may always find me at the Bull, in Holborn, of a Sunday night.</p>

            ? - On Sunday evening, the 17th of October, about half past seven.</p>
               <p>Where did you stop her? - At the bottom of Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>How came you to stop her? - Seeing her have a bundle under her arm; I stopped her as a suspicious person, and asked her what she had got there, she said she had not got any thing; I said she had, and took the bundle from under her arm; I then went into the publick house to see what she had got, I went into a back room, and opened this small bag, it contained a quantity of stamps, lapped up in a handkerchief, there was nearly four thousand. (Two little bundles given into the Court, and opened.) In consequence of finding these stamps upon her, I asked her where she got them, and she would not give any answer where she lived, therefore I took her up to St. Giles's watch-house, suspecting there had been a robbery or forgery, and the next day I took her before the Magistrate, in Hyde-street, Bloomsbury, she then would not tell the Magistrate where she lived; the next morning her mistress, Mrs. Gabriel, heard she was taken into custody, and before the Magistrate, and she came; this was on the Tuesday morning following.</p>
               <p>How came Mrs. Gabriel there, do you know? - I really cannot tell, except it was from hearing that I had been down Chick-lane, and hearing from the publick house.</p>
               <p>What morning did she come? - On the Tuesday following, Mrs. Gabriel then told the Magistrates, Justice Walker and Justice Brittle, that if they would admit Abrahams an evidence for the Crown, she would tell who the man was that she had got the stamps from; accordingly, Abrahams was sworn an evidence, and then Mrs. Gabriel said, that the man was in custody in the city, before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>What passed there? - The prisoner confessed before my Lord Mayor, the selling the stamps to Mrs. Gabriel, I heard him, he said so once or twice before my Lord Mayor, in my Lord Mayor's presence, he said he did not deny selling the stamps to Mrs. Gabriel, but he believed them to be good stamps.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say, you say he confessed selling the stamps? - He said very little, he wished for a little more time, and that he would tell us where the stamps was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080084"/>Prisoner. No, Mr. Lucas, not where the stamps was.</p>
               <p>Lucas. I am not positive to what he said, farther than in saying that he was concerned with one Jones.</p>
               <p>Court. You told me just now, he confessed before the Lord Mayor, selling the stamps to Mrs. Gabriel, that, shortly stated, goes all the length against the prisoner; now you say, you cannot tell what he said. - No further than his being connected with one Jones.</p>
               <p>In what words? - He said, he sold some stamps to Mrs. Gabriel, which he believed to be good, and that he had about eight pounds in cash, and the remainder in clothes; he said that in the presence of my Lord Mayor and several people; when I went with him to the counter, he said he would tell us the person concerned in these stamps, which was one Jones, of Dunstable, and a man named Mich. that lived somewhere about Old-street, or Clerkenwell, and if we would come, he would tell us the particulars of it, that they were concerned in the stamps, and that they had given them to him to be disposed of: these are the same stamps that I took from Abrahams.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had that woman any thing else with her at the time of the stamps? - Yes, she had a piece of melted silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I had sold some stamps, but I could not tell that they were them.</p>
               <p>(The stamps shewn to Mr. Major.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Major. They are forged, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Lucas. Did he say for what money he sold the stamps? - He said it was part in cash, and the remainder in clothes, at the same time.</p>
               <p>Did he specify what the clothes were to come to? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I did not say at the time I was taken, that there was a person present at the time I had these stamps delivered to me? - I really do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. The charge against you, is for selling these stamps, knowing them to be counterfeit; now observe, though it may be true that you received them to sell for somebody else, yet if it appears that at the time you sold them you knew them to be counterfeited, that will not avail you in your defence.</p>

            , on Sunday the 17th of October, about the hour of seven or eight, we thought her a suspicious person, and she was very loth to part with the bag from under her arm, Mr. Lucas took her to the publick house, the corner of Field-lane; then he said, why, these are stamps, either the Stamp Office is broke open, or it is a forgery; he took her into custody: I was not at the taking the prisoner; the prisoner said he had them from one Jones and Mich. to sell, and that he carried them to Mrs. Gabriel's, near Chick-lane, and he carried the money and the clothes back to the Horse-shoe again to this man; he said he had about eight pounds in money, and some clothes, but the whole sum I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. When he gave this account before the Lord Mayor, of where he had these things, did he say that he knew them to be stamps? - He was ordered to go back to the prison, and he said he would make a full discovery of the people; he said if we would go to Dunstable, to the Swan, there we should find a full confession of the whole.</p>
               <p>Court to Brettell. Was you present when the prisoner was examined at Guildhall? - I was, he was asked how he came by them, he said he had made an acquaintance with two men, who informed him they should have occasion to employ him on some occasion, and that some time after that, he met a man of the name of Mich. somewhere about Clerkenwell, and he gave him these stamps.</p>
               <p>Recollect his expression? - That he had given him these stamps that he had sold or delivered to Mrs. Gabriel.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080085"/>Did he say what the bundle contained? - I am sure he said the stamps; he was asked how he came to know these two people, he said he was a watchmaker, and took a house at Dunstable, that Jones came pretty frequently to Dunstable, and he did not know where he lived, but if he was at liberty, he was sure he could find them both: he wished much to have his liberty, he said he left Dunstable after he found he could not live as a watchmaker, and that he met Mich. about Clerkenwell, that Mich. gave him these stamps, and recommended him to sell them to Mr. Gabriel in particular, and that he received for them about eight pounds ten shillings, he recollected the different sums, and cast them up in his mind, and the waistcoat that was then on his back.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say any thing in your hearing, expressing his own knowledge what these stamps were, as to their value? - No, he did not, he neither said he did or did not know.</p>
               <p>Did he ever say what price Mich. had desired him to ask for them? - No, he did not, he said the money he had received for them he delivered to them, and had had nothing for his pains but that waistcoat.</p>

               <p>What was he taken up for? - Mr. Gabriel came to my house, and told me to come with him; I went with him to Houndsditch, and the prisoner was coming along, and I laid hold of him, says I, I have a charge against you for making some stamps, and for selling them; says he, cannot we go to a public house, I told him it was not in my power to take him to the public house, I must take him to my Lord; says he, Mr. Gabriel gave me such a small quantity of money for the property, it will be the means of bringing us both into a hobble, unless he makes it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O, my God! thou wicked villain! as they laid hold of me, says I, what is it for, and he said he could not tell.</p>
               <p>Levy. And he told me I should go to the other side of Moorfields, and I should meet a man, one Mich. an Irishman, a lusty man, at the house of one Fitzpatrick; Catchpole went along with me, but we did not find him.</p>

               <p>Levy. I asked the prisoner how he came by them, he said they were brought out of the country, and brought to him to sell.</p>

               <p>I live in Pump-court, White Horse Alley, Cow-lane; you know that you took the lower room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O yes, yes, I did, I did.</p>
               <p>Did he occupy any other room in the house? - He took the room, I believe it was of a Friday, to enter on the Tuesday, and the Thursday following, in the morning, the goods they brought, were taken away for rent from whence they came from, then his wife moved into another room that was cheaper, and laid upon some straw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never came to the room.</p>
               <p>Slann. About an hour after, that day, he came and asked if his wife, or his old woman was at home.</p>
               <p>Where did his wife take a room after this? - Next door, it is all belonging to us, we rent all the whole court, and he has not been seen for a fortnight, he came in a fortnight after, he used to come now and then, sometimes he came pretty often, sometimes we did not see him of a while, in particular, for six weeks he was there every day.</p>
               <p>Was you there when the officers came and searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What room did they search? - The lower room, she moved out of the garret into the lower room again.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080086"/>Was it that room that the officers searched? - Yes, I saw what was taken out, these things were taken out.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he ever in the lower room? - He took it, but he never was in it; he took a room at Ratcliffe-cross, they had some goods elsewhere, and some they moved into the lower room, and I never knew where he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. My Lord, I confess that does not bring it home to him with respect to the room.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Now this is the time for you to make your defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I hope the witnesses will be ordered out, I wish to speak without contradiction.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As to the room, I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not brought home to you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then what else is there?</p>
               <p>Court. I will state the evidence, it amounts to this, that you sold those things to Mrs. Gabriel, as you have acknowledged to the constables.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Gentlemen of the Jury may think I should certainly have gone elsewhere, and not have remained in London if I knew any thing of their being bad, I received them of Mich. and as soon as I had sold them, I returned him the money; there were two parcels, the first parcel I had two guineas for, but my memory is really treacherous with disorder, the whole that I was to sell them for, was ten guineas; if I did not get ten guineas for them, I must not sell them; I came back and told him what money they were willing to give him, which was eight pounds ten shillings, the clothes and all inclusive; I knew not the value, I never had any thing to do with receipts in my life; I have plenty of gentlemen here, I have a witn ess that was present when I received them, when I was taken I had no money, I had not sixpence.</p>
               <p>Court to Levy. You say, when you took up this man, it was upon the information of Gabriel, where did you find the prisoner? Gabriel took me into Houndsditch, and going along I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Where were you going to look for him? - He came to my house, and told me there was a person coming along Houndsditch, and I should take him into custody.</p>

               <p>Did you find any box there? - None at all, I have had the custody of these very things.</p>

               <p>What silver tankard was that? - It was a silver tankard, that had been used in India.</p>
               <p>When you went to the prisoner Benton's, what passed? - He was a gunner on board, I did not myself go in, till the officers had secured them; I went in at last and saw the prisoner, and asked him what had become of the small box of Lady Coote's plate, he first said, he knew nothing of the matter, we then told him we had seen the Jew, who had a commission for the sale of it; that he said, he had received the plate, and we had seen him, and therefore he had better own it.</p>
               <p>Be accurate to the exact words you made use of? - We told him he had better own it, or tell who was concerned with him; at the house of the prisoner, there was a piece of a handle of a saucepan found, but I do not know that it was part of that plate.</p>
               <p>Have you been able to see any part of the plate? - I saw a small tankard, the silver hookers were found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for Benton. What was your department? - Aid-de-camp.</p>
               <p>Had you packed the plate yourself? - I had not, there were several packages of plate, services of plate, but these were put in a small box.</p>
               <p>Is the tankard here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know what metal it is? - It is silver, I believe, it is India made, and there may probably be some good, some bad silver.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is not so good as the sterling plate in this country.</p>

               <p>Who packed the other chests? - The other chest was packed by Mr. Hulse, I attended them to the ship, the second mate attended them to the ship, they did not go with the small box, I carried this box myself on board the Bellmont; I had not a note for that small box, it was all delivered in the ship, then I think it was in the care of the officers.</p>
               <p>But it never was delivered in the way the chests were delivered, taking a note, or receipt for it? - No, I had not a particular receipt for this box but I had a receipt for all the things coming safe on board, and this box amongst them.

Smith, he was carpenter of the same ship, he said he came for the box, I asked him if it was for the box of china, and asked him to come in, he said it was not china, when he came in doors I asked him for the key, he said he had not the key, but the lock was good for nothing, he desired me to bring him a hammer, and I fetched him a hammer, he opened the box, and there was four dishes, two of them reached from side to side of the box, and two smaller, and there were two water plates and a cheese toaster, a saucepan, with a wooden handle, and cover, a three pint bowl and a pint bason, and a pint mug with a flat cover, the mug was remarkable, I think I should know the the mug again, if I was to see it.</p>
               <p>How much do you think that mug might be worth? - I suppose it might weigh about five ounces, I do not know the value, the larger things were tied up in two handkerchiefs, and the smaller things Green put into his pocket; Smith said at that time he had come from Benton for the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. They were carried openly in handkerchiefs, were not they? - Yes, openly and publicly, in the middle of the day.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoners, or either of them? - I was at the Britannia, and one Wood called to me, and asked me if I bought silver, I told him no, it was a thing I did not buy, but if I could get any thing by it, I would either sell or buy, he gave me directions to Benton's house, somewhere in Poplar, and I went to Benton's house, and asked to see the silver, he told me I could not then, for there was another party concerned, I appointed to be down there on the Thursday, which I think was the 16th; I could not go till the 17th, I then saw a person that was there, which was Green the prisoner at the bar, then we were all in company together, then Benton asked Green, if he was agreeable to let me have a sample, or something of the kind, and Green said all that Mr. Benton did was right, and went away; I then asked Benton for a sample, and he gave me some plate, which I took to Mr. Rutherford.</p>
               <p>When did you see any more of Benton and the plate? - I went to him in the afternoon, and I told him I thought I could sell the plate, to a silversmith in Leadenhall-street, and I would call upon him with a chaise, and he should go with me, and I would be with him about nine, or half after, I called upon him, and he put up the four dishes, a mug, and a tankard, we went to town, and baited at my father's; in the mean time I put it in a handkerchief, and took it under my arm to Mr. Godbehere's, a silversmith, in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>How much did you get in the whole for this? - Eighty one pounds, three shillings, and ten pence.</p>
               <p>Did you pay this money to Benton? - I was to pay him seventy pounds for it, I got ten pounds by it.</p>
               <p>Do you remember a tankard there? - I believe there was, it looked like one, it was all battered and bruised.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is the value of that mug? - I do not know, I am not a dealer in plate.</p>
               <p>This is the first adventure you have made in that way, upon your oath? - Yes, it is, upon my oath, and the first that I have sold by commission in this way.</p>
               <p>Who instructed you in the price you was to have in this way by commission? - No person instructed me, I did not take it at a venture, when I came to settle with Mr. Benton, I paid him up the account, which he was agreeable to, and I got that by it.</p>
               <p>You memory does not keep pace with your ingenuity at all, because you told my friend just now, that you received eighty-one pounds; upon your oath, did you tell Benton that you received eighty one-pounds? - No I did not, I told him I should expect to get something, if I sold it for him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what that something was? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you handed over seventy pounds, and told him you got a trifle by him, as you did before; what was the value of that tankard? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - No. 11, Artillery-lane, Bishopgate-street.</p>
               <p>For what purpose is it that you keep the crucible on the fire? - I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Court to Silva. Had this plate Sir Eyre Coote's arms upon it? - I do not know, I remember the water plates-and dishes had, the coat of arms upon it, and the collar as a knight of the Bath.</p>

               <p>I keep a silversmith's shop, No. 86. Cheapside, I remember Benjamin applying to me to dispose of plate, I shall be able to tell you the day by referring to my books, it was on the 18th of November, he brought some plate into the shop, he said that was to be disposed of, I asked him if it was his, he said no, he had brought it from the gunner of the Bellamont Indiaman.</p>
               <p>What were the articles of the plate which he produced? - They were two large and two small dishes, two water plates, a cheese-toaster, a saucepan, a cover and a mug.</p>
               <p>What were the value of these articles, they weighed three hundred and twenty-seven ounces and a half, for which I paid 81 l. 3 s. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Court. Had these plates and dishes Sir Eyre Coote's collar and coat of arms upon them? - Not a mark upon them.</p>
               <p>I ask that for your justification. - If it had been English plate, and had had no arms on it, I should certainly have acted otherwise; but as it was foreign plate, and the property of a gunner, whose name and place of abode I had, and he left it me to make an assay, there were several gentlemen in the shop, all the men saw it, here is a mug, it is about the same quality as Spanish dollars.</p>
               <p>There was a saucepan? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had that saucepan any handle? - It had not, I was applied to by Rutherford, and I never rested till I found it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is this mug in such a state to pass at Goldsmith's hall? - It is most certainly plate, but not having passed, it cannot be called what we deem sterling; would not venture to send it to the hall without making a separate assay.</p>

               <p>Now considering it as old plate, and not sterling, do not you think you have over valued it? - I and my clerk made an assay of the whole, and I think the dishes were worse.</p>
               <p>But you have not assayed the mug? - No, therefore I cannot tell whether it is worse or better.</p>
               <p>There is some solder about the mug? - Yes, there is very little solder in it.</p>
               <p>Court. At what value did you estimate it? - I should guess it at the present price of dollars, which go at four shillings and eleven pence halfpenny per ounce at present, I fancy it is about fifteen ounces, value 3 l. 15 s.</p>
               <p>(The mug shewn to Mr. Doveston, and deposed to by him.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean it was used in the family, or as exclusive property? - As exclusive property.</p>

               <p>I went with Macmanus, I searched his pocket and found eleven guineas and three twenty pound notes, he opened his pocket book himself, and I found this paper, an account of silver, and a card of Mr. Benjamin's address in his pocket, there were several of them in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Benjamin. Do you know this paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you give those to Benton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are they your writing, friend? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let me look at them then, for any manuscript of yours must be curious, what is this? - It is the weight of the silver as he desired, the other is the value.</p>
               <p>Mr. Doveton. The hookers are very common things in India, it is impossible to swear to them.</p>

               <p>Before that, Mr. Rhodes came to you? - Yes, Mr. Rhodes came about twelve, and said that is my cow stands there, how came you by it; I told him a young man had brought them to me in the morning, and said he brought them from Mr. Hamilton, of Holloway, that he left the cows with me, and was gone away somewhere, I did not know where; when the prisoner was taken up I was present.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said little or nothing to Mr. Rhodes, till he came before the Justice, then he said he bought them.</p>

               <p>Court to Rhodes. Where were your cattle on Thursday last? - In the fields by the half-way house, it was in the forenoon.</p>

            , I was last up in this house, I remember the doors and windows of the house were fast, there is a sash window backwards, I went to bed a little after one, I cannot tell just to a minute; we were alarmed by the watchman about three, I came down stairs and found the doors open, and the bar open, I had left it shut and locked over night, they had opened the sash over the door and come in, there were four table cloths and two aprons, that were dropped down in the passage, there were five silver spoons, and how much liquor I do not know, there were five five shillings worth of halfpence, there might be about twenty shillings in half pence and farthings, I think my husband must know the halfpence, he always makes them up himself, there was a pane of glass cut out, and the things that tasten the window were pushed out, and then the sash falls down, it was a sliding shutter the inside falls down.</p>
               <p>Was the sash open? - Yes, it was left open when we come down, there was a bolt fixed to hold up the sash that it might not fall down.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. What was this door that was left open? - A back door that leads into the passage, and then you go into the street.</p>
               <p>You say you went to bed last, do you swear positively, and are you sure that there was no door or window open when you went to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whose business was it to look round the house generally? - Mine, there never is any door or window open any night.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Shoreditch, on the morning of the 31st of October last, I saw one man, I do not know his name, at three o'clock on Sunday morning, six weeks ago, I cannot tell the month, because I am no scholar, I met him half way, in black dog alley, I saw him come out of the alley, and asked him what he wanted, he said nothing at all, he was going to make water, I went to take hold of him, and he almost shoved me down, the prisoner Hall is the person, there was a lamp at the end of the alley, I am sure Hall is the man, when I got half way down the alley, I saw him there, he said he was making water.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Hall. The Justice asked that man, if he knew the man, and he came and pointed to me, he said it was the night before last, and I was in prison at the same time.</p>
               <p>Hosier. I was then in liquor, I did not know what I was about, but I know now, they fetched me up before the Justice, but Mr. Willmot said, that man is in liquor, send him away; I am very sure and certain, I only saw him by the lamps, I kept hold of him about a minute, he shoved me off directly, I had just hold of his collar, I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>How long after? - I never saw him after, till that night, I never saw him before I saw him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the time you saw him in the alley? - I cannot say rightly, about half an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080098"/>The prisoner says it was only two days, how long was it; - Two days after, they said it was about a week, I cannot rightly tell how long it was.</p>
               <p>Was it a day, or a month? - About a day I think so.</p>
               <p>Was it the next day, you saw him at the Justice's? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that as you are of his face? - I cannot say I am sensible of it.</p>

               <p>Had you lighted candles? - Yes, then one took me into the parlour and asked me where the money was, then I heard them whistle while I was down in the passage, and I heard some man come in and chain the door, and I told them if there was any, it was in the table drawer in the parlour; then they told me they must take me down in the kitchen, that no light might be seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080105"/> on the terrace walk, and one of them staid with me in the kitchen with a loaded pistol, and two of them went up stairs, when they came down stairs, he that was in the kitchen with me went out, and they all went up stairs together to the street door to go away, then the other two men ran away, and the other man, Simmons, came down and said to me, if I did not rescue him till three o'clock, he was a dead man, and he asked me if I could not let him out at the top of the house, and I told him there was no door, and he asked me if I could not cover him with clothes, and he told me if I did not cover him with clothes, and stay with him till ten o'clock, he would blow my brains out; I went up and covered him up with two beds, then I went down and called in the people to take him: I know the prisoner Anderson, he was with us about three weeks before; the house was attempted to be robbed before, and my master asked me if I knew an honest man to sleep in the house, and I recommended Anderson as an honest man, having known him twelve years; the bureau was broke open, and some drawers up stairs, and the things mentioned in the indictment were taken. I saw no person but Simmons in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for Prisoners. Dame, how long have you lived in Mr. Powell's family? - Thirteen years.</p>
               <p>Now I remind you, you are upon your oath, and that the lives of these people are depending, take care to conceal nothing. - I have known Anderson twelve years, he has worked in his business.</p>
               <p>Have not you been very intimate with him? - I have not.</p>
               <p>How happened it that he was to dine at your father's on Sunday? - He said he had not seen the old folks a great while, and he would dine with them.</p>
               <p>Has the prisoner Anderson, in the absence of the family, slept in Mr. Powell's house? - He slept there the time the house was attempted before, he slept there with a pair of pistols loaded, and a blunderbuss; my master desired me to get an honest man.</p>
               <p>You say you did not see any of the persons that committed this robbery, except Simmons? - I think two more persons came in after the first, because I think I heard them talk.</p>
               <p>How soon after the robbery did you see Anderson? - He came about nine on that evening, and said he would sit up all night for the safety of the house, and sat there all night; at one o'clock in the morning we went round to see the state of the premises.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing in the course of that search? - Yes, I picked up a silver book in my progress through the house, in the India room.</p>
               <p>Anderson was there then? - Anderson took it out of my hand, and said he would have it, I said he should not; I can speak to it: I do not know what became of it after he had it, till the runners told me, I did not know he took it out of the house.</p>

               <p>How long after you missed it? - I missed it the next morning, when I wanted it to go to work, and Mr. Minshall sent his boy up our way to know who had lost it, because he thought it was some poor person's that could not afford to lose, and I went down there and saw it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Was the mare stole before we were in trouble; it has been found in the street since.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the mare found again? - It was found one night since, a little boy came and said she was in the street.</p>
               <p>- MINSHALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Bedford-street, Liquor-pond-street, I boil horses for the dogs; on Monday night the 8th of November, about twenty minutes or half an hour after eleven, the two prisoners brought this mare to my gate, they asked me a guinea for it, Smith was upon the back of it, and the other stood at the gate, and I asked them whose it was, and they said it was their own property, that they bought it and gave two guineas and a half for it, and they were partners in a dust cart, and had it three weeks; I looked at it, and saw it was blind, and I asked them what made them bring it at that that time of night to sell, they said it fell down under a load of dust, and they could not get it up again; I looked at it and found it was very clean, as if it had just come out of the stable; I asked them a good many more questions, and at last I asked them whether it was a horse or a mare, and they said it was a horse, I looked and found it was a mare, and I told them I suspected them, and then they used a many bad expressions, and Smith said I wanted to swindle them out of it; Smith went out under pretence to make water, and he ran up a passage and I stopped them, I sent our boy round St. Giles's, and I went round Paddington way, and our boy heard that it belonged to Mrs. Marshall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. This man is very apt to take people's lives away for the sake of the reward, he has been confined himself for the same affair three years, and has taken us up thinking to make the same of us.</p>
               <p>Court to Minshall. Have you been confined for any thing? - Once.</p>
               <p>For what? - For carrying some silk in a cart, two men hired me to carry it, and it was stolen, I was tried here for it, six or seven years ago, I was convicted and sentenced to Newgate for three years, and the horse and cart taken away.</p>
               <p>Have you ever given evidence against any horse stealers? - Yes, in the sessions before last, one that was stolen from Lewisham, and another a year and a half or two years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080108"/>What did you get in that last conviction? - Nothing at all, there is a ticket the prosecutor would not trouble himself about it.</p>
               <p>What do you expect to get by this? - Nothing at all as I know on, I have attended here ever since Tuesday week, and at Hicks's-hall, and lost my time.</p>
               <p>What are the horses that you boil up? - Dead horses, and poor ones, that are past their labour.</p>
               <p>You do not always wait till they die? - Sometimes we buy them alive in Smithfield, we deal with collar makers, and give them so much each for the meat and they have the hide back again for their own use.</p>

I said no; then he went out, and came back again; says he, I will leave the message with you; the parlour door was locked, I could not go in there, so I went up stairs, and he wrote on a paper, and he chucked it to me, there says he, can you read that, yes, says I, and he put his apron over my eyes, and he said, Charles come up; with that I tried to get the apron from over my face, and I just saw the glimpse of his coat, but I did not see him to know who he was; then they put me into the cellar, and told me if I spoke a word, so that any body could hear me, they would cut my throat for me, and while they were committing the robbery, Warner came down and asked me where my master was, I told him he was gone into Bishopsgate-street, and would be back in a quarter of an hour; I did not say he was gone to church; they took some table spoons and tea spoons, and a silver pepper box, and six china plates, and three table cloths, and seven dozen movements, they were in the shop up stairs, the others were in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>About eleven o'clock, the little boy came to my lodgings, which were in Aldersgate-street, and said there were thieves in the house; I ran after him, and he shut the street door after him, and I got in at one of the parlour windows and looked round, and the dining room had been forced, and a piece had been cut out, the back shop was broke open, because that was always locked, I had locked it myself, that door was stove open the door had been forced, and the staple fallen out; by this time the boy returned with the constable; I asked him if he knew any thing of that door being open, he said no; the people went, and I staid with the boy till Mr. Noakes came in; I ran up stairs into the shop, and I missed a deal box, and looking on the board, I saw some articles which I knew; I have a very perfect knowledge of all the movements; I immediately wrote them down on a piece of paper, and gave them to Mr. Noakes: I went the Wednesday morning to Warner's lodgings with the constable, and there was the very deal box found; it is my master's property, and which I left in the shop; locked up, on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Did you hear either of the prisoners say any thing when they were taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were any promises made to them? - Not as I know of; Warner was examined by himself first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles: I believe Warner asked the Justice if his evidence would clear him? - The Justice said he could make no promises; he said he would give very satisfactory answers to every question he asked, and the Justice asked him about the things, where they were sold, he told immediately,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080110"/> that they were sold to one Levy, a Jew, and the movements for one guinea and a half, he had received a guinea, and was to go for the rest: I was at the first examination of Johnson, but he denied every thing.</p>
               <p>Do you know the value of these movements? - They were valued at twenty pounds fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. What led to any suspicion against Warner? - Johnson was taken up on the Tuesday evening, and Warner was well known as a companion of Johnson's.</p>
               <p>Nothing was found but the deal box? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. You was at your master's house on Saturday night? - Yes, and I locked up the room, and laid the key on a table in the passage.</p>
               <p>Whether your master opened the door or not, between the Saturday and the Sunday, and removed those movements, you cannot tell? - No.</p>

               <p>Was all safe when you went out? - I do not know, I did not go up stairs; nobody could go in, I had the key in my own room; I immediately ran up stairs, and saw the box that we used to keep some unfinished work in, was taken away, and the movements gone; the value of them was twenty pounds fourteen shillings. The prisoner Johnson had been with me upwards of three years, he was with me an errand boy before I bound him; I never saw the other boy: I saw the box at Warner's lodgings, and owned it immediately. The prisoner Johnson, upon being first charged, boldly denied it, and again he denied it before the Magistrate, at last, in consequence of what Warner had said, that he had sold the coffee pot, he then says, now you know all, I may as well tell you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Was this confession taken down in writing? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Warner, before this confession? - No, I never spoke a word to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Warner. I am not guilty of the fact, they told me I should be sure of being cleared, if I spoke the truth; I said that he and I did this robbery.</p>

               <p>I am quite innocent, I never was nigh the place, I had not been that way before for three weeks; when I was brought before Justice Blackborough, they persuaded me to own it, says they, if you know any thing, speak; says, I I am quite innocent of the robbery, I never was nigh the place.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 15th of November, the prisoner Warner came to our house, either to have a screw wheel changed, or to ask for one, he said, it was for one of Mr. Jackson's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080111"/> watches; he came in with his hat in his hand, I took particular notice of him, as he was dressed very genteel, he had on a blue coat, with yellow buttons; I asked him the number of teeth, I remember what sort of wheel I gave him, and he went away: the coffee-pot was not missed till the Saturday following, the spoons were missed before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Johnson. Why should he tell such a falsity.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. What I said is truth; he said, he had sold it, it weighed sixteen ounces at four shillings an ounce; and he said, he would knock it to pieces before his face.</p>

               <p>I was present when the prisoner Johnson said, before the magistrate, that he saw the coffee-pot knocked to pieces, it weighed sixteen ounces, at four shillings an ounce, Warner and he were both together with the plate; Mr. Levy was taken into custody, we found nothing at Levy's.</p>

               <p>I am Mr. Pitt's servant's wife, I was left laundress of these chambers, Mr. Gascoigne gave up possession of these chambers in July, he delivered up the key to me for Mr. Gascoigne's servant.</p>
               <p>At the time these keys were delivered to you in what condition were the books in the book cases? - Perfectly safe, and the cases locked, I saw the books there.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner servant to Mr. Gascoigne? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many keys were there to these chambers? - Three, I went out of town to Oxford, in July the 23d or 24th, I took one key with me, the other I left at Mr. Pitt's uncle's, in Westminster, and the other with Mr. Rose's servant.</p>
               <p>When you left the chambers, and were setting out for Oxford, were the books perfectly safe? - Yes, the prisoner went to Oxford with me that very day, he stayed till the 11th of August, it was of a Wednesday.</p>
               <p>How long was he absent before? - He was invited down by my friends, on account of his civility to me, my father who is a bookseller in Oxford, had got the prisoner to do some business for him in town, which business he did very punctually; I saw him the following Wednesday or Thursday, I think he stayed till Saturday night, he came the following Thursday morning he never left Oxford till I came to town, when I came to town, it was the 6th of September; I had a friend came to meet me at the coach, I came to the chambers immediately, as it was my home.</p>
               <p>Describe the manner in which you found these chambers? - On my arrival in town, I was met by a friend as I expected, and we had a coach and came to the chambers, I found the outer door open, which alarmed me very much; I went into my room, and found my cabinet broke open, and what was in it was thrown out; I also found a desk of my husband's broke open, I went into Mr. Pitt's dining room, and there I found every book case broke open, I think there are sixteen in the whole, but only fourteen are locked, two are left open for Mr. Gascoigne, some of the books were taken out of one case and some out of another, they were not all taken; I found Mr. Pitt's desk also broke open, one of the windows was open, and a long cord hanging out at that window, the window looks into the Temple-garden, I did not look out to see the length of it.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in company with you you at the time? - Yes, and the watchman whom I called up as it was dark.</p>
               <p>Were these book cases in the same condition when you went out of town to Oxford, as they were when Mr. Pitt left it? - Yes, I never missed a book that I know of, I cannot say I know all the books, but I never missed any; in consequence of this I applied to Mr. Pitt's uncle.</p>
               <p>Court. Who had the keys of the book cases? - I had them, I locked them up in the desk when I went out of town, I had opened them several times myself to have a book to read, I always took care to lock them again perfectly safe; I first informed Mr. Pitt's uncle, I then applied to

               <p>Did it suit your convenience now and then to have your visitors sleep in chambers? - It so far suited, when Mr. Gascoigne was out I have had them sleep there.</p>

               <p>Are you so certain, that upon your oath you can say, you never did? - I cannot say upon my oath, I may have lent them for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>There were three keys to these chambers, for what purpose was either of them left with Mr. Sadler? - I left them for safety, I expected nothing to happen but fire.</p>
               <p>Was there no other reason for depositing the key with Mr. Sadler, but security? - Only his living opposite to the chambers.</p>
               <p>Had you any inventory of the books - No.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Pitt went abroad, were the books delivered to you with any account of what they were, or only the keys? - Only the keys.</p>
               <p>What was the purpose of this young man's visit to Oxford? - Sir, when I had these friends from the country before, his genteel behaviour induced some of my friends to ask him down to the races; he was not at my father's house, but he was at liberty to come when he liked, his good behaviour induced my father and brother to look upon him as a friend, my father's name is Richards; I found the chambers doors open, I thought they had been broke open, and somebody had concealed themselves.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing curious in the locks of the book cases? - No, not that I know of, common locks.</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Sadler any particular directions to look at the chambers? - Not particularly, he had directions to Mr. Pitt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manley. At the time you slept in the chambers, they were persons of you own sex that slept there with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do not mean to impute any thing impure to this lady; I believe, while you was at Oxford, you and the prisoner had some difference? - I do not know that we had any particular words.</p>
               <p>I believe it was not unfrequent for you to have words? - Not that of, many friends fall out, and the more intimate they are, the more apt they are to fall out.</p>
               <p>Only those little squables that arise in common life; do you recollect now at the Lamb inn, a little misunderstanding there? - I remember being there by the prisoner's sending for me, he came to Oxford privately.</p>
               <p>Why he came in the stage coach, that was pretty public; you had some words? - I do not know that we had.</p>
               <p>You will not say that you had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I believe in the latter end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080114"/> July I went out of Oxford with you? - You did.</p>
               <p>I returned again the 11th of August? - You did.</p>
               <p>Was not your proposals to go to Margate, and our intentions to go to Margate? - I know nothing of your intentions.</p>
               <p>On the 11th of August I arrived in town, on the Monday following I received a letter from you by the Oxford coach, signifying you had wrote a letter to me from Oxford, and directed to me at chambers, and was surprised you had no answer, therefore you had sent that letter by the stage? - I sent a letter, but not by the stage as you say, I sent a letter by the post the next day after you set off, I do not recollect sending another by the stage, but I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 18th of August, which was a week I returned to Oxford, by means of the letter I received from you? - I will be upon my oath, I did not desire him to return to Oxford.</p>
               <p>You desired me to send a letter to you between some leather, that I was to send you for some shoes, that your friends might not see it? - I do not recollect it, they were such indifferent things, that I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the reason you do not recollect it, that it is so indifferent a thing? - I told him if he sent the letters to my father, I would receive them and answer them, but it was not my wish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you give him any particular directions, with regard to the leather? - I did not, I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not? - I cannot recollect, I cannot swear.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner send any leather down to you to make shoes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any note in that? - There was a little note in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent a letter to her between the leather, and I sent to her for some shoes intimating to her that I was then at the Cross-inn at Oxford.</p>
               <p>Did you or not, immediately on receiving the letter, come to the Cross-inn at Oxford? - By your desire I did.</p>
               <p>You then said, I am greatly afraid my friends will see you? - No, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday you and I went to the Lamb at Oxford? - I saw him there, we went there.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday I reproached you with your conduct towards me, and I advised you to come to town? - He did not that I know of, we had words.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The question is, whethere at that place he did not reproach you with some advice? - As to his advice I looked upon it as nothing, I do not know that he did then, I did not come to town for a fortnight after, had he advised me I should not have taken it.</p>
               <p>When was that? - It was on Saturday the 21st.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did he advise you to come to town? - For a purpose I did not know, he stated many frivolous things.</p>
               <p>State some of those frivolous things? - We had words, and he upbraided me with something of my conduct, I was amongst my friends.</p>

               <p>What did he say were the reasons why you ought to come to town? - I do not know any other reason than being at Oxford at the time I was, he thought the inhabitants and my friends would take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Court. He advised you to go, that you might be together more privately? - I did not follow his advice at all.</p>
               <p>I observed an expression that dropped from yourself a few minutes ago, which I took notice of at the time, it is more observable now, you said he came to Oxford privately? - Nobody knew of his being there, that is what I call privately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At this time I fancy I told you my reasons why I came privately, it was through your letter you wrote to me, that I would not wish to come publicly, therefore I told you to come to town, if you could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080115"/> not behave with more prudence, that it might be kept a secret? - Upon my oath I had done nothing in town or in country improper, you had the impudence to introduce yourself there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You told us he was invited by your friends, did not he upon the 21st of August explain to you his reason for coming to Oxford privately was this, that as your behaviour was such, you should not be seen together? - It might be his vanity perhaps.</p>
               <p>But was that the reason he assigned? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>But did he say to you that your conduct during the last three weeks had made you the subject of observation together, and that therefore it was to go on, you had better come to town? - No, Sir, I mean to say that positively.</p>

               <p>He did not assign it as the reason that it was in obedience to your directions, to send his letter between the leather? - To be sure he did wish me to go from Oxford.</p>
               <p>And for those reasons? - I do not know that they were.</p>
               <p>Did not he state the reasons? - I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. To convince the Court that what I have said is truth, at that time when we were at the Lamb together, you said you would not come to town? - I said I would come to town when it suited my own convenience.</p>
               <p>Did you or did you not say the same evening after that, that you would go to town, for home to your friends you would never go more? - No, indeed I did not.</p>
               <p>After that, did I or did I not call for pen, ink and paper, and write a note to your brother, and deliver you into his hands? - I do not remember such a circumstance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did such a thing pass? - I do not know that it did, I remember well I said, there is my brother passed the window, I said there is my brother gone by, shall I call him in, no says he, I do not want him to know I am here.</p>
               <p>Did he or did he not in fact say, he would have some conversation? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did he write a note to your brother? He did not.</p>
               <p>Did not he call for pen and ink to do it? - I cannot swear that he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you inform your friends he was at Oxford at that time? - No Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you drink tea with him at the inn? - I believe I did drink one cup of tea with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I called for pen, ink and paper, and wrote a note to your brother, and was determined to send to him, did you or not get off your chair, fall down upon your knees immediately and say, my dear Evans do not? - I will be upon my oath Sir, it is not true.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing of that sort? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was that the way you did sometimes call the prisoner? - No Sir, it was not, I never was heard by any body to call him so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not take you from your knees, saying that if you would wish to save yourself from being exposed, you must behave with more prudence? - It is false, and you know it is.</p>
               <p>Well, here is further than that still, after that did not you express yourself thus; my dear Evans, I never spent so agreeable a time in my life, not even with Fenner, and of the two I do not know which I love best; I sooner would live with you Mr. Evans? - It is false, as there is a God in Heaven, I never made use of such expressions, I am not that kind of woman, nor never was.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you preserved any of these letters? - No, we came to town the 6th of September last; we were in town about ten days or a fortnight, and her brother's wife in Oxford hearing something of our behaviour in Oxford together, which was rather singular, she immediately came up to town on that occasion; then they knowing I had some letters I had received during the times I came to town, they said they would not believe that there was any intimacy between us, nothing should prove it but her hand writing; I immediately produced five or six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080116"/> letters to her sister in law, which she said was her hand writing. I had them in my pocket, and she coaxed me to burn them, and said, my dear Evans do burn these letters; I burnt them before her face.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this true, that you solicited him to burn these letters in your presence? - No Sir, I never uttered a word about them, he burnt two letters in my presence, which is all I wrote, but I never asked him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I first saw the prisoner the latter end of May, or beginning of June; he applied to me, to know if I could make him a key to a chamber door, the key was made at my shop by one of my men.</p>
               <p>Did he bring a lock with him? - He brought the lock to our shop, he asked me if I could make him a key, I told him yes, if I had the lock or the key; he said it was for chambers, No. 4, Pump-court, the key was left in my shop, I did not receive it.</p>
               <p>When did he come again to your shop? - About six weeks afterwards, I was in the shop, the prisoner came and asked me if that key was made, he said he had been in the country; he took the key, and asked me if it would fit, I said I would go with him and try it; says he I am in a hurry, I will try it, and he came back with some of the bits of the key broke; says he can you mend it, says I, I cannot, I must have the lock, for some of the bits of the key are in: I offered to go with him to take off the lock, he said he could take it off himself; he brought the lock, and the bits of the key in the inside were taken out, and the same key was mended and made to fit.</p>
               <p>Did you offer to go back with him to put it on? - I cannot recollect, but as he had taken it off himself, I let him put it on himself.</p>
               <p>Did you in fact offer to go back with him? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see these chambers after they were broke open? - Yes, Sir, it might be some weeks afterwards, I went there to repair some locks, I took off the lock off the great door, it is the same lock the prisoner brought to me.</p>
               <p>After this transaction, did you see the prisoner at any time? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Did he ever come to your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him after, when Mr. Pitt's chambers were broke open? - Yes, the prisoner came to me, and desired I would be favourable to him at the examination, for he was suspected of being the person that had the key made in my shop; he told me the family were so connected, it would be the ruin of himself and his character, and the ruin of the young woman and her family; I told him it was a serious affair, I did not like to do it; when they first came to me to look at him, I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Fenner send for you? - Yes, or her sister.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner afterwards? - There was no great deal passed, he desired me to be favourable to him on the key which he had made, he acknowledged then he had that key made; he said it would be a material thing, it would injure him, he sent for me once or twice to speak to me, he sent for me to the Bible, it was still to want me to be favourable to him on the same occasion.</p>

               <p>What was the particular reason that he gave for it? - Concerning his connection with the laundress, it would ruin her family, and with some other woman, and it would ruin her character; Mr. Manley examined us all round, and the prisoner denied having the key made for these chambers, for any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Did he deny having the key made? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the subject of that enquiry at the time he denied the key being made? - He was charged with having the key made for Mr. Pitt's chambers; Mr. Pitt's chambers had been robbed, and they wanted to find out the person that robbed him; he was accused of having this key made, but for what purpose I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080117"/>Was he charged with having this key made to rob the chambers? - I do not recollect any charge of that sort being given, but he denied any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before this examination by Mr. Manley, had the prisoner been accused of the robbery? - He was suspected.</p>
               <p>And had been accused of it? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Why was not Mr. Manley's enquiry into the cause of the robbery? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>It was so understood by you and all that were present? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner as well as the rest knew that was the subject of the examination; then I take it his answer was just as you have stated, that he had not had the key made for any thing of that sort? - Mr. Manley accused him of having the key made, which he denied.</p>
               <p>In what words? - Mr. Manley, when he came into the room said, Evans, you are charged with having a key made to these chambers.</p>
               <p>What words did the prisoner use? - I cannot recollect the words that he said, he had not had the key made.</p>
               <p>He said I never had a key made to these chambers? - It might be so or it might not, what I put in of that sort had no meaning.</p>
               <p>Did not you take his answer to be, that he never had the key made for the purpose of robbing the chambers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said he desired you to be favourable, what did he say?</p>
               <p>Court. Tell us what he said, not what you thought?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did the prisoner say to you, that induced you to suppose he wanted you to favour him? - Says he, Mr. Jackson, this is an unfortunate affair, we are going to be examined this day, and I hope that you ill be favourable to me; when we came before Mr. Manley and Mr. Pitt -</p>
               <p>What did he say more? - This is an unfortunate affair, I having a connection with this laundress, and she being the servant of Mr. Pitt, if she is found out, it will be the total ruin of her and the family, and it will be the ruin of my own character; he mentioned to me, that he had a connection with another woman, and that he had this key made for the purpose of introducing that other woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are the Temple smith? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are more frequently employed to make locks for the Temple than any body else? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does this frequently happen, that our servants losing their keys, conceal it from us, and get new keys from the Temple smith? - They may do so, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have not you reason to know it, have not you known a number of instances of servants and laundresses coming for keys? - Certainly, I have received orders from laundresses to have keys made, it always had the approbation of the master.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you always think it necessary to go and ask the master? - By no means, I always was paid by the master.</p>
               <p>Was you never paid ready money for those keys that have been made? - Many a time.</p>
               <p>Then what do you mean; when it has happened that you had an account with the master, it has been put in the account, but in a multitude of instances they have been paid for by the laundresses? - I am paid by the master.</p>
               <p>Has it not happened to you to know, that it has been the neglect of the servant? - Never in my life, that never happened to me in my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am afraid that, besides the bad practice of multiplying the keys of our chambers, there is another bad practice, which is, that servants very often introduce ladies into the chambers? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>When you took in the bill to Mrs. Fenner to be paid, what did she say to you respecting this key that had been made by the the order of the prisoner? - Nothing that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080118"/> I know of particularly, she said she had not the money then about her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you any conversation with Mrs. Fenner about this key? - We had some conversation, she asked me whether I thought he was guilty or not, but I thought he was guilty.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Fenner say to you about this key? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with her about this key? - Yes, she asked me if I did make the key, I told her, yes, I did make it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did she not tell you that she was exceedingly sorry that she had mentioned any such thing, that she was exceedingly sorry that she had asked you any questions about a key being made at all? - Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Fenner. You say there were three keys belonging to these chambers? - Yes, they were all left in my possession when Mr. Pitt went abroad; during the time Mr. Gascoign had the chambers, Mr. Gascoign had one, I had another, and his servant had the third.</p>
               <p>Were there two or more returned to you? - Two, and my own made the third.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever any conversation with Jackson, the lock-smith, about the key he was supposed to have made for the prisoner? - When I sent for Jackson, I asked him if he had ever made a key for that door, he said he could not tell, he believed he had, he would go home and see; he took the key and went home, and returned with the key, and said there had been such a key made at his shop; he did not give me a positive answer of the person, but by the description, I concluded it to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did you say to Jackson after that about it? - He said if they had made a key, his man knew about it, and he had repaired the lock at the same time, I desired him to take off the lock, which he did; when he returned, he said the man would swear it was the lock he made the key to; Mr. Jackson was sent to, the time the prisoner was in the chambers, I took him and asked him if that was the man, he said he could not be sure, and he wished me to go into my room, that he might have a full view of him, and then he said he could not be sure that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say you was glad this discovery had been made? - I said so far as this, as Jackson was not sure that was the man, and as I had informed Mr. Pitt of it, I was sorry I had made such a discovery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Mr. Gascoign was not to leave the chambers on the 23d of June, and she expected I was to leave the chambers at the same time? - His time was up then, I expected it, as the twelvemonth was up.</p>
               <p>Whether in the middle of May we did not often have a few words at the chambers? - We have had frivolous words.</p>
               <p>Court to Jackson. You told me positively, that you took off the lock and took it home? - I was quite sure, as well as my servants.</p>
               <p>Are you equally sure that the prisoner is the man you made the key for? - I am sure he is the man I made the key for, and gave it to.</p>
               <p>What has made you more sure he is the man now, than when he was shewn you at chambers? - I knew he was the man, but when the prisoner came and desired me to speak favourably of him, I told Mr. Manly I believed he was the man, but I would not chuse to swear t o him; I was always sure of the man after he came to me, and reasoned with me, which confirmed my suspicions.</p>

               <p>I am a bookseller, No. 2, Bridge-street, Black-friars, I know the prisoner by buying of him some books that are signified in the indictment, in August last the time the prisoner came to me, I will not take upon myself to specify; he came in the habit, and dress, and appearance of a gentleman; he said, he had part of his library to dispose of, I desired to know where I could see the books, and he desired me to come to his chambers, No. 2, Fig-tree-court, in the Temple, I went according to his order, and saw the books, it was on a Saturday, which I believe you will find to be the 14th of August; I went with my man and looked at the first parcel, I paid him for them four guineas and a half; he had a fire in the chambers, he told me, he was a going to travel, or going into the country, and had an inclination to part with some law books, he called on me some days afterwards, I desired him to appoint his time, he appointed a future day, I went and took my man, and paid him fourteen guineas for them, and took them away in a coach.</p>
               <p>Can you enumerate the books of the first parcel? - (the books produced). Daniel's History of France, there wanted the last volume.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What is the value of that set of books? - I should suppose the value of them not perfect to be about eighteen or nineteen shillings, and the others I had priced in my public sale and catalogue at half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You do a great deal of business, more persons in it than yourself; they are all authorized to sell?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There are sufficient marks in these books, that mark is of letters instead of figures, denoting the price of them in my own hand writing, A. for one, L. for eleven.</p>
               <p>What is the amount of the whole loss? - Seventy pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How lately before you let your chambers to Mr. Gascoigne, had you been there yourself? - I left England in June, 1782.</p>
               <p>Had you been absent from your chambers any length of time? - No, I had not, I had a catalogue of my books, I always kept a catalogue in case of fire; I left the keys with the laundress, she knew the situation of the books of course.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Gibbons's, in Essex-street, in the Strand; Mr. Pitt's servant directed me to the house, I found him there at eleven o'clock, he lodged in the garret, I found him in the parlour, I took him to the watch-house, and searched him, I found the key of his room, and the key of his box; I went back again, he would not tell me where they were; I found his father and mother lived in Shire-lane; then I went to his father's lodgings, and found his father there; he said, he had no objection to my searching his room, with that I searched the drawers, and found these book, which Mr. Pitt says are his; I charged the prisoner with them, the prisoner said, they were his own, he had had them two years.</p>
               <p>(These two books deposed to by Mr. Pitt.)</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Rose, I know Mrs. Fenner, she left the key of the chambers with me, I kept it very safe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner on the 25th of August? - I do not know the day he came to our house.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect about what day? - It was the latter end of August.</p>
               <p>Do you think it was as late in the month, as the 25th? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect your sending your servant to Mr. Pitt's chambers, by his desire? - Yes, to see if there were any letters for Mrs. Fenner, the servant went and came back, and brought the key back, she locked the door, and said there were no letters.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prisoner went out of town to Oxford that day or not? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know these chambers? - Yes, it is a spring lock that will open within side, without a key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will call my witnesses to character. Gentlemen of the Jury; on the latter end or middle of May, Mrs. Fennell and I had many words, we used to cohabit together in chambers, the same as man and wife; she told me after Mr. Gascoigne was to leave the chambers, she would use me just as she pleased, and lock me out, and if I could get in by any means, she would give me leave; by that means I had a key made for that account, but in the room of leaving chambers, I did not leave them at all; Mr. Gascoigne left them the middle of July after term, he then discharged me, and told me he would take me again in November; I staid at chambers from the 17th of July, when Mr. Gascoigne discharged me, to the 23d or 24th of July; on that day we quitted the chambers, I left them perfectly safe, I went out of town, I staid three weeks, I came to town to go to Margate; on the Wednesday I received a letter, on the Saturday I received another letter, on the Monday following I went down to Oxford, and staid till the Saturday; we had a few words on the Monday night in the evening; on the day I fetched the key from Mr. Jackson, I received another letter by the Oxford coach, desiring me to come down to Oxford again, and not to come as I did before, but to come to her friends, and say I was going to Birmingham; when I went I called her brother up, and told her friends according to her desire; they told me to stay there, I thought her conduct was rather singular, I advised her to behave otherwise, and treat me as a common acquaintance; we fell out a great deal, then I took the key and was determined to have no farther connections with her, I threw the key away; on the 6th of September we came to town together, we arrived about eight in the evening, and as we were going to the chamber door, says she, Lord Mr. Evans the doors are open, says I, it is impossible; the door was open, the windows up with a rope from the top to the bottom. Gentlemen, with respect to the books in question, I can account for: about 1779 I lived with Mr. Jones, I was servant to him at the time he had a commission in a new raised regiment at Hilsey barracks, he was taken very ill and was obliged to leave the regiment, and was ill at his ready furnished lodgings four months, and was like to die; he gave me ten pounds in money and his furniture, and a great number of books; here are witnesses here to prove, that they had the books in their possession two years, here is a person that had that book that Mr. Pitt has sworn to, before ever it was taken from me; I will leave it to your opinion, whether I could commit that robbery in chambers in that condition, in the height of summer.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 24th of November, a little before five in the afternoon I was coming down stairs, and just before I got down, I heard a violent breaking of glass, I thought a porter had been coming by; I asked my daughter that was in the shop what was the matter, she said the glass was broke, and before I could get to the shop door there was an alarm of stop thief; several people came about the door, and in a few minutes somebody came, I cannot tell who, and said they had got the man, and he is coming over presently, the man was brought back within seven or eight minutes, he was brought into my shop; a gentleman immediately came in, and said here is your mug, the mug had my own private shop mark upon it; the prisoner said nothing, the mug stood in the shop window, the third pane high.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday afternoon about a quarter before five, the 24th of November, I was gathering my pots at the corner of Brook-street, I looked across the way, and saw two men at Mrs. Clarke's window, and one of them put both his arms through the window and took out a mug, and run across the way; I tried to lay hold of him, and he knocked me down, I am sure this is the man.</p>

               <p>As I was going up Holborn, about ten yards above Mrs. Clarke's door, nearly opposite Brook-street, I heard a sudden crash of glass, I turned about and saw nobody for a quarter of a minute, immediately I saw the prisoner cross opposite Brook-street, and run as fast as he could; I pursued him, and was close to him two or three times, but he rather gained ground of me, he was not above ten yards from me any time; I thought to have caught him, he turned round the corner of Gravel-street, which is a pretty short turning, I was in the middle of the street, he crossed over it; half way in Gravel-street there is a little passage and a man tripped him up, and he fell in the kennel, I took him by the collar and lifted him up, and walking two or three steps all of a sudden a person gave me this tankard into my hand, then we took him to the shop, that is all I know of the matter, I only know of taking him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>I was going down Holborn, and I saw the prisoner pass me, not a minute after I heard the break of a window, and I heard the voice of stop thief, I saw the prisoner cross with the tankard in his hand, I followed him, I never lost sight of him, I saw him drop the tankard, he is the same man, he dropped the tankard in Gravel-street; the person that picked up the tankard is not here, I saw it picked up, and it was given to me, and I gave it to Mr. Harper.</p>

            , there came this man on one horse, and another man on another horse.</p>
               <p>Were the two prisoners on one horse? - I cannot say, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Have you known the prisoners before? - I knew one of them, Hilliard, I was set to watch, because some fowls were found killed, and so we watched to see who came for them; when the prisoner came to the gate, which is a distance from the place where the fowls were concealed, two of them alighted about fourscore yards off, and the two prisoners came up where the fowls were concealed, the prisoners uncovered the fowls, and I believe they heard me, he dropped the fowls, and Hilliard met me round the rick, there was Pollard and five more with me.</p>

               <p>Where was the mare all the time? - Tied to the gate the outside the field, Pollard released the mare from the gate, but I cannot say whether Hilliard or Brooks were on the mare.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Could you, at the distance of eighty yards, see whether there were two on one horse, at eight at night? - Yes, I I never saw Brooks before.</p>
               <p>Could you see the shape, or the face of Brooks at that distance? - Yes, it was moon-light, I swear to the best of my knowledge these were the men that got off the horse: I carried the prisoner and the mare to the Office, and shewed it to Mr. Boydell: it was the mare that was tied to the gate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Was the gate between you and the horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there bushes in the gate? - No; I I saw the mare at the gate all the time.</p>

               <p>Did they come to the place where the ducks were? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the ducks alive or dead? - Dead; they began to uncover the ducks, and I apprehended them, the gate was about fifty yards off; I carried them through the gate after I apprehended them: the mare was tied to the gate, I unloosed her.</p>
               <p>Had it a saddle on? - No, I carried the mare to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 24, in Wapping-street, I lived there in September last; the prosecutor lodged with me at the time of the robbery, he is a seafaring man, he had lodged with me about five weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. How had he conducted himself during that time? - Very sober and steady, the prosecutor went out of my house between seven and eight at night, and not coming home all night, I was very uneasy about him, it was on a Thursday night, I am sure it was in the month of September, he never slept from my house only one night before; in the morning the prosecutor came home, he had borrowed an old jacket and trowsers, and told me he had been robbed, scraped acquaintance with him, and said he was a country man, and insisted on going to get some supper and sleep with him that night; and that he took him to the sign of the Dark-house, in Dark-house lane, and I went with the prosecutor there about half past eight, the prosecutor came home about a quarter before eight, and I could find none of the prosecutor's things; but soon after a woman came and gave information of the prisoner, and I went upon Tower-hill and took the prisoner; I went past him two or three times before I took him, and I observed the prosecutor's waistcoat and handkerchief upon him, it was a handkerchief of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Did you on the appearance of these things, immediately believe them to be the prosecutor's? - I did, I secured the prisoner, and took him to the publick-house where the prosecutor was, I think it is the sign of the old King's-arms; the prosecutor immediately challenged the prisoner, and told him he had his handkerchief and waistcoat, and his sleeve buttons, he had his shirt sleeves over his hands, he did not challenge any thing else at that time; the prisoner said they were none of his, he knew nothing at all about it; I asked the prisoner if he had not got a silk purse about him, and he asked me what business I had with any thing belonging to him; I said I believe you have one; he asked me if there was any particular mark upon it, I told him there were two steel rings upon it, I told him there were some stitches which I had observed before when the purse was in the hands of the prosecutor, and the prisoner pulled out the purse in a hurry, and said where are the stitches? and I shewed him that very moment; I said this is the purse belonging to the prosecutor; nothing else passed, but I took him to the Justice's, and I gave the purse to the prisoner after I had shewn him the stitches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I resigned myself willingly or no? - He did, after I said he must go with me; he said he would go with me any where, he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did the prosecutor buy that purse? - No, he did not, my wife gave the prosecutor that purse, that made me so well acquainted with it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to me, and desired I would go and receive her wages of a Lady whose name was Appleton, in Fitzroy-street; her mistress was very much offended at the demand, and charged me on my life to tell her she had robbed her; she called this woman a thief, I told Mrs. Appleton, you have much the appearance of a gentlewoman, I beg you will adjust this matter, for the woman declares she never robbed you, or any body else; I said for my own satisfaction, and the many obligations the prisoner at the bar has been under to me, I should have been very happy for her family's sake. Mrs. Appleton said, if ever she dared go nigh any of her friends, she would prosecute her; I said Madam, do not be so cruel; this is the gentlewoman that is the prosecutrix now, I had this order to demand the wages of Mrs. Appleton; will you be so obliging Madam to let me look at your face (to the prosecutrix) I am not afraid to shew my face before all the world; that is the very Lady, Sir, who went by the name of Appleton; and she further said, that if this woman had any demands, that her master should hang her; which of the masters I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you went to that Lady who bore the name of Appleton, and you demanded wages, and she said if she troubled her for wages, her master should hang her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Council for the Prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Who are you? - A woman Sir.</p>
               <p>You look more like a man than a woman, what are you? - I am a wife, I have lived in Printing-House-yard, Black-friars, eight years, I never was before a Court, nor my name in question before.</p>
               <p>Did you know the hand-writing of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that, and see if that is her hand writing? - There is her hand writing on the note.</p>
               <p>Put on your spectacles? - I have none Sir, but if you please to lend me a pair, I can tell you; my husband was a jeweller by trade, I now follow the stay-making business, and employ a great many hands (looks at it) I cannot pretend to say, I have a vast many notes, I have seen her writing.</p>

               <p>In consequence of a robbery at Dover, Dixon's father was taken with the property that had been stolen at Dover; he was asked where the watches were, and he said, he was sent there to fetch them, innocently, and knew nothing where they were; and then said, that if they would not hurt him, he would give them information where they might find the watches; he wrote a letter to his wife the prisoner, desiring her to give the particulars of the burglary done at Dover.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you the letter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Produce it? - She denied having any knowledge of it, and said she knew nothing of the property, or any thing about it; we pressed her very much upon it, and told her if she would restore us the property, it was all we wished or wanted of her; but she still persisted in being ignorant, we went about the house to search, and Jealous and me were in the kitchen, and left Mr. Andrews and her in the parlour; in that parlour I found some drawers that were locked and could not get into them, and we went out of the room, and returning we found the drawers open, and her at them: there was the silver watch which Mr. Andrews swore to, we insisted on searching her, she refused, but we did search her, and Mr. Carpmeal took a watch out of her bosom, and Jealous found some rings.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt, Council for the Prisoner. Tell the Court what you know, not what you was informed? - This piece of ribbon was missing, and I went to her, and from under her cloak, under her right arm, I shook this piece of ribbon; the next witness saw her take it, there was fourteen yards, or rather more.</p>
               <p>Court. What may it be worth a yard? - It cost one and twenty pence a yard, I am sure of the ribbon by my husband's writing upon it "21," the word and figures,</p>
               <p>"18 yards," also are his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the prisoner say when the ribbon dropped from under her cloak? - She denied it; I immediately took her into custody, I am sure it dropped from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It was between six and seven? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you had candles on the counter? - Yes, I was on the right hand, not far from her.</p>
               <p>Had she frequented your shop? - I never saw her in my shop before, I saw nothing of this transaction before I was told of it, there were four customers in the shop when I came up to her; I suppose there might be eight or nine at first, but not near her; I came from behind the right-hand counter, she was served at the left-hand counter; there was nobody near her when I came up to her, she had a black cloak on, but not a long one; I saw it drop from her, it was rolling from her right heel.</p>
               <p>Is not it a common pattern? - I can swear both to the figures and the words.</p>
               <p>Have not you sold a great many ribbons of that pattern before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Is not that a usual length? - It is half a piece.</p>
               <p>I suppose other shop-keepers mark their ribbons in the same manner? - I do not know what other people do, I never saw any marked in the same stile that that is done.</p>
               <p>How long before this evening was it that you saw this ribbon in the drawer? - I had taken it out of the window before candle-light that very evening.</p>
               <p>Was you before the Magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>The Magistrate thought very slightly of the circumstance; as it was then made out in evidence did not he? - I did not understand him so.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to take bail? - I never heard a word about it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. You was very much confused? - Yes, there were one or two more women there, and a man came into the shop, I missed two or three pieces more; I am sure the prisoner was the person; I saw the piece under her cloak; my mistress was at the opposite compter.</p>
               <p>Was not you directing your observation to your mistress? - No, I could not, there was another lady stood before me, they were at the other counter, about a yard and a half off.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it dropped from under her petticoat? - I am not sure, but it so appeared.</p>
               <p>Which side did it drop, near the ladies, or near the door? - Near the ladies.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into the shop to buy some ribbon, and that young lady shewed me a box, that was too low a price, she shewed me some at another price, I agreed for two yards at one shilling a yard, I laid down two shillings, I thought she was gone round to cut it off, and she went round to tell her mistress she was robbed; she said she missed a piece of ribbon, says she, whether it was the lady that went out, or this lady, I cannot say, but I suspect this lady; I believe there were ten or twelve people in the shop, they took me backwards and stripped me, and found nothing at all upon me; when they came back, they found such a piece of ribbon; they kept me from ten minutes after five till eight.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Bambridge. Did the ribbon drop before you searched her? - From my shaking her; she went into a little room, and I followed her, missing other things, but no other than this we found upon her or near her.</p>
               <p>Court to Miss Oliver. You did not suspect any of the rest of the company? - No, I told Mrs. Bambridge I saw her take it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a very good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. James. Who did the prosecutor give charge of to you? - Of young Fosgate.</p>
               <p>Who do you mean by young Fosgate? - The brother of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This box is mine, it was in my shop with plate, it was in my possession the Saturday before, and there was a pin in the box very particular that I could swear to, it was in my possession on Saturday.</p>

               <p>Court. That will not do, we do not know they were taken on the prisoner? - I have a letter from the Mayor at Bath.</p>

               <p>Was it a tuck end? - No point to it.</p>
               <p>Did you see his face? - No I saw his dress, when he stopped us, the other came up by the side of the post-boy and bid him stop, he said stop, damn you, or I'll blow your brains out; then the post-boy said blow and be damned, and hit the horses a good lick, and flew away from them, they did not ask us for any thing, I know Freeman by his dress, we drove up to the house, about two or three hundred yards, then the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080165"/> post-boy mounted his horse, and bid us go on, and he would follow these men, and we found them hid in a place like a well, Freeman struck at me, and I knocked him down, and there was a pistol lay, and another man took it away.</p>
               <p>Which of them was it you knocked down? - Freeman, I saw the pistol taken from him, Greenwell was in the well also, he run away directly, and was taken soon after, Greenwell had a blue coat on; the other had a whitish coat on, they had both aprons on, we overtook them about a mile, I was sure when I overtook them, they were the two men, they stood by the side of the well.</p>
               <p>Were they laid down, or were they standing up? - Rather stooping down, it is just close by the path.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, council for the prisoner Freeman. What time was this when you was in the chaise, when you was attacked by somebody? - About nine, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish one man's face from another? - I knew them by their dress.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish the colour of a man's coat at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you describe what kind of cloaths, either of them had at the dirt house? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not there a person on horseback? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why could they not have got out of your way, so that you could not have overtaken them? - They could have got over the hedges, if they pleased.</p>
               <p>Was it not a dark night? - No, it was moon light, Freeman came on my side.</p>

               <p>What sort of cloaths had they? - Greenwell had a dark colour, and the other a light, Freeman had two coats on, he had a light colour drab on the outside; I mounted my horse and pursued, and overtook them, just going up Highgate-hill, I rode by them, and knew them, there were four in company, therefore I did not offer to stop them, I put up my horse at the Bull, intending to meet them, I could not leave my horse upon the road, I found them down in the well, by the old store house; I did not see them searched.</p>

               <p>Are there many many houses thereabouts? - Yes, it is a street, I pursued them about two hundred yards, and just as I got up there was a man said, they are taken into this house, I went in and the landlord pushed me out of doors, and said, nobody came in there; I then went to Mr. Green's, and desired they would send somebody out with me, but as I had not been robbed of any thing they would not, then I took a gentleman with me, and we saw the landlady, who said, she did not know us; and I stood in the tap room, the prisoner was there, and I went and laid hold of his collar, and said, this is the man that stopped me first, he stood by the fire side; I am sure that is the person that stopped me, because I caught him for half a minute; when I had hold of his collar, he said to me directly, it was not me that cut you, it was the other; a gentleman that was with me went for the constable, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>What money did you lose? - Half a guinea, one shilling, and two half crowns, I know I had the money in my pocket, they had no weapons, I cried out, and the prisoner Mitchell wanted to murder me.</p>
               <p>How do you mean? - He cried out, kill the old buggerer, kill him, three times.</p>
               <p>But he had no weapon to kill you with? - He was going to take a knife out of his pocket, and the neighbours got up, and cried out of their windows, for shame; there were many neighbours.</p>
               <p>Did he take out his knife? - He had got his knife in his hand, and would have done it, if it had not been for the neighbours, who cried out for shame, and begged him to have merey upon me; I am sure he had a knife out, I saw it.</p>
               <p>When the neighbours cried out, what became of them? - They ran off, they were with me the space of half an hour.</p>
               <p>What were they doing all that time? - They were dragging me about the yard, and beating me like a dog, as I had no more for them, and knocked my teeth out of my head.</p>
               <p>How many teeth did they knock out? - One.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour before you could alarm any body with your cries to get any assistance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make any resistance all this time? - I begged for mercy, I fought and struggled as much as I could; when they ran away, I went to my neighbours, and told them what accident I had met with; they were taken up the same morning out of their beds; I told them who to take, I knew them both from children.</p>
               <p>And they knew you well enough too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080171"/>You knew where they lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And they knew that you knew where they lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did they first say to you when they attacked you? - They said nothing to me till they got me down to the ground.</p>
               <p>How far did they live from you? - About twenty or thirty yards, one of them did; and the other lived further off.</p>
               <p>What are they? - One was a lamplighter, the other used to mangle for people, and used to carry burthens.</p>
               <p>What time had you gone to bed that night? - About seven.</p>
               <p>So these people that knew you so well, and knew that you knew them so well, robbed you and went home to their beds: did you lose any thing else but money? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any watch? - No, I had nothing but money; when they were taken up they said they knew nothing about it, they were not concerned in it, they denied being there.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - It was a very good star-light.</p>
               <p>Any lamps near? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could the neighbours see them as well as you from the windows? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was at the beginning of this struggle that they got the money from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was before the neighbours were alarmed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So all that the neighbours saw, was them and you struggling and fighting? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you cry out, when you did cry out? - I cried out, pray Bob, do not murder me, have mercy upon me.</p>
               <p>You called him by his name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What words did you use? - I cried out, murder.</p>

               <p>What sort of a knife had he? - A long snig-a-snee knife, a spring knife.</p>
               <p>He took it out deliberately, and opened it before all the people? - Not before all the people, but before the people in the yard.</p>
               <p>How long might these people be looking out of their windows? - Ten or a dozen minutes.</p>
               <p>They made such a noise, that the people were waked out of their beds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What, they threw up their sashes, and called out, have mercy on the poor old man, do not kill him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they saw these lads kicking you in this unmerciful way, as if you was a dog? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often have you had the misfortune to be robbed in your life? - Four or five times.</p>
               <p>So I thought: how often have you been a witness here of robberies on your own person? - Two times.</p>

               <p>Upon an average, how many prosecutions had you in the course of the last two years? - One before this.</p>
               <p>They have been both within the year? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Is there any other door to the room? - No, only what goes into the back room, and I saw three men upon Simon, but I could not tell who they were justly; the prisoner turned himself round close to me, I could have touched him with my hand through the hole; then I saw it was him, knowing him so long before, he lives in that neighbourhood, and is well known there, I have known him almost a twelvemonth: and

               <p>What became of you after? - Simon went to his business, and I went to bed again, I could not get out any where, because I was locked in.</p>
               <p>How were you locked in? - I could not get into the street no way.</p>
               <p>Was this in the yard? - It is a street, because there is no gateway to stop any person going up.</p>
               <p>What hindered you from getting out? - Because after he came out of his own room at the back door, he locked it after him.</p>
               <p>Where does this ladder come down to? - It comes down, by lifting up the trap door, it comes upon the ground, the back place from the dwelling house.</p>
               <p>How is that surrounded? - It is behind the dwelling house, going into a back opening, and there is a door from the little yard into the other yard.</p>
               <p>Did you try that door? - Yes, I wanted to get out to help him.</p>
               <p>Did you call to him? - No; when I saw him in that situation I was afraid, for fear they should break in, the boards were very thin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I suppose it was the pistol that Lucas had that frightened you? - I saw no pistol at all.</p>
               <p>What sort of pistol had the prisoner? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>If he had had one, you must have seen it, if he had beat Simon's eyes about; what was it he beat Simon's tooth out with? - I do not know, I did not see.</p>
               <p>Which of his eyes was it that was so black and blue? - It was the right eye, that was the only thing he complained of.</p>
               <p>His right eye was very much swelled? - Very much, and all scratched down the right cheek.</p>
               <p>How long had you and Simon been bedfellows? - About a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>What sort of lodging is this? - It is very well for such as we.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you trust him alone in your shop and warehouse? - Yes, always, I never took the least account, he might go where he pleased; he keeps a little cart, and has carried goods from my house to Mr. Matthews for several years, and for people in Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Court to Moss. What time was it in the morning you missed your pigs? - About nine or ten.</p>
               <p>You had not been at your sty before? - No, nor none of my people that are here, I did not track them myself, but as to the place they were tracked to, there never was such a place seen in the world.</p>
               <p>Court to Partridge. How did you track these pigs? - By the foot in the lanes, and roads by the back lanes, that goes from Hornsey-house.</p>
               <p>Were they ever out of the lanes? - No, not till they came to Mr. Jones's house, they turned out within three fields of Mr. Jones's house.</p>

               <p>What sort of partition or gates are there between the first field, and the three fields? - I believe in every one there was a gate.</p>
               <p>Were the gates shut or open? - They were all shut, I cannot say the first gate was fastened, but we were obliged to get over that.</p>
               <p>Did you trace them through these fields, are you sure that the pigs went through that gate that was fastened? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Did they ask about any pigs? - Yes, the officer asked her about some pigs, after a little discourse, she said, she had none at all, only three sows and a boar, and she said, they were upon the common.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, she knew none else.</p>
               <p>Court. She said they were on the common? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did any body go to shew Johnson where these pigs were? - No, I am sure of that, because we were all in the house talking to the woman, when Johnson went out and found them unknown to any body.</p>
               <p>How many were there in the house? - I cannot positively say; there were some children, and the woman, and Mr. Isaacs and myself.</p>
               <p>Was there any body there besides? - Not as I saw, I did not hear the little boy say, there is my daddy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you see a lad there about eighteen or nineteen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him go out in the yard? - Yes, after we had found the pigs, the boy of nineteen was in the house, and he was going to shew Mr. Isaacs where the pigs commonly lodged; and as we were coming out of the house together, they saw Mr. Jones coming up, he was just come out of the door, Mr. Isaacs, and I, and the boy, with the woman with a child in her arms, in order to shew where the hogs generally were.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnstone. Recollect yourself, and take care you do not mistake, you told us you traced the hogs, and you yourself got into the sty? - Yes, and I saw a man's foot in the sty.</p>
               <p>Then you found the track of the pigs, with the other man Partridge? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see the track of the man all the time that you tracked the pigs? - In general, I did not look every step.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the track of the pigs and take notice of them, without seeing the track of the man? - No.</p>

               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far did these pigs go in lanes? - The space of three miles, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Where did they go then? - They turned into a grass-field, through a gate that led out of the lane.</p>
               <p>Was there any road there? - None at all, it was as much as we could do to track them there; we could not do it but here and there a place, and there we tracked them exactly the man's feet and hogs, and the gate shut again, and we made away from gateway to gateway, thinking they must drive them through the gates, and we found them at every gateway.</p>
               <p>How many gates were there? - From the first to the last, I believe there were four.</p>
               <p>How were they first got out of the lane? - I cannot possibly say, we looked and got over the gate, they had gone through.</p>
               <p>How was that gate fastened? - I cannot say as we knew they were gone through there, we made directly after them.</p>
               <p>How was it fastened, was it locked? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were all the gates shut? - All put to, some of them had only a bit of wood, I believe no fastening.</p>
               <p>Did the gates open towards the field, or towards the yard? - I cannot say, there are three fields and four gates, one going out of the road, and one going into the yard.</p>
               <p>Do these gates lay pretty near in a line<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080179"/> towards the yard? - All leaning in a line towards the yard.</p>
               <p>Could the hogs have got under the gateway, from the lane into the first field? - No, I do not think they could.</p>
               <p>Court to Partridge. What do you say to that? - I do not think they could, one was too big.</p>
               <p>Court to Lawson. Could the sow get under the gate? - I think it was impossible.</p>
               <p>You heard nothing that passed between the woman and the officer? - Only this, we made enquiry if that was Mr. Jones's, she said, yes, he is gone to town, then I directly turned out of the house, and went to make search after the pigs, and found them; I heard no other conversation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Johnson. The only tracks that you found was it at different gates? - No, there was only one track over the gates.</p>
               <p>Court to Lawson. This first field opens first into the lane? - The two first fields adjoin to Mr. Thompson's, besides another gentleman's; sometimes the gates are all thrown open to go all over the farm, because Mr. Thompson is taking in droves both bullocks and sheep; Jones rents this place to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Then Jones has the liberty of driving any thing not to do damage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The grass is over the shoes in different places? - It has been a growing season.</p>

               <p>Was there any thing of your's found upon him at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that is the man? - I swear by the clothes, he run before me, and another man followed him; all I know is, that the man was brought back in the same clothes; I lost two watches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. I think we have gone so far that nothing was found on the prisoner? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>When you went out the first time you suspected it was a boy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who is that boy? - I do not know, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080180"/> is not the boy that is now to give evidence, I went into the shop, I did not think of any harm.</p>
               <p>You jumped up in a hurry for fear they should get all the watches? - There was a great bounce made by the four shutters, then in the instant two panes of glass was broke, the prisoner immediately run away, and run much better than me.</p>
               <p>How far had he to run, till he came to the corner of Denmark-street? - I believe I could run it in a minute.</p>
               <p>Four out of five of your shutters were close? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the other shops in the street open or shut? - There is a watchmaker's shop shut up at seven.</p>
               <p>Did the other shop shut up before you or not? - They may do as they like.</p>
               <p>But did they? - My neighbour never shuts up her shop till nine, as to the other shops, I do not know whether they were shut or not.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the man's coat? - I observed it was a little drabish.</p>
               <p>How many of your neighbours might have the goodness to join in the pursuit? - Nobody run but one, but a little higher up there was a few.</p>
               <p>Is the boy to whom you had spoke, one of them? - He might.</p>
               <p>Was you at your tea? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>The person that run from your door, had a round hat on, flapped? - It was not flapped, I suppose it was a little flappish, I am not a maker of hats, I call it a round hat.</p>
               <p>Now a man with a round hat of whom you had about the third part of a minute, running from you with his back to you, you undertake to swear to? - He was not above thirty yards off.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was not moon light.</p>
               <p>Was it rainy or fair? - It was a little sprinkle of rain.</p>
               <p>A little sprinklish? - It was not very dark or light.</p>
               <p>It was a little darkish, so upon a darkish night about one third part of a minute a man running from you, with his back towards you, with a hat flapped on, you seeing him for only twenty seconds, undertake to swear to him? - He had two white buttons on his side.</p>
               <p>That is right, now you can swear to them, two white buttons upon his hip; to be sure a man with two whitish buttons upon his hip, is the most remarkable creature in the creation; I will not keep you any longer Mr. Levy, good night to you? - Good night to you.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of November, between six and seven, I had just left work, and passing by the end of Denmark-street, I heard the cry of stop thief! I took no notice of it, at last I saw the prisoner at the bar come up between the posts, there is a bar at the end of the street, he came into the new road from Denmark-street.</p>
               <p>Was he walking or running? - He came running up to me when I stopped him.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him, was he walking or running? - He might be standing still when I first saw him, it was dark, and I could not see him.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him what was he doing? - He was coming through the posts, I was about twenty yards from the posts, he came running up to me, and I stopped him, I took hold of him, he asked me why I stopped him, I told him I did not know, I supposed he was the thief; soon after Mr. Trevallion who keeps cows came up, and desired me to keep fast hold of him; then Mr. Levy came up and said, that was the man; we took him to Denmark-street, to the sign of the Kettle-drum, an officer was sent for, but no property was found upon him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How far might you be from the prisoner when you first saw him? - About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>It was so dark you could not see whether he was running or not? - He stopped at the posts, he might run after he came through the posts, and he certainly did.</p>
               <p>Was it a rainy night? - No, it did not rain at all.</p>
               <p>Now do you mean to swear that? - It rained afterwards, that same evening.</p>
               <p>Nay man, never blink it, did it rain or not? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself a little? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>May be it was a light night? - It was dark, but not so dark but I could distinguish the man coming through the posts, he had a drab coloured coat and metal buttons.</p>
               <p>After you took hold of him, you took care he threw nothing away? - The constable took him away, there were no watches found upon him.</p>

               <p>I am a cow-keeper, I live in Denmark-street.</p>
               <p>How near is that to Levy's house? - About fifty yards, I cannot say how long the street is, it is a longish street, I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw a young fellow in a light coloured great coat, with metal buttons, and a blue coat under it, run along, there was a lamp, I saw him very plain, I run after him and fell down on one knee; I made a stumble at the top of the street, a young man stopped him, and we took him to the public-house and searched him, he had a bit of myrtle in his mouth.</p>
               <p>Had you sight enough of him to know that the man that was stopped was the same man? - Certainly, he never was out of my sight, he had not got by the door when I saw him; when I turned out of my door he stepped over my cellar window; there was a knife in his pocket; Mr. Levy came up crying stop thief, and partly out of breath.</p>
               <p>Did you see any boys running? - Yes, towards the top of the street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The boys were a head of the person that came past your door? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of these boys that were running? - I saw no boys till the cry of stop thief, there are many alarms in that street, the prisoner was taken at the upper end of the street in a back lane, the boys ran after me, and some overtook me; I keep a chandler's shop at home, and carts and cows.</p>
               <p>Stand up that the Jury may see you, you keep carts; what the handy jockey carts, do you keep any of those convenient things for the benefit of the country poultry? - No, Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in any other animals, do you deal in horses? - I never buy any but what I buy for my business, I buy them with a good face.</p>
               <p>Was you in your front room that you was drinking tea? - My rooms are all in front, I have but three rooms.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080183"/>Did you hurt yourself much? - No, Sir, not a great deal.</p>
               <p>Was it a moon light night? - It was not.</p>
               <p>It was a dry night, that you recollect? - I will not be positively sure of that, to the best of my knowledge it was a dry night.</p>
               <p>Did not it sprinkle a little? - I did not know, if it did I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Did you dirt yourself much in falling down? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you trace back the way that the person had run from Mr. Levy's house? - No, Sir, they brought the prisoner back, I saw him make a halt back; I sent Mr. Levy back, it was not my business, there was nothing found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I live in Ratcliff-highway, within three doors of the prosecutor, I was going out with some goods, I saw that person about Mr. Levy's window, I saw him walking backwards and forwards, looking at the things that were in the window.</p>
               <p>What did you see him do? - I saw him do nothing but look at the things.</p>
               <p>How long did you observe him? - He might be ten minutes, or better.</p>
               <p>What might you be doing all the time? - I went out with some goods, and when I came back he was in the same place.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A grocer, I live with Mr. Jollands, I am errand boy, I have lived there two years and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Levy come out of his shop at all? - No, Sir, I did not, I went and told my master that there was a person lurking about, and I did not like him, but my master being busy in the shop, did not take much notice of it.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the prisoner? - Because I am sure of it, I went close by him, he had a bit of myrtle in his mouth, and a light great coat on.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of that? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>How came you to take notice of such a circumstance? - I did take notice, he was walking backwards and forwards, and I looked at him.</p>
               <p>What sort of a bit of myrtle was it? - A little sprig.</p>
               <p>Was this a very light night that you saw a little bit of myrtle? - He was near the windows, and by the lights you might see his face very plain.</p>
               <p>What led your attention to him so much to observe he had a bit of myrtle in his mouth? - Because he looked at me, I went in doors and saw no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time of night was this? - Between six and seven, all the shutters were up excepting one, and there was a little space between every one, I did not see any body thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Do you know the lady that lives at next door? - Yes, the prisoner was looking at her shop as well as Mr. Levy's.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body with him? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>It was a moon light night? - I cannot say directly, the lamps were alight.</p>
               <p>It was a dry night? - No, Sir, it was a wet night, it rained small rain a good pace, that made me look the more, because the person stood still in the rain.</p>
               <p>You frequently have been alarmed in that neighbourhood with thieves? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called four witnesses, who all gave him a good character.)</p>
               <p>Court to Read. Was you present when the prisoner was searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see what was found upon him? - I saw nothing found in his pocket, he had a pair of gloves on his hands, I am positive of that, I took particular notice of it.</p>

               <p>But these clothes were not in that room? - No, we asked how she came by them, and she said they were a pair of sheets Mr. Milne had bought early in the morning; I asked Milne whether they were not his sheets, and he denied them.</p>
               <p>Was he by when she said he bought them? - No, that was just before he came in, we found some picklock keys in the cupboard, in the same room where Mrs. Steward lives.</p>

               <p>PRISONER STEWARD'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I cannot express my affairs so well as I could wish, for I am deprived of council by these men who had my property; this day six weeks, the 2d of November, they approached my apartment forcibly; I was a washing, I had a great wash; I asked them for their authority, they did not produce it, they would not let me have it in my hand; I said do nothing rashly, let me have some person to be witness, if it is only the constable of the parish; this gentleman packed up my wearing apparel, I had a mangle in the house, I take in mangling and washing, they then picked up a trunk which they called a Peter, I paid eighteen shillings for the trunk, I have the receipt; I said here is nothing but what I have a receipt to prove; there were six silver tea spoons, tea tongs, buckles, seven gowns and my sheets, and two counterpanes, one never wetted; they acted like lions, had I been a Turk or an Infidel, they could not have acted with more barbarity; I have been six weeks in prison, I have had this man out of compassion to support, he was a sufferer, and a great one, he came inadvertently to the place during the interview they had with me, and he said Gentlemen, what demand have you with Mrs. Steward; says he, Gentlemen, send for the constable of the parish and see her righted, as she is without a friend, or any person present: I stand here as a prisoner, it is really truth though you may not believe it; Blacketer packed up my trunk, and there was three silk gowns, that any Gentlewoman in London might put on, and six silver tea spoons with S. S. engraved, which I paid for;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080185"/> they had my undeniable character in the neighbourhood; they even brought my fender and a set of fire irons, they were going to unscrew a pier glass; I said, Gentlemen, do not spoil the frame of my glass, which I worked very hard for, and eat a cold dinner of a Sunday; they only unscrewed one screw of the pier glass, which was to go before the magistrate, I desired them before the magistrate to commit me bailable; he then took four or five keys from a cupboard; now this man deals at Mr. Perrott's, and several ironmongers, he has iron to turn to the best advantage, he has imported them abroad by the dozens together, they are no picklock keys, and they were loose when they had them. I will endeavour to submit to your command, be it what it will, and the will of God, if you will but please to release this man, he is an innocent man; I am willing to submit to your command, was it death, so you please to release this man, he is innocent, and I am innocent, they brought my clothes to prison, after being in prison thirteen days; this Blacketer that appears against me, is acquainted with a Jew woman that deals in old clothes; there is a God above that knows the secrets of all hearts; there was a little boy that lives in our neighbourhood, with one Mr. Roper an auctioneer, this man after I tried to get him into place, the husband of this Jew woman suffered, and she had received a duplicate of this poor boy whom I kept from destruction, and this Mr. Milne out of charity gave the boy a shilling to bring her before Mr. Fakney, one of the Justice's of the rotation; he had a search warrant against me, these sheets were laid at my stair head out of villainy, and no other; I am as innocent as the baby unborn, I am willing to submit to the will of God; this woman gave an information of me in Tottenham Court-road; my imprisonment has brought me to destruction entirely.</p>

               <p>Court. What became of the clothes? - After thirteen days I had some of them sent, I was starving in the prison for eight days, and had nothing to relieve me, nor had this innocent man, my spoons and tea tongs were returned by Mr. Blacketer.</p>
               <p>PRISONER MILNE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord I live in the City I am a porter to auctioneers and brokers, I never was before a Judge or Justice in my life before, I gave a shilling to this boy, the sheets I never saw, as there is a just God in Heaven; these things were advertised on the 6th of November, on the 9th Blacketer brought down a porter with her trunk, and some apparel, and some plate, he charged two shillings, she paid him one and nine-pence, then he comes on the 13th teenth, and says, will you sell your fire irons and fender to Mr. Fletcher, no says she; said he, if I had known this I would have brought something against you, then he forcibly took from her, a Princes metal candlestick, between the gates of New-prison.</p>
               <p>Court to Blacketer. Did you receive any money for the things that you carried? - I received two shillings, then I came down again with a load of wet linnen, and poker, tongs and shovel, I gave the man one shilling each time, and I had nothing for my trouble at all.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that brought it? - A porter that came along with me from the office.</p>
               <p>Court. I should be glad to know if you take away things out of her house, is she to pay for bringing them again; upon my word an innocent person may be in a very pretty situation, if that is to be the case? - I brought them to prison by her desire, she promised to pay me, I paid the man two-shillings for bringing them down, upon my oath I paid two shillings, and I never had directly or indirectly any of that again.</p>
               <p>You have the man here I suppose? - No I have not, he saw me have no more than two shillings, I never put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>How came you to keep these things fourteen days? - I do not recollect that they were so long, they were advertised three times.</p>
               <p>Sayre. There were three or four pair of wet sheets, they were advertised, and people came and could not swear to them, when we were at Mrs. Steward's lodgings, she begged we would not let the woman of the house know, I said it was fit she should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080186"/> know; this woman has been convicted before.</p>
               <p>Court. But that you are not to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Steward. I never was? - I dare say she was.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know it yourself? - For shoplifting once.</p>
               <p>Do you know that of your own knowledge? - Yes, Mr. Akerman's servants know it.</p>
               <p>That man was not in the house when you first came in? - No he came in, in about ten minutes after the sheets were found.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner Steward. You was saying just now, that you had people that knew you, I suppose you have somebody to your character? - My landlady is not well my friends have attended all last week, I am innocently accused, but I am willing to submit to your pleasure, so as you will please to release this man.</p>

               <p>Where did go from the Bell? - I was going down Holborn to go home.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At Shadwell, there was a woman standing at the end of Union-court, asked me where I was going, and she asked me to go along with her, and I did go to the house where this woman mentions; I do not charge the prisoner with any thing of this, but what was afterwards.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at Williams's house? - I had not been in the house five minutes before I missed my watch and money, I immediately made an uproar in the house, and said I was robbed.</p>
               <p>How many women were there in company? - There were four, I believe; I insisted upon not going out of the house till I had my watch and money, I was in the house from about ten till about a quarter after twelve.</p>
               <p>Did the women that were in the house with you follow you out? - No, they were gone out before.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of those in the house? - I cannot say whether she was or not, I do not remember her face there.</p>
               <p>How long had you been out of the house before what you say happened? - I had but just got out of the house; when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080189"/> found I insisted on my property, they said, why, damn you, why did not you go and look in the room, and I went, and I found it underneath the bed, between the bed and the mattrass, after that I was going up the alley again, I met with the two women, the prisoner at the bar and another, I believe they were not the same women.</p>
               <p>Morris. My Lord, I only beg to say, the patrol never comes on duty till past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character.</p>
               <p>Court to Morris. Did the prosecutor appear to be drunk or sober? - He was sober, to the best of my judgment, he shewed me the house where he had been before; when I first came up, the prisoner and he were together.</p>
               <p>When you first saw them, had he hold of her? - Yes, she did not offer to resist, she was not above five or six yards from her own lodging, they all lodge in one court.</p>

(Produces it.) I was last in the room, and bolted the door myself, as I do every night, and take up the keys of the house; I locked the parlour door, which is next the passage, and took up the key.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the door next the yard unbolted? - No.</p>
               <p>Was that hole near one of the bolts? - It was, if they had been two minutes longer, they would have been in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I believe there is an end of the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the pieces of this door on the outside or inside? - I picked up this piece within the parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. We are upon very nice ground, here is a clear breaking, but in order to constitute this offence of burglary, there must be an entering as well as breaking; if there be any evidence of these people putting in their hand, there would be an entering:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080190"/> as for the entry, any, the least degree of it, with any part of the body, or an instrument held in his hand is sufficient, so as to step over the threshold, to put in a hand, or hook, or a pistol, to demand one's money, are all of them burglarious entries; but here they might cut these pieces out of the door without these pieces being in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Jury. The centre bit must go through, and so must the hand go through.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I fancy, my Lord, we have now got far enough for me to trouble your Lordship with an objection.</p>
               <p>Court. Go on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I take it to be a principle, and it is the practice of the law of England, that all points may be used in order to save the lives of prisoners; but I am perfectly convinced, that by your Lordship and by the Jury, many of whom are known to me to be men of good sense, and great humanity, no point will be pressed against the lives of the prisoners, I am perfectly convinced, that if this case depends on the question, whether half an inch or a quarter of an inch of the point of an instrument, has penetrated through the door, the lives of the prisoners are perfectly secure; but, I am to address myself to the question of law, and I will endeavour to confine myself very strictly to that question: I take the liberty of stating with great submission, that according to the ancient common law notion of burglary, it was indispensibly necessary that there should be a breaking, accompanied by an actual entry, that I take to be the ancient common law of England; the reason that burglary is considered as an offence highly criminal is, that it is an invasion of the security of the subject in his castle; I am aware that there have been some determinations, in which that ancient principle has certainly been considered with a degree of latitude in the construction, that is not always to be found in the determinations of the Judges, in questions of life; I am aware of those decisions which hold, that where a pane of glass is broken, and an instrument introduced noctanter, that that is a burglary; but, I may say without offence, that there are very great authorities, who wish it was a new question, and had not been so held; but, I take it the principle of all these new determinations is this, there is such a breaking of the castle of the proprietor, that his property may be taken out through the aperture; and I take the principle of those determinations, which speaks of an instrument introduced, to mean not the instrument by which the breaking is made, but an instrument by which the property of the proprietor is removed, introduced subsequent to the act of breaking, and after it is complete; here the introduction of the instrument is part of the act of breaking, and no man living can say, that this centre bit was introduced for the purpose of taking out the property of the proprietor, no, it was for the purpose of breaking into the domicile of the proprietor; and I admit that, as to that branch of the crime it is complete, but the Court will not say, that the introduction of the instrument for breaking, was for the purpose of taking out the property; if there had been the least property of Mr. Brown near this hole, that the hand or a hook could have removed if introduced, subsequent to the breaking, I do admit I could have had nothing to say on the subject; as to all the cases that have been mentioned of the introduction of a hand, a foot over the threshold, or a pistol, they all seem to proceed on the idea, that the breaking is precedently complete, and this is considered as an act of dominion over the property of the owner, acquired by the breaking; as where a pistol is introduced, by which terror is applied to the true man to compel him to part with his goods; but there is no case which has said, that the introduction of an instrument in the act of breaking, shall satisfy both the distinct requisites of the offence, namely breaking and entry to steal; suppose instead of being the case of a door, which is pierced with the centre bit, this had been a brick wall, broken with a pick-ax, and it had appeared that the pick-ax had necessarily been within the wall, would the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080191"/> Court have held, that this, besides being a breaking, was an entry into the dwelling house to steal? I assure myself that however imperfectly, I have on the sudden, stated the argument, the Court will not in a case of life, extend the law one iota beyond the letter of former determinations, and will not think themselves warranted to construe this case upon the evidence to come within the definition of a burglary.</p>

               <p>The Judges concurred with the Council, and directed the Jury to acquit the prisoners on this indictment; and ordered another indictment to be preferred against them, for breaking the door in the night time, with intention to commit a felony.</p>

               <p>Was there an attempt made to rescue her? - Upon my coming in, the father and mother both fell upon me, and there were two or three women in the house besides; my nephew and the constable and I, went together, and we brought her away.</p>
               <p>Was the letter produced in her presence before the Justice? - Certainly it was, and read before him by the clerk.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - When she was before the Justice, she denied the writing of it, one of the lodgers came in, and was asked whether it was her hand writing, he said, he had seen her write cleverer; the Justice made her write twice over in the office, the boy picked her out before all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080192"/> the rest, and she still continued to deny it; the Justice's clerk told her not to own it, but deny it, I cannot tell her answer, she never acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>You knew the prisoner before? - Yes, I have seen her before, she has been a great affliction to my family, by some particular connection with my son.</p>
               <p>Had she ever at any time previous to this, expressed any resentment against you or your family in your hearing? - No, when I found their connections, I bound my son apprentice to Mr. Moulton, stationer, in Chancery-lane; in a fortnight after he was bound, this girl would not let him alone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. Is your name

               <p>Nothing particular passed between you and the boy? - No further than asking his name and where he lived, the Justice gave the boy strict charge to be in the way when he was wanted, instead of which, he was sent out of the way, and sent down to Scotland: the boy's name is

               <p>Have you ever seen her write? - No, from the expressions I believe it to be her's.</p>
               <p>What have you heard her say respecting the letter? - The words mentioned in the letter, excepting setting the house on fire; all that infamous language, the latter end of last summer, going by my door, to me and our servant.</p>
               <p>How came she to make use of this sort of language to you? - Upon the account, I imagine, of my brother, she lived with him; she threatened one night, but I cannot tell the day of the month, that she would go and get drunk and break the windows, and threatened to come and cut our maid's bloody melt out; I have heard her make use of very indecent expressions, in the very words of that letter.</p>
               <p>You have read the letter? - I have, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, you have heard her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080193"/> make use of the same expressions as those in the letter? - I have.</p>
               <p>Or of expressions of a like tendency? - The same words partly, Sir, what are in the letter, them infamous words; I have never seen her write, but I have seen her writing in books and things.</p>
               <p>Did you see her on the day this letter was brought? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not wish to ask her to repeat the words unnecessarily; do you know any thing of this boy that brought this letter that you are speaking of? - No, on the 14th of November he brought this letter, I never saw him before; the boy said before Justice Haines, she gave him a halfpenny to deliver the letter.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Have you any knowledge of this business yourself? - I know the prisoner very well, and I really believe she is the person that sent the letter.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing yourself respecting the sending or writing? - A child knocked at my master's door with the letter, and I took it from a little boy, I did not see the prisoner then; I never saw her write, I never heard her say she would send a letter, she has threatened me; she has called me a bloody old mare.</p>
               <p>Court. Any expressions made use of by the prisoner are admissible evidence, but whether they are relevant, will be a point afterwards to be considered. You have heard her make use of expressions similar to those that are in the letter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear any particular threat of revenge against Mr. Vaughan? - She has used him exceedingly ill, and called him equal and worse, I can safely say, than what was in that letter.</p>
               <p>Court to Vaughan. Have you any knowledge what became of this boy, after he had been examined before the Magistrate? - The woman where he lodged, took him with her out of the place, afterwards I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard the prisoner say any thing about him since? - I never spoke to the prisoner but once, and that was when she made her escape out of Bridewell, and I heard her say nothing; I did not mean to touch her life, but to chastise her for her insults.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The jit of the offence, is the threat, and the letter being without a name, for the writing an indecent letter *, however gross the offence may be against public decency, is not the offence against this statute: now, this boy being out of the way, there does not appear to be sufficient evidence to call upon the prisoner for her defence; the only evidence is, that she has been heard to make use of expressions grossly indecent, similar to those contained in a part of this very abominable letter, but with an exception to that part which is the threat to burn the house; therefore, it would be too much to presume, from persons having heard the prisoner make use of the very indecent expressions that resemble those in the letter, that she either wrote or sent this letter: the person who brought the letter being out of the way, there is no sort of evidence who sent it, nor who wrote it; but if you think it necessary, I will call on her, and hear her defence.</p>
               <p>* The letter itself was set forth in the indictment, and, of necessity, read in Court, but being totally improper for publication, is therefore not inserted in this Trial.</p>
               <p>Jury. There is no occasion now, my Lord.</p>

               <p>A good many people were in the street at the time? - There was no watch.</p>
               <p>Where did he first meet with you? - In Moorfields, and from thence to Old-street, then to Smithfield.</p>
               <p>He kept close to you? - He swore he would not leave me without it; he offered no violence, farther than taking hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>What is Crank? - He is the person that took him.</p>
               <p>He committed no violence in Smithfield? - None at all.</p>

               <p>You did not go through Austin-friars together? - No, not to my knowledge, I was no ways in his company, nor knew any thing about it.</p>
               <p>There is a print-shop, where he stood behind the</p>
               <p>'Change, now recollect yourself? - I recollect very clearly he did not, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Then from Moorfields you walked into Old-street-road, behind St. Luke's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go to Smithfield? - We came back through Aldersgate-street, and then he would follow me into Bull and Mouth Street till we turned off, and we turned into Smithfield through one part of Little Britain; I was very much confused.</p>
               <p>How many hundred people did you meet in your way? - I met several, no doubt, and I thought making an alarm might be of consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080195"/>What was you afraid of? - I was afraid of my person, he was a more active man than I.</p>
               <p>The shops were not shut? - I was afraid he would have done me some injury.</p>
               <p>What injury could he have done to you by calling people to your assistance? - I thought it was more prudent to let him go to where I was known, I did not apply to any person to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>When he told you his clothes were in pawn, did he tell you his name and where he lived? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>When you went into Smithfield, he waited for you? - Yes, and he came into the door after I had spoke to the man to assist me.</p>
               <p>What was it that he said; was you given charge of that night? - I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Did he give charge of you? - I believe he might after he was in custody, he charged me with nothing, not a word of any thing that night, the charge he made against me was before the sitting Alderman, after he was going to be committed.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it very strange, that a man should follow you through all these populous streets, and that he never once pulled out a pistol, or any one single thing to intimidate you? - So it was.</p>
               <p>When he was taken into custody, was he searched? - Yes, there were no arms.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell him after he told you his situation, that you would relieve him? - I told him at last, being very much intimidated, that if I could borrow a guinea, I would relieve him? - I was going to Helmet-row, to Mr. Dobson, the Parish Clerk of St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>What part of Moorfields was you in when he stopped you? - The part next the Artillery-ground next the rails.</p>
               <p>Then you was not affraid to walk in a lonesome street? - I was obliged to walk, I could not lay down.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by laying down? - When he demanded this money, I was a good deal of this side Chiswell-street.</p>
               <p>Now sir, that night when you charged him with the watch; upon your oath, did not he charge the watch with you? - Never sir, till after the constable had come and got him in custody, and was taking him out of the door, he then said I charge you with that gentleman.</p>
               <p>How came you not five minutes ago, to say that he did not charge you at all? - That is a matter that did not strike me, I meant a charge against me for any crime, he said nothing about any crime.</p>
               <p>What did he tell the constable to take you into custody for, did not he charge you with a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime? - That I attempted to commit an unnatural crime upon him.</p>
               <p>And did not he that very night Mr. Swift, when you was taken into custody? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Take care what you say? - He did not, no sir, I bless God, I pay some regard to my word, and my oath, it certainly was not said for what the charge was made.</p>
               <p>Then you never heard for what the charge was made, till you came before the Magistrate? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court. You came from the Borough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was going to a friend of yours in Old-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you get into Moorfields? - It is the road I generally go, through Austin Friars, I went to spend two or three hours with my friend, he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go home again? - I intended to go round to Smithfield, as this man was with me, and intended to follow me.</p>
               <p>What carried you into Smithfield? - This man said he would follow me, and persisted in it, and I thought I would let him follow me.</p>
               <p>All London lay between Old-street, and the Borough, in the direct road home again? - I thought I would take him to where I was known.</p>
               <p>Smithfield was very much out of your way? - I often call there.</p>
               <p>Had you any intention of calling there that night? - I believe I had, I often call there of an evening.</p>
               <p>That is no answer to my question? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080196"/> My particular view certainly was in taking the man there, as he was determined to follow me, I knew nobody between there and Old-street.</p>
               <p>Between six and seven at night, in the evening, all the houses were open, why did not you call for assistance? - I was fearful of the consequences.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, would you have this case go any further.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolton, one of the Jury. My Lord, we are all astonished the prosecutor did not call for assistance.</p>

               <p>Court. You are a witness to this oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you was present with the Surrogate, and saw the prisoner sworn in the usual manner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And all that is at the back of the will, excepting the signature, is your hand writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who gave you instructions for writing what is below the attestation? - Nobody in particular.</p>
               <p>How came you to put it down? - We always give them the description what they were on board of ship, I asked the prisoner, and in consequence of his information, I wrote that description on the paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I see that the Doctor's certificate is, that somebody, whom you take to be the prisoner, swore that he was the executor, and that the effects of the testator did not amount to such a sum? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was the purport of the oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that was all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people do you think, you have carried since September, and in September, down to the present time, to be sworn? - It is impossible for me to tell.</p>
               <p>Some hundreds? - There may be so, but not so many of late, owing to so many having suffered.</p>
               <p>Not so many of late, but you cannot tell what it is owing to; is it at all singular for a man to kiss his thumb instead of kissing the book, I know it happens in the common law courts frequently? - I took particular notice of it.</p>

               <p>Generally with people that cannot read or write? - I have seen marks.</p>

               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Chetwood as follows.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, This is an indictment as you have heard against the gentleman at the bar, for wilfully and maliciously firing at Huxley Sandon, Esq; a loaded pistol: Gentlemen there is no attempt on the part of the prosecutor, to carry this further than the facts will go,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080204"/> therefore I shall only say in opening this case to you, that the prosecutor and the prisoner, had been for a long time in habits of friendship, the prisoner always had access to the house of the prosecutor, and they were in great friendship and intimacy; sometime since it was supposed the prisoner was going to France, or Italy, and he went to the house of the prosecutor, and prevailed on the wife of the prosecutor to accompany him to Dover, and accordingly she did accompany him to Dover; the prosecutor enraged and angry at that time, no doubt of it, pursued his wife and his friend to Dover, however they cluded the search, and came back to town: Information was given after several endeavours to find them, that they were at a Bagnio, in Long Acre, the prosecutor and his friends went to search there, they were denied, but the prosecutor and his friends had reason to think that they either were in the house, or coming to the house, as they had been in the house, and were very well known there, the man said at first they were not there, and he did not know them. However from several expressions, the prosecutor and his friends were convinced that they did know the prisoner, and in a little while after they heard the feet of two people walking, as if in great confusion over their heads, and they were then pretty well satisfied, that the prisoner at the bar was in the house, and was in company with Mrs. Sandon, who has been the unfortunate cause of this prosecution; Gentlemen, the prosecutor and his friends went up stairs, there they met a servant, coming out of a room with a candle in her hand, and one of the friends of the prosecutor took a candle from her, and they were going to enter the room, Mr.

             the husband, was going in first, he was willing and desirous to be thoroughly satisfied, whether the prisoner and his wife were there or not, and immediately a pistol was fired by somebody; that it was loaded, was most certain, because the ball passed through a part of his hat, there was no light in the room at the time, but however, he saw by the firing of the pistol, that it was perhaps the prisoner at the bar, he was pretty positive at that time, however, they called fresh assistance and took the prisoner and Mrs. Sandon; the witnesses will inform you, in what situation they found the prisoner at the bar, and how they found Mrs. Sandon, I believe they were both armed at that time, Mrs. Sandon had pistols loaded in her hand, as well as the prisoner; whether or no, the prisoner was the person that fired the pistol at Mr. Sandon, it will be for you to enquire; there is little doubt, I should apprehend, that it will be proved to be him; if you find that he fired the pistol, you will have no difficulty in pronouncing him guilty of shooting, maliciously and feloniously, against Mr. Sandon: Gentlemen, we shall call our witnesses and prove the facts; and if you believe he was the person that fired the pistol at the prosecutor, you will find him guilty.</p>

               <p>Were they armed? - The lady was, but I do not recollect seeing pistols in the Count's hands, I saw pistols in the lady's hands, the lady said she would fire at the first that came in, for she would sooner die than go with them.</p>
               <p>Did the lady mention any names, or had any been mentioned to her? - No Sir, she said she would kill the first that came in, she would fire at the first that came in, for she would sooner die, than go with them.</p>
