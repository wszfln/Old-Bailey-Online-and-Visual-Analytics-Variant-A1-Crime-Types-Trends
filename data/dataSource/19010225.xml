About 11.15 p.m. on Friday, February 1st, I was with Detective Sergeant Matthews in Cheapside—I saw Devine sitting down, and another man, followed by Barry, a yard or two behind, stop at the corner of Lawrence Lane—the three spoke together—Devine left them and went into the doorway of No. 98, and closed the door—Barry laid across an iron post at the corner of the turning, looking up and down the street—Devine came out of the doorway after about a minute, spoke to them again, and went back into the doorway—Barry then crossed the street to opposite No. 98—meeting an officer, I crossed the street to see what Devine wag doing, and saw him turning round in the doorway, which is about 5 ft. deep from the shop front—he was putting something up his sleeve—I caught hold of him, and asked him what ho was doing there—he said, "Nothing," and commenced to struggle violently—it took four officers to get him to the station—outside the door this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was taken away from him in the struggle, from the same hand I saw him put up his sleeve—it was handed to me—Barry was arrested as he was facing the shop door—they were taken to the station and charged with attempting to break and enter this jeweller's shop at 98, Cheapside, and also having housebreaking instruments on them by night—I saw this steel saw found on Devine—on Barry I found about 4 1/2d. and a pen<lb/>knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Barry.</hi> You came from the direction of Newgate Street—I did not see you strike a light—I found no tobacco pipe on you—you asked me for some tobacco, but it is against the rules to smoke in the station—no cigarettes were thrown away—there is no basket in the station.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MATTHEWS (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant, City</hi>). I was with Bacon—I saw Barry and two others going down Cheapside from the Post Office—they stood for a moment or two at the top of Lawrence Lane—Devine went into Mr. Alderton's doorway at 98, Cheapside—in about two minutes he came and spoke to Barry and the other man—Barry crossed to the corner of Queen Street, and watched—Devine went back to the doorway</p>

               <p>—after about two minutes Bacon crossed the street, and I assisted him in arresting Devine—four of us took him to the station—he attempted to get something from his sleeve; it was taken from him—other officers Arrested Barry—they were taken to the station and charged with having housebreaking instruments, and attempting to break and enter—Barry said he had been drinking—I did not see him asking for a light—a clay pipe was found on him, but no cigarettes or tobacco, that I saw.</p>

On the afternoon of January 26th, with other officers, I visited Wickham's rooms at 141, Shakespeare Road, Herne Hill—I said to Wickham, "I am a police officer, and I am informed that you have got a quilt in your possession which was stolen from Clapham; also that you have got other stolen property in your possession"—he said he had not any stolen quilt or any other stolen property—I said, "That being so, do you mind my searching your room?"—he said, "No"—I searched the front room, which is used as a bedroom, and found under the bed this portmanteau—I said, "Is this your property?"—he said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190102250006"/>
               <p>"Yes"—I said, "Are its contents yours, and where did you get them from?"—he said, "I bought it from <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Daley, and gave him 4s. 6d. for it, about a fortnight ago"—I said, "Was there anything inside it?"—he said, "It contained shirts, clothing, and a quantity of papers"—I pointed out to him that the lock had been cut out of the portmanteau, and said, "Did you ask Daley how that was done, and how he obtained the portmanteau?"—he said, "No," but thought that Daley said that he got it from a cousin—assisted by officers, I searched the room—I found a great quantity of ladies' and gentlemen's clothing, which had been mutilated—the names were cut off, and it was torn about, but some was marked "W. T. D. Bodkin," and there were books with the same name, which Wickham said were in the portmanteau when he bought it—I then said, "I shall arrest you for receiving this property, well knowing it to have been stolen"—he said, "All right; I cannot say anything, as you have found the property here"—I took him to Brixton Police-station, where he was detained—about nine that night Daley was brought to the station—in Wickham's presence, I said to Daley, "I am a police officer, and this man," referring to Wickham, "says that he bought a portmanteau of you about a fortnight ago"—Daley said he had not sold him anything—the portmanteau was shown to Daley, but he still denied having sold it to Wickham. Wickham said to Daley, "You did bring it to my house," and shortly afterwards he said, "I went to live at Shakespeare Road in September last; Daley brought to my house a white cardboard box, containing ladies' clothing, and a kind of tunic; just before Christmas he brought a parcel containing books; a fortnight ago he brought the portmanteau, which contained clothes and papers, and that is the portmanteau which was found under my bed"—I read over to Daley what Wickham had said—Daley said, "It is true; and now I will tell you what he has done. About the middle of last October I used to work at Hayes, Cotton &amp; Cos, Acre Lane, scenery people. <hi rend="italic">Me</hi> and another <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> broke into the place, whilst Wickham watched outside for a policeman. We broke into the place through a window at the back, and took a shawl and other things. We broke in again on another occasion, and took out a portmanteau. Wickham was with me then, and all the things were taken to his place, and were pawned by him. I afterwards started for Lavington Brothers, and Wickham went with me to the Mid<lb/>land Railway, Whitecross Street, from where we took a bag of lace; all of it was on cardboard. He has been selling it, while I had some of the money. We took it to Wickham's house. We next had a case of boots from Nine Elms; the boots were in cardboard boxes; we took the case from the down shed; and that was about a month or six weeks before Christmas. About two or three days before Christmas we had a turkey, cake, pudding, two picture books, and a white tablecloth; that was in a hamper from Nine Elms. About a fortnight ago I took the portmanteau from the down shed at Nine Elms, and took it to Wickham's house the same day. Wick<lb/>ham took it in, and I believe he gave me 5s. 6d. for it. Wickham said I had the stuff. When he says I was with him, he is telling lies. I was not with him when ho <hi rend="italic">sneaked</hi> it"—they were then charged, Daley with stealing the portmanteau, and Wickham with receiving it—Daley said, "He has rounded on me, and I will <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on him"—Wickham made no reply.</p>

               <p>—on January 18th, about 7.30 p.m., Mrs. May brought the child to me—she was apparently in a dying condition—the head was in a filthy condition, and full of lice and sores, the result of irritation by the lice; the hair was covered with nits—the body was emaciated—the state of the head would be of long standing—there was no organic disease—I prescribed for the child, and I was fetched the next day—I found it rather worse; in fact, I did not expect it to last more than an hour or so—it died the following morning—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—it weighed 26lb.—the normal weight of a child of that age (five years) would be about 48lb. or 49lb.—there was a total absence of subcutaneous fat, and the child was very bloodless—the upper stomach contained some recently digested food—the lower intestimes were shrivelled, empty, and transparent—the conclusion I arrived at was that the child died from starvation—there was no evidence of organic disease in any of the organs—the irritation alone would be maddening and weakening—the child's condition before death would have been observable to anybody, probably for weeks—the heads of the other children were in almost as bad a condition—the back room was certainly not fit for habitation—the eldest child seemed a little weak; the other two were fairly healthy, except the state of their heads.</p>

I am a clerk at Lloyd's Bank, St. James's Street Branch—on January 31st this order for a cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was received—it purports to be signed by Mr. Walter Levett, who has an account there, of 10, Wilton Street, Belgravia—I compared the signature with Mr. Levett's signature, and they did not at all agree—in consequence I wrote to Mr. Levett, saying that as the signature differed considerably, we should be glad to have the order confirmed—I subsequently received this letter, saying, "It is quite correct; the difference may be because I am in bed"—I thereupon despatched the cheque-book to that address—it contained 60 forms, Nos. 44661 to 44720—the cheque produced, and marked "A," is the first out of that book.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My tram car was blocked by the traffic, and it might start at any moment—I did not stay more than a minute in the shop, and went out as soon as Mr. Griffiths came in—I was considerably surprised and startled by hearing the shot and what I saw in the shop—the woman's body and the man's were the main things which concentrated my attention—I remember that the steps were not fully stretched out, but nearly fully; the cord was limp—one rope appeared tighter than the other—I did say before the Coroner, "They were opened wide to the full length of the rope"—my memory misled me—I could not see the body without looking round the side of the steps—the woman was on the floor, parallel with the counter, and her hat was touching this window partition; her feet were between the steps and the counter—the man's body was not actually on the floor, but leaning against the packages; his feet were on the floor—the woman's feet were between 2ft. and 3ft. from the man's body—I stepped over the woman's feet and got about half way past the steps—the bottom step is broader than the top—between the nearest part of the bottom step there was about a foot and a half to the counter; the counter recedes underneath—you can put three stacks of wood under it: it is about 4ft. high—the side of the steps would be at an angle—that would broaden the passage at the top of the counter—there would be only 6in. from the glass case to the steps; the top part would be just double—no portion of the steps was under the glass case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman, of 94, Fleet Road, Hampetead—the deceased, John Bellis, was one of my nephews—he was 24 last April—at one time I carried on business at Penton Street, Penton<lb/>ville, but have been away six years, and he was my assistant there, and also his brother, Edward—Penton Street is near Amwell Street—I have seen the prisoner in the shop there as a customer, and in that way her acquaintance with my nephew was made—when I gave up that business I left ray nephews behind to carry it on for somebody else—I had the intention of returning, and went to live in Wales—I returned to London in 1900, and in March took a business with the object of establish<lb/>ing my nephew John, who was assisted by his brother Edward for two months or more—I was on the premises between March and May, when Mrs. Griffiths came there; she was not with me on the two former occasions, and the prisoner came and had tea with me and my nephew John; that was the only occasion I saw her in the living part of the house—in May I went into regular residence with my wife—I do not think I saw the prisoner again in 1900—we</p>

               <p>close on Thursdays between five and six, and on Sundays my nephew was free all the year round—he never mentioned that he was continuing to see the prisoner from time to time from May to September, but I knew it—I never saw them together between those dates after the Sunday when they had tea, but I believe his Sunday evenings were spent in her company—he went to Wales to spend Christmas and was away five days—the week after Christmas my wife brought me a letter, which I read carefully and gave it back to her—I did not know the writing—Edward Bellis was not back there after June—I do not know of a meeting between my nephew John and the prisoner after Christmas—there was a difference between the brothers before Edward left, and he left partially on that account—I did not close early on Thursday, January 10th, nor in November or December—I close ordinarily at 10 p.m.—on Thursday, January 10th, I was going out at a quarter to eight, and saw the prisoner—she did not go to the shop, but walked past me—Amwell Street is three miles from Fleet Road—my nephew did not go out that night; he was in the shop when I went out, and I found him there when I came back—there was no one else to attend to the shop—it was his habit to go to the Welsh labernacle, Charing Cross, when he was free, and he went out to go there on Sunday evening, January 13th, I do not know at what time, or when he came back—on Monday, January 14th, I contemplated placing an oil engine in the shop, quite at the end of the counter—a piece had been taken away in the morning, but the engine was not put up—some packages had been removed from the spot and placed on the floor, and that allowed an uninterrupted view by anyone who stood at the front of the counter to see persons at the back of the counter—I hang brushes or broom-heads on hooks on the shop ceiling—steps for the use of the shop are kept sometimes at the door and sometimes at the back of the shop—we put anything out of our hands on the side counter; starch would be kept there—some brushes like these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) were hanging near the door prior to 3 o'clock, and some broom-heads like these—I believe I gave some instructions to my nephew John about the brushes prior to 3 o'clock—I went from the kitchen or parlour through the doorway to the shop on the Monday afternoon, prior, I believe, to 3 o'clock—I went to the back of the shop to the cistern, and as I was going back I looked into the shop and saw the prisoner standing about the middle of the counter, where a customer would stand, and on the customers' side—she had a pair of gloves in her hand—there was no one else on the shop side of the counter—I could not see my nephew; he would be obscured from my view by the packages, which were about a foot from where the engine was afterwards placed—I did not hear a word spoken—I did not speak to the prisoner, or recognise her in any way—I returned to the kitchen, where I had left my wife, and found her there, and in about a minute I heard three shots; about equally distant—I did not think they were pistol shots; they were reports—immediately afterwards I heard someone call out for the police—I went into the shop and saw my nephew—his back was partly to the door, and his face from it—his head went down, with his right arm up—he was supported on the packages behind him—I believe he reached the ground—his feet were</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When Edward Bellis left in June it was in consequence of some friction that was not connected with the prisoner's visits to the shop—when my attention was first attracted to the steps my nephew had been taken away from the shop; the loose packages had then been removed.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, of Hampstead—shortly after 3 p.m. on January 14th I was called to 94, Fleet Road, where I found Bellis sitting on the ground, with his head supported by his aunt—he was breathing badly—I found a punctured shot wound over the left side of the middle line of his lip, and an exit wound at the lower edge of the same lip, a little to the right of the entrance wound—one of the lateral incisors was knocked out, the tooth just behind the wound—there was very little blackening on the entry wound, which I believe to be dirt off the bullet—his moustache was not singed—I found nothing to indicate that the wound had been inflicted at close quarters—it would bleed extensively—on the base of this bullet there is a small depression.</p>

               <p>which might be due to its coming in contact with the tooth—the second wound was behind the left ear, which was also a pistol-shot wound—there, was burning all round it, and the hair was singed and blackened by powder—it wouid bed a good deal at first—it afterwards became filled up with brain matter, which prevented it bleeding later—the effect of such a wound would be immediate unconsciousness, or within a second—the bullet remained in the brain; he would fall at once—I should say that the pistol was fired within a very few inches—on receipt of the first wound, I should say the head was leaning forward, and somewhat rotated to the right—there was a splash of blood radiating, about the size of my hand, at the end of the counter—I believed it to come from the face wound—I should say he would be capable of walking after that wound—it would be painful, but would not stun—I should say the blood would fall on the ground, and, when he stool up, on himself—there was a larger pool of blood under his head—there was a good deal of blood down the front, and some down the side and collar—I saw no disarrangement of his clothes—I gave him what attention I could—I sent him to the hospital—I observed an abrasion on the prisoner's right temple—I did not observe any blood between the two patches—I should say the face wound was inflicted at a distance of about 2ft., and was the first—if there had been a struggle I should expect to find blood-marks on both parties—his feet were towards the counter—none of the articles in the shop had been disturbed indicating a struggle.</p>

               <p>right half of the brain was perforated by a kind of channel 1 1/2in. long, at the end of which I found this bullet (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) embedded in the brain—the front tooth was broken off—the moustache was not singed, or the lips—there was nothing to indicate that the mouth wound had been inflicted at close quarters, except powder marks on the left side of the face—that might be from either shot, or both—the pistol must have been within a few feet for the face to have powder marks—there was singeing all round the other wound, and blackening by powder, which indicated that the pistol must have been fired within a few inches—the body was roughly measured by my assistant, after the skull-cap had been removed, at 5ft. 11in.</p>

You need not put yourself out in the very least for me. I suppose you sought some very attractive company on Sunday, and this is the benefit I reap, being put in the background, as per usual. Never mind, you can do your worst." <hi rend="italic">Another stated:</hi> "Old Griffiths has just passed here, packed up with baskets and oil-cans; he never looks in this direction, and when he sees me walking along Penton Street he darts in the shop as though he had been shot.

She confesses to be a good, religious woman, but she has proved herself to be a vile hypocrite. She has tried to sow seeds of discord between Jack and I ever since she came back from Wales, and I guess the prospect of losing ₤40 proved too great for him, for although he said he would scorn her, he has turned coward to me; but be shall lose everything. My only wish is, that you will not go in black for me. When I am buried you are to wear bright coloured clothes. My money and engagement ring is for mother; May is to have my bracelets, and Ada can have my other things; but send Lydia my night-dress, case and satchel. Please pass this revolver over to Arthur; ask him to sell it, and give mother the money: I gave 35s. for it.

               <p>bigamy—he gave me a retainer, instructing Mr. Cudby to defend him—I had several interviews with him, so did Mr. Cudby—I saw him a day or two before his trial at Newgate, when he asked me whom we had selected to defend him—he mentioned several names, amongst which were Mr. C. F. Gill, Mr. Horace Avory, Mr. Bodkin, Mr. Hutton, and Lord Coleridge—I told him those gentlemen would want very different fees, probably, to what others would, and if he could find the necessary fees we should employ Mr. Gill—I received from him first ₤24 1s. 6d., and afterwards a cheque for two guineas—I accounted for those sums to my master, who employed Counsel to defend him, and he was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment—in consequence of a letter of September 24th, 1897, I saw him in Hollo<lb/>way—I saw him again there in consequence of receiving a letter of October 13th, 1897—I saw him again very shortly after his release—at these interviews he never said that the money was obtained by fraud—I first heard that a charge was made against me with reference to the two-guinea cheque, at the Guildhall—I had then ceased to act for Mr. Cudby, and was assisting Mr. Deakin, a solicitor who was proceeding against several persons in one of Mrs. Cathcart's matters—these people were trying to get bogus orders against the lady—I attended an inquiry before Master Wilberforce to review the taxation of costs and the conduct of certain solicitors on February 19th, 1900—I was subpoenaed on behalf of Mrs. Cathcart, but could not attend because of the summons at the Guildhall, charging me with obtaining a cheque for two guineas by false pretences—Heckford appeared, was sworn, and gave evidence—I never said to him that I wanted the cheque for Court fees—the Alderman refused to commit, and the prosecutor was bound over to prosecute—in March I appeared at the Old Bailey on an application to enlarge the recognizances to the next Session, the Recorder refused—I saw the prisoner on September 22nd at the Sidney Arms, East Harbour Street, close to the Thames Police-court, in consequence of a letter he wrote to my father—Heckford, my father, G. W. Eyres, Tomkins, and myself were present—the prisoner's first words to me were, "I hope you will bury the hatchet"—I said I did not know about any hatchet, but I wanted him to give a statement of the truth which he was to give me to show the duplicity and conspiracy which had existed between him and Deakin to get me out of the way on February 19th, when I was supposed to attend the High Court—he told me that Deakin found all the money, and had given directions for Court fees to be inserted in the information, and that the Jury had thrown out the bill; that Deakin had promised him ₤10, and had given him ₤2 on account, and he sued Deakin for the balance at the Whitechapel County Court—I cannot pledge my oath whether I had any conversation with the prisoner after September 22nd—I regret to say that I have been in trouble two or three times.</p>

About 8.10 p.m. on January 31st I was on duty in Caledonian Road—I heard a whistle blow—I went to the Queen's Arms—I found the prisoner detained by several people—he was excited—after entering the saloon bar, several people said that the prisoner had followed and stabbed a young woman—I asked for the knife, and it was handed to me about 10 minutes afterwards—I took the prisoner to King's Cross Police-station—on the way he said, "I will do for her yet, if I am in that place at Newgate"—he was charged, and made no reply.</p>

On January 31st I was present about 9 p.m. at the Police-station, when the prisoner was charged—he made no reply—I was afterwards told by Inspector Millard that the prisoner wished to see me in his cell, and I went there with Millard—the prisoner said, "You know me?"—I said, "Yes"—I had known him before—h said, "I want to tell you something about this. I was out all last night with a man named Curly; he during the night told me he had seduced my girl, Maggie Morris. I met Maggie at six this evening; I said to her, 'Have you been speaking to any of those fellows down at the White Hart public-house?' She said, 'I do not know any of them.' I said, 'I am told two or three of them seduced you.' She said, Only one of the fellows had any connection with me.' I said, 'Was you drunk?' She said, 'Yes.' I said, 'He has took a liberty with you during my absence, and I will take one with him,' and I went to look for him, but could not find him. She then commenced to laugh at me. I lost my temper. I took the knife from the butcher's block, and ran across after her. She ran into the public-house, and I followed her. I only done it to frighten her. If I had any intention of injuring her, I could have taken it across the road, and have done it"—that statement is signed.</p>

Schmieder &amp; Co., 149, Gray's Inn Road, W.C.—on March 3rd we received another order, and a further one on March 7th, all from the Judd Company—we wrote to</p>

C. Matusch, c/o Griffin Manufacturing Company, 18, Appold Street" (<hi rend="italic">Asking them to call a meeting of the creditors of the Judd Company, to investigate its affairs; failing which, they would have a petition filed in Court, to compel that action being taken.</hi>)—it was returned by E. A. F. Matusch with this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had just returned from a journey, and found the letter to his brother, that the Griffin Company had no connection with Judd's, that his brother was not there, nor had anything to do with the Griffin Company, that he was then in Berlin, and he knew his brother had discharged all debts, bogus claims and money-lenders excepted.</hi>)—I subsequently sent another registered letter, which was returned marked "Not known"—this is the envelope, dated February 20th.</p>

Schmieder and Co. and the Griffin Manufacturing Company as their references—we communicated with the references, and got this letter from Schmieder—(<hi rend="italic">Saying that they had known Mr. Hirsch two and a half years as a highly respectable and honest man; that they trusted his firm for ₤100 and more, as they required, and that their payments had been prompt.</hi>)—we got this letter from the Griffin Company, dated August 16th, 1899, signed by F. C. Matusch as director—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that they had known Mr. Hirsch about three years as a highly respectable and honest man, that they trusted him with what he required up to ₤100, and that they were sure he would not buy anything he could not pay for.</hi>)—in consequence of those references we supplied them with paper value ₤12 1s. 9d.—it has never been paid for—we applied several times—we communicated with the Griffin Company by letter—they wrote saying that they would see Hirsch &amp; Co., and tell them they must settle up, and that they were quite safe—we wrote to Schmieder, and I believe we got a reply, but we cannot find it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hornchurch, Essex, and am a consulting engineer, of 17, Gracechurch Street—a few years ago we had some small engineering works, called the Vulcan Iron Works, at Bow—in 1898 we sold the machinery we had there to Messrs, Harvey &amp; Williams, Ltd.—the prisoner Harvey was a director of the company—we did not give them any right to use our name—the machinery passed by delivery—they kept our name on the door for one or two weeks, and when I was calling there on other business I objected to it, and they took it down—I have been there occasionally since to collect rent, and have seen Harvey there—I know Mr. Fenner; he lives about half a mile from me—I have no office at 161, Strand—I never gave anybody permission to use my name there or on any other premises—I heard of it from Mr. Fenner about the middle of September—these two letters sent to Mr. Fenner and the International Oil Company as references were not sent with my knowledge or authority—the heading of the paper is something like ours—we carried on business at Bow for about two years—I went to 161, Strand, on September 18th, and saw Harvey—"McMullen and Co." was on the door—I complained to Harvey at his using our name, and said he had no right to do so; he said he did not mind much what name he used, and he would take it down, but having bought our business previously, he thought he had a right to use the name—I said I was going to take whatever steps I could to prevent his using our name—I do not think I said anything about the note-paper on that occasion—on the 19th I went down to Ware Park Mills—the mill was stationary; no one was in it, and it was shut up—I went to the house adjoining, where I saw a lady who apparently was the sole occupier—I do not know what her name was.</p>

Carter &amp; Bell—I did not see any letter book there after Harvey left—a lot of note-paper there was destroyed—this typewriter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is exactly like the one that was there; it is a Williams; one was taken away—I got paid for one week—I did not go down to Matusch—I was paid for the week I was there for Messrs.

               <p>them—sometimes his younger brother, E. A. F. Matusch, would dictate them—I took down references for Harvey, or for the Hertford Engineer<lb/>ing Company—I saw Harvey occasionally at the Griffin Company—I was there for not quite six months—I was there when Matusch was taken into custody—when Harvey came he saw Matusch—when ordinary people came to see Matusch they either sent in their cards or put their names on a piece of paper—that was not done when Harvey came, because he was well known—I believe the letters of reference were generally signed by Miss Adams; she was another lady typist—I remember a little room at the end of the warehouse at Appold Street—I believe it was occupied for a week or a fortnight by Harvey—I do not know the date; I should think about the end of August or the beginning of September—that room was only a few yards from Matusch's room; they saw each other during that time—Miss Adams typed two letters for Harvey—I do not know what they were about—I remember the last two witnesses coming to be engaged for Harvey—the Griffin Company were lace paper manufacturers—I believe Matusch was managing director to Leppoc &amp; Co.—I saw him sign a few letters as managing director—I do not know where Leppoc's business was done—we printed paper for them—we had a printing department, and we printed paper for different things—I believe we printed paper for the Hertford Engineering Company—Matusch dictated the letters, which I saw signed by him as managing director of Leppoc.</p>

I answered an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> in February, 1899, and was engaged as a typist by the Griffin Company, at 18, Appold Street—my duties were correspondence and book-keeping—Matusch generally signed the letters which went out, sometimes his brother and sometimes Mr. Hirsch—latterly I signed a good many of them as secretary—I do not think I was ever appointed secretary—Matusch told me to sign them as secretary; he dictated the letters I signed—I saw Harvey there, first in March, 1900—he came there frequently during the summer—about the end of August or the beginning of September he had a room there for about a fortnight—I remember Matusch engaging some lady clerks—I have seen a large number of typewritten documents, signed by me, con<lb/>taining references—they were dictated by Matusch—most of them were in the same form—I generally copied the original—Harvey had a clerk at Appold Street before he went to the Strand—on September 22nd I remember typing a large number of letters withdrawing references—Matusch told me to do that—I was late at the office that day—I saw</p>

A. Adams, Secretary," was dictated by E. A. F. Matusch—I said before that it was dictated by F. C. Matusch; that was not true—I did not remember it at the time—I know Schmieder; I first saw him in 1899—he called about two or three times a month to see Matusch—he continued to call during 1899 and 1900.</p>

Piccolomini, dated July 14th, 1897, payable on October 15th, 1897, apparently unpaid, and twenty other bills and other papers—I made inquiries at 19, High Holborn, for Kuer &amp; Co., but they had gone—I traced them to 30, Brooke Street, but they had gone from there—I made inquiries at 174 and 175, Fore Street, for Mendlesohn Bros.; I saw a gentleman of that name here; he said he had not a place at Fore Street—I made inquiries at Silver Street for Benjamin &amp; Co.; they were gone—I went to Eldon Street for Coppel &amp; Co.; they were gone; I found their books there, and a lot of unpaid bills, and a number of invoices from the Griffin Company, for furniture supplied on September 29th.</p>

On February 4th I was on duty near the Point, and heard four or five shots, and a woman's scream—I ran towards the sound, and saw the woman some distance down the road; her back was on fire—I asked her what was the matter—she said something, and I went to the Point with another constable—the prisoner ran towards us, put up his hands, and said, "Hands up"—I butted him in the stomach and threw him down—he was very violent, and I struck him with an umbrella which was on the ground—I asked him for the revolver; he said, "It is over there. Is she dead?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I wish I had killed her, as I could easily have got away, as I have signed articles to go away to-morrow"—on the way to the station I took this letter from him: "January 28th. My dear Sister,—No doubt the bad news will cause you a great start, but it is better thus, as this woman is too wicked to live. I am also a very wicked man myself, and two such people are better out of the world than in it. Good-bye; farewell.

I did not mean to harm her"—he said that he wished he had killed her; he never in my presence said, "I meant to do her no harm"—I left the woman in the care of an elderly man, and told him if he discovered anything wrong about her to take her to the nearest doctor—Saunders struck him with a truncheon; I struck him with the umbrella—he had a slightly contused wound; he fainted at the station, but I put it down to the heat of the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas George King, a printer, of 35, Exmoor Road, Southampton—on January 17th I travelled by rail third class from Southampton West to London in a lavatory compartment—the train started about 11.15—the lavatory was nearer to the back of the train than I was—I seated myself at the back of the train at the further end, with my back to the engine—no one else was in the carriage—when I got to Eastleigh the prisoner got in, and sat with his back to the engine, near the door—we were each in a corner seat—we stopped at Winchester, and Mr. Pearson got in, and sat in a corner seat opposite me—he was reading the paper, but not very long—neither of us spoke, up to the time we got to Surbiton—Mr. Pearson had then moved to the other side next to the lavatory door—before we got to Surbiton the prisoner went into the lavatory and shut the door behind him; he was there about two minutes, and came back and sat down again—I saw Surbiton Station us we passed through, and I took my ticket out of my purse and stood up and looked out at the window—I then had my back to the prisoner, and heard two sounds, one directly after the other, and thought it was fog signals—I did not feel anything, but I found my face bleeding—I said, "What have you done?"—he said, "I did it for money; I want some money; have you got any?"—I said that I had a little, and took my purse out and gave him a shilling—he took it and put it in his pocket—I noticed that Mr. Pearson was bleeding from his head, I cannot tell exactly from where—I do not think he was alive then; I heard a gurgling in his throat—the prisoner went to him and took some things out of his pocket—I saw a cigar case and a purse—he offered me a sovereign; I said that it was of no use to me; I would not have it—there was blood on my face; I tried to staunch it with two handkerchiefs, and then the prisoner gave me his, and the blood got on my hand—he said, "Keep your hands down; don't touch me," and I did not—he said he had come from Birmingham, and was going to Liverpool on Saturday night, and then to South Africa—I kept him in conversation some little time—I did not see the revolver, but he said, "It won't do for me to keep this by me; I have a good mind to put it in his hand, and then it will appear as if he had done it himself"; I said, "If I was you I would throw it out of the window"—he was going to throw it out, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190102250073"/>
               <p>there were some men working on the line; he said, "I can't throw it out; there are some men working there"; I said, "If I were you, I should throw it out"; I saw it then, and he threw it out—he took some bullets out of his pocket, and I said, "I would throw them away too"—I did not see them; they were wrapped up—I said, "If I was you I would put something over his face, for I don't like the look of him," and he put a handkerchief over his face—he said, "As soon as I get to Vauxhall I shall make a run for it; mind you don't say anything about it"—when we got to Vauxhall the prisoner opened the door, and was going to get out; he hesitated a moment on the footboard, and then jumped out and ran away—I called out, "Stop him"—I was taken to the hospital, and was there about eight days—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the purse I saw in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not speak when he got in, and he sat down on the seat nearest to where he got in—I sat at the other end—he did not go to sleep—I was not watching him, but he had a very bad cough; he coughed all the way, and seemed to be very restless all the time—he made no sign of knowing Mr. Pearson when he got into the carriage at Winchester—Mr. Pearson did not speak from first to last, or I either—the train stopped just before Surbiton, and he went into the lavatory—I do not know whether Mr. Pearson was asleep, but be was perfectly quiet—the prisoner was still sitting in the same place; after passing Surbiton he was sideways—I was nearer to him than Mr. Pearson was; he could have touched me with his hand—not a minute elapsed between the shots; it must have been at the same moment—it was before I turned round—it struck me on my cheek—he had not asked me for money, but I went on my knees, offered him money, and implored him to spare my life—he stood up at one time—he did not go over to Mr. Pearson at once after firing at him—I do not remember what sort of watch chain Mr. Pearson wore—I saw the purse, but did not see the money in it; I only saw what he took out in his hands—I did not see whether he took any money out of the purse and put it in his pocket, or out of his pocket and put it in the purse—I never saw him with a railway ticket at all—I was extremely alarmed—it was at my suggestion that he threw the revolver out of the carriage; he had previously asked me what he had better do with it—I remember passing some buildings with glass roofs at Nine Elms; it was at those that I suggested that he should throw out the revolver—I asked him if he had got a mother, and to spare my life for the sake of my two sons—be said, "I am sorry I hurt you/" and that he had two or three brothers, and had had bad luck for a long time—I asked him where he came from—he said, "Birmingham"—I have not since heard that his father lives there—it was at my suggestion that he put the handkerchief over the deceased's face and a paper behind his arm—the train had not quite stopped when he opened the door—I had never seen him before—so far as I know, he had no reason to assault me in any way—he did nothing between Eastleigh and Surbiton but look out of the window and cough—he had a very bad cough.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a B. A.—I have had very little to do with cases of weak brain or brain disorder, but I have studied it—people in the lower stations of life are generally more subject to diseases of the brain than in the higher, but it depends on circumstances—if a person is of naturally deficient mind, although it might be slight, it would be increased by excessive alcoholism—continual heavy drinking would impair a mind which was predisposed—another cause would be severe</p>

               <p>disappointment, or brooding over some trouble, imaginary or not—it is quite possible that a man predisposed to the attacks of an unhinged mind, or weak-minded, might, from alcoholism or disappointment, be led away in a moment to do an act which he is not responsible for.</p>

I am truly sorry and penitent for having, in an evil moment, allowed myself to be carried away into committing the offence for which I now stand convicted, that of murder. No doubt you will remember, dear Lizzie, the morning we left Southampton, when I left you in the private bar of an hotel, I went and purchased a revolver, so that when I came down to Portsmouth on the Saturday I could end both our lives if I had not been successful in obtaining money from my father.

I am truly sorry and repentant for having in an evil moment allowed myself to be carried away into committing the offence for winch I now stand convicted. Perhaps you have seen in the paper that I had no intention whatever as to shooting your husband. No, none whatever. I purchased the revolver at Southampton with the intention of shooting the girl whom I have been going out with and myself; she was unhappy at home, and so was I. I shot your husband on the spur of the moment. I never spoke to him in my life, and it is utterly false what the woman Mrs. King says; I never asked your husband for money, nor <hi rend="italic">she</hi> either. I am really tired of my life. If you only knew what I have gone through! But there, I am telling you of my trouble, and you have got enough of your own. God forgive me! There is nothing for me to do now but to make my peace with Him. I know it seems rather hard for a young chap like me, in good health and strength, only 23 years, to die like this; but never mind; I deserve it; God forgive me for saying so. I would now only ask you to write me a few lines, and say that you forgive me your husband's death.—I remain, the wretched murderer of your husband, <hi rend="smallCaps">GEO. H. PARKER</hi>").</p>
