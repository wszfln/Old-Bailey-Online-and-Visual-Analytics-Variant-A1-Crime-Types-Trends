On Friday the 21st of December, in the evening, the prisoner came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270003"/>to my house, and said he wanted to purchase a flute of two guineas value; I was alone in the shop; I called Mr. Serle, one of my young men into the shop to serve him; the prisoner said I need not trouble myself to look out the flute then, but gave me a ten pound bank note, and begged I would take the two guineas out of it, and he would call again for the flute; I went to the money drawer, and acquainted the prisoner, I had not gold sufficient to change it; Serle came into the shop, and I gave him the note to get it changed, as he was going to the door the prisoner called him back, seemed very much confused, and unwilling it should go out to be changed; he said four guineas will do for the present; I then opened the drawer, and gave him three guineas and two half guineas; I expressed a doubt of the money being weight; he replied, if it is not weight it will not do for me, and begged the young man would hand him over the note; nearly at the time he received the bank note with one hand, he put some money down with the other, and went instantly out of the shop.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he put the money down? - He threw it down on the counter; I was directly opposite to him; he threw down two guineas, and two half guineas; I took it up, and put it into the bowl in the till.</p>
               <p>Do you know what money was in the bowl when you put the two guineas and two half guineas in? - There were some half guineas; I don't know how many; when I gave him the three guineas and two half guineas out, there was nothing left in the bowl but half guineas; I then went into the middle-room to ask the bookkeeper if he knew the prisoner; Serle looked into the bowl, and said he had taken away the new guinea; I then took my hat, and went up the Hay Market in search of the prisoner; not finding him I went to Justice Hyde's, and two officers went with me to a house in Johnson's Court, Charing-cross; when I went in the prisoner stood at the fire.</p>
               <p>How long was that after he had been in your shop? - About half an hour; I bid them take him, they did; and on my return to the office, he was brought in; he asked what he was brought there for, that he knew Mr. Broderip very well; that he had borrowed a guinea of him; I answered, that I was not on any terms of intimacy with the prisoner; that I did not lend him a guinea, but he had stole it from me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was this man drunk or sober when you found him at the ale-house? - I do not know; he did not appear to me to be drunk.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect precisely the expression he used when you charged him with the guinea; did he not say, if there was any mistake it must be rejected? - That was not the expression.</p>
               <p>Your servant told you he had taken the new guinea; did you remark the guinea? - Yes, it was a bright new guinea.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner searched? - Yes, there was a guinea found upon him, but not a new one.</p>
               <p>For what purpose had you given him the money the last time? - He said four guineas would do for him.</p>
               <p>When you took up the money, was you conscious you took a guinea short, before your young man mentioned it? - I was at the time, but I did not mention it for the moment; she two half guineas struck me, but I recollected myself, and knew there was a guinea gone.</p>
               <p>As you observed it at the time before the man went out of the shop, you did not say, Sir, you have made a mistake, and taken one of my guineas? - He darted immediately out of the shop.</p>
               <p>You did not make any immediate pursuit after the prisoner? - It was not ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>As you are in a great way of business, your servants have access to it I suppose? - Only three of us; the till is commonly kept locked.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270004"/>Some of the officers, I suppose, have the custody of the guinea found upon him? - I believe they have.</p>
               <p>Court. You went into the middle room as soon as the man went out? - I did.</p>
               <p>Where was Serle at this time? - He was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice to Serle that the money was missing? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take notice of it to Serle? - I went directly backwards to the book-keeper to speak to him on this business, to ask him if he had not seen the prisoner in the shop before.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SERLE sworn.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came into the shop I was not present; Mr. Broderip called me to look out for a flute, about two guineas and an half value; the prisoner gave Mr. Broderip a ten pound note, and asked for change; Mr. Broderip gave me the note, and desired me to get change; the prisoner said he was in a very great hurry, and could not stay; he said four guineas would do for the present, and he would call for the change another time; I was near Mr. Broderip; I saw him give him three guineas, and two half guineas, one was a remarkable new guinea, which I had taken just before; the prisoner doubted that the money was not weight, and said, if it was not it would not do; he put the money on the counter, and asked for the note, which I gave him immediately.</p>
               <p>What money did he throw on the counter? - I did not see; I was near the door; I saw him throw it down, but was not near enough to distinguish what it was; Mr. Broderip, immediately, put the money into the till, in the bowl, and the prisoner went out immediately.</p>
               <p>Where did Mr. Broderip get the money from, he gave the prisoner? - Out of the bowl; Mr. Broderip went back into the middle-room; I thought there was something very extraordinary in the behaviour of the prisoner; I opened the till immediately before Mr. Broderip returned.</p>
               <p>When had you seen the money in the bowl before? - Not above five minutes; the key was in the till.</p>
               <p>Who had the care of the till? - Sometimes Mr. Broderip, sometimes me.</p>
               <p>Had you counted the money when you saw it five minutes before? - Yes, there was five guineas in it; four half guineas, and three guineas; I opened the till, and asked Mr. Broderip if he had taken out the new guinea I had taken just before, Mr. Broderip said he had not.</p>
               <p>Had you observed the new guinea? - I saw Mr. Broderip give the new guinea to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Had you observed it when you last saw the bowl? - I had; Mr. Broderip then said, he recollected the man had given him back but three guineas, but that the two half guineas had deceived him; he thought it was four guineas.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This was a remarkable bright guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After he was gone you missed it, and told Mr. Broderip; how long was that after? - Not above a minute.</p>
               <p>When you told him, he said he had been deceived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner again? - About half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Has any guinea of that sort been found on the prisoner? - There was a guinea found upon him, but quite a different one to the one I lost.</p>

               <p>How long had you lived there? - Six years; he came in, in a great deal of trouble.</p>
               <p>What time did he come? - About twelve o'clock the 4th of January, he came to settle with me about a quarter's rent due to him from me at Christmas; he asked for the rent, Mr. Phipps told him he should not come into the house, for he would dash his brains out if he attempted to come into the house; Phipps said, he should not be paid; I told Phipps he should have his money, I would sell some of my goods to pay him, and not to distrain for the money.</p>
               <p>He had talked of distraining? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he agreeable to that mode? - Yes, he was agreeable to take it in any way I could settle it.</p>
               <p>Did he continue there any time after this? - He was there till about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Who was present in the room when you had this conversation with Leach? - The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Did any thing remarkable happen to Leach that afternoon? - He was arrested about three o'clock, and taken out of the house; Leach refused to go; he said, he owed nothing; Phipps went out and double locked the door, and sent people into the house to take my things down; I went up, and said, they should not be taken down, for I owed Phipps nothing.</p>
               <p>How do you know who sent the person into the house? - Phipps put him into the house and double locked the door; he went out and returned with the patrol; then they began to take down the things.</p>
               <p>Did Phipps lock the door? - Yes, when he went out to get the cart, he put the patrol into the house, and then went for the cart; while he was gone, they went to take down the things; I opposed them all I could.</p>
               <p>Where was you while the goods were taken down and put into the cart? - I was locked in the fore parlour, who locked me in I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Who let you out? - A friend of mine came from Islington; I made a noise, she went for somebody and they let me out, that was about an hour after I was let out; the goods were all in the cart; I sent a man after them to watch them; Mrs. Johnson, the prisoner, beat me, and used me very ill, because I sent a person to watch the cart; she said, I had no right to send any person after the things; they were all theirs.</p>
               <p>Who did you understand by theirs? - Phipps's and her's; and she swore I should not have a bed to lie upon, and if I attempted to go out of the door, she would murder me, and took up a large carving knife, and said, she would cut me up directly; she repeated her blows, and knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270006"/>me down into the fire-place; I begged of her not to make a noise to alarm the neighbours, nor to quite murder me, that it would be of no use; she swore to God she would, she did not care for any body; she cut my mouth, it was all of a gore of blood; the patrol found me in that condition.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find the goods afterwards? - Yes, in Temple-lane, No. 9, some of them are here now? - When did you find them? - On the Saturday; they were in Phipps's chambers, in the hands of the treasurer of the Temple, for rent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I take it for granted, you are no stranger to Phipps? - No, I have known him a great while.</p>
               <p>He has done a great deal of business for you? - No; he used to come to my house; I never owed him any thing.</p>
               <p>Did not he come to your house with an execution? - Yes, for sixteen pounds; it was brought to my house in Penton-place.</p>
               <p>How long had you left the house in Duke-street when the execution was brought? - The night I came into the house.</p>
               <p>How was that execution settled? - I gave a warrant of attorney to Phipps to pay a guinea a month, and he discharged the officer.</p>
               <p>In order to settle it, I believe the goods were taken as a part? - Yes, from the other house.</p>
               <p>Did you offer him any money? - No.</p>
               <p>You gave him some of the goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came he to be satisfied with goods to part of the amount? - I do not know, he did not choose to strip the whole house.</p>
               <p>Did not you acknowledge your obligation to him for taking only part of the goods? - Yes, but I did not owe him any thing when he put the first execution in, Phipps had the key of my former house a fortnight before, and would not give it up.</p>
               <p>Did you tell your landlord Leach, where you was come to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you owe Leach? - A quarter's rent, eleven pounds five shillings, which would be due at Christmas.</p>
               <p>Leach wanted to distrain your goods in Penton-square? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not Phipps claim the property in consequence of this as under the execution? - Yes.</p>
               <p>These were the same goods that he might have taken when he came with the execution? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Phipps having a claim on the goods and there being nothing to affect the prisoner but having some connexion with him, the Court directed the Jury to find the prisoner not guilty, without going any farther into the evidence.</p>

               <p>Are there any other apprentices who sleep there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is this from the dwelling-house? - Ten or fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>Is this surrounded with any sort of fence? - On the one side it is open to the road.</p>
               <p>Without a gate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it attached to the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Does that part from the road go into the yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did this building come into that road? - Yes, on that side near the road; I know nothing of the burglary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You said this adjoins to the road? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You do not step off the causeway of the road into the workshop? - No.</p>
               <p>How is the yard enclosed? - By gates, and the building which runs down on one side next the road; the yard encloses a number of out-buildings, not the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>The dwelling-house is quite distinct from that connexion of out-houses? - Quite so, the drying-places and other things of that sort are enclosed in the yard.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. May we ask how much you gave for them? - If you please.</p>
               <p>If you please to answer it? - I gave sixteen-pence a yard.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I did.</p>
               <p>And paid for them at the time you had them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before you were taken into custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is a high price for you to give; is it not? - I have told the truth.</p>
               <p>How came you to give that price? - Because I could not get them cheaper.</p>
               <p>Where did you buy them? - Of Terry Finley, at his own house in Back-lane, Rag-fair, the day before I was taken up.</p>
               <p>How long have you dealt in calico? - I deal in any thing.</p>
               <p>I suppose so; but how long have you been a dealer in calico? - I gave a fair judgment for it.</p>
               <p>You will have a fair judgment some time or another? - When I can buy any thing I do; I am a dealer.</p>
               <p>You have been a dealer a long time? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>But you deal in any thing and every thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you pay it in cash or bank-notes? - No, in gold and silver.</p>
               <p>How much did you pay him for these goods? - Two pounds thirteen shillings for two pieces; that was the first time, and I gave him one pound seven shillings for the last piece.</p>

               <p>I live in Cable-street, Back-lane.</p>
               <p>Those calicoes which Usher had, do you know where they came from? - On the 10th of January I was out; my wife sent for me home; when I came home, there were three men round my door, and two withinside.</p>
               <p>Who were the two men on the inside? - The man with the one eye (Briggs) and the other, he with the silk handkerchief, (Goldsmith.)</p>
               <p>You don't know who the men at the door were? - No; when I went into the house, there were five pieces, four white<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270009"/>and one Stormont, which I agreed with Goldsmith to give them three guineas and an half for; Briggs came the next day and another man; I believe him in the white jacket (Hoy) I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>You are sure that is the man that came with Briggs? - I cannot be positive, they told me I gave them a light guinea the night before, which I changed, and they told me they had some more, and they said they did not like to bring it down Back-lane, on account of the runners being about there; with that I appointed a place in East Smithfield; I took Briggs with me,; he looked at the place, and said he liked it very well; Briggs and Goldsmith, and another, brought me, on the Sunday night following to this room in Smithfield three pieces; we appointed a place to meet Briggs, at a public-house, on Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Confine yourself to those pieces of calico that belong to Mr. Smith? - I don't know which belongs to Mr. Smith; I thought they all belonged to Mr. Smith; Shakeshaft has the other pieces.</p>
               <p>(Shakeshaft produced the pieces which he said he had of Finley.)</p>
               <p>How many pieces did you purchase the first time? - Five.</p>
               <p>How many pieces did you purchase before the 21st of January? - I purchased none before the 21st of January.</p>
               <p>When did you purchase these? - The 10th of January I purchased five pieces, and on the Sunday night following I purchased three pieces, and on the Monday night I purchased five; those that are produced I purchased of Briggs and Goldsmith.</p>
               <p>Shakeshaft. I produce three, and Armstrong produces three pieces.</p>
               <p>To Finley. You purchased all these of Briggs and Goldsmith? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were any body else with them? - Yes, the first time they came to the Black Horse, that was on the Tuesday night, there were five in company.</p>
               <p>Who were those five? - I only went in at the door of the Black Horse, and Goldsmith and Briggs came out to me, I don't know any of the other three.</p>
               <p>How many did you see at any other time? - There were three when they came with the light guinea? - I don't know any but Briggs and Goldsmith.</p>
               <p>Out of the six that are produced, you sold three? - I sold three to a pedlar, one Johnson, that goes about the country, and I sold three to Usher, and three that are now produced; I purchased fifteen in the whole.</p>

               <p>What trade are you? - A shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>You don't make women's shoes of this, do you? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to be dealing in this? - I have dealt in it a great while; I have been guilty of bad faults in buying things that were stolen.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a receiver of stolen goods? - About a couple of years, off and on.</p>
               <p>Have you had any intervals of honesty in the two years; very short ones I am afraid; have you been here before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often? - Twice, I believe.</p>
               <p>No oftener? - No.</p>
               <p>Twice as a witness? - As a witness.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270010"/>How many did you sell to Usher? - None of the first five.</p>
               <p>What did you give for the next? - For the next three, I gave two guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>What did Usher give you? - Sixteen-pence a yard.</p>
               <p>Why were you at the trouble of measuring them between you and your friend Usher? - I never measured them.</p>
               <p>Never measured them, and yet sell them by the yard? - The people I bought them of, told me they were two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Who was present when you received the money from Usher? - My wife.</p>
               <p>That was all you received of Usher? - Yes, except a year ago; it was one pound six shillings and eight-pence; I did not take the halfpence.</p>
               <p>So that a guinea and five shillings and six-pence was all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You only sold him three pieces? - No, two at one time, and one at another.</p>
               <p>What was the one pound six shillings and eight-pence for? - For the one.</p>
               <p>What did he pay you for the others? - One pound six for each of the others; that was two pounds twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by telling me that one pound six shillings and eight-pence was all that you received from Usher, except a year ago? - That was a mistake.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; on the 10th of January, about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, or it might be later, five men came to my house; two of them were Briggs and Goldsmith; I did not know the other three; they asked for my husband, he was out, I sent my servant to call him; while the servant was gone, each of the men pulled a piece of calico from under their coats; I desired three of them to go out, for my husband would only deal with two of them at once; my husband came in and bought the five pieces of Briggs and Goldsmith, for three guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Did he afterwards sell any to any body? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you know Usher? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see Usher after this? - I cannot say when; I saw him some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have a slight acquaintance with Usher? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He does not deal with your husband? - I cannot tell that he does.</p>
               <p>He does not deal with you of course? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you keep these goods? - In the cock-loft.</p>
               <p>You never received any money? - Yes, soon after this, my husband told me to receive two pounds thirteen shillings of him.</p>
               <p>Was that all you received of him? - I received one pound six shillings and sixpence afterwards.</p>
               <p>How came you not to mention that, when you was asked how soon after you saw Usher? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Your husband never deals with five people at a time? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you been married? - Fifteen months.</p>
               <p>He has carried on a roaring trade, has not he? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>For what reason did you desire the three men to withdraw? - Because my husband ordered me.</p>
               <p>Your plant was in the cock-loft? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Explain to the Jury what a plant is? - Where we put things.</p>
               <p>The plant is where you keep stolen goods; is it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why was you to receive this money, and not your husband? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Your husband was by? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he present or not? - I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270011"/>What part of the house did you receive it in? - In the back shop.</p>
               <p>What shop do you keep? - A clothes-shop.</p>
               <p>Was he in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he in the room? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You are sure he did not enter into any conversation with you and Usher about the money, or about any thing else? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any halfpence in change? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened that, because you know it came to eight-pence? - He did not give me the odd two-pence.</p>
               <p>You received these monies at different times? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your husband present at either of the times? - I cannot say.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a calico printer, I was servant to Mr. Smith of Old Ford; on Tuesday night the 8th of January, Hoy, Briggs, and I were together at the White Horse, Old Ford, and we consulted how we should rob Mr. Smith's ground; we were to rob the shop on the Wednesday night; we were to meet at the White Horse, Old Ford, but when I went to unkey the window, there came one of the men into the shop; upon that I went out again; when Briggs and Hoy and I met, I told them I could not do it, because one of the men came into the shop; we agreed to meet the next night, and I was to acquaint Jervais with it; after I had done work on Thursday night, I saw Jervais at the door, I told him it was very easy to rob the shop, if he would be agreeable, which he consented to; and I told him to go and unkey the further window in the shop; then we both went up towards the White Horse, we sat there till about six o'clock; then Joseph Briggs came in, and we told him every thing was ready; after being in for some minutes, Briggs went out, then Jervais and I followed him; there we met Briggs, Hoy, and Goldsmith, very near the White Horse; we went all together towards Mr. Smith's shop; going along, Briggs stopped and got a sack; Jervais and I, and Goldsmith and Hoy, went on towards the shop; Jervais and I went up to the shop window first, and let down the bar, and opened the window shutter, and then I went away, a little way below the shop, and left Jervais.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - To look out, to see if any body came along; when I went away Briggs and Goldsmith came up to the window, and one of them, I do not know which, broke a pane of glass; I thought I heard somebody coming down the lane; I went away towards the window, and told Briggs and Goldsmith; Briggs threw the sack over the pales opposite the shop; then we went away to the end of the wall.</p>
               <p>All of you? - No, Jervais was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>When you all went up there, you did not see Jervais at that time? - No, when we found there was nobody coming, we went back again, and I went to the same place where I was before; I saw some pieces come out of the window.</p>
               <p>How do you mean? - They were put through the pane of glass that was broke, and thrown over the pales where the sack was.</p>
               <p>Who threw them over the pales? - I cannot say which it was; after that, Jervais came out, then Briggs got over the pales; Goldsmith, Hoy, Jervais, and I went up to the further end of the pales, where Briggs brought the sack, and threw it over; Goldsmith took it upon his back, and carried it a little way up the lane, with the assistance of the rest of us; we carried it all through the fields, till we came to the field but one joining to the Gravel Pit at Old Ford, then we took five pieces out of the sack, each of us put one round our bodies, then we carried the sack and buried it in the Gravel-pit-field, under some loom, and then we all sat off down the alleys towards London, and came out at Mile-end-road; we went into Back-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270012"/>to Terry Finley's; Briggs and Goldsmith went in first, after they had been in some time, Goldsmith came, and called Jervais, Hoy, and I in; we went in, and each of us took a piece from round our waists, and threw them on the stairs; Mrs. Finley told us we must go out, for her husband would not deal with more than two at a time; accordingly Hoy, Jervais and me went to the Gun and Holly-bush, in the lane; after we had been there some time, Briggs and Goldsmith came in to us; Briggs said he asked Mr. Finley seven guineas for the five pieces, but he could get no more than three guineas and a half; then we went to another public house, and shared the money; then we went as far as Bow together, there we parted with Goldsmith and Hoy; I went and delivered myself up to Mr. Leach and Mr. Newton.</p>

               <p>Did you tell them of this robbery of Mr. Smith's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them that all these prisoners were concerned with you? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before you was in custody you certainly gave an information? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Somebody else was in custody who could have informed against you, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is the merit of your information; who was it that was in custody at that time? - Jervais, Briggs and Doust.</p>
               <p>You did not say a word of this to anybody, till you yourself expected to be taken up and hanged? - No, I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>You began your evidence by saying, we met together, and consulted how we could do this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath who proposed it to the others? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have you any doubt about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then we may understand you, that you proposed to Briggs and Hoy to rob your own master, and then agreed with them to endeavour to draw in Jervais, who was a servant to the same master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A poor lad who had, before this, borne a good character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said one of them broke the window; upon your oath did you not do it yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>You was not at the window at the time it was broke? - No.</p>
               <p>Were there no calicoes on the bleaching grounds at that time? - None of them were on the grounds.</p>
               <p>I know none of them, but were there any upon the bleaching ground? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Recollect, because you cannot possibly fail to know that; the workshop joins the bleaching ground, does it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you not propose to break the house rather than the grounds, that you might get these people into the scrape, and get the reward? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had you lived with this master to whom you was so faithful? - I believe about six months.</p>
               <p>You found Jervais living there when you first went to live there, and in possession of a good character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He knew nothing of it till you were all agreed? - No.</p>
               <p>To Royle. Look at those calicoes, and see if you know them again? - I know the pattern very well; I printed twenty pieces of the pattern.</p>
               <p>Are those the pieces you left under the table? - The ends being torn off, I cannot swear to them; the ends were on every piece I left under the table; the ends were numbered, and I have the numbers of the pieces that were stolen, in a book at home.</p>
               <p>Are those finished? - No, they are in the first state in which they are printed; there was another colour they had to go in, and then they were to be boiled off; they are in the state of those that we lost; a paste was to be put in to save the eye, and they were to be stormonted; I did twelve of them, but the eight that were to do, the paste did not answer the purpose.</p>
               <p>That was to fix the colour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about this being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270013"/>property that was lost that night? - No, every piece here seems to be in the same state.</p>
               <p>Unfit for sale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is not an uncommon pattern; is it? - We have not a pattern that I know of like it; it is a new pattern.</p>
               <p>Have you seen, since those were lost, any patterns of Mr. Greaves's before the Justice? - No; I have not seen any till I saw this to day.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Smith. Do you know that piece? - There has been a name taken off; I have a piece (producing it); part of the goods of this man's printing, which was left in another room, at the time the robbery was committed; this was sent to the office that they might know the pattern when they saw it.</p>
               <p>Is it a new pattern? - Quite so; they never were printed before; our patterns are confined to our own houses.</p>
               <p>Court. You have sold none of this pattern yet? - None.</p>
               <p>None of the trade that you know of had that pattern? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were the calicoes all of the same width and quality? - All the same.</p>
               <p>Do those exactly correspond in width and quality with what you lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Finley. Did you buy the calicoes all of the same persons? - Yes; of Goldsmith and Briggs.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were the fag-ends to them when you bought them? - Yes; I pulled them off, and burnt them.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks upon them? - Yes,</p>
               <p>"Smith, Old-Ford."</p>

               <p>I sailed with Mr. Hindes, of Bow, to the East Indies, for the East India Company, and he would have been here, but he has a bad state of health; he has sent this paper.</p>
               <p>Court. That cannot be admitted.</p>
               <p>Briggs called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>How did the man who was with Jones bring the cask up the yard? - In his arms: after the cask had been in the yard about an hour, I saw Jones come up the yard and look at it, and turn away again.</p>
               <p>Look at the other prisoner, is he the man that had the cask? - I cannot swear that he is, or that he is not the man.</p>

               <p>Who pays the rent of the house where you live? - I myself; on the morning of the 31st of January, the watchman alarmed me about four o'clock; he called out, the front door is open; I saw that door secured over night; I came down stairs, and went into the parlor, and found the parlor door that goes into the shop open, which very much alarmed me, for I had the key of that door in my pocket, and knew it was locked; I did not lock it myself, but I always look at the doors; I looked round the parlor; we have a large desk and a small one in the parlor, both of them were fast; I went into the shop and looked at the window, but missed nothing there; I then looked round the shop again, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270017"/>saw a glass case was out of its place, and I found it on the ground near the parlor door, with the back upwards, and the lock broke open, and one watch left in it; there were thirty-five watches in it the night before, it was the case we kept the watches in that we can warrant, and that want repairing; I sent my boy to Kennington to acquaint Mr. Davidson of the situation we were in; I went to Bow-street about seven o'clock, and gave information of what I had lost, and printed hand-bills.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any part of the house where any body had got in? - On going down stairs, I found a sky-light over the kitchen dresser broke, big enough for a man to get through, there were two panes broke, they were feather panes, one over the other, and nothing between; there were some pieces of glass on the dresser, and the mark of a foot: about nine o'clock, Mr. Littler, who is servant to Mr. Jones pawnbroker, in Fleet-street, came to me; I went with him to Mr. Jones's, where I was shewn a watch; I did not immediately recollect it, it being a watch that had been left with me, and not my own; I recollected the string and the key, but upon looking further at it, I recollected the watch; the prisoner was there; I got a constable and secured him; he was taken into the parlor and searched; I observed he had something in his hand be wanted to get rid of; I secured his hand and found these ear-rings in it, which are mine, I took them out of the prisoner's hand myself; there were some other things found upon him by the constable in my presence; the inside case of a watch, and a French beuded buckle, and a duplicate of a watch which was pawned at Mr. Fleming's, in Holborn; a person was sent for that watch to Mr. Fleming's, and brought it to Mr. Jones's; some of my property was in Kent-street-road, near the turnpike.</p>

               <p>On his cross examination, it appeared that the partner had never slept in the house, but that the rent and taxes, with the servants wages, were paid out of the joint-stock; on which accounts, the Court were of opinion, that the burglary should have been laid to be a breaking open of the dwelling-house of both the partners, and that not being so laid, the indictment was not sufficient to support that part of the charge.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Jones, pawnbroker in Fleet-street; on the 31st of January, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to our house with intent to pledge a watch; he asked five guineas upon it; I took it to the window, and found it was only metal gilt; I went and returned it to him, and asked him, what should make it so valuable; he said, it was gold; having before received an information from Mr. Essex, I pretended to go out for money, and went to Mr. Essex; he came immediately, and I shewed him the watch, he said, it was his watch; I had fixed Mr. Essex at the door of the box where the prisoner was, to keep him from running away; and went and fetched Thompson, the constable, and we took the prisoner immediately; the watch (producing it) has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>How came he to stay in the box while you went for Mr. Essex? - I told him I was going for the money; I was not above four minutes gone for Mr. Essex; I ran all the way; Mr. Essex seized him by the collar, and asked him, where he got the watch; he said, he found it.</p>
               <p>These boxes are made in such a manner, that persons may come from the street into them, and go out again, without going through the shop? - Yes; the box opens into a court.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Fleming, pawnbroker, in High Holborn. On the 31st of January, about half an hour after eight in the morning, the prisoner came to my master's shop, and offered a silver watch to pawn; I lent him a guinea upon it; I made out a duplicate of it myself, and gave it him; this, (looking at it) is the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes; he is the same man; the Monday before he left a coat, and redeemed it when he brought the watch. (The watch shewn the witness.)</p>
               <p>This is the watch; I just now opened it; the screw being loose, the top sell off.</p>
               <p>What are the words after Hollingsworth in the duplicate? - Drury-lane; he said he lived at White-horse-yard, in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Essex. That watch is mine and Mr. Davidson's property; the chain has a link of it broke; I have a clear recollection, that I observed that watch among the rest, the night before they were lost; was put there as it wanted repairing.</p>
               <p>Look at the gilt metal watch; do you know that? - Yes, by the key and string; it belongs to a gentleman we do business for; not being my own, I was at a loss for the name and number, and did not specify them as I did the rest.</p>
               <p>Do you know the ear-ring? - Yes; I can swear to it; I have had it a long time in my possession.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark upon it? - We never mark our goods particularly, farther than from observation.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark upon it? - I don't know it but from occular demonstration, as I know one man from another.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that rings are to be distinguished from one another, as much as men are? - Much more so.</p>
               <p>Can you identify that buckle? - I cannot, they are more common than rings are.</p>
               <p>Court. What are these ear-rings? - Garnet coloured.</p>
               <p>What stone is it? - I don't think it is any stone; I believe it is composition.</p>
               <p>To Littler. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - I saw him the very morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270019"/>he came to our shop between eight and nine o'clock, in the road leading from the Obelisk to Black Friars Bridge; I took particular notice of it; I thought, at first, he had been a person I knew, who is shop-man to Mr. Davidson, in the Borough, and was going to speak to him; upon his coming to our shop, I said to myself, this is the very man I met, and mistook this morning.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. On the 27th of January, about a quarter before six in the morning, I saw the prisoner Talbert walking backwards and forwards before Mr. Wheeler's shop; Mr. Wheeler had lost bread several times, and desired me to watch;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270027"/>just as the watchmen had cried the hour of six I saw him go up to the door; I heard somebody on the inside undo the bar, and he lifted up the latch, and went; and I saw French put six quartern loaves, and two two-penny ones, into a bag he had with him; he twisted the bag up, put it across his shoulder, and went across the road.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see any money pass at that time? - Not a farthing; he came directly out; I followed him till he came to the corner of Macclesfield-street, then I crossed the way, and told him he must go with me to the watch-house; I left him and the loaves at the watch-house, and went back to Mr. Wheeler's shop; I called the watchman, and then knocked at the door; I knocked three times before he would open it, then French listed up the bar, and opened the door, and I gave the watchman charge of him till I called Mr. Wheeler; Mr. Wheeler came immediately; he desired him to forgive him; he said he had never done such a thing before; we then took him to the watch-house; I have had the bread in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>What did Wheeler charge him with? - I don't know what Wheeler said.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Had not Talbert time enough, when he went into the shop, to throw down the money for the bread before you came up? - No, not without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>When French asked his master's pardon, you don't know whether it was for having stolen the bread, or having trusted a man his master would not trust? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>Did you hear any thing Mr. Wheeler said to French? - He said he was very glad he was taken; that he had been robbing him for some time; French said, I hope you will forgive me for this time; Wheeler said, do you think I will forgive you, when you have robbed me while I was asleep?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. A man may rob his master by taking his property without his knowledge; or by selling his property without his knowledge; and keeping the money; in which of these senses did he charge him with robbing him? - I don't know; that is what he said.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You have been taken up for this fact? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are the man called Ruddy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was concerned in the robbery? - No.</p>
               <p>You were taken up for it, and admitted to be an evidence as an accomplice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What were you charged with? - Upon suspicion of stealing it.</p>
               <p>They said they would hang you, if you could not put it upon somebody else? - No; about six o'clock in the morning, last Saturday week, I was called up by Crafts, I went with him to Cow-cross, and met Mundy; Crafts and Mundy talked together.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what they said? - No, Mundy left Crafts, and he and I went and got a pint of purl; we had not been there long, before Windsor Tom called me out, and said he wanted Crafts; they said they wanted Mundy or my master, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270033"/>Are you a servant of Mundy's? - Yes, they had some discourse, but what I cannot tell; Mundy and I went up the cross; after that we met Crafts at the top of the alley, and we all went together.</p>
               <p>Where was the heifer when you first saw it? - In the slaughter-house.</p>

               <p>You did not see who brought it there? - No, my master told me to tie it up, and I did.</p>
               <p>When you went first it was loose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You and Crafts are not upon very good terms? - We never quarrelled; Lavender would have had me said that, that I never thought of.</p>
               <p>What did Lavender want you to say? - He wanted me to say that I was a party concerned with Crafts in stealing it.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you any thing about the reward? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>That he kept snug, intending to have it himself; he knew it was false at that time? - Yes, for I had a witness what time I got up.</p>
               <p>Scott. After Mundy was taken up, Lavender over and above persuaded me to admit

             an evidence; I said I could not swear to any body else but where I found my property; I said openly in the Court, that all the people between here and St. Paul's, should not persuade me to admit him an evidence; Lavender said, I suppose you want to massacre the man, but I'll get him through, I'll be bound.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the heifer you found at Mundy's, was your heifer? - Yes, I knew it perfectly well.</p>
               <p>PRISONER CRAFTS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I saw a man coming down St. John's-street, with a black heifer, and he gave me six-pence to drive it to Mr. Mundy's, he bid me tell him it belonged to Mr. Swaine in Thames-street; I met Mr. Mundy, and told him it was a heifer of Mr. Swaine's, Thames-street.</p>
               <p>PRISONER MUNDY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I desired Lyons to tie up the heifer, and ordered the boy to give it some hay; Lyons locked the door, and locked it in, that if I should hear any body had lost it they might have it again; I said I fancied it was heavy in calf, that I believed it belonged to Mr. Marsh of Hampstead, he had just such another; I had not time to send to any body when Mr. Scott came; I said, Sir I am very glad you have got it again.</p>
               <p>(There being no evidence to affect Estol, he was not put on his defence.)</p>
               <p>(Crafts called three witnesses, who had known him from his infancy, and gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>My husband is book-keeper to the Cambridge coach.</p>
               <p>Where is your warehouse? - Adjoining to a parlour and stair-case, and bed-rooms, in Mr. Harding's house; Holmes came to our house about half after seven o'clock, and brought a square parcel in whitish paper; I took it, and put it with the other goods.</p>
               <p>Was it sealed? - I did not take any particular notice because I knew Mr. Holmes; there was a lad came at the same time with a parcel from Mr. Stokes's; the prisoner came to me; he stood with his arms across; he had a blue coat, with a red collar, and a red waistcoat on; he said, what time do you expect the Cambridge coach? I said, I do not know; about ten minutes after, I locked the warehouse door and tried it, and went to warm me; when I returned, the lock was picked, and that parcel, and the parcel brought from Mr. Stokes's were gone; the parcel in white paper attracted my attention, I missed that immediately; I never saw the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? Yes, I took particular notice of his mouth and nose.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Have you always kept to this story, that you could recollect the person of the prisoner? - I do, and always did.</p>
               <p>Did you swear to him at your first examination at Bow-street? - I said, I really thought he was the person; I knew him by his mouth and nose; I said the same then as I do now.</p>
               <p>How did you find the door on your return, open or shut? - It was standing a-jar; I locked the door, and took the key with me.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else in the yard? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the person now? - Yes; I am positive.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing to induce you to remember him better now, than when you was before the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any scruple before the magistrate at your first examination? - I said, I will not swear blank he is the person.</p>
               <p>Had you any doubt on your mind? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say at first, he was the person, or like him? - I said, he was the person, or like him.</p>
               <p>Had he the same clothes on at the office, as when you saw him? - When I saw him in the yard he had a blue coat on; he had a brown one at the office.</p>
               <p>What waistcoat had he on? - A red one.</p>
               <p>Had he a red waistcoat at the office? - Yes; it might be of a brighter colour than the one he had that night.</p>
               <p>Much brighter, or a little brighter? - A little brighter.</p>
               <p>(Her examination was produced, from which it appeared, that she swore before the Justice, that the prisoner very much resembled the person who came that night to enquire what time the Cambridge coach came in.)</p>

               <p>You are now positively sure the prisoner is the person? - I really think he is the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270035"/>Has this money ever been demanded of the proprietor of the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever understand that they were liable to make good the money? - No; we took it as a common parcel.</p>
               <p>What time did the Cambridge coach come in? - Not till the next day in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER M'CRATCHY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Stokes, in Goldsmith-street, Cheapside; I took a parcel to the Green Dragon, on the 26th of December, about half past seven in the evening; I saw a man walking about the yard with his hands folded; I was enquiring for the book-keeper; Mr. Holmes came, and a porter with him, and said, he knew where to find the book-keeper; and went and brought out Mrs. Brickwood, and gave her his parcel, which was covered with white paper, and I gave her mine; the man put his head into the warehouse, and asked when the Cambridge coach would come in.</p>
               <p>Did you observe his dress? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You cannot swear to the man? - No; she took the parcels to the farther end of the warehouse; I came out and went away.</p>

I am ruined! I had made it for Mr. Thompson; I went down stairs as soon as I could, but not time enough to catch him; I never saw him again till the 10th of January; the watch was found at Epping.</p>

               <p>I live in the same court with Appleby, about a quarter after nine I saw two men in the court, one of them went into Appleby's, the prisoner stood at the door, and the other came out with a box, and gave it to the prisoner; he carried it with the tail of his coat; Green was with me.</p>

               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was the man? - Yes, I am quite certain of it, I passed him quite close by him.</p>
               <p>Why did not you stop him at that time? - I did not think of it then; I followed him to the end of the court, and saw him throw it upon his shoulder; Green went back to alarm Appleby, and left me to watch; I could not stop him.</p>
               <p>The constable who apprehended the prisoner deposed, that when they told him what he was taken for, he wanted to turn evidence.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 3, Gun-court; on Saturday, the 9th of February, about a quarter after ten at night, I was coming home with my wife from market; as we were coming into the court, I heard a noise at No. 1, where the prisoners lived; I peeped into the room, it was a casement, and it was not quite shut; I saw the prosecutor lying on the bed, struggling very much; I saw Cowden lying upon him.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was Cowden? - Because I saw her very plain with a light that was upon the mantle-piece; I had known her before she came to live in the court; Storer had her hand on his mouth, and Cutler stood with her backside against the door; I sent my wife to call the watchman; but before the watchman came, Mr. Solomons came out, and said, I am robbed, I am robbed; two women came out, but neither of the prisoners; after that, I saw Cutler run out; then I ran in and saw the prosecutor without his hat; Cowden then gave him his hat again.</p>
               <p>Was the prosecutor then in the house, or out of the house? - Just within the house; the watchman came, and we brought Cowden and Storer to the watch-house; about half an hour afterwards, Cutler was brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>How was this bed situated? - Just as you come in at the door; the window was at the side of the bed, so that you could see any part of the bed, and the foot of the bed came towards the door; upon the Monday they were taken before Justice Wilmot and committed.</p>
               <p>Cutler. Did you see me in the room after you had taken me up by a warrant from the Rotation-office? - Yes, I saw her in the room, with her backside against the door, I had taken up Cutler and Storer that night about seven o'clock, for abusing me; Storer had cut my hand with a knife, and Cutler had taken up a poker, and struck me over the head, and cut my hat, but they were discharged, and were home again before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. What business are you? - I deal in old copper and brass, and buy bad shillings.</p>

               <p>What watch was it? - A silver watch with a steel chain; I asked for my watch, she abused me, and said, I was not worth a watch; she and another girl that was in the room, then shut me out into the street; I called the watchman, and he made them open the door, and took her to the watch-house; my watch was found at Mr. Fleming's a pawnbroker's, in Drury-lane; his young man is here.</p>
               <p>How soon after you lost it? - About a fortnight.</p>

               <p>Did Jones live in the house at this time with his wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A silver watch with a steel chain and three seals; Jones desired me to pawn it, for his wife was in the watch-house, and desired me to take the seals off; I pawned the watch at Mr. Fleming's for sixteen shillings, without the seals; I then went to Mrs. Jones in the watch-house, and the prosecutor was there she said he had accused her of robbing him. I was going to give her the money, and she said no; I afterwards gave her the money, and the duplicate, and the seals.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether she knew any thing of the watch, till after she was brought up to the Justice's? - I gave her the duplicate, and the money, and the seals.</p>

I said, yes; and he went and returned with the two great coats in ten minutes; upon a suspicion he did not come honestly by them, I jumped over the counter, and told him he must stay there till I went to hear what Mr. Smith said about it; he said, I need not go, for he had taken the coats from a house by Buckingham-gate, but could not tell exactly where; I told him I must take him before a magistrate, but would be as favorable as I could.</p>

Oddy said, Murwell was obliged to to sell them, because he was going into the country; on the 29th of January they brought these three saws; I was not at home, they came and left them, and came the next day, and asked me what I would give for them; I took them into a back parlor, and looked at them, and saw the letter A upon them; I asked the prisoner his name; he said, it was Murwell; he said, he worked for Mrs. Allen in the Borough; I said, they told me the stock and bits were all they could get of a bad debt from Cleavely, and if they did not give me a satisfactory answer from Mrs. Allen, I would stop them; they went away, and came again on the 31st, and brought this letter; (producing it.) I told them that was not satisfactory, and that I had written to Mrs. Allen; after that, I met Oddy, and took him into custody; the other prisoner was taken the same evening.</p>

I did not come on that business, I have got a wife at home I was going to, but you have decoyed me into this dismal place; she directly stamped with her foot, and called for some gin; the room-door was never shut; I told her I should drink no gin, and was going away; I got as near the door as I could, then the two young men came into the room.</p>
               <p>Which two? - The two outside ones, Granger and Collins.</p>
               <p>Those two men came into the room? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What is the little woman's name? - She acknowledged to the name of Smith the next day at the Justice's; while they had hold of my arms, knowing I had the notes, in this pocket, I leaned back as well as I could, to prevent them from taking them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270054"/>out; she pushed to that pocket, and took them out; they were in my breeches pocket; she dropped a letter and a bill of parcels on the floor, and then ran out of the room.</p>

               <p>Did they take any thing besides the notes? - Yes, they took my cash; two of them had their hands in my pockets, Collins and the little woman; they took two half guineas, six shillings and some halfpence; then I recovered myself a little, they wanted to get away; I laid hold of one man with the one hand, and of the other with the other hand, and said, they had robbed me of forty or fifty pounds, and I would lose my life before I would let them go.</p>
               <p>What did Jones do? - She pulled my handkerchief off my neck, while they had hold of me.</p>

               <p>Did any body else come in before you laid hold of them? - Yes, Messenger came in, and picked up part of the writings which the little woman had dropped.</p>

               <p>What was found upon them? - There was nothing found upon them there, that I could swear to; they had given the notes to another girl to take care of.</p>

               <p>No more? - No more.</p>
               <p>Messenger was not taken that night? - No; the next day when I went before the Justice, I said there was an old man; they would not fully commit the others till he was taken; I took a neighbour with me down to the house, and asked the woman the name of the old man; she said it was Messenger, and while I was there he came in; that is the man; as soon as he came in I know him again, though it was candlelight when I saw him before; I said you are the man I want, I was looking for you, you must go with me; he said, blast your eyes, I will cut your bloody melt out; I told him it was no use to struggle, he should go with me; he then went readily, and shewed me the nighest way to the watch-house; the constable searched and found a handkerchief of mine upon him, and a duplicate in his pocket; I went with the officer to the pawnbroker's, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270055"/>Woodins, the corner of King's-street, Drury-lane.</p>

               <p>I live at Frome's Hotel; I sent my brother with the prisoner to Mr. Carpenter's.</p>
               <p>How long had you known him? - About two hours and a half, or three hours before.</p>
               <p>How did you become acquainted with him? - The prisoner came to the Hotel as a stranger; he was asked to dinner with me, by Mr. Frome; he said, he was just come from Paris, where he had laid out 20,000 l. with Monsieur Le Roy, a famous watch-maker of that city; he said, that in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270066"/>Holland they did not like French watches, for they were too slight; that he came to England for the purpose of buying English watches, for they were more solid; I told him, I knew a friend of mine, (meaning Mr. Carpenter) who was able to serve him, and I believed was a very honest man; after dinner, he asked me for his direction, and I sent my brother with him, with my compliments to Mr. Carpenter, and the gentleman wanted to buy some watches of him.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you his name? - He did not; I never knew his name, not even when he signed the draft in my presence.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Carpenter went away with the bill, what became of the prisoner? - The prisoner took the watches, and carried them into his room; Mr. Carpenter gave me two watches, which the prisoner did not chuse to buy, and desired me to put them away; I put them in my bureau in my own room; in the mean time, the prisoner took the opportunity to go off with the watches he had agreed for; I went in search of him, but could not see him; I went to Bow-street, and wrote a description of the prisoner to have hand-bills printed from.</p>
               <p>You do not know what his name is now, do you? - I have reason to suppose his name is Vander Cruysen; he signed that name upon the back of the warrant.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him write except that bill? - Yes, he has wrote for me part of a letter in Dutch to my wife, who is a Dutch-woman.</p>
               <p>Do you know his hand-writing? - I cannot take upon me to swear, but I thought it was something similar.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going a voyage, and came ashore to buy some things I wanted; I met with a young fellow I had known two years before, he took me up to Whitechapel, and asked me to carry this cloth for him, when Scott took me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            ; on Tuesday the 26th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I lost the things in the indictment; I was in the fore-shop, I met Mr. Cundel coming out of the back-shop from the ladies; he desired me to attend to them; upon my entering the back shop, I observed Wheeler pull some muslins off the counter into her lap, they were both sitting close to the counter; she then concealed it under her cloak and muff, she had a very large white silk cloak on, trimmed with furr, and a very large muff.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay after that? - About a quarter of an hour; they bought a remnant of Irish, which they had asked for before, about five or six shillings, they paid for it, took the parcel, and were going away together; upon their approach to the shop-door, at the distance of eight yards from where they were sitting, I attempted to lay hold of the prisoner Wheeler's apron, and she immediately turned round, and returned to where she had been sitting before, the other followed her; I saw her drop the muslins; and the other immediately picked them up, and laid them on the counter.</p>
               <p>How far were they from the counter, when you saw them drop the muslins? - Close to the counter.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by either of them at the time of dropping them? - Not till I charged them with it; Wheeler said she was surprised I should charge her with taking the muslins; Barnsley said her name was Williams, that she lived at Cold Bath-fields; Wheeler said she was acquainted with Lady Spencer, that she was a customer at the shop, and had frequently come with her servants; I sent for a constable and took them up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Those ladies came to your shop, bought a piece of Irish, and paid for it; what did they give you? - They gave Mr. Cundel a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>They bought some muslin as well as Irish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never charged them at all with the theft, till the muslins were on your counter? - No.</p>
               <p>You shewed them a number of pieces of muslin? - The counter was littered all over with muslins.</p>
               <p>Then some of the pieces might have fell down? - No, there were none down.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Percival; on the 26th of February, about four o'clock, the two prisoners came into the further end of the back shop together; Barnsley desired to see some muslin, the same as they had seen last week, that it was ell wide at nine shillings a yard; I served her with three ells of muslin, which came to thirty-five shillings, and which she bought and put in her pocket; she said I must give her change for a ten pounds note; but she recollected before I gave her change, that she wanted a small quantity of Irish, the same that she had some of the week before, at four shillings and two-pence a yard, and added, that the little man, then in the front-shop would know the sort; I left the ladies and went into the front-shop; I met Mr. Percival in the front shop, I desired he would walk into the back shop to them; they were sitting about ten yards from where I met him; I looked among the remnants of Irish, and found one, which Barnsley bought, and gave six shillings for it; I then gave her her change out of the ten pounds note; they had got their parcels, and were going out, as they were approaching the back shop door, Mr. Percival attempted to take hold of Wheeler's apron; she then turned round, and went to the place where they had been sitting; she was immediately followed by Barnsley; I saw Barnsley pick up the muslins from the floor, and lay them on the counter; when Mr. Percival immediately took the muslin, and charged Wheeler with the theft.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the place where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270073"/>they had sat down, to the place where Mr. Percival attempted to lay hold of Wheeler's apron? - Six or seven yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any muslin on the floor, before they turned back? - I did not; I think if there had been any, I could not but have seen it; Barnsley said that her name was Williams, that she lived in Cold Bath-street, Cold Bath-fields; Wheeler said that she was very well known, that Lady Spencer knew her; (the muslin produced in Court.) It is in four pieces, I marked the length of them on the muslins, previous to my taking them to Bow-street, (looks at them) upon this piece is marked three yards and five-eighths; the next piece is marked two yards and three quarters; the next is marked two yards and five eighths, and the other piece has ten yards marked upon it.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say they are your master's property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the very property that were taken up at the time by Barnsley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. These goods had been shewn to somebody, and were laying with great disorder on the counter? - Yes, in some disorder.</p>
               <p>Did you observe if any muslins were fell down? - I did not observe any down.</p>
               <p>There had been no charge made till the muslins were laid on the counter; where have these muslins been kept? - In the shop under the stairs.</p>
               <p>How many of you have had access to them? - Seven of us, masters and all.</p>
               <p>For how many days? - Ever since last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>They have not been kept under lock and key? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. What are your shop marks? - A, E, H, L, O, R, D, K, P,</p>
               <p>What is the value? - Six pounds.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told the clerk of the indictments that it was not privately, and I desired him not to lay it capital.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When Wheeler returned to the counter, was it not to look at a printed muslin, which she said if she had any, would suit her? - She certainly did.</p>
               <p>Wheeler. He said Ma'am, there is a very pretty print; that was the cause of his laying hold of my apron to shew me that, and on that account I turned back.</p>
               <p>Is the Constable here? - No.</p>
               <p>Why is he not here? - He saw nothing of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Barnsley. Whether Mr. Percival did not mark the muslin himself from a great number of other pieces? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>WHEELER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Percival denies marking the muslin, I have nothing more to say; he marked them himself, from a great quantity in his own shop, before the constable, who could have proved it.</p>
               <p>Barnsley. I leave my defence to my Counsel.</p>

I said if she would shew me the duplicates of the things, I would not be hard upon her; she said she had no duplicates; when she came to the bottom of London Bridge, on the other side, she tried to get from me, and ran down an alley, on that I called a constable directly.</p>

               <p>(The coat was produced in Court by the constable, and deposed to by Mr. M'Guire)</p>

               <p>Did you undress and go to bed? - Yes, my great coat was on the bed, my handkerchief was on a chair, and my money was in my breeches pocket, there was upwards of 4 s. I left my breeches on the side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I had rather been drinking a little.</p>
               <p>How do you know those young women had them? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Did you know them before? - I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>What light had you? - A candle in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed directly? - We sat two or three hours first.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you go to bed to both of them? - Yes, we had two half pints of gin together among four of us.</p>
               <p>Who were the four? - The prisoners and I, and the other young fellow.</p>
               <p>You said before that he left you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did positively? - If I did, it was by mistake, he left me in the room with them about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>He went away before you went to bed?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270089"/>- Yes, my great coat was found about a fortnight after at a pawnbroker's in Wild-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Are you a man of that prowess that you always have two ladies when you go to bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you not offer them your coat for the honour they did you? - I am very certain I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you direct any overtures to be made to the relations of either of the girls? - No I never did; there had been people after me, to give me money to make it up.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner Morgan pledged this coat with me for five shillings; she said it was her husband's coat.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before? - No, but I am positive the prisoner was the woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. The people that come to your shop stand back in little pigeon-holes, do not they? - Yes, but I had seen her several times before; she used our shop.</p>

               <p>There had been alarms of robberies there before? - Yes; I had seen people several times before; he was taken the next day, about twelve o'clock at noon; there was found his jacket and shoes upon the top of the house adjoining.</p>
               <p>What sort of noise was it you first heard? - I apprehend it was his getting under the bed.</p>
               <p>You had hardly time when you looked under the bed to see what clothes he had on? - Yes, his jacket was off, and his shoes.</p>

               <p>Then why should he open the garret door? - The trap-door comes to the landing-place, not in the garret, but the outside of the garret.</p>

               <p>Are you so well acquainted with the smell of aqua fortis, as to tell it from any strong acid? - I will not pretend to say upon my oath I am judge sufficient to say that; the little boy was sitting on the ground without his shoes and stockings, crying; the old man continued at work all the time making shoes, without a shirt; he had a waistcoat on; each of the lads pulled off an apron; the old man did not turn his head, nor say any thing, till we said, we must take him to the magistrate; then he seemed very much affected indeed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Smell that, (giving the witness a phial) do you think that is aqua fortis? - I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with the smell of copperas? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>You know perhaps that shoemakers use copperas to colour their heels of their shoes? - They may.</p>
               <p>Did you find any copperas in the room, except that was copperas in the bottle? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the man at work upon men's shoes? - I believe they were women's, but I cannot say.</p>

            , together with the said other persons, being so assembled and so armed, were aiding and assisting in taking and rescuing from the said Thomas Quick, the said brandy and rum, the duties of which had not been paid or secured as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Garrow, and the case by Mr. Attorney General, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury: - This is an indictment against the prisoner, founded upon an act of parliament in the nineteenth year of his late majesty, and which was then found necessary for the protection of the revenue, which was at that time, as I am sorry to say it is at present, very much and almost totally annihilated, by the violent proceedings of those engaged in this illicit traffick. - Gentlemen, the object of the act is to prevent a forcible opposition to the officers of government, in the discharge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270103"/>of their duty; the consequences of such opposition had been then so fatal, and has of late years been so fatal, that it became absolutely necessary, that severe laws should be made, in order to effectuate that end, which ought to be the purpose of every law; the prevention of the offence, as well as that of the more serious consequences, which sometimes happen; therefore it was enacted, that if any persons, to the number of three or more, shall be assembled for the purpose of rescuing uncustomed goods, after seizure, that that shall be deemed a capital felony. - Gentlemen, it will be necessary for the prosecutors to prove, in order to sustain this indictment, that the prisoner was, together with others, more than to the number of three, assembled for the purpose of rescuing, and that they actually did rescue from the officers of excise, after seizure, a considerable quantity of goods liable to pay customs, and the customs of which had not been paid. - Gentlemen, the facts are these: On the 5th of November last, a cutter, called the Resolution Cutter, in the service of the excise, was stationed off Swannick's Bay, for the purpose of looking out for smugglers; early in the morning, but when I believe it will appear to you that it was perfect day, they discovered a small cutter at anchor in Studland Bay, about four miles distant from the place where the cutter lay; upon this the smuggling cutter slipped her cable, and stood out to sea; the smugglers finding she could not make out her way, immediately went ashore, landed her goods, and carried away as many of them as they could; before the Resolution was able to come up, they had been able to carry but a very few off, and the rest was left upon the beach, or thrown into the sea, out of which the Resolution's crew took up a considerable quantity; they had secured them, and were ready to carry them away as soon as the tide would permit; having waited there about three hours, they perceived about thirty men on horseback coming towards them; and it will appear that the prisoner was one of them; they were armed, some of them with fire arms, some of them with large bludgeons, of whom the prisoner was one; and with these arms they came evidently for the purpose of rescuing these goods; upon which, Quick, the officer, called out to them, that they had arms with them, and bid them stand off, for they certainly should not rescue the goods; upon which, they cried out, fire away and be damn'd, we are come resolute! upon which, they forced on horseback against the officers; Quick ordered them to fire, which they did, and several of the smugglers fell; they then rushed in upon them, and very soon put the King's officers to flight, except Quick, who was knocked down, and lay senseless for some time; the rest ran into the water till they were up to their necks; the smugglers went into the water after them on horseback, and it was God's providence alone that preserved any of them: when Quick came to his senses, he found that he had not only received the blow that laid him senseless, but that the smugglers had in the most inhuman manner cut and mangled him in the way he will describe to you; upon this, another party of smugglers came with a waggon and cart; the officers not being able to protect their seizure, the smugglers put the goods into the cart and waggon, and carried them away. Gentlemen, this is the kind of case I have to lay before you; no men would venture their lives, if laws of this kind were not made to prevent such offences; and the officers of the crown do no more than their duty, in bringing to justice the prisoner at the bar: It is not for me to comment upon these offences, because you know the laws of this country must be maintained, in a rigid execution of them: whether this man falls within the law, it is for you to determine; I have stated to you the law and the evidence; if the evidence comes up at all to the brief I have in my hand, there can be no doubt, but the prisoner is guilty of the offence, of being assembled with others to the number of more than three, with fire-arms and other offensive weapons,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270104"/>concerning which, you will have my Lord's direction; sticks, commonly called walking-sticks, certainly would not be considered as offensive weapons; you will judge whether the arms were fire arms, or bludgeons, such as were made for the purpose: if the evidence comes up to the case, I am sure you will find the prisoner guilty; if it does not, you will of course acquit him.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Solicitor General.</p>
               <p>What is your occupation? - I am a mariner.</p>
               <p>On board of what ship was you in November last? - The Resolution.</p>
               <p>Where was you on the 6th of November last? - In the morning we lay in <placeName id="t17880227-106-crimeloc507">Swannick's Bay</placeName>

               <p>Were you on shore that morning? - Yes, about ten o'clock, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Quick, the officer of excise, that morning? - Yes, he landed a few minutes after me in another boat.</p>
               <p>Describe to the Jury what passed upon Quick's coming on shore? - From her coming from the cutter, we saw a small boat that we supposed was what they call a tub-boat, a boat used by smugglers to carry tubs.</p>
               <p>Upon seeing this boat, what passed? - We pursued her to the shore, and in a little time she landed; we saw her land, and the four men that were in her, ran up the sands.</p>
               <p>Where did you see her first? - About three miles from Swannick's Bay.</p>
               <p>Was she sailing? - Yes, towards the land; the four men ran up the sands, each of them taking a tub; the tubs are four gallon casks.</p>
               <p>What passed after that? - In a few minutes after we landed; and in the wash, the surf that runs upon the shore, we found about one hundred and forty, or one hundred and fifty small casks of spirits, which we saw thrown out of the aforesaid tub-boat; we seized them, and piled them up in a heap; we endeavoured to launch them off in our own boats, but on account of the surf running so high upon the shore, we found it impracticable, we could not get them off; we continued so without any thing material happening for about the space of two hours.</p>
               <p>What time of day might this be? - It might be about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you stand by the casks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. At the end of two hours, what happened? - We perceived a company of men on horseback.</p>
               <p>How many in number as near as you can judge? - As near as I can judge thirty or forty; I am sure upwards of thirty.</p>
               <p>Had these persons any things with them? - When they came nearer, we perceived they had clubs.</p>
               <p>Describe to the Jury what sort of clubs? - They were near about three feet long; the small end was about the bigness of a common walking cane; the large end came to a large knot about as big as the fist of a child of ten years old.</p>
               <p>Did this appear to be a walking-stick? - I never knew them used as walking-sticks; they must be very unhandy for walking.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner at the bar one of those thirty? - That man was very near in front.</p>
               <p>You are very sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he any such stick as you have described? - He had one of them.</p>
               <p>What did you observe the prisoner do? - I cannot say any thing of the prisoner, any farther than that there was a general explanation.</p>
               <p>What was said? - When they came within twenty or thirty yards, the mate, Mr. Quick, desired them to stand off, or he would fire at them.</p>
               <p>How near were they when this happened? - Twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this explanation before or after Quick desired them to stand off? - After.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. What answer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270105"/>was given to this? - Fire, you b - g - rs, fire, we are come resolute.</p>
               <p>What passed upon this? - Upon that, most of us fired.</p>
               <p>How many were you in number? - Eleven.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of this? - I saw immediately, one man drop from his horse.</p>
               <p>Go on? - The company rushed in among our people.</p>
               <p>What did you perceive then? - I saw two men beating Mr. Quick, the ate, with these large stick; I having a musquet in my hand, ran down to relieve Mr. Quick.</p>
               <p>In what condition did you find Mr. Quick? - He was all over blood; the blood was gushing out at his head.</p>
               <p>What passed upon your coming up? - As soon as I had cleared him of the men that was beating him, I received a blow myself that made me stagger.</p>
               <p>What was that blow given to you with? - I cannot tell, as the man was not in front of me; I cannot say; he was behind me.</p>
               <p>Was it a blow with a fist? - It appeared by the cut to be a cutlass, for it cut my hat as sharp as a knife, and cut my head in the crown.</p>
               <p>After you received this blow, what happened? - I had not recovered staggering till I received a second blow.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive what that blow was given with? - It must have been with a cudgel or stick; it did not cut me, but brought me to the ground.</p>
               <p>Having received this second blow, what happened? - I lay blind some little time; the first thing I saw, was a man making a blow with one of these sticks at me; as Mr. Quick and I lay close together; we received each of us a blow with these sticks from near twenty of the party; one man snapped a pistol at me twice.</p>
               <p>As you lay in that situation? - As I lay upon the ground; finding the pistol would not go off, he took the pistol and rammed it into my mouth, knocked out two of my teeth, and loosened three.</p>
               <p>Did you see any fire-arms? - When they first came up I saw none.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards? - Afterwards, I saw several of them have pistols.</p>
               <p>Were there any other sort of fire-arms? - They had some of them; I cannot describe the number; they were short pieces, like carbines; they appeared to me to be musquets with half the barrel cut off.</p>
               <p>Were there any other species of arms besides these? - There were cutlasses besides.</p>
               <p>Describe the situation that Quick was in? - When I first recovered, he was lying like dead; I hardly thought that he could survive long; he hardly flinched when he received the blows with the stick.</p>
               <p>You mean the last blows? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe among those persons that any of them fired? - There were two of them fired, but what, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>In what direction? - One of them towards the sands, and one towards the water.</p>
               <p>Towards your people? - At that time, I could only see our mate and another man; we lay upon the sand close by the water-side; while we were in that state, this company, with about ten more than first came, came with a cart and waggon.</p>
               <p>What did they do with this cart and waggon? - They loaded the tubs that we had seized, upon the cart and waggon.</p>
               <p>What did they do with them? - They rode off with the waggon, and their whole company as a guard, putting their wounded upon the waggon and cart; they put three upon the waggon and two upon the cart, that I suppose could not ride on horseback, and covered them up with great coats, and rode off.</p>
               <p>What became of Quick? - He was carried away by our people, upon two oars.</p>
               <p>In what condition was he? - When I spoke to him, he could not speak; he only shook his head and waved his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270106"/>And was carried off in that condition? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were in the casks? - I smelt brandy and tasted rum; they were four gallon casks; they were slung.</p>
               <p>Describe exactly what the slings are, and how they were connected with these casks? - They are small slings, made of small cord; they were made fast round the cask for the more convenient carriage of them.</p>
               <p>Court. How many of these casks might be so tied together? - Every cask was separate with a sling about it.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Sheppard.)</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the service of the Revenue? - Near ten months.</p>
               <p>I think you say there were four men in the tub-boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they sailors? - There was one of them a sailor; two of them were young lads, about sixteen years old.</p>
               <p>The first time you saw the prisoner was on horseback coming down upon the shore? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As soon as you told them to stand off, you fired? - Quick fired; I cannot say we all fired.</p>
               <p>Quick was the first man that fired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many do you think you might kill? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How many did you see turn about and ride off wounded? - There was one man wounded; they took him off his horse, and put him in the cart; by the time that I recovered my sight, the waggon was close to us.</p>
               <p>It was some time you know before you was knocked down after you fired? - No time all.</p>
               <p>Upon your party's firing immediately, the other party pushed in upon you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was a man then dropped from his horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw the prisoner before that time? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>How long did you observe him? - I observed them some little time as they were riding off, to see if I knew any of the company.</p>
               <p>But you did not know this man? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you first see him afterwards? - At Southampton, after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is Adams? - An inspector of the out-ports of excise.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body you knew him at that time? - Yes, the captain of the cutter I belonged to was with me; he asked me, if I knew him? and I said, I did.</p>
               <p>At that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You recollected him, when you saw him at Southampton; there was no difference in him? - Yes, he looked rather thinner, but there was no material difference.</p>
               <p>This was the 6th of November? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose he appeared the same then, that he does now? - He looked rather fuller.</p>
               <p>With a patch upon the side of his face? - No.</p>
               <p>Nothing of that kind, at that time? - No; he was then dressed in a long smock frock.</p>
               <p>He had no mark upon his face at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you seen any others of the party since? - I have seen none else.</p>
               <p>This man was amongst the thirty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were many of them in long smock-frocks? - Most of them were.</p>
               <p>How far off might he be when you fired? - Not above ten yards.</p>
               <p>You saw no more of him after you had fired? - Not that I can possibly say.</p>
               <p>I believe most of your shot told? - I cannot say for my own, for it did not go off.</p>
               <p>When you fired, then it was that they broke in upon you, and knocked you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular in this man's face that made you recollect him? - The only thing was his complexion and features; as I might suppose, if I were to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270107"/>any one of the gentlemen here, and was to see him again, I should say, I saw that man at such a place.</p>
               <p>But suppose you were to see him a month afterwards, should you recollect him? - Yes, if I looked very attentively; and from the notice I took of this man, I know him to be one.</p>
               <p>How came you to take notice of him in particular? - I took notice of all that were in front.</p>
               <p>Do you think you could recollect at a month's distance? - I think, I could; I do not speak from any resentment against that man.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it that you saw this man at Southampton? - About a fortnight ago, or nearly thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Do you think if you had met that man, and had looked at him, you should have known him without his being pointed out to you? - If I had not looked at him, I should not; but if I had looked at him, I should.</p>
               <p>About the middle of this month it was that you saw him? - About the 14th, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Where have you been since this accident? - Mostly at Southampton.</p>
               <p>You have seen many there in smock-frocks? - A great many.</p>
               <p>How long after this was it, that Quick gave information to the Board of Excise? - I believe immediately; I have heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give any information yourself? - Of what.</p>
               <p>About this man? - I could give no particular observations, further than I described the man at front; that he was a man of such statute.</p>
               <p>To whom did you give that description? - To the officers, at Pool.</p>
               <p>Give us a description of some of the others in front? - There was another man next to the prisoner, was a stouter man than any of the others; they asked me, if I should know them again, if I saw them; I told them, I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. I think you said at the time, that Quick advised them to keep off, that they were within forty yards distance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the firing was, they were about ten yards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they continue advancing? - Yes, with their full bent on horseback.</p>

               <p>A boat belonging to the Resolution cutter? - It was; after I got out of Bourne-sea, I saw a vessel lying riding upon anchor, in Studland-bay, which I supposed to be a smuggler, and when she discovered me, she slipped, and went out of the bay.</p>
               <p>You saw her slip? - Yes; she was going to the Westward, but seeing the Resolution, she hauled her weather, and went down upon the North shore; I chased her in the boat, the captain in the cutter; the captain got up with her; before I pulled in my boat, the smuggler had sent his boat on shore.</p>
               <p>You saw that? - Yes; the captain immediately hoisted his four oar'd boat, and sent her on shore after the smuggling-boat, with four men in her; as soon as I arrived at the spot, I went on shore, and seized the goods which were all lying upon the land-wash of the sea; I got them together all on a heap, as quick as possible.</p>
               <p>What did you get together? - The tubs.</p>
               <p>What kind of tubs were they? - What they call half-ankers.</p>
               <p>What liquor? - Rum; I tasted.</p>
               <p>Were they in flings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You tasted nothing but rum?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270108"/>- Nothing but rum; after I got them together, I tried to launch the four-oar'd boat to get the goods on board of the cutter, but the sea ran so high, I found it impossible to get either of my own boats off; after that, I got my own masts and fails into the smuggling-boat, and endeavoured to launch that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You thought the smuggling boat would launch sooner than your own? - Yes, because she was flat, and would rise lighter; while I was putting the goods on board, I saw a party of people riding down from Bourne-bottom.</p>
               <p>How many might that party consist of? - About thirty; seeing them ride down in their long smock-frocks, I took them to be smugglers; I ordered my people to take to their arms.</p>
               <p>Court. They were in smock-frocks, were they? - Most of them; they accordingly did take to their arms; as soon as the smugglers came within hearing, I desired them not to ride any farther, if they did, I would sire upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How near might they be when you gave them that caution? - About ten or twelve yards, or rather better; upon which, the answer they made me, was; d - n your eyes! fire, you b - g - rs, fire! they rode up immediately, with their sticks brandishing over their heads; upon which, I ordered my people to fire, and fire! myself; when one man dropped from his horse.</p>
               <p>Had you observed the persons of any of those that came up? - One that was a-foot upon the shore, of the name of Dominy, I am sure I should know again.</p>
               <p>But of the thirty that came up, do you know the persons of any? - I cannot swear positively.</p>
               <p>Look at that man? - I cannot swear positively to him; after this man fell from his horse, they rode in upon me, and the man that was on shore, cleft my skull with a tomahawk, which he got out of my own boat; cut a piece out of my left arm, wounded me in my right hip, cut me across my left hand, and broke my right hand little finger; after they had done that, they beat me in a very cruel manner; I was lying upon the sands; they bruised me from head to foot very much.</p>
               <p>Had you observed what the men had in their hands when they came up? - Some sticks, some whips.</p>
               <p>What sort of sticks? - They might be as big round as a large broomstick, with a large head to them.</p>
               <p>How long were they? - About three feet, or three feet and a half, as nigh as I can tell by the sight of them.</p>
               <p>What kind of whips were they? - They seemed to be large loaded whips; I cannot say they were loaded, but they appeared to me to be large loaded whips.</p>
               <p>What was the size of the end of the whips? - About as big round as the large end of a broomstick.</p>
               <p>As you lay upon the ground, you say you received several blows; do you know what you was beat with? - With those sticks; they laid hold of the small end, beating me with the large end; after beating me, and wounding some more of my people, they drove off the goods in triumph, in a waggon and a cart.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of the rest of your people? - No, I was in a state of insensibility at that time.</p>
               <p>Therefore you do not know what became of your people? - I do not.</p>
               <p>You was afterwards carried on board; I believe that was all you knew? - That was all I knew.</p>
               <p>You did not see the goods carried off then? - Yes, but after that I bled so much, that I was insensible.</p>
               <p>What has been the consequence of those blows? - It affects my legs; a paralytic disorder proceeds from the wounds of my head, to my leg on that side.</p>
               <p>How long was you confined? - Between five and six weeks in my chamber.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys.)</p>
               <p>You say, these persons were about ten or twelve yards distance, when they first came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270109"/>Upon that you gave immediate orders to fire? - I desired them to stand off.</p>
               <p>And they not standing off, you desired them to fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon the firing, I take it a scuffle immediately commenced? - It did.</p>
               <p>You were of course, in a great deal of confusion, as well as the other men at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have stated a tomahawk being made use of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That came out of your own boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was not brought by these people? - No.</p>
               <p>Your own own masts and fails were in the smuggler's boat at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were in the way that the smugglers had to go to their own boat? - No; the goods were all on shore.</p>
               <p>But they must have passed you to have gone to their own boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were no other weapons besides sticks and whips, except this tomahawk? - I did not observe any other.</p>
               <p>And this mischief was done you by this Dominy, who is not yet taken? - It was; he came behind me, and cut me with a tomahawk.</p>

               <p>Do you know who the man was, who fell from his horse, who was shot? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>He was shot before any scuffle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You was the first person knocked down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you seized the boat? - I had clapped the broad arrow upon her, in two places.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There was no firing from the smugglers? - Not that I remember.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>(Examined by Mr. Fielding.)</p>
               <p>You belong to the Resolution cutter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Quick was the mate of that cutter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you in the boat with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You landed with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you see upon the beach when you first landed? - Some tubs swimming in the water.</p>
               <p>You collected them together afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you been on shore by the beach and taken possession of these tubs, before you saw a company of men coming down upon you? - As nigh as I can guess about two hours.</p>
               <p>What o'clock was it, as near as you can guess? - About ten o'clock, when I came on shore.</p>
               <p>How many do you think there were? - I cannot rightly say; there might be thirty, or there might be more; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When they had come within twenty or thirty, or ten yards, was any thing said by Quick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near were they then? - They might not be any further than from one end of this table to the other.</p>
               <p>You were near enough to hear distinctly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did Quick say? - He desired them to keep off, or he would fire.</p>
               <p>What answer was made? - They said, fire, you b - g - rs, fire! for we are come resolutely bent!</p>
               <p>After that answer was so made by them, what was done? - Quick ordered us to fire; he fired first, and then ordered me to fire.</p>
               <p>When you had obeyed this order, did you perceive the effects of your firing? - We saw one or two men drop.</p>
               <p>When you had seen them drop, what followed immediately? - As soon as they had dropped, they rode in upon us, and knocked us down.</p>
               <p>Now look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he one of the company? - He was one of the company.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what situation was he in the company? - He came on horseback, with a large club in his hand, not quite so big as my fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270110"/>In what manner was this club carried? - By the small end, and the big end above his head.</p>
               <p>In what situation was he; as there were thirty of them, some must be forward, and some behind; was he in the front? - He was nearly in the front, there was one before him.</p>
               <p>And you took observation enough to say he was one of the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he came forward, did you see who he assaulted? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see whether he assaulted any one? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What became of you? - I ran into the water, and as I was in the water, a man came to me, and pointed a musket.</p>
               <p>One of the company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On horseback? - Yes; he pointed a musket at me, and snapped it, I suppose a dozen times, and it did not go off.</p>
               <p>What became of you at that time? - As soon as that man went away, there were three more came and knocked me down, cut me in the head, and bruised me very much.</p>
               <p>In the water? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did they do after they had knocked you down in the water? - They knocked down every one they came nigh, and went away with the goods.</p>
               <p>In what manner were they loaded? - In a waggon and a cart.</p>
               <p>Did they all go away with them? - Yes, they all ran away with the goods.</p>
               <p>Do you happen yourself to know what those casks contained? - About four gallons each.</p>
               <p>But did you taste any of the liquors? - What I tasted was rum.</p>
               <p>What became of Quick after they were gone? - We came and took them up that were wounded, and carried them on board.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that man, the prisoner at the bar, was there? - Yes I am, he certainly was on the shore.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Sheppard.)</p>
               <p>Where did you see him first after this happened? - At Southampton.</p>
               <p>A fortnight ago? - It might be a fortnight, I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>That was the first time you had seen him since that happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - Yes, I saw him upon the shore.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before the time the affray happened? - No.</p>
               <p>There could not be much time intervene between your firing and their attacking you; they were very near you when you fired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say there might be one or two men before this man? - There might be one or two, he was almost as soon as e'er a one.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing of him after you had fired? - No.</p>
               <p>Then, in fact, the only time you saw this man, was when they were advancing in this riotous manner, and when Quick ordered you to fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think all this took up two minutes? - Yes, ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did they make any halt at all? - No.</p>
               <p>They came up galloping very furiously, when Quick called to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they called out, fire, you b - g - rs, fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was the only opportunity you had of observing him? - We had a very fair opportunity of observing him.</p>
               <p>Jury. What distance was this man from you, when you first saw him? - I suppose he was not above ten or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>You particularly saw him, so as to be perfectly sure? - Yes, perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>You never saw him till he was in custody? - No.</p>
               <p>And then he was pointed out to you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>The learned Judge having summed up the evidence to the Jury, proceeded to make the following observations.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. - This is the evidence on the part of the prosecution, and this prosecution is founded upon part of an act of parliament, which was passed in the 19th year of the late king's reign; in which it is enacted, that if any persons, to the number of three or more, armed with firearms, or other offensive weapons, shall be assembled, in order to be aiding and assisting, in the running, landing, or carrying away prohibited, or uncustomed goods, or goods liable to any duties, which have not been paid or secured; or after having been seized, to take them from any officer or officers of excise: in that case, and other cases specified in the act, but which are now out of the case, it shall be deemed a capital felony; so that the crime for which the prisoner stands indicted, is a capital offence. The question is, whether he comes within the meaning of the act. It is certainly true, that the mere act of rescuing smuggled goods, is not now, of itself, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270112"/>capital felony; because though it was so under this present act of the 19th of

            . the subsequent act has described that offence, and made it a misdemeanor only; and subjected the offenders to certain punishments less than this act of parliament had described for that offence: the construction is, that this is a virtual repeal of the statute of the 12th of

            . so far as it goes to inflict the capital punishment, upon the rescuing of the goods. - That part upon which the prisoner must be convicted or acquitted is, that he with other persons, to the number of three or more, armed with fire-arms, and other offensive weapons, was assembled, in order to be aiding and assisting, in taking those prohibited goods, or rescuing the same after the seizure by the officers of excise; so that to bring the prisoner's case within the meaning of the act, it is necessary he should assemble with other persons, with the intent, and for the purposes of the act; and that the persons so assembled should have been armed with fire-arms, or other offensive weapons; and in my opinion this act requires, that every person charged with having committed the offence, should be proved himself to be actually so armed; and that if the prisoner had been seen unarmed in this assembly, and every other man in the assembly had been armed, I should have been of opinion that the prisoner was not within the meaning of the act. Therefore the question for your consideration in the first place will be, whether any persons with whom the prisoner was connected, did assemble armed, and whether the prisoner was so armed, for the purpose of assisting in preventing or in rescuing the seizure? In the first place, with regard to these things being uncustomed goods, I believe you can have little or no doubt; the circumstances of their landing in the manner they did, the casks are found to contain goods liable to the payment of the customs and excise, their being in those small casks with slings tied round each cask; the pursuit of a boat with such a sort of cargo on board, the landing of that cargo, and the men running away from it, must leave very little doubt in your minds but these goods were certainly smuggled goods, and were brought there for the purpose of being landed. - Then, gentlemen, the question will be, whether you are of opinion that the prisoner was a person present; the next question will be, whether the persons assembled, the persons who committed these outrages, and who have in fact carried away the smuggled goods, did assemble for the purpose of rescuing the goods. Then what is the evidence? The goods are landed, they are in possession of the revenue officers, who are making preparations for carrying them off, but are prevented from doing it immediately; they had them in their possession two hours; the men who land them leave them, and in two hours time there appear men to the number of thirty or more, with certain instruments, sticks or clubs; these men advance precipitately; upon their coming up, they are called upon to desist, or they would be fired at; and then they use terms of high provocation and defiance, bidding them fire and be damned, with very opprobrious names; the party are too numerous, they overpower them, and several of them are ill treated, as you hear by the witnesses. In consequence of this, the revenue officers being overpowered, the goods are carried away in a waggon and cart, which waggon and cart are brought down; this is a very material circumstance; there arrives very soon after these men a waggon and cart, and into this waggon and cart are these goods put, and carried away under the guard of the whole company; then the question will be, whether they originally assembled for the very purpose of that which they effected? Now, Gentlemen, their number and the circumstances under which they come, their bidding defiance, and their actually taking away the goods, are circumstances for you to put together, in order to decide, whether they did or not assemble for the purpose of doing this act. The next question for your consideration then will be, whether the prisoner at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270113"/>bar is one of those men; if you are of opinion that they were not so assembled, I mean the body which he joined, then of course there will be an end of his guilt; then the question will be, whether the prisoner was one of those persons? now you see upon what evidence that rests; there are, to be sure, two witnesses who speak to it, but the prisoner was a stranger to both those witnesses till this happened; they had but a short time to observe his face; neither of them were acquainted with the prisoner, nor did they see him again (this was upon the 6th of November) till about the 14th of this last month; when they did see him again the second time he was in custody; they were called to look at him; they both agreed that he was the man; there certainly was a very material difference in his appearance, owing to some accident which appears about his head, the marks of which he now bears; but however, they do undertake to swear, that notwithstanding that difference, he was one of those men. Then, Gentlemen, the next consideration for you will be, provided you are satisfied the witnesses are not mistaken, whether the prisoner was armed with an offensive weapon; for it is essential that he should be himself individually armed with an offensive weapon; for though all the rest were armed, if he was not he would not be within the meaning of the act. Now, Gentlemen, you have heard a great deal from the Counsel on both sides; to be sure I do not go the length of one of the Counsel, in saying that any instrument whatever it be, is an offensive weapon if it is used as such; a common cane that a man usually carries would not, in my opinion amount to the offensive weapon mentioned in the act; but my notion of the act is this, that if it is an usual instrument, if it is a common stick that he carries in his hand, or a stick that he may carry without exciting any surprize from the size of it, it would not come within the description; but any instrument that imports terror in its appearance, and that may serve to intimidate persons, that instrument, in my opinion, will be an offensive weapon within the meaning of the act, if that instrument is shewn in such a way as to intimidate. Gentlemen, it was a stick, one witness says, about three feet, and another about three feet and a half long; but he describes it to be about the size of a large broomstick, with a large head to it; there was no name to it, and perhaps it was not fit should have a name, but it was said with such the prisoner was armed at that time; the prisoner when he appeared carried it over his head, which was in an offensive manner no doubt. I shall leave it entirely to you, whether the instrument, as you have heard it described by the witnesses, was an offensive instrument, and liable to produce that terror to the witnesses from which danger was likely ensue; if you are of that opinion, it will be an offensive weapon, within the meaning of the act; but it depends upon whether you are satisfied that the persons were assembled for the purpose of carrying away the goods; that they were so armed; and that you are satisfied in your conscience that the prisoner is one of the men; it depends upon these circumstances whether you convict the prisoner: It will be your duty to acquit him, if you are not satisfied that the company in which he is supposed to have been, did assemble for that purpose; or if you think that he himself, with them, was not so assembled; or that they were not armed, that is particularly, that the prisoner was not armed with such a weapon as may be deemed an offensive weapon; for all these circumstances must concur before you can convict the prisoner; you will exercise your own judgement, and either convict or acquit the prisoner, as the circumstances shall appear to you.</p>

               <p>You did not see it in her bosom? - No, I took it from under her coat, and her hand was over it, I heard it drop on the ground; it was a piece of maroon ribbon, I gave it to Mrs. Winch, and I saw Mrs. Winch give it to my husband.</p>

               <p>Court. Where were you going? - To intercept them at the Indian Queen, where they were to cross the road; but we met them at the eight-mile-stone, as near as I can recollect; we met a gang of them; there might be eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen, I cannot tell; Gliddon was rather before us, and they beat him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. How forward was Gliddon before you? - From ten to twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Did you see them attack Gliddon? - Yes, and they came up to me; I asked them what they carried, and they said, who are you? or clear the road, or something to that purpose.</p>

            . What did they carry? - Ankers of liquor upon the horses; when we attacked them, and insisted upon knowing what they carried, some of them said, off! off! and immediately quitted their horses; two or three of them passed me on horseback, with each of them two ankers under them, particularly the prisoner at the bar; they would not get off their horses; they stood in a party off the road; they had engaged some of my officers before; I came up to the prisoner, and a little scuffle ensued between he and I; I insisted upon his stopping his horse, but he would not; I rode side by side with him, close to him, for twenty yards, or more.</p>
               <p>Had you during that time, an opportunity of observing his person? - Yes, I have not the least doubt of his person.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to speak with certainty? - Quite sufficient.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt? - None at all; I had an opportunity, about nine days or a fortnight afterwards, to call at his house; I had cut him with my cutlass in the arm, and when I saw him at his house, his arm was in a sling, and he looked very sour at me; I had before seen the prisoner, and knew his person, but the reason of my going to the house was, because I did not know his name; I went to see if the man that I knew by sight, was the prisoner by name; we had drove three horses that they had quitted with ankers of liquors upon them, before us; Mr. Gliddon came up, and the smugglers followed us, beating us with large bludgeons, till my arms and back were quite black, and so were the officers that were with me; they called out after us a cant word,</p>
               <p>"Ooro;" swearing, that they would lose their lives, before they would lose their goods; we went on till the road was firm; for where we attacked them first, there were tin works, and it was dangerous to turn a horse out of the road; when I came to that part of the road which I knew, I turned my horse upon the common; I told them, now my lads, I will shew you some sport; they turned back, and said, let them go and be d - n'd to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270119"/>What liquor was upon the horses? - Brandy, rum, and gin.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - I got it home and tasted it; I got three horses and six ankers.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any blow from any particular person? - Yes; I had a blow from the prisoner with a stick upon my arm, but not so hard as from the others.</p>
               <p>Was your horse wounded? - Yes; something run through his cheek, an edge-tool; there was another horse that was shot, and had the mark of a bayonet, or some instrument, I cannot tell what, run into his buttock, as they tell me; I do not swear to that.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not see the horse shot? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Lens.)</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - Eleven or twelve, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - Tolerable; neither very light, nor very dark; but it was light enough for me to see a man and horse at the distance of three or four hundred yards; I saw a man and horse at that distance, which I believed to be a smuggler, out upon the spy.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suppose that horse was at so great a distance? - He stopped, and we rode up to him, I believe about two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes; I had surveyed several places where I had seen him.</p>
               <p>Then what was the occasion of your going to his house when he looked so sourly at you? - I went to convince myself that it was the same man I saw upon the ankers.</p>
               <p>Be kind enough to to tell us what you mean by looking sourly? - I went in, and said, how do you do, and he said, what is that to you.</p>
               <p>You say they followed you, beating you with bludgeons five or six feet long? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know what you say? - Yes; they could not have reached me very well, without being that length; you may give them what term you please, but they had sticks of that length.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this transaction that you charged the prisoner with being concerned in this business? - It might be nine days or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him how he came wounded? - I told him I was very sorry to find he had been engaged in the practice of smuggling, on account of his family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Are you perfectly sure that the prisoner is the man; be quite sure? - I am perfectly sure; I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Had they any permit with their liquors? - No; none at all.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>I am an officer of excise; I was with Mr. Llewellyn, on the 22d of April last, between nine and ten o'clock, I called Mr. Shallcross, and a corporal and serjeant of marines.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Shallcross an officer of excise? - Yes, we all went about seven or eight miles; about eleven o'clock we were OR Gauce Moor.</p>
               <p>Was it light or dark? - It could not be very light, because it was a new moon, but it was so light that I could see the colour of a man's clothes; I saw a man at the distance of ten yards with a white jacket on.</p>
               <p>What happened? - I rode foremost; I passed one or two horses loaded with ankers; then I called out to them, and said, halloo, gentlemen, what do you carry here? immediately a man cried out, all off! all off! then I saw two of them talking together; one of them said to the other, lend me your stick, if I don't do for him, I'll be d - n'd; I attempted a blow at them with a stick I had in my hand, but the stick flew out of my hand; I received blows from them, before I struck either of them, and I do not know that I struck either of them at last; I had received a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270120"/>great many blows; my horse was killed under me, he was shot in the rump, and likewise stabbed near the same place; we drove on three loaded horses before us, and they kept following us and beating us; they said, they would sooner lose their lives than their goods; I believe we rode on a mile, and they followed us, beating us, and huzzaing; by-and-by we began to huzza as well as them; they then said, d - n them, let them go, it is of no use to follow them any further.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection of the prisoner? - Yes; but I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lens. You do not profess to have so good a sight as the last witness; you say, that at the distance of ten yards you could discover a man with a white jacket on? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How many were there? - I believe six or seven; we rode up to them; I told them I was an excise-officer, that I should seize the tubs and the horses; they swore they would be d - nd if I should; I should not have a single tub; I told them if they would be easy and quiet, and let us have the liquor and casks, we would give them their horses; no, they swore we should not have a single tub; some of them attacked us with whips, and two others ran and pulled out some hedge-stakes about five or six feet long, and then they came and knocked my horse down, which brought me down; then one of them hit me over the back with an hedge-stake; one of them halloo'd out, do him! do him! or something to that purpose; then Turner rode in with his cutlass, and that saved me; I then caught hold of one of their horses that had got a tub strapped on upon a little bit of a pad behind the saddle, and got up upon him as soon as I could; then they began pelting us with flint stones; one of them swore I had stole his horse; I shot at them seven or eight times, and I believe one of the balls went into Burgess's thigh; they followed us, pelting us with stones, and beating us, till at last, though I happened to have an iron hat on, they threw a stone, that made a dent in my head, and it bounded up, a matter of fourteen or twenty yards; one of my comrades said, ride! ride! or you will be killed; I had fired pretty nigh all my ammunition;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270121"/>Turner called them by their names, and told them, I was an officer, and that they had better not obstruct us, for it would be at their peril, and that they must suffer for it, and cautioned them over and over again; we rode half a mile further, and then we took one of the tubs and spiled it; and found it to be gin; we put that tub into a ditch, and rode on to four or five houses, trying to get a gun; for they did not mind being shot at with pistols; we got a gun and some powder and shot; when we came back, there were five or six of them assembled in the middle of a field where there were stones as thick as they could lay; it joined the valley where we first attacked them; they ran away from the tubs into the wood, but before we could get to load any of them upon the horses, they came out of the wood again, and swore we should not have any of them away; I told them if they did not keep off, I would fire at them with a gun; I shot at the legs of two of them, and they ran again into the wood.</p>
               <p>Why did you shoot at their legs? - Because I did not want to hurt them, I thought to frighten them; they assembled again, and swore we should not take them; I told them if they came any nigher, I would shoot at them; they pulled their coats off, and pelted us with stones; one of the stones hit the barrel of the gun I had in my hand; Thomas Francis was very resolute.</p>
               <p>Are you perfectly sure it was he? - Yes; I pointed the gun at him, and he held up his arms before his face, and said, shoot and be d - n'd, I dont care for you; I fired at them wit powder and small shot, and that drove them off; then we got the goods and drove them about the wood.</p>
               <p>What did the casks contain? - The twenty-two tubs contained Holland's gin; I tasted them.</p>
               <p>You are sure that

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>You are in the Excise? - No, I am not, nor was not at that time; I was going across the country to execute a warrant; Mr. Edmunds and Rhodes were going the same way, and I went with them.</p>
               <p>What time of day was it when you went to Starchfield? - About 12 o'clock; when we got to Starchfield, we put our horses into a copse, and left Rhodes with them; we walked across two fields, when Rhodes came after us, and told us the smugglers were gone past; we pursued them, and overtook them in a mile and a quarter tapping their tubs; Mr. Edmunds and I rode up to them, Rhodes was rather behind.</p>
               <p>How many were there? - I am sure there were five, but I cannot say exactly to the number; Mr. Edmunds told them he must seize the goods; they swore he should not; they blasted their eyes, and used other imprecations; three of them went to the hedge, and pulled out hedge stakes five or six feet long; one of them struck Mr. Edmunds's horse, and knocked him down; he was going to strike Edmunds with his stick, and said, damn your eyes, I'll do for you, which, if I had not intercepted that blow,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270122"/>it would have killed him; one of them hit me with a stick and made me drop my reins; they followed us and beat us very much; they pelted us with stones; Edmunds had an iron crown to his hat, and one of the stones bounded from his head as high as this cieling; we retreated when we found we could do nothing for the stones; Rhodes had fired, but my pistols were damp, and would not go off at all; Edmunds's face was so violently swelled with the beating, that a person that had not been very well acquainted with him, would not have known him; the swelling came on gradually.</p>
               <p>Edmunds had fired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were in a field where there were plenty of stones? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which seemed to be the most formidable workmen, the stones or the pistol? - When they found they could not do any thing with me with the sword, they found the stones best; Edmunds got upon one of the smugglers horses, and we retreated when we found stones come so fast.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of the men before? - Yes, I knew them well before; I had formerly been an officer in that part of the country; we went and got a gun and another person to assist us; when we came back they were in the field; they were off their horses, and the tubs unloaded, bidding defiance to any body that should oppose; we went up and attacked them; they retreated; Edmunds told them he should certainly fire upon them, for that he had regularly seized them; says I, Burgess, you know very well you are acting against the law; the other two persons I knew as well, but not by name.</p>

               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. How long had you known the persons? - I had known Burgess several years; I had known the other about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Downer.)</p>
               <p>You say they are known to you; perhaps you are as well known to them? - Perhaps so.</p>

            , I understand? - Yes, that is the name the smugglers gave me.</p>
               <p>How happened it that you was removed from the custom-house? - I was moved to an inland place, and having a vast quantity of liquors under the staving act, and unsettled, that was the reason of my going out.</p>
               <p>You had time enough to have taken them and the tubs too, before they could have had an opportunity of getting hedge-stakes? - I believe it might have been done if Rhodes had come up, but he was behind, and we did not wish to be desperate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The smugglers gave you the name of

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270128"/>Mr. HODGSON</p>
               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>Mr. HODGSON (without the smallest Imputation on the Systems of his Cotemporaries, whose Merits he chearfully acknowledges) pledges himself to take nothing for his Transcripts, if any Gentleman who solicits a cause, or the Counsel whose Arguments he professes to take, are not compleatly satisfied with his Performances.</p>
               <p>A new Edition (being the third) of HODGSON'S TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND, which is a sufficient Instructor of itself, is just reprinted, and Mr. Hodgson in order to accommodate all sorts of Purchasers, has reduced the Price to Eighteen pence only; also his new Publication, entitled,</p>
               <p>"SHORT-HAND CONTRACTIONS, adapted to every System of</p>
               <p>"Short-Hand; to which are added, a Comparative Table of Short-Hand Alphabets,</p>
               <p>"and two Extracts by way of Specimen, with two Copper-plates annexed," Price only 2 s. 6 d. are sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Matthews, Egerton, Fourdrinier, and all the Booksellers.</p>
               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No. 35, Chancery-lane, will receive immediate Answers, and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law and others, immediately attended to: Addressed to Mr. Hodgson, at his House, No. 13, White Lyon Row, Islington, or left for him, at No. 35, Chancery-Lane.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>The numerous and particular Trials which have been much enquired after, Mr. Hodgson has reprinted for the Accommodation of his Customers.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on Mr. Hodgson's Plan, wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing: Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice, (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has just bound up a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last sixteen Years, which he will dispose of; or any person wishing to see any particular Trial, may have an Inspection of the same, or take a Copy of it, at the usual Prices.</p>
