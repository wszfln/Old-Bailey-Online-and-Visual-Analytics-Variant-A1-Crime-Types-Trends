On the evening of 19th August I was on duty with three other officers in plain clothes in St. Pancras Road—the prisoners were there with another man not in custody—shortly after 7 o'clock they were walking together towards Kentish Town; we followed and lost them several times on the road for a few minutes, and the last time we saw them was in Alma Street, Kentish Town; they then all three came out together from No. 3, and shut the door behind them—we distributed ourselves, two at one end of the street and two at the other—I and 381 Y followed the prisoners as they left the house—I saw a struggle going on with the sergeant and Gossett; 154 Y was lying on the road; Penfold and the other man not in custody were gone—I assisted the sergeant and took hold of Gossett and took him to Kentish Town Police-station—I searched him and found seven common door keys in his right-hand coat pocket, 22 spoons, seven forks, and a gold pencil case, which the prosecutor afterwards identified as his property—I asked him how he accounted for being possessed of these things—he said "A man gave me them to carry. I don't know where they came from"—I was examined before the Magistrate the next day, and again on the Wednesday following—on the 1st September I sent a report down to Chertsey Police-station, in which Penfold's name was mentioned—next day I received a telegram and went to that police-station, and found Penfold detained there—I recognised him at once and told him he would be charged with a man in custody and one not in custody with burglary, on the 9th August, at No. 3, Alma Street—he said "It is all a mistake"—I have no doubt that he is one of the men I saw.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I live at 4, Blyth Terrace, Lambeth, and am the wife of Edward Flutant, who is a clockmaker—about 1 o'clock on the morning of Wednesday, 17th August, I was on Westminster Bridge, going towards Lambeth; no one was with me—I first saw the prisoner in uniform on the bridge with a woman, about at the third gas lamp; they were talking—I did not notice what the words were—they were a little drunk—I passed by them, and then afterwards when they stopped, I stopped also, and saw they were playing together; she was getting up on the parapet of the bridge—the soldier assisted her in getting up and over the other side, the side next the water—her feet were first on the parapet, and afterwards suspended over the water—the prisoner at that time was holding her by the hands at the top of the parapet—I don't believe he was holding her to prevent her falling—I did not see that he held her hands, but I saw that he held her like that (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—his hands were not round her waist, but when she was over the parapet he took hold of her arms, and then he let her drop, and she disappeared under the water—I was two or three yards away when I saw this—after he let her fall he did not look over the bridge, but walked away at once—he then had a stick, which I had not noticed before, in his hand—he did not exclaim or cry out at all—I followed him, and called out "Police"—he walked in the direction of Charing Cross—I saw a coffee-stall man there, and spoke to a woman who was passing at the time—I afterwards saw the prisoner taken into custody—some days after I saw the body of the woman—I had not known her before—they were on the right-hand side of the bridge going towards Lambeth.</p>

               <p>assisted her in putting her legs over on the other side of the parapet by taking hold of the back of her dress by her waist, and then he was obliged to let her go so that she could put her feet down—he continued to hold her by the back of her dress until her legs were on the other sideof the parapet—I did not see him have hold of her round the waist at any time—when she was over the parapet he held her by the hands, and she was suspended—I said before the Magistrate "He took her by the waist, she slipped through his arms, and then he held her by the hands"—I did not exactly see her slip through—I was standing so that they could both see me all this time—after I saw the woman drop I said to him "What have you done?" he did not answer.</p>

I saw the body of the deceased at the mortuary at Poplar on Sunday, 21st, about 11 a.m.—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I should take her age to be about 25 or 26; the features were very much destroyed by decomposition, but the lower part of the body was perfectly free from decomposition, except the abdomen—there were no marks of bruises about the body inflicted previous to death—there were no signs of marks on the arms as if they had been grasped—the cause of death was spasm of the glottis; sudden death, not from drowning, but from falling through the air from the bridge; that was a sufficient cause, especially in a person so diseased as she was—there were not the usual symptoms of death from drowning.</p>

I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—on 9th August, about a quarter to 9 p.m., Walters was brought in suffering from several incised wounds on his head, face, and right arm, and he had some scratches about his body—the wound on his forehead had fractured the skull and reached the brain, and some pieces of bone were detached, which I have got here—I found this small piece of steel in the wound; I have compared it with the notch in this hunting knife, and it corresponds—it is not the point—it was loose in the wound, not sticking in the bone—he</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was in the street finding a money-changer's, and found this one; the doors were not shut, and there was a light inside. I walked in and asked the prosecutor, who was behind the counter, to change a coin; he said, "Your infernal face raises suspicion in me, your intention in coming to the shop is something else." I said, "I beg your pardon, I will go out." He grasped my sleeve, and said, "I will call a policeman, and you must explain yourself before a Magistrate." I pushed him away, and he struck me a blow on the skull, and on the temple, and then, in a fit of passion, I struck him, but I never intended to kill him, only to extricate myself from his hands. I broke the point of the knife that very day, and with such a knife it is not right to charge me with murder.</p>

On the 19th August, a little before 6 o'clock, I was called to Camden Square, where I found the prisoner and two men holding him, and they charged him with stealing this lady's purse—afterwards the prosecutrix came up in a cab—she gave him in charge—on the way to the station the prisoner said there were two other men with him—I have the purse which he took from his right<lb/>hand trousers pocket—he produced that purse, which was identified sub<lb/>sequently by the prosecutrix.</p>

I am not an Englishman by birth—I came to London on the 27th June, I think—I have been in London before—I was never at Covent Garden before—I did not go out for a night's spree—the fact of the matter is I was late in getting in, and I was locked out if you wish to know—I was out seeing a few friends the same as you might do after the day's work—I had something to drink with my friends—I drank with two or three friends perhaps—I cannot tell you how much I had to drink with them.</p>

I am a licensed cabman, of 12, Kay Street, Queen's Park Estate—I took up the prosecutor at Bayswater and drove him to Covent Garden—I left the cab on the King Street side in charge of a man, and walked over with the prosecutor to the public-house on the opposite side—there were several people about—the prosecutor got in with several men and gave them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to spend—that was in Russell Street—the prosecutor said "You had better all have a glass together"—the prisoners and the prosecutor got into conversation, and then they got into the cab—they refused to serve us at the public-house—we drove to the Meat Market, we stayed some little time, and then went to a house in Shoe Lane—we then went towards Bayswater—the three men were in the cab all the way—I had the trap of the cab up all the time—something seemed to tell me that it was not quite straight, and I was looking through the trap—I saw a moving of hands—Anderson was sitting on the lap of Driscoll—they did not alter their positions—when we got to Bayswater, Anderson got out first, and made his way up Porchester Terrace—Driscoll got out next, and Thomson got out after them—Thomson spoke to me about the fare, and was feeling in his pocket, and said his purse was gone, and I said "Go on after them; they have got it"—I drove after them with the cab—I should say he caught Anderson in about a dozen yards—I was too far off to see anything that passed between Anderson and Thomson—I cannot say whether I have seen the prisoners before.</p>

The prosecutor engaged me between 2 and 3 o'clock, and I drove straight to Covent Garden—we drove to the Meat Market, and we got down at a coffee-house and had some refreshment, and after that we went to the Shoe Lane public-house—I got off the cab, and we stayed there quite half an hour—we then went home to Bayswater—I am sure the prosecutor was sitting on the right-hand side of the cab—I did not hear Anderson call a policeman—I saw the policeman come up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—I remember the prisoner coming to lodge at our house on 17th June with a man named Orton; the child came a week after—it was brought by a middle<lb/>aged woman; it was in a deplorable state, dirty and very thin—the prisoner went out during the day for five or six hours, leaving the child upstairs on the floor with the door locked; that happened nearly every day—I have heard the child cry so bitterly that I tried to climb the window to get in, but I could not, because there was no window-sill—we have tried the door with keys, but could not get in—I asked her to leave the door unlocked; she made the excuse that her home was so poor, but said she would; she did not—I was in her room two or three times; the child was on a piece of rag on the floor; it never slept with them—it had no clothes on but a little shirt tucked round its waist, and a petticoat thrown across it—I saw no food for it about the room—I Have asked the prisoner if there were any, and she always said either that she had just</p>

I am a clerk in the employ of Mr. Jakins, of 6, Camden Road, an agent of the Cheque Bank—on Friday, 22nd July, Smith came and asked if we wrote cheques—I asked her what cheques—she said "On the Cheque Bank"—I said "Yes"—she said she wanted three for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I asked her to whom she wanted them made payable—she said "All to the same person"—I said "If they are all to the same person you had better have one for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she said she would rather have the three—I said I preferred writing one, as they were all to the same person—she said "Well, then I will take one for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked her to fill in a slip with her name and address, and to whom she wanted it made payable—she wrote the name Trefusis; I forget the address—I gave her the cheque No. 210130—7—I had received information which made me take those precautions—I had received a different kind of ink the night before, and I wrote this cheque with it—she put it in a satchel, and went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been engaged in the study of handwriting for the last 35 years—I have looked at this cheque, No. 210420.4—the letter I saw bears my initials: my opinion is formed generally—I have seen the agreement—I compare the signature with the body of the cheque—it is difficult to say positively from just looking—I want the capital S and P.</p>

I have about five reasons—the writing in the body of the cheque is disguised—the writing in the letters is natural—Mr. Chabot has been examined against me about eight times in 20 years—we were both conscientiously positive in our views—I was against a late Lord Mayor in a libel case—the Jury were against me—that is not the only case when they were against me—I cannot always expect to win a case—I wanted to point attention to the capitals S and D—I form my opinion on certain capital letters and the way figures are joined—there is nothing more striking in it than in ordinary writing—I find certain forms of letters all occurring in one writing.</p>

I am a clerk employed by the Cheque Bank Com<lb/>pany, Limited, at 124, Cannon Street—I have been searching for cheques—the cheques 211126 with the numbers 2, 3, and 4, were issued to Mr. Horwood on 22nd July—I have looked for 074911 with the small Nos. 8, 9, and 10, and 210420-3, 211380-1—those cheques have not come in—from 22nd.

I am an interpreter, of 4, Castle Street, Haymarket—came from Tangier, and have been in England since 27th July—on friday, 29th July, I met a man, and we went to the Three Nuns, Aldgate—I parted with him and met him again next day—he took me to the came public-house—I saw the prisoner sitting in the bar—I was talking talian—he did not say anything to us, and we never spoke to him—nother man came in and we had some more drink—the prisoner met us the street in the evening, and said "Good evening; what business have out here, and what are you talking about?"—I said said "This gentleman</p>

               <p>has some French bank notes to change, do you know anything about them?"—he said "Yes"—he spoke in Italian—the man showed me one of the bank notes, and the prisoner took it and broke it in three pieces, and said "Very good"—I saw it was late and said "Good night, it is more than half-past 11"—the prisoner said "Well, we must say what we are going to do about this business"—I said "I don't know"—he said "Oh yes, we will meet to-morrow at 8 o'clock exactly"—so the next morning I was the first man in the place—the man who met me first came after me with his little bag; the prisoner then came and said "Good morning, the gentleman has not come yet"—I said "No"—at 8 o'clock the gentleman came who was supposed to have the bank notes—we went to a coffee-house, and when we were taking the coffee the man opened his bag and showed me a roll of paper which looked like money—he said "This is gold, feel it"—I felt it and said that it was money—he said "I will show it to you," and he took it out and untied one end of it and showed me a gold 50-franc piece—I said "It is a very good piece, any<lb/>thing like this I can change myself"—he said "No, I must have all the change, the bank notes and all"—he put it in his pocket again, and the prisoner and the other one told him he must not carry that heavy thing in his pocket again, and he must put it in the bag, and he did, so, locked it, put the key in his pocket, and said we must go, and he gave me the bag to carry—I said "Where are you going?"—it was raining—the prisoner said "We are going to the biggest French hotel in London, where there are several gentlemen who can change this money"—we went along from street to street till we got to one very big street, and there was one very narrow street—the man who met me first said "We must have breakfast, and can have it here"—he went into a small street to see whether the other door was open—as he was going outside the owner of the bag asked me to give him my confidence—I took the string of the bag and caught it in one of my buttons—that was my own bag that was under my clothes; I had 60 sovereigns in it—while I was undoing it the man came back with a knife to cut the string—I said "Don't cut it, I want the string to hang the bag on again"—I untied it and handed my own bag containing my money to the man who gave me the bag to carry—he put it in his pocket afterwards—the prisoner said "You had better go and put that bag in your room, because it does not look well to carry it on a Sunday, and we will wait for you at Bishopsgate Street Station"—I said "I do not know my way," and the prisoner called a cab, put me in it, and told the cabman to take me to the station—I went to the station—I did not know where to go—I thought I had better wait for them there, and I had been waiting three quarters of an hour, and after I saw no signs of them I said I had better go and keep the bag in my hands, and wait in the public-house—after waiting a long time I had a letter from a gentleman I had to go to, and I took it out and handed it to a policeman—I heard the money in the paper loose in the bag; it sounded like gold—I had no key to open the bag, so I capsized the bag in that way and shook it, and I saw a penny—I got frightened and shook it again, and saw 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. together—I then went to the police-station—they asked me how I knew there were coppers in it, and I said "There are supposed to be bank notes also; you had better look"—they opened the bag and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in coppers, one piece of gold, and some newspapers—one of the officers took me to see if I could find any of them—on 17th</p>

               <p>August I met the prisoner near London Bridge Railway Station—I said to him "How do you do?"—he answered "How do you do?"—I said "How is it that you never came for your bag, because I don't know what is in it, whether it is gold or silver?" and he said "Did not the others come for it?"—I said "I never saw one of you since that day"—I put my hand round him and said "I want my money; it is no gentleman's trick to play with a poor man like me"—his face changed like a dying man's—I said "If you don't give me my money quietly I will give you in charge"—he said "Yes, come in here"—I said "No, I want my money here"—he said "Here, come in this public-house"—I stopped, and we sat down just inside—I said "I have caught you now, and if you don't give me my money quietly I shall give you in charge, for—I have an order from the station to give you in charge when I caught one of you"—he asked me how much it was—I said "53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he put his hand in his pocket and handed me out 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I took with this hand, and half a sovereign—he put that back and said "I will give you that and French money"—I said "All right, give me that, "and he put his hand in his pocket and handed me some notes, and I said "No, they are no good"—I said to me "Come to the bank with me, I will change them for you"—I said "All right," and I put my arm round him again, and he said "Don't take me like that in the street," and I took him by the cuff—I had the money in the other hand, and he thought I was going to the bank, but I went to a policeman and gave him in charge.</p>

I said "No"—they said "We have come to take your husband in custody for fraudulent bankruptcy in Belgium; we have been looking for him for three days to try and find him, and you must give us money"—they said that they must have 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cover their expenses, as they had spent from 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. finding my husband, and the remainder was for them to go to Ant<lb/>werp to arrange matters—the little black one spoke (<hi rend="italic">Griffin</hi>), but the the other was close to him—I said, "I have no money;" they said "Yes, you have money," and the little one said "Which would you prefer, to give me the money or to have your husband locked up for 20 years?"—after that, thinking they were police-officers, I gave them three bilk of 100f. each and a small diamond pin value 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Griffin gave the pin to Littlefield, and said "Are you contented?" he looked at it without saying anything, shrugged his shoulders, and put it in his pocket-Griffin took the notes—I gave them wine and every sort of good thing there, and also gave them each a bottle of champagne to take away with them, and told them it would do them good on the boat going to Ant<lb/>werp during the night—when my husband came home I told him what had occurred—I was walking with him in August, saw Littlefield, and pointed him out to my husband, who fetched a constable, and on the ing Monday he was given in custody.</p>

Fretin's hotel at Antwerp before Christmas, and after I came to England I met him, and renewed my acquaintance with him at 14, Hipplepin Road, Tottenham—early in February I met Griffin, whom I had Known for five or six years—he is a portmanteau manu-facturer, of Jermyn Street—I mentioned M. Fretin to him, and said that he kept an hotel in Antwerp, and had since been bankrupt and left Antwerp in debt, and came to England, and resided at 14, Hipplepin Road, Tottenham, and was in the employ of the Great Eastern Railway—Griffin took an interest in what I said; he asked me for Fretin's address, and I gave it to him, and on the Tuesday or Wednesday afterwards he called at my office and said he wished to speak to me pri<lb/>vately—I said I could not speak to him privately then—he said "I should like some memoranda like these," meaning my bill—heads, "where do you get them printed?" and asked for one—my partner, Mr. "Wright, took it away from him, and was about to put it into his pocket—either that evening or the next I was going" with Mr. Wright to take an omnibus to Tottenham Court Road, and we met the prisoners—I had not seen Little-field before—we all four went to the Bedford Hotel, Tottenham Court Road, and had something to drink, and Griffin told us that he had been down to M. Fretin's house, and had a good supper and some cigars, some of which he brought away with him—Griffin afterwards came to the office and wanted me to go outside to see Littlefield, but I did not—he said he wanted me to make an arrangement to get them out of the scrape which they had got into, that they wanted me to say that I authorised them to go down to M. Fretin's to collect a debt, as that would be the better way of getting out of it—the same proposition was afterwards made in the presence of Littlefield's son, but I do not think it was ever made in Littlefield's presence—Griffin explained what the scrape was—he told me that Fretin gave them a pin and three bank notes, each value 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that they had supper and cigars, and he frightened the old man by telling him about his bankruptcy, in fact, what I had told Griffin; and that they represented to him they had come from tome tradesmen in Antwerp, and they wanted some money to pay their expenses—Fretin owed me no money, and never did; nor did I instruct them to go to him to collect a debt of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I always considered Griffin a highly respectable man—I have known Fretin since July, 1880, when I put up at his hotel—I never knew him passing by any other name there, but in London I believe he passed by the name of Fretin Hybrech, in consequence of his bank<lb/>ruptcy in Antwerp—I only know the name of one of his creditors, that is Mr. Vanderenden, of Brussels—Griffin was a perfect stranger to Fretin—I entered into Fretin's history because I thought it peculiar that he should have left Antwerp and come here to the Great Eastern Railway, and be engaged at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as a fireman—I mentioned it to Griffin in a casual manner—Griffin appeared to take an interest in such an extra<lb/>ordinary man, and asked his address, and if he had any money—I said that I believed that he had plenty of money—I did not say that he had obtained 2,000 cigars fraudulently, or that the amount of his</p>

               <p>liabilities was 60,000 francs—I told him that Vanderenden was one of his creditors—I know that there is such a person as Cropps, of Brussels, but I do not know whether he is one of the creditors—I have never said that Fretin was present, but the prisoners said that he was—I do not know Mersch, of Antwerp. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Wallington was here called into Court</hi>)—I do not know that gentleman—I can't say whether I have ever seen him in public—he was not present when the conversation took place about Fretin being a fraudulent bankrupt—I did not savin his presence, "There is an old thief named Fretin who has absconded from Antwerp, having con<lb/>tracted a large amount of fraudulent debts; he is now hiding from his creditors at the Hipplepin Road, Tottenham, under the assumed name of Hybrech, he owes me a large sum of money, and amongst others, a sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the price of some goods which he sold to me considerably under their value, but which goods had been stopped at Antwerp by the police authorities. I paid him for the goods, and they were never delivered, and he never returned me the money"—that is all a dream—I did not ask Griffin to go to Tottenham and collect the money for me, nor did he then ask me the names of his creditors, or write down at my dictation the names of Vanderenden and others—I did not offer him my pencil, nor did he write them down in ink—it was in February I first learnt that the prisoners had been down to Fretin's place—I thought it was a very wrong thing—I did not tell Fretin that I knew who the men were, because I did not see him—I knew where he lived, but I did not go there—I wrote and asked him to come and see me, and then I men<lb/>tioned it—that was at the latter end of July, because I had heard that there had been some tales about it—he left the country in April; I saw that in a telegram—on a Tuesday in February Fretin came to my house and told me mat two men had been to his house and robbed his wife during his absence—that was the day after it occurred, but I did not then know who had been down there—Griffin told me about a week afterwards, but I did not see Fretin again to tell him, and I did not trouble about it—I had had business with Fretin at Antwerp bargaining for goods, but I never bought any—I used to hire his warehouse to put my goods in—he had a large place at the back of his hotel, where I used to ware-house my baskets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Griffin told me that he had failed during the week, and was going to pay the composition of so much in the pound; and he was going to open a new shop, and then I told him about Fretin's bank<lb/>ruptcy—I did not know that the name of Hybrech was used in conjunc<lb/>tion with that of Fretin, or whether it is his wife's maiden name, but in France and Belgium the wife's maiden name if very often prefixed to the husband's.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember the prisoners coming to my father's house at Tottenham in February—they asked for Mr. Hybrech—I told them he was not at home, and called my mother—Griffin went into the front room—they afterwards went to the hack kitchen, and my mother went to them—my father was not at home—I was not in the room when the conversation took place—I saw my mother fetch three 100-frano notes and a pin, but did not see what she did with them—I saw the prisoners go, but did not see what they took with them—I did not go out on the steps with my mother and the prisoners—no cab was there—I say positively that my father was not at home when the prisoners left.</p>

I kept an hotel at Antwerp, where I made Moser's acquaintance—about Christmas last, being in money difficulties, I left my hotel, came to England, and went to live at Tottenham—I saw Moser on my arrival on 1st January—I was not at home when the prisoners came to my house, but my wife told me of it, and I went next day to the police-station and gave the description which she gave me—I never owed Moser a centime—my wife pointed out Littlefield to me in August, and I got his name and gave him into custody on the Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I surrendered to Mr. Greenham when I was told that there was a warrant out against me—that was on 20th or 22nd February—I came back from Antwerp on 2nd April—I did not know Littlefield's name till he signed it when he was taken into custody—I first heard Griffin's name at Edmonton Court—Moser never told me that he knew the names of the men who had defrauded me, or gave me any informa<lb/>tion on the subject—when Moser wrote to me I gave him a rendezvous to meet me in front of the station on 9th July, but he never came—it is probable that M. Yanderenden was one of my creditors, but I do not know; my head was turned—I came to England bankrupt on 31st December, 1880—I failed for from 5,000 to 6,000 francs, and I sent 10,000 francs by my son to pay everybody—I gave a bill on 10th January, which was payable on 1st April—it is, unluckily, Mr. Crapps who owes me money, but I never said so to Moser;. nor did I tell him that Mr. Yanderenden was a creditor of mine—Heckers, the banker of Antwerp, is not a creditor of mine, nor does he owe me money—Vermersh, a horse-dealer, who is dead, owed me 10,000 francs—I am quite sure I was not at home while the prisoners were there; I gave my lawyer a card showing where I was—I did not see a cab there, or give the cabman a cigar—I went to 207, Piccadilly—I did not ask to see the man who was doing the decorations—I said that I was looking for somebody with a lump on his neck like an egg—I had never seen the man I described, but I meant one of the men who had been to my house and got the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as my wife told me—I never said of the man I described "I know him very well, and shall know him again if I see him; I know him as being able to decorate hotels and restaurants."</p>

I sent my son to Antwerp in January with a sufficient sum to pay all my creditors—I paid them all I owed them, and my bankruptcy was annulled—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Moser—I did not go, and then I received this other letter, dated 9th July, at 8 p.m.—I did not write to Mr. Moser, I told the bearer that I would meet him at the rendezvous—it was a little while before my wife pointed Littlefield out in the street that I made the inquiries at the house in Piccadilly; my son had followed him there from a railway train.</p>

Fretin, and collect some money for him, and if Moser would do that it would settle the case—Littlefield was in custody then.</p>

               <p>came to his office and told him that two men had been to his tenant and broken in during his absence, and almost frightened his wife to death; and that two or three days after Littlefield came to Moser and told him a different tale altogether; and Fretin acknowledged to Moser that he was there when the men came down, and he saw them and not his wife, and that he gave the things to them—he also said that Fretin had been to him next morning and told him; and he asked me if I would go down and see Fretin, and I said "No, not without a note from him"—he wrote one on one of these memorandums and gave it to me, and I went down the following morning and saw Mrs. Fretin and her daughter—she gave me directions to go to the South Tottenham Station on the Midland fine—I came back and saw Moser between 12 and 1 o'clock, and told him I had been to Fretin's, and he was out, and would not be back till evening—he said "Will you go again and take this note?"—I said "Yes"—I went down again about 7.30 p.m., and saw M. Fretin, his wife, son, and daughter at dinner or supper—I handed the note to him; he opened it, read it, put it down by his side, and I took it up, and put it back in the envelope and returned it to my pocket—Fretin made an appointment with me to meet Moser at 7.30 next evening, Friday, at Liverpool Street Station—I went the next morning with Griffin to Moser's office, and told him the result of my interview with Fretin, and about the appointment at Liverpool Street—Moser said he should not go to meet Fretin there in case Eddington, the superintendent of police of the Great Eastern Railway, might be there, or some one employed by him, to hear what Moser had to say to Fretin; and he said "You go up to Liverpool Street and see who is with Fretin," and I went and told Griffiu what had passed between Moser and I—Griffin then said that he would accompany me to Liverpool Street to see if Fretin was there, according to his appointment—we went to Liverpool Street and saw M. Fretin and his son and another man outside, standing between Broad Street and Liverpool Street Stations—we went back and told Moser what we had seen—he said he was very glad he had not gone there—next morning I saw Moser again—he said if I could only get Fretin to his office to see him, he would guarantee that Fretin did not take further action in the matter, as he held him entirely in his power—he said "I can't explain it, or how or why, but it is suffi<lb/>cient for you to know that I have that power"—he opened a drawer and took out a foreign newspaper and said "This is a last resource; if Fretin will not come here to see me I will insert an advertisement in this paper, which will cause two men to come over from Belgium and arrest him at once"—he also said that Mr. Eddington, of the Great Eastern Railway, had passed Fretin's goods to England over the line in an assumed name, and that subsequently Fretin entered the employ of the Great Eastern Railway as a fireman in the name of Hybrech through Eddington—Moser mentioned an oak suite of furniture which he should have liked to have himself.</p>

I had won, and then I should receive 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and went to the Victoria Club with it; outside the club I met the commission agent; the prisoner introduced him to me as the commission agent, and I handed him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he went into the club with it—he said he was going in to draw the money—he returned, and said, in the prisoner's presence, that Steele, the bookmaker, was indisposed, and we should not be able to get our money that day—we parted, and I went home—next day I received a telegram; I have not got it, I think I done away with it—it paid he would take me 300 to 30 on Thora for the Thousand Guineas; that he had made use of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I had won, and made the bet with it—upon that I went to Newmarket to see the Thousand Guineas run—I there saw Lane and the commission agent—the agent said that it was a wonderfully good horse, and it could not possibly be beaten, and upon that I gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I saw the race—the horse did not win—soon after that I met the commission agent at another meeting; I invested some more money through him, and lost it—during the Derby week I met Lane and the commission agent again—they said they had a good thing coming off at Epsom, a good made-up race; the prisoner told me that in the other's presence—he said he was going to invest money in it that he had previously won, and borrow some more and put on this horse, and he asked me to get money and put on it, that it was sure to win—I got 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and put it on this horse—I lost it—soon after I met them again at Windsor—after the Hampton Races Lane called on me, on Sunday night, in town—he said that he had actually won me 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the Hampton meeting; I had not invested anything at that race, they had taken it on themselves—he said I should have to deposit 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the Victoria Club to realise the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I said "I shall not be able to get it to-morrow morning, but during the week I may be able to get it"—I spoke to Mrs. Hastings, the lady companion to Mrs. Chicheater, and I</p>

I had handed over to him—I said "No, certainly not; you know as well as I do that I have the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I borrowed to pay back to-day"—they would not listen to me—the commission agent made away to the ring; I begged him not to use my money—he afterwards came back, and said he had made use of all my money, and if the horse should win I should realise 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me the name of the horse—I waited to see the race—the horse did not win—I asked the agent first if he could lend me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay back that which I owed—I asked him afterwards if he would lend me 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he promised that he would—he did not—I went back to town—next morning I received a letter from him—I showed it to Mrs. Hastings—the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not in it—I had no further communication from him—I received a letter from the prisoner stating that he had seen the agent, and I would most likely get my money—I had asked the prisoner when we were coming from Newmarket, if he should see the commission agent, to write me a letter to show to Mrs. Hastings to atisfy her that she might get her money back—after that I heard no more about the money from either of them—shortly after I gave information to the police—I parted with my money because I had great confidence in him—he told me he had become acquainted with this commission agent—I thought it was perfectly true, and I had great confidence that the man he introduced to me was Bob Wyatt, and that he had got at the commission agent through him—I deposited the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because I quite thought I was going to realise the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thought I should get it back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Dane Hill Lodge, Uckfield, Sussex—in 1878 I knew the prisoner; he told me that he was a mortgage broker—prior to February, 1878, I had some bonds, which I had pledged with a loan office in order to make a payment which I had promised—I had a conversation with the prisoner as to getting them from the office—ultimately I paid the money to him, and he redeemed them and brought them to me—he asked what I was going to do with them; I said to take them home and take care of them—he said "I wish you would lend them to me; they would be of the greatest service to me; I have had a very heavy loss, and you will do me a great service if you will allow me to make use of them"—I said "Can I do so with safety to myself? I cannot afford to lose the money, nor can I give it to you"—he said "You know very well that I am worth a great deal more than 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I think you will be very badly used; I can make it better for you"—he said he wanted to be allowed to borrow money on them—he wrote me this letter, marked "A." (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "28, Budge Row, Cannon Street, February 6th, 1878. Dear Madam, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of the following bonds, left with me by you for the purpose of raising money on them, to invest on your behalf in such funds as I deem safe, and I hereby undertake to return the said bonds to you or your nominee at six months' notice; but it is to be understood that I am to be responsible to you for any loss, should it occur, except by depreciation of the said bonds." (<hi rend="italic">A list of the bonds was added, and then the words</hi>, "I have read the above and agree to it"—I wrote those words under his signature at his request, and after that I gave him the bonds, and he placed them in a safe at his office, where this con<lb/>versation took place—when I got home, on reading the letter again I was somewhat dissatisfied, and I wrote him a letter—I received this letter from him dated 10th February, 1878, but this has no reference to the case—I received this letter, marked "B," from him, dated 8th March, 1878. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Madam, I have sent to-day to Mr. Pilgrim about the security you left with me. I am perfectly willing to sign any document for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188109120075"/>
               <p>your protection, and put it in any legal form, and am willing to pay not less than 10 per cent., but I do not think it fair of yon to demand the securities back at once. I should incur considerable loss if I disturbed the arrange<lb/>ment made, and I feel sure you do not wish me to suffer. I must therefore request you to instruct Mr. Pilgrim to draw an agreement in accordance with my arrangement of 6th February.") This agreement of 14th March, 1878, was prepared by Mr. Pilgrim, my solicitor, on that day—I was with Mr. Pilgrim and the prisoner at the prisoner's office, and he and I there signed it (<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement to return the bonds on receiving six months' notice, and to pay interest for the accommodation</hi>)—directly after that agree<lb/>ment was signed Mr. Pilgrim advised me to give notice, and a written notice was given to the defendant, and he wrote this letter ("D") at the time (<hi rend="italic">This was an acknowledgment of receiving the notice</hi>)—we had a conver<lb/>sation about interest—I said I would not take more than five per cent., but 'I would take less—at this time I think he said he had borrowed rather more than 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my securities—we said we would not take his statement that he had borrowed rather more, we would have a definite sum named, and I said to Mr. Pilgrim "Gall it 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and reckon: that at five percent., "and he did on 14th March pay me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. interest, the same day as the agree-ment—I don't remember receiving any other payment of interest—I had some dividends paid me, which I received through his hands—I have received back the Atlantic and Great Western bonds, but only those—at that date I had no idea that he had sold some of the bonds—when the six months' notice was up it was arranged that he and his wife were to come down to Brighton and bring the bonds with him—he did not come, and next afternoon, Sunday, I went to see him—I told him I was very much astonished that he had not been down, and that I had not heard from him, and also that a sum of money which he ought to have paid in to my bankers had not been paid in—I think at first he said he had paid it in—afterwards he seemed to hesitate; he said he was not sure whether he had or not; that he had that same day to pay in a very large sum some—where else, and in paying that he might have omitted the smaller sum—I spoke to him about the bonds; he said they were all safe—he did not say where they were—I made repeated efforts to get them back, personally and by letter—he never said he had sold them—about 26th July, 1879, I received a notice in bankruptcy—I first ascertained that the bonds had been sold the day I went to the Mansion House to take out a warrant—I put the matter in Mr. Bradley, my solicitor's hands—Mr. Pilgrim had ceased to act as my solicitor from the time I had the notice in bankruptcy, because he was acting for the defendant—after 26th July I retained Mr. Bradley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had had the bonds at the Personal Advance Asso<lb/>ciation not quite three months—I paid 10 per cent, interest—the prisoner got them for me, and then he said if I would let him have them to raise money on it would be of great advantage to him—I was kindly disposed towards him, and thought I could do him a service in that way—I thought he would borrow money on them, and lend it out on mortgage—bills of Bale were never mentioned—he told me he was a mortgage broker, and he always had security for all advances he made on real property—in his letter he says, "I am to be responsible for any loss, should it occur, except by the depreciation of the bonds"—that was what I did not under<lb/>stand; that was why I objected to the agreement of 6th February, and</p>

               <p>also to another statement in it that he was to raise money on my behalf; that was the reason I wished another drawn up—I signed the agreement of 6th February as agreeing to it—I did not make any objection at that time because I had not read it—I wrote the words at his dictation—I had an idea of what it contained, because as he wrote it he told me what he wrote: he uttered the words—in that way I had become acquainted with the contents of the document—I made no objection, because I had not weighed and considered it; I understood it, as I thought—I think I found out my objection the next day, and I wrote to him—I think I wrote a letter previous to the one dated 10th February—I think I wrote the very next day—I wished Mr. Pilgrim to draw up a draft arrangement—I objected to the words that the money raised was to be invested on my behalf—it was not to be raised on my behalf, but on his own—by the new agreement of 14th March 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year was not settled as the interest I was to receive; it was never my intention to lend it to him for a year—7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to be paid to me on dates mentioned; that was only a temporary arrangement—I don't know how much I received since 14th March; I have not any of the papers—I handed them all to my solicitor—I have simply had back the coupons of some of the bonds—I think it was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 14th March—when I handed the papers to my solicitor I gave him an account of all I had received—I wrote to the prisoner from time to time for the dividends as they came due: the coupons—I received a cheque for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was dishonoured—I could not prove that the bonds had been sold until the day I applied at the Mansion House, I had a suspicion—I can't give the date of that suspicion; it was not so early as October '78 I think it was in the spring of '79—during November and December '79 I was in communication by letter with Mr. Anstruther and with his wife with regard to the repayment of these moneys—I think the lever you refer to relates to the repayment of the 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a promissory note which I had to pay to Mr. Palmer; that has nothing to do with this matter—between December '78 and June or July '79 I had been taking steps to recover payment—I put it into the hands of Mr. Pilgrim to recover my bonds after the expiration of the notice—as soon as I knew the prisoner had sold them wrongfully I went with Mr. Bradley to the Mansion House and asked for a warrant against him—I can't give the date—the case was adjourned; I was not present then—the case was said to be settled—I came to no agreement whatever until I was put in the box at the Mansion House—Alderman Lusk asked me if I was willing to withdraw the prosecution on the understanding that Mrs. Anstruther would make good all the moneys and securities due to me—I asked if I might be allowed to do so, and the Alderman told me that, taking all the facts into consideration, as Mrs. Anstruther was willing to make good the moneys and securities due to me, if I thought proper I could do so—upon that I did withdraw—I had not been present before that at an interview between the solicitors; I went to my solicitors in company with Mrs. Anstruther, but I was not present at any interview, because Mr. Bradley Dut me into another room with his wife—no sum was mentioned to me—the Alderman told me that deeds belonging to Mrs. Anstruther's separate use were lodged at Hoare's bank in the joint names of my solicitor and hers—Mr. Bradley asked me how much I thought they had to pay me, and I reckoned it up with him, and as near as I could make it it was about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I have not got any such account; Mr. Bradley made it up at his office—Mr. Bradley said they had agreed to pay his costs—I don t</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188109120077"/>
               <p>know how much that was—they never offered me a smaller sum—Mr. Anstruther came to thank me for withdrawing from the prosecution, and asked me to give him as long a time as I could for repayment; Mrs. Anstruther did not come to see me after the case was over—I have never seen her since, except in Court—nothing was said on those occa<lb/>sions about the amount—I brought an action against Mrs. Anstruther in in the Court of Chancery, because the three months had expired on which they had promised to pay the money, and they had not paid it, and they objected to pay, and Mr. Bradley told me that was the only course to make them—at the time the agreement was made no special sum was mentioned—as we went to the Mansion House that morning Mr. Bradley asked me what I thought my loss was, and I told him I thought about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but no sum was mentioned as regards the Anstruthers; they promised to pay in three months, and as they did not I brought the action in Chancery—I was examined as a witness in that action, and stated that Mr. Anstruther was indebted to me 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the date of the agreement—I believe Mrs. Anstruther'a deeds are still in the bank, in the joint names of my solicitor and hers, but I have no control over them—I have derived no benefit from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. After failing in both Courts I laid the facts before Alderman Lusk, and got another warrant for Mr. Anstruther's arrest—I had two objections to the letters of 6th February; the first was as to the money being invested on my behalf, and secondly as to being responsible for no loss except for depreciation; I did not understand that, and there<lb/>fore asked my solicitor to draw up another agreement—the arrangement about Mrs. Anstruther's deeds being deposited did not emanate from me, the overtures were made to me by Mrs. Anstruther and her son-in-law, Mr. Riley, a solicitor; they came down to our house in Sussex—that was after Mr. Anstruther was in custody on the warrant, but before I knew of it—this property was not my entire fortune—its recovery was a matter of importance to me—I told him in the first instance I could not afford to lose the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—the statements in the defence put in by Anstruther, with reference to the action, are all incorrect as far as accounts are concerned—when he was taken into custody in the first instance, Mrs. Anstruther and Mr. Riley, her son-in-law, and Miss Whitmore came to me—I would not allow an interview with my client, and I sent her into another room with my wife—Mrs. Anstruther's deeds were deposited prior to going before the Mansion House; I insisted upon that being done—all the facts were mentioned to Mr. Alderman Lust—I don't think he made invitation to Miss Whitmore to withdraw; he simply said "You have heard what has taken place"—I think Mr. Wontner made the statement before Mr. Alderman Lusk on that occasion, and then he called Miss Whitmore into the box—there was no dispute as far as I was concerned about how much money should be paid—800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount—they refused to carry it out altogether, relying on the statute of frauds, that there had been no proper deposit of deeds, nothing in writing—Mr. Justice Fry found in favour of the defendant upon that—he took the objection himself, that it being a public matter of fraud and felony he was bound to take notice of it, and he dismissed the action without costs—it then went before the Court of Appeal, and Mr. Justice Fry's decision was followed upon the same ground; the remark of one of the learned judges was that the parties were placed in their original positions—I then got a second warrant from Mr. Alderman Lusk.</p>

Rice's factory talking to Jones, a fellow workman, and Adolph came up and asked me to have a glass of ale with him at the top of Great Prescott Street—I said "Very well," and then he met Robenowitz, shook hands with him, and asked how he was getting on; and then he said to me "Here is my friend Robenowitz, who will make business with you"—Robenowitz asked Adolph for some money and then called for some drink, and said to me "I shall see you outside the factory at 7 o'clock on Monday night"—nothing had been said about the factory—Robenowitz asked me to come home with him and I did so, and he said "Will you have some dinner? I know young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> can eat dinners; young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> can eat a good deal; have a bit of dinner"—I had some, and he went out and came back with Kolatski, and said "Now then, if you want to make business with me, we are private, nobody can hear us; have you got anything?"—I said "I don't properly understand you; what do you mean?"—he 'said "Well, I buy anything in the fur way, but nothing in the cloth way; you need not be frightened, if you fetch the skins to me they will be cut up in half an hour and made into caps the next morning and lined, and it would puzzle anybody to know their own skins; have you got anything at home?"—I said "I have only a few rubbish skins, which have come from the factory, and are not much good"—he said "Anything will do so long as it has got hair on it and it is dyed dark brown. Here is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advance if you want it"—I said that I did not want it—he said "Well you fetch me the skins, and you can have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a minute, me and Kolatski will come for those skins and bring a bag"—he asked his wife for some money, which she gave him—he put it in his pocket and came out with me, and we took a cab to my house, but got out at the Elephant and Castle on the way, and then walked to 32, Ash Street, New Kent Road, where my uncle lives—he was not in—I waited there some time with Robenowitz and Kolatski, and then we returned to Whitechapel Road—Robenowitz said "I will see you on Monday night; you fetch the skins down to me"—I said "I can't get skins without <hi rend="italic">nicking of</hi> them"—Robenowitz said "Well, <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> them, that is just what I mean, and meet me on Monday night or come to my house"—we had several "drinks" with them, and I spent the remainder of the afternoon with them and left them in the Commercial Road—that was August 20th, and on Monday morning, August 22nd, I told the governor about it the</p>

Joseph Ollander at his house, and asked him whether Adolph was in—he said "He is out in the City, he has not come home yet"—I went in and he sent out for some drink—Jones was with, me all the evening—Joseph said "You see we are not very busy in our line, we just barely get enough for a living"—it is a skindresser's. shop—we stopped till Adolph came in, and I said I came round to see Robenowitz about the skins—Joseph said "Don't take the skins round to Robenowitz, he will want them on trust, we will pay you ready money for them"—I said "Very well, but I want to see him very particular"—he said "Never mind about him"—we all went out to a public-house at the corner of Greenfield Street, and Adolph said "You go inside, Joseph, and pay for the drink for these chaps, and I will stand outsider"—Joseph, and I and Jones went in, and when we came out Jones was talking to Adolph some time, and I and Joseph walked up and down the street, and he said "You can get me skins; Samuel wants them on trust; fetch them down, here is your money; I am always prepared"—I said "I can't get the skins without nicking of them"—he said "Well, that is what I want you to do, <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> them; don't take too much put of the factory at one time; one. or two skins every night; we are not frightened, as soon as you get them out of your hands we are all right"—I said "Very well, then meet me on Tower Hill on Thursday night at 7.30"—we left them, and after they got out of sight I called at Robenowitz's house and saw his wife, but he was not at home—I went home, and next day told my governor all about it, and in consequence of a conversation with him I went on Tuesday evening with Jones to Greenfield Street and met Kolatski at the corner by the public-house—he said "Well, have you got any skins?"—I said "No, I have not; I can't get them without <hi rend="italic">nicking</hi> them"—he said "Well, of course, <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> them, that is what we mean"—I said "I want to see Samuel Robenowitz"—he said "I will take you round to Myrtle Street"—No. 29 I believe it was—he took me there, knocked at the door, Robenowitz came down and showed us up to his workshop—we after<lb/>wards went to a public-house, and Robenowitz paid for some drink, and said "Have you got anything?"—I said "You know I can't get anything without <hi rend="italic">nicking</hi> them"—he said "Of course, <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> them then"—Jones was there all the time—Kolatski was there—I told them I should meet them on Thursday night—on Wednes<lb/>day morning I spoke to my master again, and on Thursday the 25th I left the factory at 7 o'clock with Jones, and went to Tower Hill, when Joseph Ollander was waiting with a sack under his arm—he said "Well, have you got the skins, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>?"—I said "No, but I have got them, all ready to fetch out of the factory, but I could not get them out, there were so many upstairs, and I took them down to Jones, and gave them to him"—I then said to Jones "Why did not you fetch them out?"—Jones said "You know very well I could not fetch them out when there were three men working late"—Joseph said "Well then, fetch them out to<lb/>morrow night"—we went to a public-house, and Joseph paid for some drink, and said "Will you fetch the skins by to-morrow night, and I shall be here all ready prepared for it?"—he showed me a purse of gold, and said "At 7.30 to-morrow night see me"—he also said "How many hands have you got at work at the factory?"—I said "Over 50 or</p>

I want to see him first"—he said "Very well then, I shall take you round to Robenowitz"—he took me to Robenowitz at his workshop, who said "Well, have you got the skins?"—I repeated what I had said before, and so did Jones—Robenowitz said "Well, then, can you fetch them to-morrow night?"—Kolatski said "You can leave your mate with the parcel in any coffee-shop, and come round to our workshop and fetch us round to the coffee-shop, and we will make business there"—I said "Yes"—Robenowitz said "You can have any amount of money as long as you have got the goods for it"—we all four went out with Goldsteen, who keeps the house, and went to a public-house, where Kolatski treated us, and said that he was all ready prepared, and he said "Well, do you want any money?"—I said "Well, I could do with some"—he said "How much do you want?"—I said "Half a sovereign"—he said "I can't trust you with half a sovereign," and gave me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave it to Mr. Rice next morning with the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I received from Joseph—I then went to the Thames Police-court—I afterwards received a parcel from my master with certain instructions, and went with it with Jones to Tower Hill according to the appointment, and met Joseph Ollander, who said "Have you got them?"—I said "Yes, I have got the parcel, there are the skins in it"—he said "Come in and have a drop of ale"—I sat down in the public-house, and he said "You see seals are Very cheap now; how much do you want for them?"—I said "Well, say what you like, say what you give for them"—he said "Well, I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them"—he had not opened the paper, but he felt them, and said "They are nice and soft"—I said •' That won't do, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not enough, give us 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—he said "All right then, I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—we came out, and he took us round by Tower Hill, and said "Now then, here is the money," and took the parcel—I counted it, and there was only 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said "Hold on, you are not off yet"—he said "Well, there may be a few shillings short; I will give you that to-morrow at dinner time, good night"—we followed him some distance, and saw him in custody.</p>

Helsby said "No"—he said "I am ready with pay for everything," and pulled out a purse, opened it, put two fingers in, and I saw some gold in it—he said "Here is the money," but he did not offer me any—we then went to the workshop, 27, Myrtle Street; Robenowitz opened the door, and we all went upstairs with the man who keeps the house—we all five then went to Webb's public-house in Whitechapel Road—Robenowitz spoke to Helsby going along, but I could not hear what was said—Kolatski paid for some drink, and Robenowitz said, "Do not take too many skins out of one lot, because you do not know but they might have suspicion on you; take one or two out of each lot"—he asked me how many men were employed in the factory—I said "70 or 80"—he said, "Whatever you do be careful, and as soon as you get the skins out of the factory they are all right"—Kolatski could hear that, and he said, "You don't want to get drunk so that they shall not have suspicion on you at the shop; as soon as you get your money for the skins put it into a bank, and you can have a book or a piece of paper, which you like; you can leave the book at the bank if</p>

On 25th August, in consequence of information, I kept observation on Tower Hill, and saw Joseph Ollander there about 7.30 with a sack rolled up under his arm—Helsby and Jones met him, and I heard Joseph say "Have you got them?"—I walked away to keep out of observation, and then followed them to the Fountain public-house, Minories—I went into one compartment while they went into another—I remained about half an hour—they then went to the Nag's Head, Tower Hill, shook hands, and Helsby and Jones went through the Minories towards High Street, Whitechapel, and Joseph went away by himself—I followed Helsby and Jones to Greenfield Street—they met Kolatski outside the Duke of Clarence public-house, and went up Greenfield Street into the Bricklayers' Arms public-house; came out and went into Myrtle Street—they remained there about an hour and a half—Jones, Helsby, Kolatski, and Robenowitz, and the man who keeps the house came out, and they went down to the Bricklayers' Arms—when they left the Bricklayers' Arms they wont into the Com<lb/>mercial Road, up High Street, Whitechapel, where they seemed to call Helsby and Jones up into a quiet yard—I went up shortly afterwards and saw them talking together, and Kolatski handed something to Helsby and said "Keep it quiet"—they shook hands and I walked away—Kolatski, Robenowitz, and the other person went towards their home, and Joseph and Helsby towards the City—on Friday, 26th August, I was with Inspector Abberline, and after the men were apprehended Adolph muttered something partly in English and partly in German, saying to a woman "Go and take the parcel out of the house," and she went away directly—I took Kolatski on the 27th—he said in answer to the charge "I am innocent; I don't know Helsby."</p>

I am an inspector of the Criminal Investiga<lb/>tion Department—in consequence of information I instructed White, and on Friday, 26th August, at 8.30, I arrested the two Ollanders at the corner of Charles Street and Greenfield Street—Helsby and Jones were close by—I said to them "Are these the two men?"—they said "Yes"—I said "We are police officers; I shall take you in custody for inciting these men to steal"—they made no reply—I said to Helsby and Jones "Which man did you give the parcel to"—they both pointed to Joseph—he said "The young men said that they wanted to go to America, and they had some skins to sell, and I bought them; I have since thrown them away"—I said "Where"—he said "I don't know"—I detained them in the workshop while White and another officer searched; they were then taken to the station, and the warrants read to them—they said nothing—about 10 o'clock the same night I saw Robenowitz in the Whitechapel Road—I said "I am a police officer; I shall take you in custody for inciting a man to steal"—he said "I don't know anything about it"—I searched him, and he laid some pieces of paper on a desk—I went on searching him, and he caught up the papers and tore them up—I got them away from him as quick as I could, and pasted them together—they bore the address "32, Ash Street, New Kent Road"—that is the uncle's address—I found the same address on another piece of paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lawn Cottage, Nightingale Lane, Wanstead, and am a porter in the employment of the Great Eastern Railway Company at Snaresbrook Station—on the afternoon of 19th August, between three and four o'clock, I was travelling in a railway train to Snaresbrook—there is a tunnel about two hundred or three hundred yards from the station—when we passed through the tunnel I was standing at the carriage window, and I saw Gilbert and Collier lying on the bank with their faces downwards—at that time I did not see Maskell—I proceeded in the train to Snaresbrook Station; the train stopped there; I got out, made a communication to the station-master, and went back to the tunnel on the line, and I saw the three prisoners on the top of the bank, just against the hedge against the mouth of the tunnel against the up rail—I examined the up line and found five pieces of wood, called keys, and two stones inside the mouth of the tunnel on the up rail—the prisoners were about 150 yards off, walking—as soon as they saw me they ran away—a train was due on the up line in about ten minutes—I picked up the pieces of wood and ran after the prisoners—I saw Maskell and. Gilbert caught about a quarter of a mile off—Jarvis, another porter, was with me—I took them to the station and charged them—they said they were blackberrying on the line.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Constable M</hi> 81). On Sunday morning, 10th July, at 1 o'clock I was on duty in Church Street, Bermondsey—a woman came and made a complaint to me, in consequence of which I went down Artillery Court—as soon as I got to the mouth of the court I heard cries of "Murder "and "Police," and when I got some way down I saw the male prisoner stripped, with his jacket and waistcoat off, and his shirt sleeves turned up—he was using most fearful language—I requested him to go away several times—he said "Go and f—yourself"—he struck me a violent blow on the head with his first and knocked me down and then kicked me several times in the side—I got up and went and caught hold of him—we struggled and went down together on the ground, and the woman came up and kicked me several times in the side—I was not able to do anything after that, but I kept hold of the man until the other constables came up—both the prisoners were the worse for drink—I was not able to get up, and was assisted to the station—the struggle com<lb/>menced outside the house—the female prisoner and some other women drew me into the house—after the man had kicked me, and before the woman did so, I felt my injuries—I saw the prisoner at the station; I did not notice his boots—I sat down for a little while, and then I went on duty again, and remained on duty all that night, up to 6 o'clock in the morning—I went to bed then, and remained in bed all day Monday—on Tuesday I went to Guy's Hospital, and was treated for the injuries; they were on the ribs and across the stomach—I was under the doctor's care over nine weeks, and am still, and am still suffering from the effects of these injuries.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, and live at 37, Pauline Street, Ber<lb/>mondsey—on Sunday morning, 10th July, I was passing by Artillery Court, and heard cries of "Police "and "Murder"—I went into the court and saw the prisoner knocking a woman about, and a police constable</p>

               <p>took hold of him by the throat to take him out of the house, and then the prisoner hit the policeman on the head with his hand and knocked him down, and there was a struggle in the road between them—besides hitting him on the head they kicked him in the ribs—the male prisoner had on his shirt with the sleeves turned up, and trousers and boots—I could not see what sort of boots they were—I saw Police-constable 138 come up—he took his belt off and put it round the prisoner's neck and dragged him out of the house—I did not see anything until after I heard the cries of "Police "and "Murder."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Windmill Tavern, Limehouse—on Wednesday night, 3rd August, about 9.30, I was coming down Rotherhithe Street—I went into a fish shop; I had been there about two or three minutes when King came in—he said nothing to me—I had some fish and walked out—I said to the fish shop man "I will have a glass of ale"—King said "Well, I can drink one"—I said "Very well, you can have one if you like," and he went with me into the Wheatsheaf, which was five or six doors off—I called for a pint of ale—McCarthy came in and stood a bit back from the counter—I took out some money and paid for the ale, and sat down in front of the bar—King took a glass, poured out the ale into it, and handed it to me—I drank about half a glass, and found myself getting stupefied—King drank out of the same pot, but not much; he just sipped it, and McCarthy also just sipped it—I took some gold out of my left-hand pocket to pay for the ale, but I found that was not my money, so I put it back, and took the money from the other pocket and paid for it out of that—I had a half-mourning ring in my pocket—I might have taken that out with my money—I then left the house; the prisoners followed me—I went down the Horns Stairs, Rotherhithe, which was about 200 yards off, to take a boat to cross the water—I saw the waterman, and he went down to the shore to get the boat ready—while he was gone the prisoner followed me down the stairs; when I got</p>

"I was with Brook<lb/>bank on Bank Holiday night between 12 and 1 o'clock when Brookbank led a young man from the Roebuck, White Hart Street. While leading him along he put his leg before him and threw him down and fell atop of him, and getting up ran away, saying he was going to fetch a cab, and never returned. Brookbank gave me the watch and chain on the Tuesday morning to pawn, telling me to bring the money to his place." <hi rend="italic">Parker says</hi>: "No, sir, Nash tells me last week when we was in the cells I was telling the gentleman all about it. I said 'How did you get it?' Hes aid 'Me and Poodle were going over to the Roebuck, and we see this gentle<lb/>man outside drunk. Brookbank laid hold of him and pulled him round by White Hart Street. Brookbank chucked the gentleman over on his face, took his watch away, and halloaed out he was going to fetch a cab.' He said he ran across the road and picked the gentlemen up, and he tried to save himself, and tore Nash's coat right down the back. That is all he told me in the cell. He met me at Vauxhall Cross and said, 'Go and pawn this watch for me, will you.' I said 'Whose is it?' He said 'A young man's. I am going to pawn it for him because the young man is hard up.' I said 'All right,' just like that, so he said 'If they ask you your name, say you live at 115, Tyre Street; if they ask you where you bought it, say you bought it off a young chap living at No. 10, Jonathan Street.' He said 'It is broke, say you broke it about larking yesterday, because they might not take it in; say it is your own;' so I took it in." Brookbank says: "I meets Nash about half-past seven on Monday night at the corner of Paul Street, and had some beer. I know nothing about this."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Gibbons Rents, Bermondsey, and shall be 12 years old next February—on 1st September, about 9 p.m. I saw the prisoner at the corner of Magdalen Street; I did not know him before—he said "Will you get me half an ounce of tobacco and a long pipe over the way;" that was the Anti-Gallican beershop—he gave me a florin—I offered it, the barman kept it, and sent for a policeman.—I went with the policeman to where I had left the prisoner, but could not find him—I walked about looking for him, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards</p>

               <p>saw him in Tooley Street, and the policeman took him—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Anti-Gallican—on 1st September about 8 p.m., I served Harris with half an ounce of tobacco and a long pipe; he gave me a florin; I put it in the till with some smaller money, and gave him the change—there was some smaller money there, and two half-crowns, but no florins-about half an hour afterwards Leary came in for half an ounce of tobacco and a long; pipe, and tendered a bad florin—I sent for Halliman, and gave it to him—I then examined the other florin; it was rather light, but I was busy—when I saw it was bad I handed it to Mr. Salter—I am sure it is the one Harris gave me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 142). On 1st September, about 9.45, I was called to the Anti Gallican-Leary made a statement to me, and I went out with him, and he pointed out the prisoner in Tooley Street—I asked him if he had any counterfeit coin in his possession; he said "No"—I told him to let me search him; he had his right hand in his trousers pocket, and kept shuffling about—I told him to take it out, but he did not—I took it out, and found four shillings and six sixpences in his hand—I then put my hand into the same pocket, and found a hole in it; I shook his trousers, and this bad florin fell down his leg to the ground; he said that it did not belong to him—I took him to the station, and found this cigar on him—he was placed with three others, and Halliman picked him out the moment he came in—I received this florin from Pigeon, this other from Salter, and this other from Dane.</p>
