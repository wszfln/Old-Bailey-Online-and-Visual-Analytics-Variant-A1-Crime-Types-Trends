            . What are you - A. I am a shoemaker, the prisoner worked for me; I had some conversation with her about some things she had taken out of pawn on the 27th of July, she said she had taken nothing out of pawn on that day, only a child's gown for six pence; I was informed she had taken three articles out of pawn; I asked her if she had any money from Tom, the man she lives with, she said no, he would give her no money, if it was to save her life; I told her that I suspected that she had taken Mrs. Short's things away; she had only one shilling and sixpence of me on that day.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent of what I am blamed as the infant within me; when I went to Mr. Steele, I carried him four pair of shoes: his woman that he lives with, sells coals; I asked her for some; I crossed over the way to a butcher to buy a sheep's head; I ask'd the woman if she would let me go into the yard; when I came out of her yard I went into the cellar, I took up the bag of coals, and went home; the prosecutrix sent a girl to watch me home; I had not been home long before the mother and she came; she said if I would give the tickets up, she would forgive me; she said I was afraid to let her look in my box; I told her she was welcome; she looked in my box and in my bedstead, she could not find them; she said I do not think it is you, it must be somebody else, because the door was fastened curiously with a nail; she said a woman saw me come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140004"/>out; I went to the woman; the woman said it was not me, it was a lustier woman than I am; my husband brought me home a pound note from the West India docks; I went to Mr. Lamport immediately and took out the articles while I had the money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any other person near him in the street - A. He did not see any body about the street at the time. The prisoner took him into a public house and told him he must treat him or else he would not let him go; he found himself in a difficult situation; he asked the publican if he could not sleep there, he would pay him any money; the prisoner was by at the time; the publican said he had not a place for him; the prisoner said, never mind, I will bring you home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call for any liquor or drink any thing - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140005"/>Yes, they had two or three glasses of liquor, and the prosecutor paid for them; the prisoner called for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the witness drink any - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened next - A. He went out, and the prisoner had hold of his arm; as soon as he got out in the street he met with another man, and he laid hold of his left arm.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he seen that other man before - A. No; every now and then they both put their hands in his pockets; he tried to keep them off with his elbows: that was till he came to our door, it is only about an hundred yards off; when he came to my door, the prisoner told him it was not his lodgings: the prosecutor replied here is the number, pointing up to the number; then the prisoner said now I shall take you away to a prison; upon that the prisoner and the other man held his hands; he was with his back against the door, he knocked with his elbow against the door; there was a woman stood a little before these men, and a fiddler came and played the fiddle, when they made the noise; upon that he says, I opened the window; the prisoner had then his hand in his pocket, and when I opened the window, the prisoner said to the other man let him alone now, and then they both went away and left him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman and the fiddler - A. They all went one way; the witness put his hand in his pocket, as soon as the prisoner left him, and found all his money was gone; I came down and opened the door; he exclaimed to me, all my money is gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What pocket was the money in - A. His breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When had he last felt that money that he had in his pocket, before that time - A. He had his hand in his pocket, and felt it after he came out of the public house; it was loose in his pocket; he is sure he felt it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of money was it - A. Five guineas, two seven shilling pieces, one West India joe, and his protection box.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he see the other man before he went into the public house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell the landlord of the public house of that man who brought him there against his will, and that he wished to get rid of that man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he not to tell the publican that that man brought him in against his will, and that he did not choose to treat him - A. He says he was afraid, because the man told him he was a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see any thing of the fiddler or the woman before the man first laid hold of him and took him into the public house - A. They came up at the time he was at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. Now was there any body in the public house at the time he was there with the prisoner besides them and the landlord - A. He saw two or three women, but they were all ready for starting out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Had any of these women any of the liquor that he paid for - A. No, not as he knows of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into the public house after that he lost his money - A. He did; I went with him.</p>

In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner; I found him on Thursday morning between six and seven o'clock at No. 5 in a court, George street, Spital fields; he was in bed, in a one pair of stairs room with two girls of the town; I told him what I apprehended him for, and took him to the office and searched him; I found two guineas in gold, and a seven shilling piece; he said it was his own. I returned him the seven shilling piece; the two guineas I have now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday night I saw this man, he was in liquor, he catched hold of me and said will you have something to drink; I went with him into that gentleman's public house; we had some peppermint; he went out of the house, and I saw no more of him till the Thursday morning I was taken out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Griffiths. The prosecutor did not know the two guineas - A. No he did not.</p>

On the 2nd of August in the evening, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner looking at some lace pinned on some calico inside of the door; I saw her unpin it; she stood outside of the door, reached her hand in and unpinned the lace; it dropped inside of the door; she picked it up and put it in her pocket and walked along the street with it; I stopped her and asked her what she had got in her apron; she said she had nothing. I opened her apron and saw the lace.</p>

I left her a little before twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner Giles or Smith - A. No; it was on the ground floor. I waited at the house when I came out for a watchman; none came by. About two o'clock on Sunday morning I heard the three prisoners now at the bar coming from Lefevre's room; they came out of the house together and I laid hold of Lefevre, she had robbed me of my watch; I charged her with the robbery; Smith took hold of me by the right side of my collar; I had Smith in my left hand, Giles was endeavouring to pull Lefevre away; Smith said, you b - r, let the woman go, it is my wife, meaning Lefevre was his wife; I told him I did not care whose wife it was, she had robbed me, and I was, determined to bring her to account for it. Smith made an assault upon my person, he laid hold of my coat, tore it, and put me in bodily fear. Giles said, bl - t his eyes, take his bloody handkerchief off his neck; Smith then directly untied my silk handkerchief and took it from my person; I cannot say what he did with it. In the scuffle I was knocked down, I believe by Smith; they left me on the ground covered all over with blood and went towards Osborne street; I saw no more of them that time. I am sure of their persons, I have seen them before at different times; this happened on Sunday July the 31st, and the women were apprehended on Monday. I saw Smith again the next morning we were both going to work; I saw him on the following days; he was apprehended on the Thursday; then he went out of the warehouse by a prohibited way; when he saw the constable was coming to take him into custody he resisted; he was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT You say you saw the prisoner Smith in Whitechapel on the following Monday - A. I beg your lordship's pardon; I saw him in Whitechapel on the Tuesday, about ten minutes past seven in the morning; we were both going towards the West India dock; we walked about one hundred yards together. On Wednesday I saw him going towards the dock; one of our foremen was in company with him; I asked him if he knew that man, he said he did, he told me his name was Smith.</p>

I really think Smith is innocent of meddling with him or taking the handkerchief from his neck; so is

               <p>Q. Was any body in the house when you went out - A. Nobody; I shut the door after me and locked it, with the key on the outside; it is only a common lock. I am sure I locked it. I come back about half past five, I could not have been absent longer than ten minutes; then I took the outside shutter down; I had taken the pins out when I went out: when I had taken the shutter down I had put the key in the lock; I could not unlock it; I thought I had strained the lock. I took the latch in my hand, I found the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you went out pulling your door to and locking your door - A. I always take the key with me. I recollect putting the key in to unlock the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the key in the door when you went out - are you sure of that - A. To the best of my recollection I did; I do not recollect that ever I forgot it. We are all frail creatures.</p>
               <p>Q. To the best of your recollection you did lock it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lifted up the latch, and then the door opened - A. Yes, and immediately the young man at the bar come down stairs before I got into the house; I had hardly entered the door when he came down with a pistol in his hand; I think it was in his right hand; but he did not offer to do me any mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you - A. Not a syllable; he rushed by me instantly, and immediately went into the street; directly after he passed another came down, he passed into the street the same way; I attempted to lay hold of him, I slipped my hand and fell down; I did not fall, properly; I recovered my fall, I got up again and made an alarm and cried stop thief; the man that went out last made a blow at me, it just touched the fore part of my face, it did not hurt me, and then he ran away immediately; I pursued after him about a dozen yards, not more, I was not capable of going far; then I made an alarm, a neighbour pursued him; I returned into my own house, I went up stairs into my chamber, I found all the things taken out of the drawers and throwed on the floor, and the plate was put on the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had all these things been in the drawers when you left the house - A. Yes; the drawers were not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you find on the floor - A. Sheets and shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. None of them are mentioned in the indictment - did you find any of the things in the indictment on the floor - A. The bag with the silver things in it was put on the drawers in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What silver things were they - A. Two silver pepper casters, two silver salts, seven silver tea spoons, two table spoons, a punch ladle, a stone stock buckle, two milk pots, all silver; there was one milk pot in the chamber, the other was in common use below stairs, it had been removed from one table to another; all the others were in a bag in the drawers, where they had been many years. The seven tea spoons remained in the box on the table not taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see or hear any thing of the prisoner - A. I suppose it night be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; some children informed me he was at the watchhouse; I went in the watchhouse and found him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you undertake to say that it was the same man that rushed by you - A. I have no doubt of the man; I wish I had.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the first man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what coloured coat he had on - A. Something of a darkish coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the colour of the other man's coat - A. It appeared to me it was a dark coat; I was told it was a green coat; I did not observe myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him before - A No; he is quite a young man; I hope he will not do so any more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. At the time you left your house you had no suspicion about the door being locked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you had never taken any precaution about locking the door - A. No, I did not: it is a common thing for me to lock the door; it is possible. I might not have locked it: possibly I might be deceived about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to the person of the prisoner, when you returned you saw a person running down stairs, which you believe to be the prisoner at the bar - A. I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only a moment to observe him - A. A very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. It was merely a person coming down and rushing out - A. He walked slowly across the room; when I first saw him I was about as far from him, as from him to me in the court now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man a hat on - A. Yes; a round hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140009"/>Q. Does any body live in the house besides yourself - A. Nobody.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the day when there was an alarm at his house - A. Yes; it was on the 22nd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Mann go out - A. No: I did not; I came out of my own house to open the window shutters, between five and six o'clock in the morning. I saw a man go very hastily into Mr. Mann's house dressed in green clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or a dark green - A. Between a light and a dark green; I cannot say exactly; I only saw one man; the door was open. I saw him run in; I saw nobody near; I saw Mr. Mann about ten minutes after go to his window and take out the bolts; immediately he went up the court he put his hand up to the window and took out the window pin; I saw him put his left hand into his right hand pocket, as I thought, to take out a key to open his door; he then went in doors; he had not been in above a moment before I heard Mr. Mann say what do you want here, you villians, you have come to rob me; two men instantly rushed out of the house; in the scuffle Mr. Mann slipped down; Mr. Mann recovered himself again, he called out stop thief, and when he called out stop thief I saw the man in the green coat turn round and strike him in the face; that is the man that came out last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You say it was about ten minutes from the man in the green coat going into the house and Mr. Mann returning - you did not keep your eye all the time upon the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore in the mean time the second man might have got into the house - A. He might.</p>

They were in the garret, in the room that I used to sleep in; they where locked up in my box; I did not lodge there at that time, but my box remained there; Mr. Hall knew my box was there; I had left it there before, when I went out to service.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of leaving your box in the lodgings - A. Yes; I never lost any thing before; Mr. Hall made no objection to my box being there. He knew that I left my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lodge in the same room with you - A. Yes; there was three lodgers besides me; the prisoner was one of them.</p>

            . Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner - A. Yes; on Thursday the 8th of this month, at No 19, Well street, Mile End New Town, at Mr. Hall's; I searched him, he had nothing upon him but a watch. On the Friday the prisoner told me that he had hid the property.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation had you with him that led to that - A. I heard a word drop, that the prisoner acknowledged that he had done the robbery; I went to him and ask'd him what he had done with the twelve pounds; he said part of it was hid, and if I went to Mr. Hall's garden, at the bottom of that garden, close against the privy door, the left side going in, he had burried it there, just by the passage; I went there immediately along with Miller, my fellow officer. I dug up about six or seven inches in the ground, and there turned up the box exactly in the place he discribed; the tin box was tied round with string; I opened the box, I found it contained three one pound notes, one guinea and four shillings in silver; the prisoner said he gave two pounds fifteen shillings for the watch, out of that money; I told him that together with the money found made seven pounds. I asked him how he counted for the other five pounds odd; he said he had spent it. I told him I must keep the watch, as it was bought with that money, which I did. When he was asked for his defence before the magistrate he said he had robbed the young man. I produce the box with the money in it.</p>

I told her I thought she had some more spoons. I took her into custody and sent for an officer; the officer examined her, and found nothing upon her of any value.

            . I am steward's boy to lord Wellesley; I had the care of the spoons. On Sunday the 31st of July I missed four spoons, I had laid them for dinner in the steward's room; I knew they were all right then. I went out for about half an hour to attend a young lady from church; when I returned I missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Travis. Were you at home on that Sunday at the time the cloth was laid in the steward's room - A. I was. I went up stairs into the rooms to see that every thing was done right; when I came down to my room I missed the watch; I asked the boy if he had taken my watch; he said no. He immediately came into my room, and said somebody has taken the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person come into that room from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140012"/>street - A. Yes, any person coming down the area might come into the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That spoon and watch was given to me by a woman to pawn for her; the woman said the watch was her husband's, and the spoon she found.</p>

Yes, on the night of the 10th of August; I did not miss any thing till the Saturday following; he went away on the Thursday morning. I missed three table cloths and one sheet; they were in a middle room in a box in the attic story.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that box locked - A. To the best of my knowledge it was; it is a trunk that Mrs. Farrow keeps the linen in, near the room in which the prisoner slept; I have seen the sheets and table cloths in the possession of two different pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you alone, or in company - A. By myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing occur to you there - A. Yes, there did; there were four or five gentlemen, I knew none of them; which men came at last, sometimes two before me and three behind me; and sometimes the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes three before you and two behind you A. Yes. In consequence of a cart being round the corner it stopped close to the window.</p>
               <p>COURT. The cart stopped round the corner, was it unloading - A. I cannot say what it was doing, it stopped close to the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Did any thing happen to you - The passage was very narrow between the cart and the window; in consequence of that some of the gentlemen were before me and some behind me, that had walked down with me; they forced close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean those before, or those behind you - A. Both ways; they forced themselves close to me. During the time the men hustled me I lost a gold mounted miniature picture, eight guineas and a half in gold, and odd silver; I cannot say how much.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was all this in - A. The silver and the eight guineas and a half were in a small morocco pocket book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. In what pocket - A. My right hand coat pocket; I had no great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you observed your pocket - A. Not five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your miniature picture - A. In the same pocket, I believe; it had a small morocco case made to fit, with a small gold chain and a small swivel.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed these articles what did you do - A. I put my hand into my pocket to prevent my property from being lost, as I was coming down the Minories.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do that while any of these men were behind you - A. I did. The cart came close to the wall, I put up my hands to prevent the cart from pressing me against the windows; I turned round in a fright, I asked a person if I had dropped any thing; the time was so short that I did not know whether I had dropped any thing, or whether it might be taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these five men - A. They were all dispersed directly the alarm was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you made an alarm directly - A. Instantly. I asked if I had dropped something, and some gentlemen that were present, one of which was Mr. Baron, told me I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. You said they were all dispersed, how do you mean dispersed - A. They were gone one one way and the other the other; one ran into a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe with respect to either of the others - A. I did not see what became of them - one man afterwards was taken, Mr. Good.</p>
               <p>COURT. One man ran into a shop, and the other man ran across the way - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Which man was that - A. A tall man in a light great coat; he ran down a passage, we could not take him; Mr. Baron was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, was he one of the five - A. He was one that was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he one of the five - A. Yes, there were more people present.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140013"/>Q. He was one of the five that surrounded you when your things were lost - did you observe him at the time, which way he went - Recollect yourself - you know it is some distance of time - recollect yourself again, you know you attended before the lord mayor the next day, whom we have here now - A. I did not observe which way he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself - I am endeavouring to assist your memory - you were before the lord mayor the day after it happened to you - did you make any observation respecting the prisoner Good - A. I do recollect he walked away from the corner of the Minories, the corner of the right hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. What, across the way - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he taken - A. It was a very short time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You have told me you have no doubt that he was one of the five men that hustled you - A. I have no doubt; but I cannot say who was the person that took the property.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask that question - the man that you pursued to the shop he was taken - A. Yes, he was close to me at the time the property was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, you have stated that five persons hustled you - were there any other persons than these five - A. Yes, there were other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any others close to you - A. Yes, there were; there were more people pushing at me.</p>
               <p>COURT. If I understand you right, there were five people following you down the Minories, you put your hand into your pocket to protect your property - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Just as you came to the cart you took your hand out, you was hustled, and you lost the pocket book and the miniature picture - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the five men it was that took it you cannot say - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was one of them - A. He was one of them; and he was one of them that followed me down the Minories.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. This was on the 5th of February - we are now come in September - how came it that you were not here before - A. After I had been before the lord mayor the wife of

               <p>Mr. Gurney. I object to that. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I would put this question to you - have you been a witness in this court from February down to this time - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you under recognizance before the lord mayor to appear here - A. I was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why was not you here - A. Application was made to me by the wife, and after I had missed the second session I did not like to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it was your duty - A. Yes, but I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I will ask you whether you was not subpoenaed to attend the second sessions - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. After the second sessions were not you subpoenaed to attend - A. I had one subpoena; it was the second session, I believe, that I was subpoenaed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why were you afraid to attend - A. Because I had not come forward as I ought to have done. I did not like to come.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have applied to somebody - A. I did not like to name it to any body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. This was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon on the 5th of February - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not very light then - A. It was between light and dark.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very public street, there were many people passing and repassing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there were more than five persons surrounded you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I heard you say that you suspected that you had dropped it - can you say whether you dropped it, or whether any body took it - A. I cannot, because I stopped and asked if any body had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never been able to find any of your things ever since - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then am I to understand you to say, whether you dropped it, or whether it was taken from you, you cannot say - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You cannot say whether you dropped it, or whether it was taken from you - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I understand you to say that your hand was guarding your pocket at the time you was between these men - A. It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Your money was in your pocket book - was the money and the pocket book and the miniature picture, separate from each other - A. They were in my coat pocket, and separate from each other.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how could you drop it - A. I cannot say how it was dropped.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why have you said, you could not say whether you dropped it or no - if the miniature picture was in one parcel, and the pocket book in another, and your hand upon it, how could you have dropped it - A. My hand was in my pocket, but when the cart came so near upon me, I took my hands out of my pocket, to prevent the cart from hurting of me</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you told the lord mayor that you might have dropped it - A. I mean to state, that at the time I was before the lord mayor, I told the lord mayor that I turned round and asked the people if they had picked it up.</p>
               <p>COURT. You never said any thing to the lord mayor about that - you said to the lord mayor the moment you took your hands away from your coat pocket, you missed them, they were in your pocket before - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Mc Lean, the prosecutor of this indictment - A. No further than the knowledge I had of him when that affair took place; I saw him on the 5th of February last, between four and five o'clock, round the corner; he was coming from the Minories, passing my door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person near him - A. I saw five persons near him, of which the prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner with respect to Mr. Mc Lean; before or behind him - A. Behind him, I knew at the moment they came round the corner that he was the person they intended to rob; I had observed the characters before in the neighbourhood; I recollected the faces of the whole of the five men; I had seen them very often every day; four or five times in the course of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have no doubt of the prisoner being one of them - A. I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of them do any thing - A. Two doors below my house a cart was unloading some furniture;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140014"/>the cart backed over the pavement, which made the passage narrow; it was in that situation or in that identical spot the property was taken from the prosecutor: I sprang over to that narrow part to take them, where the passage was impeded; I observed him to be completely surrounded by them at this time; he was in the centre of the whole; I observed some of the hands of some of the parties at his pockets, but I could not positively say which. Three of the men went forward, of which the prisoner is one, Wallis is another; Wallis went into a shop; one of the five men turned round and went towards the Minories again; Mr. Mc Lean turned round and seemed greatly agitated; he asked if any person had seen a miniature picture drop; he had lost a miniature picture: I told him I thought I could point out the man that had committed the robbery; I then took Mr. Mc Lean into the shop where Wallis was: he went into a clothes shop under pretence of buying a coat; he was very much agitated; I took Mr. Mc Lean into the shop, and had him secured; the prisoner Good was one of the three men that went down Rosemary lane; Good was not pursued, he was taken in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, as the prisoner Wallis was being taken to the watch-house; I kept the custody of Wallis, while Kinnersley brought Good to the watchhouse: I pointed out Good to him, he was on the opposite side of the way to what we were walking.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are sure that man is the same person - A. Most assuredly Good is the same person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did Mr. Mc Lean attend at the watch-house - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Good there - A. He was. Mr. Mc Lean said that he had observed the prisoner Good as being of the party that had followed him, and was sometimes before him and sometimes behind him, from Aldgate down the Minories.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Mc Lean say any thing about the loss he had sustained, and what - A. He stated that he had lost a miniature picture; the other property was not mentioned till the next day, and he stated his reason for not mentioning that was, his agitation was so great for the loss of the miniature picture. They were taken the next day before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible in the situation you were in that the pocket book could fall from Mr. Mc Lean without your seeing it - A. Totally impossible without my seeing it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How many persons were surrounding Mr. Mc Lean - A. Five; I am quite positive there were not a creature else by the spot; it was a fine night and by no means dusky; there were no other person near Mr. Mc. Lean by twenty yards, excepting me; I was the nighest person to him; there was only one door between him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear and to be understood that nothing could be seen to drop from him though he was surrounded by five persons - A. I do swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this had taken place did you see the prisoner at the bar - A. About fifteen minutes; he had taken a circular direction; he had gone down Rosemary lane and come into the Minories; he was not in the same neighbourhood as the robbery was done; that was in Sparrow corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that in the city of London - A. Yes, I am confident of it; and am certain he is the man.</p>

            . - Mr. Watson. What are you - A. An officer of the ward of Portsoken. On the 5th of February Mr. Barron came to me and told me there was a robbery; I went with him to Mr. Cumberland's house.</p>
               <p>COURT. You took Wallis in custody then - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. When you were going from there what happened - A. I saw Good, the prisoner, going up from Sparrow corner up the Minories; Mr. Barron and I had got hold of Wallis; Mr. Barron said there is Mr. Good the other thief, that was in company with him at the time; Mr. Barron went with Wallis to the watch-house; I went up to Good and told him he was a per- that I wanted, and I knew him well by being in the Minories before; I took him in custody to Aldgate watchhouse; he said for God's sake take me to a public house; do not search me in the street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you tell him upon what suspicion you had taken him - A. Yes, on suspicion of a felony, in the presence of a numerous mob of people: I took him to the watchhouse and searched him; and found in his pocket a sham note and a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. When you took him to the watchhouse was Wallis there - A. Yes; and Mr. Barron; Good then said in the presence of Mr. Barron; if the gentleman would advertise the property no doubt but it would come to light; he said it several times, and he said it going along to the compter; he said that he was no thief, that he was innocent of the charge that was alledged against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will ask you as an officer how many sessions have you attended in order to give evidence on this prosecution - A. Every sessions since last February.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Mr. Mc Lean here - A. No, 1 have never seen him here; I have seen him elsewhere.</p>
               <p>COURT. Has the property ever been found - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. The anxiety that Good had upon his apprehension was his not being searched in the street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a vast many people there, he told you to take him into a public house and search him - A. Yes; I searched him and found this note, some halfpence and a clasp knife; they frequently fling the property away when they are taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Did you expect that he would fling the property away - A. I did, because the inhabitants had complained to me of them. I knew them; I have known him for a fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time the prosecutor told me that he lost his miniature picture in the watchhouse; I told him he had better advertise it, probably he might find it again. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - were I such a character as the witnesses represent me to be, I should not have held the situations in which I have been entrusted; in the year 1794 I was appointed principal agent to the navigation company, which I held eight years and a half, and in the course of which time many thousands passed through my hands to the general satisfaction of my employers, when I left that situation I went into the coal business; at the time this happened I was looking for another situation near Tower Hill; I was not in company with any one when I was walking up the Minories; I was accused of the charge which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140015"/>I am now accused of; the prisoner Wallis is a stranger to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go in search of the prisoners - A. I did, I went across the way to Flower de luce court with Mr. Hill; as we were passing up the court in the back room of a public house, the window was quite open, Mr. Hill saw three men and I saw three men, I could not see enough to distinguish them; they were looking over a pocket book; they were looking over papers in the pocket book, I could see the red flap to it. We then went for a constable and got one; we returned; as we were going up Flower de luce court presently came a man very near between the constable and myself; Mr. Hill then said that is one of them, I will swear to; that was Joseph. I laid hold of him, and the constable laid hold of him on the other side; there were two more, I believe; one I saw distinctly, his back was towards me. Mr. Hill ran after him. I took Joseph to my chambers in Fig tree court, I left him with my servant and one or two more men. I then went to look after Mr. Hill; I presently found Mr. Hill, he said that he had found the other man, but not knowing where I went to, he was obliged to let him go. When I got into the chambers we searched Joseph, we did not find any thing upon him; he was taken in custody; he said he knew nothing of other man; I said how came you in company with him, he replied it was very easy for one man to pass for another. Mr. Hill coming in he swore to him; he went up to Mr. Hill and said you make a great mistake, or told a story. Joseph said he was a person that belonged to very respectable connections. He was taken to the Compter.</p>

About four o'clock on that day I was passing down Fleet street, I observed three men pursuing the prosecutor; their conduct and actions led me to suppose their intentions were to rob him; I observed Joseph frequently point to the prosecutor's left hand coat pocket; I having proceeded about an hundred yards, watching their actions narrowly, Joseph turned round and observed I was so doing. In order to elude that suspicion I crossed over the way. When they lost sight of me, and when I had crossed over to the opposite side of the way,

             made a sudden stop; he walked continually the whole of the way before the prosecutor; when Joseph and the third person closed in behind the prosecutor, so as to prevent passengers from observing what they were doing; I had a side view, I could see what passed - when I distinctly saw Joseph put his hand into the prosecutor's left hand coat pocket, and withdraw something red, which had the appearance of a pocket book; - the pocket book apparently then went from the hands of Joseph to the third person, that made his escape; they then all crossed over the way together and went up Flower de-luce court. I met them in the middle of the road, in about the middle of Fleet street; I ran and overlook the prosecutor in Mitre court; we both agreed to pursue the prisoners, and going up Flower de luce court I saw Joseph in company of Israel and the other man, they were both looking over some papers which they had in their hands; the pocket book lay on the table, I saw the strop of it; the other part was covered over. We then got a constable, and were upon the point of going into the house, when they all came out; Joseph being the first man I gave charge of him, he was instantly secured and taken to Mr. Zachary's chambers. I followed Israel up Flower de luce court, overtook him and secured him; he asked me what I secured him for, I told him he was charged with a robbery: I begged him to go back with me; I brought him into the Temple. Not knowing where Mr. Zachary lived, and no person assisting of me, the prisoner threatened me for taking him without any proper person. I being a novice in the business let him go; he said if I would not let him go, he would do for me; these words I noticed; I let him go then; I saw Israel the next day and Joseph, at Guildhall; I am quite certain to both their persons.</p>

I must search the barge; he said, and welcome, he was sure there was nothing there; I saw the stain and dung of geese and a few feathers littering about the barge; I asked for the key of the fore cabin; he said he would go and fetch it; and went on shore; he did not return so soon or quick as I expected with it; I looked at the other end of the barge where they sleep; I saw some fowls laid uppermost and some ducks, then I saw two goslings; I saw Morgan, as I thought, rather in a shuffle; I handcuffed him; Cook made use of desperate words, he said he did not mind two or three men; I took hold of his collar; he kicked me on my legs and kicked me on my private parts; I told him I would chop his head off if he resisted any more; after I secured him I broke open the cabin; the father of the prosecutor brought the key afterwards, and there I found eight live geese, one hen, and three or four ducks; the parties came and swore to the property; Cox owned the dead goslings the moment he saw them; the live ones Mason owned, and other persons six of the others; after they were taken to the magistrate and after they were examined, we divided them and put them in confinement at Uxbridge; they offered me some money if I would get it made up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I dare say you would rather lose a few guineas rather than to stand in the Old Bailey bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- MURRAY. Q. You are constable of Uxbridge - A. Yes. There were two of the prisoners put into my custody, Cook and Chapman; I went at nine o'clock at night to carry them some beer and bread and cheese; after they had their supper I locked the door and staid outside to hear if any conversation passed between them; one of them said they could not swear to us last night, and the other said if it had not been for your bare feet they would not have found us in the morning.</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to Marlborough street office. Mr. Alder brought the prisoner Spencer up to the office and delivered her in my charge; I asked her how she came by these pantaloons; after some hesitation, she said she would take me to the person that gave them to her. I went with her to a house in a court by Fitzroy market; I went up one pair of stairs to a room door, she put her mouth to the key hole; she said it is me; the door opened. There was a woman behind the door; she pointed to the woman, and said that is the woman I had the pantaloons of. The prisoner Macklin did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Macklin's Defence. I was going up Tottenham Court road, I met a young man, he asked me if I would go along with him; I agreed; when I went with him he had no money, he said, about him, but he would give me that which would fetch me half a crown; I went to this woman and asked her to pawn them for me; I said the same at the magistrate's as I do now.</p>
               <p>Spencer's Defence. She came to where I lodged in the course of the day; she asked me to pledge them; I took them to Mr. Alder's, they stopped me; she said they was hers.</p>

When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140021"/>we got to my door he asked me what o'clock it was; I pulled out my watch, I told him about twenty minutes to eleven; he said I do not think it is so late as that, hold the watch up, I will look; I did; he made a snatch at the watch, took it, and ran away and I after him; I called out stop thief, and he was taken.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

               <p>MR. HANLEY. About eleven o'clock it rained very hard; I stopped at the public house reading the newspaper; I saw the prisoner with the board, he asked the landlord if he would buy it, he said no; the prisoner took the board up Peerless row; I stopped him near the constable's house, I asked him whose board it was; he then said it was a scaffolding board, he was taking it home to his master; I seized him by the collar, I told him I would see whose board it was; he then said he saw it fall out of a cart in the City road, he called to the man to take it up in the cart, the man said he had plenty of them, he might take it. During the time the constable came; I then gave charge of him, I insisted he should go before a magistrate; the constable said he knew where he worked, he would take him to his master; he then confessed that he had taken it away from Mr. Moore. Mr. Moore came and owned the board.</p>

I was returning home; drinking a good deal of wine and other things, and being a good deal overtaken with liquor. I was very sick at the corner of Long lane; by some means I went to sleep at the corner; I know no further.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid down - A. I sat down, as I understand. I was violently sick, and a perspiration overcame me.</p>

            . Q. You are a watchman - A I was off my watch at that time; I was going home about five o'clock; I was walking down Long lane; I observed White sitting at a door, he had lost then his hat from his head, and the shoes from his feet cash, and every thing else that he had about him.</p>
               <p>Q. That you cannot say what cash he had; you could see whether he had hat and shoes - A. I was then walking towards my place; I observed as I walked along Skinner and West, they were about as far as you may say a quarter of a mile off; Skinner had the hat swinging in his hand, West was walking with him, and he took out from under his coat, as it were, a pair of shoes, and gave them to Skinner; Skinner asked him what he was to give him; but as to the answer I do not know; he took and put his hand into his pocket and pulled out something, which I supposed to be money; I could not ascertain whether it was or not; afterwards they went in the French Horn alehouse, Beech street, and I went in after them; and when I came out I got assistance and took them in custody; when they came out from thence we came up to Mr. White in Long lane; he was up then and quite awake; I gave them over to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon them - A. Yes, the hat and shoes: the watch and handkerchief has not been found; there was a pen knife picked up by a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say that Skinner bought of the other prisoner a pair of shoes - A. I cannot say how that is; he gave him the shoes, and Skinner gave him something; what it was for I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a considerable distance from where the man was sitting on the stop - A. Yes, it was in Barbican that he took the shoes and gave him something.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor has told us he was exceeding drunk - he did not know what he was about - A. I do not think he by any means knew what he was about; I asked Skinner which way he came by the hat and shoes; he told me did not know; he was as drunk as the other; they were all drunk; I cannot say West was as drunk as the other.</p>

            . I am a watchman in St. Sepulchre's. On Friday morning the 2nd of September, I was returning from my duty, about a quarter after five o'clock; I was going down Beech street; the former witness was standing by the French Horn; Skinner and West came out from the French Horn; Skinner had a hat and shoes concealed under his coat; a person there said he had property that did not belong to him; he made a blow at him; I immediately took hold of Skinner, I said you have got that which does not belong to you, they belong to that person sitting in Long lane; he replied I am innocent; I said so much the better for you if you are innocent you shall go back with me, then we shall know whether you are innocent or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is West a watchman - A. I understand he is a watchman in Aldersgate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk too. - A. No; nor did Skinner appear to be so drunk at that time, but at the Barley-Mow he got more liquor and appeared worser than he did before; he then throwed some things from his pocket; the penknife was the only thing that was picked up; I secured Skinner in the back room; West made his escape by the assistance of some drover. The hat and shoes were delivered up to the officer; there was some money found upon Skinner; the watch was not found.</p>
               <p>MR. KENDRICK. On Friday morning the 2nd of September, I saw the prosecutor sitting on the step, with his head leaning against the door post, without hat and shoes, his sob pocket was cut open, his breeches pocket turned inside out, and his waistcoat pocket likewise; I received information that two men had gone up Long lane and Barbican with the hat in one of their hands; I immediately went after them; I found them at the French Horn in Beech street, they were drinking at the bar. Skinner said he could dispose of the property; I followed them out; I told Skinner he must go with me; he put himself in a posture of defence and said he would not, with horrid oaths; directly Gullen and Davis stepped up; Skinner was going to knock me down; they seized Skinner; I laid hold of West, we brought them back to the Barley Mow, Long lane; Skinner was taken in custody; - a penknife and fifteen shillings were taken from his pocket.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Skinner's Defence. I was in a state of intoxication; I might pick them up in the street as they were laying about, I cannot say; I never saw the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>West's Defence. When I came from my duty I met with Skinner, we went to the French Horn to have a glass of liquor; the reason I had the shoes, we were playing and walking about together; I never was in Long lane at all.</p>
               <p>Skinner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

The two prisoners came into my master's shop and asked to look at some worsted stockings; I shewed them some; objection was made to them; upon which they were put away, and Williams advised Brown to have cotton ones; I shewed them several sorts of cotton stockings; they made choice of one pair; I put them on one side; they asked to look at some worsted ones; I went back to get some worsted ones; when I came back I missed a paper of stockings from off the counter; I said nothing; they made choice of a pair of worsted. While we were agreeing for the price, Williams walked out of the shop with something under her apron, she ran across the street; I pursued her; I took hold of her gown; she dropped the stockings and I picked them up; I brought her into the shop and sent for an officer; when I came back the man was gone; in about half an hour he came in the neighbourhood; then he was taken.</p>

I requested her to carry them down to the shop, and not to have a mob about us; she took them out of her apron in the shop and laid them on the counter; The prisoner said she had a pair of black stockings, the other woman had bought them. I asked her who the other woman was, she affected to know nothing of her; I said it was a very improbable story, I should send for an officer; she went down upon her knees and said at my property was restored, I should be no loser; begged I would forgive her.

I called my father down; he served them with a pair of stockings at two shillings and five pence; then my father went up to dinner. They came in again, the other woman said she would give me one and eleven pence for a pair of black worsted; the prisoner at the bar went to the end of the counter and took a pair of black worsted stockings; when my father came down.

               <p>Q. When did you take him up - A. I gave him liberty from Saturday till Tuesday, then I sent my boy down to see if he would pay the seven shilling piece; he only laughed at him.</p>
               <p>Q. What magistrate did you go before - A. In Lambeth street.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Gurney. You have sworn to tell the whole truth, do you know that - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. You know you have taken God to witness that you will tell us the whole truth - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have not told the whole truth - my lord asked you what magistrate you went before, and your answer was you went before the magistrate in Lambeth street - that was the Tuesday after - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you not the same evening you lost the seven shilling piece, go before Mr. Thelwall the magistrate - A. I did not tell the magistrate that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Woman you are sworn to tell the whole truth - did you go before that gentleman - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went and told him the same story that you have told to day - A. No, sir; I told him he took the seven shilling piece; he told me to summons him and get the seven shilling piece back again. I went to a constable, he told me the court had no business with a street robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known this man many years - A. A matter of two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. And he knew you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were trying whether the seven shilling piece was good - A. My husband handed it over to me to look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. This man said I will tell you whether it is good or not - he took it out of your hand - A. No, he twisted it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say if you would examine your salmon kit you would find it there - did not the seven shilling piece fall in the salmon kit - A. I do not know where it fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not both of you search the ground to see whether you could find it - A. I did, I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in your kit - A. I did not, nobody asked me; the kit was not within two yards; he twisted it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was not he searched upon the spot, and no seven shillings found - A. No; upon my oath he walked into the middle of the road; he was twenty yards off when he was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was found upon him - A. No, but he might easily shift a seven shilling piece.</p>

Yes, and I was sober; we have never a drop hardly any day till we have done our business; I was selling pickled salmon that day; I sold six pennyworth of salmon to a gentleman, he handed me a seven shilling piece, I handed it to my wife and desired her to look whether it was a good one; the prisoner twisted her hand and took it out; I entreated him several times to give it her back, but to no purpose.

               <p>Q. Who did she go before - A. I believe he went before Mr. Thellwall; I believe so, and am sure of it. He gave some advice but that advice would not do.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave her advice and dismissed the complaint - A. I do not know what he did; we went to a police officer; he said he would go and fetch him without a warrant; the people of the workhouse would not let him come without a warrant, so the magistrate wrote a few lines that the man that kept the gate was charged with a felony; so they delivered him up.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for on that day; when I went I conceived that they were both in liquor. I took him into a room and searched him; I found three shillings and sixpence in silver.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From their story, and from what you saw, you thought you were not justifiable in taking the man in custody - A I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. You acted right.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I am totally innocent of taking the seven shilling piece; at the time of this event taking place, I was a pauper in the poor house, Mile end, I had the care of the outward gate, as porter. On the day mentioned, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard the cry of pickled salmon by Mrs. Casey; I went out to get three penny worth of salmon; when I came out Mr. Casey was trying a seven shilling piece by ringing it on the stones; when his wife asked him to let her try it, and when it was in her hand I very foolishly put my fore finger in her hand and said let me try if it is a good one; at that time she shut her hand and confined my finger, I pulled my finger out of her hand; at this time the seven shilling piece might have fell out of her hand, but I did not hear it fall; the woman accused me of taking it from her, which I know I did not; several people collected together about the spot, and Mr. Beckit, master of the workhouse, came out and said I should be searched; I went over to the public house and was searched; I had only three shillings and six pence about me, and no gold. I have known the prosecutor and his wife several years, and was rather intimate with them; it is about two years since I was afflicted with a rupture, I was obliged to go into the poor house; my late master, Mr. Mount, has known me forty years; I had no inducement to steal being well provided for in the workhouse, they allowed me fourteen shillings a week; and they have further informed me of reinstating me to my situation at the gate. I am innocent of taking the money, nor do I know what became of it; it was lost by the prosecutor or his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. BECKIT. - Mr. Gurney. You are master of the workhouse; in consequence of this charge being made did you come upon the spot - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prosecutor and his wife both sober - A. They were both drunk, but the woman was the most affected with liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. They made the charge against him of this seven shilling piece. - A. They did; he was taken into the parlour and searched directly. I have known the prisoner twenty years; I never knew an honester creature, I should not be afraid to trust him with money untold.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is Princes street - A. Leading from Barbican to Bridgewater square.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been previously in before that time - A. I was an apprentice to a water gilder.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in the watch line - A. Yes; such as gilding watch cases; I served my time in Charter house lane; my employer lived in Red Lion street, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you during that time know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, perfectly well; he was a watch case maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and tell me whether you recollect him now - A: I do; he had a wen then upon the right side of his face; there is no wen now, there is a scar.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that scar appear to you to be where the wen was - A. Exactly so. On the 21st of November, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came to me at the Crown and Cushion, and he asked for change of a fifty pound bank note; he said it was for Mr. Richards of Bridgewater square; I knew Mr. Richards, he is a watch case maker; I told him I could not give him change; he went away; in ten minutes he returned again, I was in the tap room, Mrs. Baverstock called me out and told me the prisoner had come to; change of a check; I came out to him, he wanted he said change for a check of ten pound; he gave me the check, and I gave him a five pound bank note and the rest in cash; he produced a check upon Mr. Walpole's house. After he had got the cash he took a glass of rum and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some suspicion that you entertained what did you do - A. I went to Mr. Richards.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that check - is that the check that the prisoner presented to you - A. It is the check, this is my hand writing. In consequence of the enquiries I made at Mr. Richards, I went to Mr. Walpole's, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140027"/>refused my presenting it, it was after hours, and they did no business; but when I wished to know whether it was a good one they took it very politely and told me; from that I went to Hatton Garden, knowing Trott the officer, to lay an information against him. I did not see him till about a month ago, then he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the prisoner at the bar whom you saw at the magistrate's, was the person that you had formerly known, that had the wen on his face, and is now the prisoner at the bar - A. I have not the slightest doubt in the world; I verily believe he is the man; at the time he came to me he had the wen on his face, which he has not now. I have no other doubt.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you have a doubt you must say it - A. I cannot say that I have; I really believe to the best of my knowledge that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have any doubt you must say it - A. That is all the doubt about it; I verily believe from my soul that he is the man, he not having the wen on his face is all the doubt I have about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you occasion to send this draft for twenty one pounds to the bankers, or were you about to do it - A. I called a porter, a messenger who was down stairs, to take it in the presence of the prisoner; the prisoner said I will give you cash for it; I called the man back, and he gave me cash for it.</p>
               <p>Q. After he gave you the cash what became of you - A. I am not certain whether it was before or after he gave me the cash that I went out of the room; I was out of the room for five minutes, not longer, some person wanted to speak to me; I then left the prisoner in the room and no one else; when I returned, I do not recollect any thing particular; he staid some time and then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. I think on the 13th of April, the prisoner called upon me in the accompting house and told me he was going out of town; and left me an order for a bedstead which he said he would sell me cheap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You said you was not certain of the time when you left the room, whether it was before or after that he gave you change for this check - A. I rather think it was previous.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who the persons were that hustled you - A. Humphrey was one; and I saw Hankey put a screw thing in my pocket and turn it inside out; I saw in his hand when he was going away; I had two half guineas, a guinea, sixteen one pound notes, and a two pound note; they were bank of England notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Mr. Woodward, you went to see the rowing match - I suppose you meaned to bet, or else you would not have took twenty pounds in your pocket - A. No; I took it with intention of paying some of it away as I returned. There was a great crowd in Mill bank road; it was a pretended fight and I went to see what it was; I was shoved into the crowd; Humphrey was one, and Hankey was another, and one I never could find, behind Humphrey, and there was of the name of Tallboys; I could have taken Hankey the same night if I had help; I saw him and four more in less than an hour after; I knew he was the man that robbed me</p>
               <p>Q. You know that if you can convict Hankey and Humphreys you will have eighty pounds reward - A. I do not want any reward.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you that - I am asking you whether you do not know that you should have so much - A. I never knew any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you - A. I am fifty two.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to say that you never heard of a forty pounds reward - A. There is a reward, but I do not know the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what you told me two minutes ago is not true - you have heard it - A. I might have done.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you what you might have done, have you not heard there is a forty pounds reward - A. I cannot say, but that I have heard such things; I do not know whether they are true or not.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you do not believe it is true, that there is a reward of eighty pounds if you convict the two prisoners - A. It may be so, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe - A. I dare say it is so, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not charged any other person but the prisoners and Tallboys - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge another man with being the man that hustled you - A. I did not charge him; he was the outside; I thought he was one of my friends; he was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon going up to him did not you take hold of his collar - A. I did not so help me God.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you remember taking an officer to the cook's shop and taking up another man - A. I took him up, I discharged him; I thought he was the man; I found he was not; I did not want him to go before the justice; he said he would go before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you charged Tallboys with being one of the men - A. I am sure he was one of the hustlers.</p>
               <p>Q. Tallboys was taken before the magistrate, the magistrate did not believe he was one of the men, he was discharged - A. He was discharged with bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, upon Tallboys' brother coming forwards as bail for him, say he was one that hustled you - A. I did not; I thought he was my nephew, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Hankey's father coming forward for his own son, you said you were in the hustle - A. He was in the hustle, he got hoisting up a stick, he did not hustle me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not imagine that I said he did hustle you - did not you say before the magistrate that he was in the hustle - A. I did say so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A.

One of the customers desired me to draw him a pint of beer; I carried the pint of beer into the parlour, and when I went back from the parlour I saw him walk out of the bar. I pursued him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected him - A. Yes; then I found him sat down in the first box in my tap room, he had his hands between his thighs, and that handkerchief with blue spots covered it over. When I came to him, I said my friend what have you been doing in my bar, he said he was not in my bar; I told him he had. I lifted up his right hand, I found my tumbler, I took it from his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any money in the tumbler - A. Yes, seven seven shilling pieces, two half guineas, and a guinea, was in the tumbler.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose that money out of the bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the money the last time before it was stolen - A. Just about ten minutes before, after I had given change to my customer.</p>

I saw the watch in his custody; I had lent the servant girl the watch; he brought the watch down stairs and gave it to my wife; he said he was a police officer, and he would take care of it; after he gave the watch to my wife he sat down in the tap room; there was some little dispute between my servant and me about her spoiling some fish me over night; he made a demand of the watch, and he said he would take charge of the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to take charge of the girl for - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any charge against the girl for stealing the watch - A. No. He sat down in the tap room, after he had demanded the watch, and minutely looked at it; he said there was some private mark, he wanted to see; after that the dispute between me and my servant was all made up; I asked him for my watch; he said I will not give you the watch now, never mind, I will take care of the watch; the next morning he went out early, he returned on the following day very much in liquor; he told me he had left the watch at Hounslow, then he said at Brentford, and afterwards he said at Knightsbridge; I sent for an officer; after the officer had taken charge of him, he said he had left it at the Castle at Brentford; he said he was sorry for what had happened, he meaned to fetch it the following day.</p>

            . I am a publican at Brentford. On the 28th of August, the prisoner got off the coach and asked me for one shilling and sixpence to pay for coach hire, I lent it him; he asked me to lend him sixpence to go up the town with; he came back and dined with me; after dinner he told me he had no money, he would leave the watch in security for what he had.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he leave it for - A. I lent him in the whole twenty five shillings and eight pence on the watch; he had been in my house five or six times; he represented himself as a police officer.</p>

On the night the talling out was between the girl and the mistress, I came down with the key of the girl's room in my hand; I said the girl is leaving the house; yes, Mrs. Marshall said, I wish I had Mr. Marshall's watch out of her room; I went up and got it and gave it to Mrs. Marshall; she throwed it down on the glass: I said you will break the glass of that watch; I said give it to me; which she did. On the Sunday morning I got a little in liquor, I went down to Brentford to Mr. Barrett's, as he has said; I pulled out the watch and said I will leave it till tomorrow, and then I will come and redeem it; about twelve o'clock at night, I returned home, Mr. Marshall sent his girl up to me to know what I had done with the watch; the answer was the watch was safe enough, I would bring it back tomorrow evening; I had no intention of keeping his watch; I am a pensioner; I have served his Majesty sixteen years; I have a shilling a day; I could go and get the money at any time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the boy Smith - A. Yes, I saw him sitting at Mr. Tancred's window; the sash was open, one leg was in and the other out; he had the appearance as though he was trying to get out.</p>

            . Whereabouts is the value of these spoons - A. They are worth about a pound a piece, one soup ladle is worth about five pound, and the marrow spoon about fifteen shillings; I am quite sure they were Mr. Tancred's property.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I came out of my mother's house about half after five o'clock on Sunday evening; my mother had an own sister that lived with her; all of a sudden she left my mother and went to live in Lincoln's inn; I work at coal heaving; I had only an opportunity to go to look after her of a Sunday; I went to this house, knocked at the door, and asked if a person lived there of the name of Smith; she said, no; and directly called out thieves.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. About three months ago I returned from sea; I went to work at Mr. Fellow's, Blossom street, Spitalfields; my master discharged me upon his death bed; I had some prize money to take; I had lost my prize certificate; on this day I was told that if I went to Swan yard, I should see an officer belonging to the ship that was invalided, where I should get my ticket again; I went through this inn, Clement's inn I think it is; they told me it was the best way to go to Somerset house; I heard the cry of stop thief; I went to see what it was: they took hold of me, and said that is him; the prisoner Smith I never saw before with my eyes till they brought him out.</p>

            . I am a publican, I live at the Horse and Groom, King street, Seven Dials. On the 13th of August in the evening, the prisoner and a woman came in with some oysters, he pulled out some bank notes, the woman asked him where he got all that money; he did not seem to wish to give an answer; the woman insisted on knowing where he got the notes from; he burst out a crying, he said he had robbed his master of sixty one pounds; I made him turn his pockets out. Here are the notes that were produced at that time.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went with some company to Sadler's wells; we went to a public house, where I had something to drink; when we came out I went home with them; one of them gave me a night's lodging, two of them were brothers. In the morning we went out to a public house by Bedfordbury, we changed one of these five pound notes; when we came back again one of the young men said he would have nothing to do with the notes, because they were stolen. I had a ten pound note in my hand, one of the young men asked me for it, I gave it him, he went off. In the afternoon we went to a public house, where the young man got the ten pound note changed; they said he had been gone about half an hour. The next morning I saw him, I asked him if he had changed it, he said yes, he asked me whether I would have a guinea of it; I said no. There was a man snatched a two pound note out of my hand; I went into Mr. Patrick's house, I had something to drink, I had a five pound note; a young man said he knew Adam Patrick very well; I changed the five pound note there, he kept two pounds for himself, the young man did; they kept me drunk all the time. I went in the house with a woman, a young man came in and asked me if I had robbed my master. A constable was fetched, and I was taken.</p>

I missed eight or ten thousand nails, done up in paper, each paper contained one thousand; I went round the counter and discovered one paper of these tacks under his hand; they were removed from the place where they stood; he then said he wanted a pennyworth of nails like these; I said he could not see what these were, I mentioned my loss to him; he said he knew nothing of them I beckoned to the porter, and immediately the prisoner ran out I pursued him, and caught him in Charter house lane; on coming back to the shop I searched him, and found one of these papers on his person; I sent for a constable; he was searched again; we found two thou sand more in his pocket; these are the three thousand found upon him.

Yes: I have examined the last side brought by the last man, and the three sides brought by the officers. I have compared them with the rest of the bacon in the waggon load, and they corresponded in all respects. I have not the least doubt of their being my property.</p>

            I am a hair dresser, I live at No. 2, Vine street; the prisoner lodged in the same room with me, there were three beds in the room; about half after two o'clock in the morning on Sunday July 17, I heard somebody come up stairs and the door open; the prisoner rolled against the bedstead, I asked who are you, he said it is Day; he proceeded towards the window with a bundle in his hand, he drew the curtain of one side, I then could see; the handkerchief in his land appeared to have something tied up in it; I asked him what made him there at so early an hour, he said he had been to the washerwoman's for his shirt, stockings, and handkerchiefs, and he should put them in the bed; he went down stairs, I did not see him afterwards till he was in confinement. On the Monday a young man that slept in the same bed produced the bundle from between the bedstead and the wall. I saw what was in the bundle, I advised him to put it where he found it; he did.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Day came past me between two and three o'clock on Sunday morning, he had something under his watch coat. I watched him to his lodgings, No. 2, Vine street.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At half past twelve o'clock, as I was returning to my box, that gentleman sat against Rose's door in Leather lane; I asked him where he was bound for, he replied that he lodged at the King of Prussia, and they were gone to bed; he asked me to let him sit in my box, he did, he sat in my box till two in the morning; I found myself dry, I went and had a drink of water, the weather being hot; I turned sick, I knew I had a quartern of gin at home; at half after two o'clock I went home and drank the gin, if I had not drank the gin I must have died; I came down and stood against the Griffin door, Hatton Wall. At half after three o'clock I roused that gentleman, he told me he lost his parcel out of the box. Where I lodge in Vine street the door is never fastened, and as for Heredit's, although he is a watchman, he has been to my box at different hours of the night. I have been in several engagements with lord Nelson, I was with him at the battle of Trafalgar. I leave it all to your mercy. I am innocent of the fact.</p>

I am an extra officer of the City of London: I heard the cry of stop thief; the prisoner was the first person running, it was four or five doors down Long lane; the prosecutor was close to his heels; I pursued close to the prisoner; he fell down as he entered the court; he got up again, he ran again, and fell down again at the bottom of the court; I caught him and attempted to search him; I was very much baffled by somebody coming up, in getting him up to the top of the court we were surrounded by a party, and the watchman was knocked down, and I was knocked down; I got up again and ran after him, with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140036"/>assistance of the watchmen in Charterhouse square, he was secured and taken to the watchhouse; the watch was found by a man who saw the whole transaction.

I am just turned of thirteen; I saw Mr. Smith bring the trunk into my father's house into the bar; he asked my aunt if he might leave it there, and if it would be in the way; she said he might take it into the kitchen, and as they were going along I called to Mr. Smith to take it up into the club room, but he took it into the kitchen, sat it on the table and left it there, and said he would call for it in about two hours; a little before eight o'clock the prisoner and Mr. Lenty came in; they called for a pint of ale; my father served them; they sat drinking there till about twenty minutes past eight o'clock; Mr. Griffiths went out; before he returned I went up stairs to my aunt and remained there about ten minutes; my aunt and me both came down together and went into the kitchen and the trunk was gone; we asked Mr. Lenty and the prisoner, he had returned then, who had taken the trunk; they said three men had been in and had taken it away; I immediately informed my father and asked whether three men had been there.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Gurney. How long before you went up stairs was if that Mr. Griffiths went out - A. He went out a very little time before I went up stairs; I saw him go out.</p>

            . I keep the Three Tuns in Red cross street. About a little before eight o'clock the prisoner and Mr. Lenty came in together; they called for a pint of ale; I served them, and I observed at that time the trunk lying on the table; they called for the second pint, which my servant served them; my daughter came to me some little time after the second pint, and informed me that the trunk was missing from the table; the prisoner came to the bar and informed me that three people had come in and taken the trunk away; they had drank a pint of beer and had taken the trunk with them; I thought it a singular circumstance that three people should pass my bar without my observing them; I was almost in the bar the whole time they were in the kitchen; the bar commands a view of the kitchen; I directly called each of my family and asked if they had served any beer, in the presence of the prisoner; they informed me they have not, nor had they seen any three people come into that part of the house; after this the prisoner and Mr. Lenty went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What sized trunk was it - A.

               <p>Q. On Sunday evening, the 24th. of July, was you with the prisoner - A. I was; it was mere accident; I met him at the corner of the court; I have known him some time; he asked me very kindly if I would accept of a glass of ale; we went back to the Three Tuns; it must be near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you sit in - A. I had been in the tap room; the room that we went in afterwards was the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any trunk there - A. Mr. Davis, who keeps the house, pointed out the trunk to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the trunk - A. It was in a separate box from where we were sitting, on a table.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner and you stay there - A. We drank three pints of ale, and the second pint Mr. Davis joined us.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you was there did the prisoner go out a short time - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the prisoner did not go out at all to your knowledge - A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. During the time you were sitting there, did any persons go into the kitchen - A. When we went in there was a person sitting where the trunk was, drinking a pint of porter, there were a great many people in the tap room, and a great many in the parlour, and there were a great many went out and in while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the trunk being missed - A. No; I do not remember any thing about the trunk being missed, I mentioned it first of all to Mr. Davis, and the prisoner mentioned it as we was going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the time that you told Mr. Davis of it had you observed any person come into the kitchen - A. There had been some, how many I cannot say, there were two or three that come in two or three times, I believe there were three came in at one time, they were sitting at the extremity of the same table where the box was.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you were there with the prisoner, do you think that it was possible for him to take the trunk away without your knowledge - A. It was not possible without being perceived.</p>

I did tell him, to the best of my recollection, that two or three people came in and took the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Your answer to the very question before was, you said you never saw any body take the trunk - how came the landlord to point out the trunk to you and the prisoner - A. When we came in the landlord came home, and when we went in the kitchen he said we have got a trunk brought here.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went out you told him you saw three people take the trunk - A. There w then a man sitting drinking a pint of porter; there was one, two, or three, I am not certain which; I ld almost swear three; I told Mr. Davis, as we were going home, that three men took the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the sister came down stairs - A. I do not know, I do not recollect her going up nor coming down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the daughter going up - A. No, nor coming down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect their asking you about the trunk - A. No, they did not ask me about the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. You can be positive about that - A. They did not, but I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. If three men took it, how did they carry it out - A. One man took it out, and laid it across his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop him - A. ad no authority, I did not know it was right to stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there in the tap-room - A. Four or five.</p>

When I came home with the deals I told him they were mine, he said they were not; I sent for a constable, he said he could send for a man that he gave a shilling to for planing them over; he sent his mate for this man, and when this man come I told him to speak like an honest man, and not to take the part a thief; he said that he never planed any over for him at all. I said to the prisoner, I think now I can convince you that these are my deals; I found three deals in my yard these three deals were cut off, the knots ent through each of them; I can swear to two of them. He then said he had made a mistake, he had taken them instead of other people's deals; I said that could be the case, there was not a planed deal in the ho out mine; they are my deals, I can swear to them two</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Perfectly well, by his being in the habit of coming for Mr. Blackburn's papers in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his coming on the 4th of August - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at your book, and let me know what the amount of Mr. Blackburn's newspapers came to on the 4th of August - A. Three pounds five shillings and one penny. That note is the note I took on the 4th of August for them papers; I have marked it 4th of August, 8 for 1808. Bkburn abbreviated for Blackburn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you delivered the newspapers and change to the person that brought you that note - A. I am not sure that I delivered the change and the papers to the prisoner, but to the person that brought me the note most assuredly I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether that was the prisoner or not you will not undertake to swear - A. I will not undertake to swear positively.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I then called the watch and sprang the rattle; which I heard answered in several places; it was a very fine moon light night; I directed the watchman where I saw him go; he turned down Weston street, which is the first turning. I presently heard he was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any butter - A. Yes, two pound and a half; I saw the butter there the morning before the butter was gone, and the safe door was open.</p>

            . Q. What are you - A. I am a Bricklayer, I was standing on the threshold of Drury lane stage door, I saw these men and the prisoner coming down the street towards Nag's head court; the prosecutor was in the center, the prisoner had his left hand upon his shoulder; I took notice of them both, there, were only them three in the street; they made a halt and they told him this was the place to go up; then I had a sight of them because I was right perpendicular, I thought they were skylarking; they were not five minutes there before they come down, but when the prisoner came down I thought they were all joining together, I might have taken him if I had thought there had been any robbery; I saw this man run down, he wore a brown jacket, he had his hand under his jacket, he ran down the court and jumped right across the street he made, a false step when he came nigh to me, and the prosecutor ran after him with a poker; he cried out a robbery, when I saw he was near me I got up and pursued him, I saw the man double up by the play house; I ran down Vinegar yard to see if he would come by that way, instead of that he ran down Change court. As a soldier catched him a publican at the corner of Catherine street said the soldier would have him; I saw the soldier pursue him, the man turned down Change court and I took it easy; I pursued along with this man, he followed me up the court it is called Round court; I believe it is a very bad place; I was told that the man had got a knife and run into a house; I went and got a light; I saw the door was locked where he went out upon the top of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him go into that house - A. No; we pursued him so far I went over the roof of the house; I was not a constable or else I would have gone farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehended him - A. Not that time. I went back and got a constable and went to the place where he was robbed, and his hat was found there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. Did you find his hat there - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was you afterwards present when he was apprehended - A. No; he was taken to the watchhouse with the woman; he was there before us.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw him at the watchhouse, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon him - A. Yes, a cut on the left hand side of his head, occasioned by the stroke of the poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the blow with the poker - A. No, I was too far away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner before this happened - A. No; I was just come to my work; I work at Drury lane theatre.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. You say you did not know this man before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them altogether - you say Sullivan was elevated, you thought they were all skylarking together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It appeared to you that they were all of one party - A. It did, or I could have catched him.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the men at work there then - A. The men were at work there at six o'clock; I found him there about eight o'clock, I believe; when I found him under the place I desired him to come out; he did; his head was most dreadfully cut behind, and his shoulders<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140043"/>all over blood; I asked him what business he had there; he told me he made his escape from some soldier who was going to murder him; I told him I wished it might be so, but under appearances, and from what I had heard, I thought it not right to let him go; I saw a beadle in the street, whom I called in; he took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what you had heard - A. I am not clear whether I did or not; he was very willing to go to the watchhouse; he seemed to wish to go.</p>

            . I am a labourer, No. 9, Change court. On Monday morning the 16th of July, I was awoke by the noise of two people running down the court, I heard the alarm of stop thief; I saw a soldier run down the court following a man; when I had dressed myself I saw the soldier come back; he picked up something, I could not see what it was, with that the soldier made his way off; the prosecutor and the prisoner were gone into the Strand; the soldier let the prisoner go when the prosecutor came up.</p>

               <p>Q. Could a person, running away, have thrown it into the cellar - A. I cannot say; I should suppose he might, there is no window, only railing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is nothing to prevent any person from throwing it into the cellar - A. There is nothing but the railing. I have had it in my custody ever since I picked it up in the afternoon between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether it was put there by the prisoner or any body else you cannot say - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a soldier run down the place - A. Yes; he either picked up something or put down something.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That watch case is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon it by which you know it - A. I never put any mark upon it.</p>

I was not gone far before a man says he is coming again; I went into an old gentleman's house: he there said I had robbed him of his watch; I said is there any assistance; he came into the room and said he would murder me; I ran out of the window and went into that gentleman's house, and what with the blow and with the running, I went to sleep; when the gentleman came to me, I resigned myself up, I knew I was innocent, I wished right to take place.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen these lambs - A. I had lost lambs frequently; the last time I watched them was with my man no the night of the 3d of September. On the 4th of September, I went out about ten o'clock as usual, I took a round to the fields, I had sheep in three or four fields, I went round to see that they were all safe; as I was coming round Maiden lane that leads from Highgate to Holloway, I looked over the stile, I observed the sheep seemed frightened, and I saw a man rise up. I had my gun in my hand, we got over the stile to see what the man was at; and before we reached him he went down upon his knees and caught a lamb in his arms; we went up to him before he observed us; his back was towards us, he was not above thirty yards off when we first saw him; my man went up to him on the left hand and I on the right; I asked him what he was going to do with the lamb; he immediately let the lamb down; he said he had been to Highgate to see his brother; he was in liquor and and wanted to lie down; which was not the case; I told him he must go with us; he swore he would not; I desired my man to lay hold of him; they had a scuffle; he got from the man; I took to my fowling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him at last - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. Is this field in the high road to London - A. No, it is up by Maiden lane, that leads from Highgate to Holloway; there is a foot path in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from that foot path - A. About thirty yards; he had the lamb up in his arms ready to take away; he had two more tied, ready to take away from the very place where I first saw him rise from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he had the lamb completely in his arms - A. Yes, I am quite certain of it.</p>

I went up to the prisoner, he was among the sheep; as he rose up from the sheep he was looking about himself; he went up to where the lamb laid asleep, he stooped and catched up the lamb, and when we came up to him he stood upright with the lamb in his arms; we came up close to him before he saw us. I catched hold of his collar, he said he would not go with us; he got away from me; my master came up with his piece, he said if he would not go with us he would shoot him; we then secured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140044"/>him.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor engaged me to work for him, and I was to learn him the flower business, for which he promised me two pounds. In the latter end of July I had not above two days work in a week; I asked him for the two guineas which he was to give me for learning him; he said he had no money, but he would give me something to pledge; he gave me the coat out of the drawer: I went and pledged it at that gentleman's shop for one pound fifteen shillings. I gave the ticket into Mr. de Frenne's hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give her the coat to pawn or sell - A. No; she delivered me the duplicate when I went to apprehend her.</p>

I had some business at the house of the prosecutor on the 21st of July; as I came to the house I saw the prisoner in the act of taking the scales; they were laying on the table in the shop, there was no person in the shop besides him. When I came in the shop he put them under his arm and covered a sack over them; he walked about half a dozen paces from the house, when I called Mrs. Raybott; she came down; during which time the prisoner walked away. I did not think myself authorised to take him myself; he was suffered to proceed up Holborn, he was detected in another robbery. I took the scales from him.</p>

             came to buy some articles in the shop that came to five shillings and sixpence, and when he was gone, the prisoner only gave half a crown. When any body serves the customers, we have a boy that takes the money from us; then the prisoner took eight shillings of a lady. Instead of taking the thirteen shillings and sixpence to the book, he only took ten shillings and sixpence, and only made a check of ten shillings and sixpence in the check book.</p>

He never asked me for any wages; about a fortnight before this I asked him if he wanted any money; he said money was acceptable at all times; I meaned to pay him that week he was taken up. I have paid all my servants wages up to Midsummer.</p>

               <p>Q. How much marked money did you miss - A. Thirteen pence from the till in my bar; the prisoner lived servant with me. I observed the prisoner go up stairs: I asked a person in the house to go up stairs and hear if he was counting money, and when the prisoner came down stairs I perceived he had something bulky in his pocket; he was going out of doors and I stopped him; I desired him to walk in. I felt his pockets, I found he had money in them; I sent for a constable, I had him searched, I found upon him fourteen shillings and eight pence; amongst that money there was thirteen pence that I marked the over night.</p>

               <p>Q. State to the court what was the duty of the prisoner in that house in regard to his receiving of money - A. He was to bring the money into me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deal with the customers that came to the house - A. Yes, and then they pay it over to me; it is the general custom of people who have the goods; they receive the goods of him, and pay the money over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of receiving the money for goods - A. If there was no person in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. It I had come to the house and received glue, and paid for it, what must be done with the money - A. It must be brought in to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to that book, 27th July, and tell me whether he entered on the 27th of July, an hundred weight of glue sold to Messrs. Hiscock and co. - A. There is no mention of the article.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he give you any other entry - A. On the 28th of July there is an entry of ten gallons of train oil and one gallon, two pounds and a half, of neat's foot oil, sold to Messrs. Hiscock.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is an entry of a contract made by him, in which he had taken the money and delivered the goods - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner then frequently in the habit of selling goods and taking the money - A. If nobody else was in the way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. It is your duty generally to receive - when you are not there the prisoner receives - A. When I am not there, there generally is another clerk. If there is no clerk there, of course he receives it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the other clerk here - A. I believe not; he was not at home on the 27th of July at half past two o'clock in the afternoon, because I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you dine - A. At two o'clock, or half past one; I stay about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are not there, is it not customary to put the money on the inkstand - A. No; I never found any laid on the desk, nor on the inkstand, since I have been in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person receives money, who has not the key of the place where the money is deposited, he would lay it down till you came in - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that could not have happened - A. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Was you in the house during the whole of the transaction with Messrs. Hiscock's porter - A. I was in and out; I never received the money for the glue that was paid to the prisoner.</p>

If he receives any money he is to give it to Mr. Thompson, but the account of goods sold, he is to give it to any body in the acompting house. He was as clerk in our accompting house till I became very unsettled with a warehouseman; we then took him in as warehouseman; we took him in warehouseman from the very situation that Mr. Thompson now has.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible that he could be ignorant or the duty of your house - A. No, we took him in warehouseman, because he knew the whole duty of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any examination take place of the prisoner in the accompting house. did you threaten him or promise him any favour - A. We neither threatened him or promised him, we charged him with the fact; he at first denied it. It was in the middle of August that we apprehended him, he was examined by us on the Thursday, the day he was apprehended; we charged him with having taken the money for this hundred weight of glue, he denied it; in consequence of which I believe myself said, we had evidence and could prove the fact; he then stated that he had received the money, and hoped we would let him go, he would do any thing that we wished; he desired me to intercede with my father and not to prosecute him; my father said as he had sent for a constable he could not let it pass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Your warehouseman was authorised to bargain for goods and receive the money if they were paid for - A. He might receive the money; any person might receive money except the porters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was not he entrusted to receive money in your business to the greatest extent - A. I put him in the warehouse because I thought he was confidential.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen that if money was not brought in one day it was brought in afterwards - A. It was not allowed; if it had happened I certainly should have reprimanded them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Has this money ever been paid to you or to any of your firm - A. It has not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Has the money ever been offered to you or any of your servants - A. It has not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can only say, as I said before the sitting alderman, that I certainly did receive the money, and there I placed it, I believe I have witnesses in the court that will prove that the accompting house as been left for a long time in a day, if you will please to hear them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he use to come to watch - A. At six o'clock in the evening, when the men left work; there was one of the men and me removing a frame in which we put the soap in the manufactory; the man perceived a cake of soap, he pointed it out to me; it was concealed; it weighs about three pound; on seeing the soap in this place, I put a piece of tobacco pipe in one end, I thrust it quite in so as it could not be perceived, and then I put it where I found it; this was in the morning; we let it lay there till the evening, at six o'clock, when the men went away, we looked and it was there, the men were all gone away; and only the prisoner was on the premises, who was to watch. I saw the soap again at the Mansion house, with the tobacco pipe in it.</p>

On Thursday, the 26th of July, I went to Mr. Kent and Montague's, West street, West Smithfield, and waited there till the evening when the prisoner came to watch; about six o'clock he came on duty, I took him in custody; I asked him where he lived; he told me, No, 6, Vine court, Moor lane; I took him to his lodgings with me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140050"/>on searching his lodgings, in a large chest I found this cake of soap among his wearing apparel; I was present when Dallison examined the soap before the lord mayor; he said it was his master's soap.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoner a lanthorn and a great coat - A. Yes, that was in my box inside of the gate; we usually hang them there. On the 11th of September the prisoner came soon after nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. After the coat had been taken away, did you make any observation - A. No, we stood talking together till between ten and eleven o'clock, then I went inside; I found some loose tea scattered on the step going into the box; I went and asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of it, he said no, he did not; I asked him to come and look at it, he came in, he said he knew nothing of it. After that I made an excuse to go to the outside box belonging to him; I put my hand in at the bottom of the box, there I found a bag containing six pounds four ounces of tea; I kept the bag in my possession till the morning; the first person I shewed it to was Mr. Barber, the elder. When I found the bag he desired I would say nothing about it; I asked him how he came by it, he said he got it out of the cellar: he still begged very hard for his family's sake that I would say nothing about it, and wished to throw it away; I said I would do no such thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. How long have you worked there - A. For fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you worked for them the last year - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been out of their service at all - A. I was, for a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days do you call a few days - A. I was absent for five days.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask leave of absence - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you suspended for your misconduct - A. I was suspended.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you hang back - I know you was suspended, and I know what you are after - when was you restored last - A. I cannot say the exact day.</p>
               <p>Q. You petitioned the company, and you was restored - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your duty is to watch at the gate, and to see that no man takes any thing away - A. I only am to watch a particular set of men.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that if you see a man take any thing away that belongs to the company, you are not to stop that man - A. If I see him, to be sure I am to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner been in your warehouse - A. Twelve or thirteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you can tell me that he has not been suspended - you know you have been - A. I have been, I do not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do the men leave the warehouse - A. At three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on Sunday evening it was discovered - your box is inside, his outside - did you ever hear of any man taking tea of the Saturday night, and letting it be till eleven o'clock on Sunday night before he took it away - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any man convey any thing out of the warehouse without being the subject of examination - does it not require great dexterity to escape detection, as they are rubbed down when they come out - A. Yes; one would think it impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. And still carrying out six pounds four ounces, which is a large quantity, must not a man be discovered if he had that quantity - A. I suppose he must.</p>
               <p>Q. You had this notable confession, that he took it out of the cellar - A. He confessed it to me himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else heard it but you - what have you been suspended for - A. A person passed unnoticed by me, who had a little coffee and tea.</p>

               <p>Q. to Dothie. Had the prisoner any thing with him when he came on duty - A. I saw him throw a basket down by the gate inside.</p>
               <p>Barber. I saw a chest that was brought up from the cellar, it appeared to be plundered, the lead was torn; I compared the tea in the chest with the tea in the bag, it corresponded with some of the tea, it is not all of the same sort.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had this chest the appearance of a broken chest, or of a plundered chest - A. It had all the appearance of a plundered chest, it had not the appearance of being damaged by a tall.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this quantity of tea - A. One guinea; the major part of the tea in the bag appears to be of the same quality as that in the chest. I have a sample of each.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Is it possible for any human being without connivance with the man at the gate, that it could be carried out - A. It is possible that it might be carried in the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Suppose a man got it out of the warehouse in his great coat, and got it into the yard, could not he take it into his watch box - A. Certainly.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody; she had been searched before I came to her; as I was taking her in to a little room along with Mrs. Thompson, she dropped a key, I picked it up; going a little further she dropped four more, in a handkerchief, I picked them up; I searched her and found no more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you try the keys to any drawers in the house - A. I did; this small key that she dropped, opened the till in the accompting house, and two of the four keys that were in the handkerchief, opened the drawers where the linen was; this bunch of keys were delivered to me by Mrs. Thompson; this key opens the ward robe. This property when I went into the room, where the young woman was, was laying on the floor.</p>
               <p>MRS. THOMPSON. Q. You are the wife of Mr. Thompson, who is in the employ of Slack and co. cotton merchants, Newgate street - A. Yes.</p>

I did; I went into the two pair of stairs back room, I put my hand on the bed, I felt something hard; I took from between the leather bed and matress a handkerchief, a soup ladle, two tureen ladles, two salt spoons, and four tea spoons; the whole of the plate and the linen belongs to Mr. Crabtree; I took the prisoner up stairs, I asked her if it was her handkerchief: she said it was, and she put it there, she informed me she found them in the garret; we then went up stairs into a bed room, her box was unlocked; I found there a bunch of keys; these are they keys I found in her box; then I searched her person.</p>
               <p>JURY. Have you duplicate keys - A. No; she said these were her own keys; all the linen is Mr. Crabtree's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did you search her person - A. Yes, in her pocket I found Mr. Crabtree's key, and a mourning gold ring. I am certain it is Mr. Crabtree's, his mother's name is on it; when I found these spoons the warehouseman and I were in the room with her; I wanted her to tell me where she had put the table spoons: I believe I told her it would be better for her if she did tell.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what she told you did you go any where - A. The constable did, he went with her. I afterwards saw half a dozen silver table spoons and a gravy spoon, that was the property of Mr. Crabtree.</p>
               <p>Q. to Woodman. In consequence of what this unhappy girl said did you go any where - A. I went to Mr. Cotterill's, in Aldersgate street, a pawnbroker; she went into the shop with me, she asked for two spoons; the pawnbroker produced them. She went with me to Mr. Parker's, Fleet street, there she asked for four table spoons; they shewed us them; I told them I believed the ticket was done away with; she said nothing of the gravy spoon, it was at Mr. Parker's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In an agony of mind, too great to be described, I venture to address your lordship, most numbly entreating your pardon. - Conscious of my inability to speak at this awful moment, I have delivered in this paper, not that I have ought to say as an extenuation of a conduct so faulty as mine has been. Alas! my lord, I am a poor unfortunate girl, whose character never till this sad-business was called in question; I am almost sinking in shame and remorse for the disgrace I have brought, not only on myself, but my poor afflicted parents, who are hard working people. I fear unless your lordship compassionates my unhappy case, I shall be lost for ever. I can assure your lordship that it was done more from youth and inexperience than from depravity of heart. I did not till too late reflect seriously on the consequence of my crime, and though others may forgive me I cannot forgive myself, and the only conduct now in my power is to bear with due resignation the punishment that may await me. I have been unfairly dealt with; for on my confession I was promised a pardon, and that no officer of Justice should be sent for; in simplicity I did so, most candidly, and on my knees I begged forgiveness. I was placed in confinement. - To your consideration and humanity do I submit myself, and should I be so fortunate to regain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140052"/>my liberty, no temptation, however strong, shall induce me to do wrong.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. You are a constable - A. Yes. On the 31st of August, I got a warrant from Justice Anderson, at Belfound; I found Jacobs at the Bell at Hounslow, he was in the street when I took him; I asked him if he had not got Mr. Warren's watch, he would not answer me for a long time; the prosecutor was by me at the time; he at last said, I should not have it, he would go before the magistrate and deliver it to him; I then said I must search him; he then took it out of his right hand breeches pocket and showed it to Mr. Warren; Mr. Warren said it was his watch; Jacobs then put it in his pocket and said he would deliver it up before the magistrate; he said he bought it of a soldier Wroasmain was brought down from the bar racks to me; Mr. Warren asked Jacobs if that was the man that he bought it of; he said no, that was not the man, but the servant girl could tell the man; the girl was called; she said the soldier was the man that was with him; Wroasmain denied it, and said that he never had a watch. On my taking them to magistrate, they were quarrelling all the way, the soldier still denied that he ever sold him the watch; I took them before the magistrate and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. I will ask you whether Jacobs ever denied from first to last that he had the possession of the watch - A. He never denied that he had the watch, but he refused to show me the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he alledge he thought he had no right to deliver it to you, the constable, but that he ought to deliver it up to the justice - A. Yes, and before the justice he said he should deliver it directly.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Wroasmain's Defence. I went into the Bell public house to ask for one of my comrades. I could not see him; I called for a pint of beer; I went to light my pipe in the kitchen, a man stood with a watch in his hand, I asked him what o'clock it was, he told me it wanted twenty minutes to nine o'clock. I lighted my pipe and went home to the barracks and was there at roll call.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say you went in accidentally and you asked Jacobs, who stood there, what o'clock it was - A. Yes; but I could not say it was Jacobs.</p>
               <p>Jacobs' Defence. I bought this watch for a pinchback watch; in the morning I found it was a gold watch.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. You keep this Bell public house at Hounslow - Do you know the Jew - A. I have seen him at my house several times, he was a lodger at times. On the 30th of August he slept at my house. On the 31st I came down stairs at six o'clock in the morning, he stood in the passage, he asked me if the servant maid Fanny was getting up; I asked him what he wanted with her; he said he had bought a watch the night before too cheap, he would not wish to keep it; the watch was worth thirty-six guineas. A quarter master, Mr. Charters, lodged opposite, that belonged to the regiment; I called him over the way and informed him what the Jew had told me, that he bought it of one of his men; Jacobs produced the watch to the quarter master, the quarter master asked him if he knew the man that he bought it of; he said he did not, but referred him to the servant girl Fanny. Fanny told the quarter master she knew the soldier by sight, she had seen him at our house along with a farrier of the regiment. The prisoner Wroasmain was sent for to the public house; Jacob, went away from my house that morning, he said he was going to Twickenham, he would return at five o'clock in the evening; he offered to leave the watch in my possession; I refused. I was fearful of taking charge of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You advised him not to deliver it up but before a magistrate - A. I did.</p>

            . Q. Are you quarter master of the regiment - A. I am. I was sent for by Mr. Gilbert to come over to his house; Jacobs produced the watch to me as Mr. Gilbert has described; I told him that I should go up to the barracks to make enquiries about it; he was very desirous I should; he said he was going in the country; he would be back by five o'clock in the 
evening.</p>


               <p>COURT. Did you hear him offer to leave the watch with Mr. Gilbert. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was it possible for a man to take that watch, chain, and seal into his hand and not to know it was gold - A. I should suppose he must know from the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire him not to go away till the fact was enquired into - A. I did; I desired him to go to the barracks; he did not go; he said he would return in the evening and deliver it up to a justice.</p>
               <p>Jacobs called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 30th of August, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I lost nine shillings and sixpence from my pocket; it was loose in my waistcoat pocket; I cannot say how it was taken; I was going home, through Broad place, near Petticoat lane, there were two boys fighting, and there was a mob standing there. I did not miss the money till I came home; about half an hour before my money was safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for changing the prisoner with taking the money - A. I do not charge the prisoner; I never saw him before he was apprehended; I did not perceive him take it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to believe you lost it in Broad place - A. There was a mob there; I stopped to see the boys fight; I passed through the mob. When the prisoner was taken to the office, nine shillings and six pence was found upon him; and a shilling and a sixpence, I believe to be the same I had.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were in this mob did you perceive any person pushing against you or hustling of you - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that after Lear had been in the crowd - A. Yes; he was going towards home then.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he close enough to have put his hand into Mr. Lear's pocket - A. I did not see him close enough to do that; I did not keep my eye upon Mr. Lear the whole time; I was not in the mob, I was standing upon the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the prisoner to Mr. Lear at the time he stood between Mr. Lear and the other man - A. About a yard and a half; when I heard the prisoner say to the other boy, I have made a good job, I did not know that Mr. Lear's pocket had been picked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after the time that you saw the boy within a yard of Mr. Lear, that you heard him say that he had made a good job of it - A. Yes, after that time; in about a quarter of an hour after I heard that Mr. Lear had lost his money, when he came away from there he said he had lost his money, nine shillings and sixpence; just when he got home, I said I thought I knew who had it; we went to look after the boy; we found him and Mr. Lear laid hold of him; Mr. Lear asked him if he would give him his money, or he would take him before a justice; they boy said he would go with him, and he did; I am sure he is the boy who was standing near Mr. Lear.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer - A. Yes. On the 30th of August Mr. Lear brought the prisoner to the public office, Whitechapel; he said he had picked his pocket of nine shillings and sixpence; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140054"/>the prisoner if he had any money about him, he said he had; I searched his pockets, I found nine shillings and sixpence, he said it was his own money; I asked Mr. Lear if he had any other witness, he said he had; he came in the evening with this lad with him: I shewed Mr. Lear the money; he spoke to one shilling and a sixpence, which I have kept separate ever since. I took the prisoner before the magistrate, there Mr. Lear claimed the shilling and sixpence as his own; - the prisoner said they were his own.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that shilling and sixpence - A. I believe it to be the same money that I had in my pocket; there are two marks on the sixpence, and a mark on the shilling; I recollected them by the mark, and I had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going of an errand with ten shillings and a penny for my father to Winfield street. I will take my oath that I never saw him before he laid hold of me in my life; I said do not collar me, I shall go with you.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in the charge of that house on the 8th of September - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you make secure the fastenings of the house that night - A. About four o'clock in the afternoon I shut up the door and the windows, and made them safe. I staid in the house till about seven o'clock; I went out then, having left the house secured; I returned between the hours of eleven and twelve o'clock the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then find the house secure as to all its fastenings - A. Yes, I found it the same as I left it. I opened the door and went in, and locked the door. I put the chain on it; I went up stairs strait forward up in the room as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your room - A. The right hand garret. I went strait forward in the room, and pulled the sash down; I returned back to the bed side, I pulled my coat and waistcoat off, and my handkerchief and shoes; I saw the blankets and the matress disturbed to what I left it in the morning; I said to myself, I did not leave them things in this manner; I turned round and touched the latch of the other garret; I had the latch in my hand; the prisoner at the bar catched hold of my collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he - A. He was between the doors of the two garrets. He immediately laid hold of my collar; I said Lord have mercy upon me; the prisoner said do not speak a word sir, lye down on the bed, that is all you have got to do; then he shoved me on my breast to the bed, sideways, and threw me on the bed; he stood over me, and the other man behind him, whom he called Joseph; he said Joseph, d - n him, fetch the pistol and we will blow his brains out, he will not lye still; with that I said to myself, if I must be shot, I must be shot, I then gave him a shove and darted to the window; then I received a blow on my head immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was it from the same man who had hold of you and pushed you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was the same man, and not the man who stood behind - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you got to the window then - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That was before you got to the window then - A. Yes. I fell towards the window, and as I fell I lifted up the sash; with that I put my head out of the window and halloed out murder, as loud as I could; the people below halloed out come down and open the door; I halloed out I would, as quick as I could; I did, I unbolted the top bolt and unchained it, and the people outside shoving the door so violently to get in, they shoved me down, they knocked me backwards; the persons that were coming to my assistance did that; I got up and went to the door, and while I stood there there was the prisoner standing; the watchman had got him, he was outside of the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. You saw the prisoner in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are certain it was the prisoner - A. Yes; I knew him directly. I said to him, you rascal, you are the man that hit me on the head; he never spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a blow was it - what effect did it produce - A. It was with a very heavy crow, I could not tell what it was done with; the constable found it was done with an iron crow: I bled very much and it made me very faint.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been attended by a surgeon ever since - A. The surgeon is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you well yet - A No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look round at the prisoner at the bar, and tell me whether you have any doubt that he is the person - look at him stedfast, with caution and deliberation - A. That is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon earth that he is the man - A. That is the man.</p>
               <p>COURT You have no doubt about it - A. I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The other person has not been apprehended - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you recollect his person - A. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you take particular notice of this man so as to enable you to speak in the way you do - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a moon light night - A. It was, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was standing over you when you laid on the bed - A. Yes, when I laid on the edge of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was his face towards you - A. Within about a foot, or a foot and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the moon so bright that it gave you an opportunity of knowing him by his face - A. I could not tell the face of the person then, not till I come down stairs; he had on an apron then, and he had when I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you entertain no doubt at all about his person - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his speech at all - A. I took notice of that; I could not observe his clothes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was his voice particular - A. I noticed his voice, when he d - d me, and called for the pistol to shoot me, and as the door was opening I heard him speak in the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the voice that you heard in the area correspond with the voice that you heard when he used violence to your person - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew him by person and by voice - A. I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. I believe, if I understand you right, you have not the least doubt of his person - A. No, I have not.</p>

On the 8th of September, about hall past eleven or near twelve o'clock at night, I heard a cry of murder several times repeated; on going into the street I perceived it appeared at the front garret of No. 20; several persons called out to the man who was crying, can you let us into the house; he said I am bleeding to death, I cannot come down, for they will murder me. Four or five of the strongest people began to kick against the door in order to break it open: while they were doing this, a man appeared behind the area, within the rails; he got over them and jumped down in the street; immediately I supposed him to be one of the persons belonging to the house: I laid my hands upon him, and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140056"/>what have they been doing to you; he said they wanted to murder the man that is in the house; I then said who the devil are you; he made no answer to that as I heard, and he was therefore seized by a number of people, among whom I was one, and

            . Q. You are a constable of that parish - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being brought to your watchhouse - A. I was not there when he was brought to the watchhouse. I went there about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any crow - A. Immediately I heard the prisoner was brought to the watchhouse, I went to the house, No. 20, Manchester square; I went down in the kitchen, there I saw Waller sitting in the chair, the surgeon was dressing the wounds; I said his head was not cut with a stick when I looked at it; I thought it was cut with an iron crow, or some sharp steel instrument. I then took the candle to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to the house - A. About a quarter after twelve; I went up stairs to see if there was any iron crow; on the two pair of stairs window I found this iron crow; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the watchhouse - A. Not till eight o'clock the next morning, then I saw the prisoner; I said he was in a pretty predicament; he said he could not help it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. I have seen him before; I asked him how he came by the picklock keys; he told me he picked them up in a little bag in the passage that comes out in the area below; I saw the picklock keys at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that crow - is there any mark on the crow - A. I wrote my own name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the red mark - A. I did not perceive this rust.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a little blood on it. - A. I think it is rust.</p>
               <p>JURY. It is blood.</p>
               <p>Howard. He said he found the keys in the passage in a bag, he took them out of the bag and put them in his pocket, he did not know what they was; I asked him whether the snuffers was in the bag; he made no answer whatever; I heard there was a pair of snuffers found upon him.</p>

               <p>Q. How deep was it - A. About the eighth part of an inch; it was no considerable depth; it was at the back of the head.</p>

               <p>Q. Were your sober - A. I was as sober as I am now; I had my money that I was paid off at Portsmouth; the notes were rolled up in this handkerchief, and the handkerchief was round my waist, and tied behind me; I went home to her lodgings in upper East Smithfield; she said she was in distress and she had no bed; I took the handkerchief off and gave her a Portsmouth one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did your handkerchief contain - A. Nine five pound bank notes, two Portsmouth one pound notes, and a Plymouth note for two pound; when I gave her the Portsmouth one pound note, I told her to buy a bed; and after the gin was drank I went to her lodgings; I sat down in the chair and we talked together for five minutes, she took my handkerchief off; I did not think she had any bad design, I thought it was kindness; she turned her back to me and took all the notes, and heaved the handkerchief into my hat; she went down stairs; I called after her and asked her where she was going; she said she would be back directly; I waited for about three minutes, I observed my handkerchief in my hat, and the notes were gone; I run down stairs and went to the Three Crowns and the other public house; I could not find her; I got an officer, and we met her in the street the next morning and took her into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any part of your notes - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Did not you make up a hasty marriage with her, and did not you propose to find money to furnish a room and live with her - A. I did not do any such thing.</p>

On the 25th of August, between one and two o'clock in the day, the prosecutor asked me if I could furnish him with some second hand blankets, and he said they wanted sheets; I had no more than one; the prosecutor said never mind, we must make one do; after they bought them the prisoner gave me a country one pound note; I refused it; he then gave me a one pound bank note.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I remember this shop very well: she had no more than a pound and one shilling, it was a Portsmouth note. I went there before I went to the Ship in Distress; when I left this shop I went to the Ship in Distress, there I gave her a two pound note; the woman that came here first bears an extraordinary bad character, and by all accounts she has deposited this money in that woman's hands.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel.</p>

About eight o'clock on the 10th of August he got up, he breakfasted and asked my leave to go and lay down again, he said he was poorly; I consented to it. Between ten and eleven o'clock I was coming out of the tap room. I met him just by the bar door, as he was coming from the stair foot; I thought he looked bigger than when he went up, his right hand pocket stuck out; I told him I thought he had something more than his own; he said he had not; I pulled out of his right hand coat pocket a shirt; he pulled out a pair of trowsers and a relief card, which this young man was relieved at my house, by the society of cork cutters; when they travel to town they give them so much money. Three handkerchiefs and a waistcoat was bound round his body; he was then taken in custody; I sent for Lewis, he claimed the things.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he answer you so as you could understand him - A. Yes, in very good English. I then desired him to come out of the church; he came immediately into the church yard; I told him he should not go till I saw what he had got; he said he had nothing but apples and pears; I put my hand round his waist. I saw something white; he had a turkian dress on; I pulled a surplice from him. I searched him round again and found apples and pears; after he was taken to the Compter I found two more surplices in the vestry, besides the one he had taken; there were three when I left the vestry, about a quarter of an hour before; there was one missing; I can swear to the surplice, I always attend the clergyman to take it off; I have no doubt it was one of the surplices belonging to the church. I have been sextoness four years.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. What are you - A. I live in Bell lane, Spital fields; I have known the prisoner eight years, he is a good sort of a man; I never heard any thing against his character.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get his livelihood - A. By working as a tailor. About two years ago he received news from Gibraltar that his friends all died in the flames; that turned his head rather lunatic; he said his friends had left him some money in Gibraltar, and he would go and fetch it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, after he had received this intelligence with respect to the loss of all his family, that he possessed his senses - A. I am certain it turned his head; I had constant opportunity of seeing it; he used to go out for five or six nights, and his wife did not know where to find him; he has been brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140060"/>home by a parcel of boys several times, with a rope tied round his waist; this sort of conduct happened down to three weeks of his apprehension. I saw him on the Saturday previous to his apprehension on the Sunday; he was then very melancholy, and said he would go to Gibraltar, he thought there was money there; I saw him on the Monday after; I asked him if he knew me, he said he knew nothing of me.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 1st of July had you received a note from Mr. Noone - A. I had, about ten o'clock; Mr. Noone lived in the duchess's house. In the course of the day I put the note in my left hand breeches pocket: I had two shillings and a sixpence in that pocket. At one o'clock I went to the prisoner's house to get a pot of beer, I had my child upon my arm, I stood by the side of the bar; when I was served with the beer I paid the prisoner; I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out a sixpence, which was refused; when I took out the sixpence I felt the note then; I put my hand in my pocket and took out a shilling and got the change; went strait home with the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you got home did you discover that you had lost the note - A. About half an hour after I put my hand in my pocket, I found I had lost my note; I went back to the public house, I saw the prisoner and his wife; I said to them have you picked up a ten pound bank of England note, they said they had not seen any thing of it; I said I was afraid I had pulled it out of my pocket as I took the money out for the beer, as I had been to nowhere else; I said I will thank you to be doubly cautious for whom you change a ten pound note, and I will bring you the number tomorrow. On the 2nd of July I took the number before one o'clock, I gave him the number in writing, he took and chalked it up in the bar, I saw he put up the right number; I said now Mr. Davidson I will have this note advertised and offer a guinea reward for it, to be brought to his house, and I desired him to pay the guinea, which he said he would; I applied to him every day for a fortnight, to know if he heard any thing about it. I had notice from the bank; I had been to the bank for them to stop it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the number, did it tally with the number you gave to the prisoner - A. It did; I went to his house and produced the note that I got from the bank; the prisoner examined it, and said true enough, that is the number of the note you gave me; I said it was very odd that I had traced the note back to the very place that I lost it; he said he did not know how he came by it, he had taken it, but he did not know how he had taken it. I thought it a hard case that he should not know from whom he had taken the note, as he had the number chalked up in his bar. On the Sunday following I asked him whether he had found out who he took the note of, he said he did not know. On the Wednesday following of the Sunday, I said have you heard any thing more concerning of my note, meaning who he took it of; he said no; his wife said you should proceed farther in it; I said I will; - in consequence of that I went to Marlborough street, and an examination took place.</p>

I then could find no watch; I then ordered my young man to search him; I was by when he searched him, he could find nothing upon him; I then called in one of his countrymen that was in the street, he could speak his language and could speak English; he searched him, and could not find any thing. I told him to tell him what he had done; he still denied having the watch, I then sent for an officer.</p>

            . I am a constable. About one o'clock I arrived at the prosecutor's shop; when I took the prisoner into the back room he would strip himself naked, he would not allow me to search him with his clothes on. I insisted upon his putting his trowsers on for decency's sake; when he was putting his trowsers on I saw the pendant of the watch in his hand, his hand was inside of the trowsers; on my seeing the watch, he let the watch fall through the trowsers, and it come out on the floor and broke the glass. I have kept the watch in my custody ever since. All the property he had about him was two shillings and four new half pence; the two shillings was tied up in the corner of his neck handkerchief.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Mead at the Red Lion public house. On Saturday the 3d of September, about one o'clock, the prosecutor came in; he had a bundle with him, he was not sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner being at your house at that time - A. Yes, he was in the same box with the prosecutor, he was drinking with the prisoner, and there were two or three girls about; the prosecutor fell asleep, he awoke about half past four; I missed the bundle belonging to the prosecutor when I wiped down the table; before he awoke I had a suspicion of the last man that went out, he being in the box. I ran to the door, I saw the prisoner walking up the lane, I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; he said d - n you, what is that to you; he said the bundle belonged to his brother. I brought him back to the house, the prosecutor was asleep, he was too drunk to give any account of himself; we could not find whether he was his brother or no; we let the prisoner go. When the prosecutor awoke he said he was robbed; I said you are not robbed, I have got the bundle; he said he had lost all his money; when I shewed him the things he knew them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up - A. On the Sunday morning. The prisoner would have choaked me provided there had not been people in the house to take me away from him. I have kept the things ever since.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in this gentleman's house on Saturday when this man came in, he got tossing with three idle women; he asked me to have a glass of liquor with him; he asked me to look after the bundle; I told him while I was in the way I would look to it; I wanted some tobacco, I went to the chandler's shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140062"/>next door; this young man came up and said what have you got there; I said I would deliver the bundle to the man when he awoke; he took away the bundle from me and turned me out of the house: the next day I was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I came into the box I had three pounds eleven shillings; I had been at harvest work.</p>

I was, on the 23rd of July; in consequence of what I heard my suspicion fell on the prisoner; I was determined to watch him at the finishing of the work that day; he went down the mint, towards the stone kitchen; the moment he turned down the stone kitchen he ran very fast; I was obliged to run very fast to get sight of him; he run very fast till he got into the Minories; I followed him into Whitechapel, attended by Bishop the officer; there we took him and put him into an Hackney coach; I told him we took him on suspicion that he had been robbing the mint; he said he could not help it; I then asked him if he had got any pieces of money about him that they had been coining that day; he said, no, he had not; Bishop searched him, took off his shoes and hat; we could not find any thing of that sort about him at that time; I then desired him to take him to the office, Worship street; while Armstrong and I went to search his house.</p>

I missed a great many things at different times, I never suspected her of taking them; I wanted my gown to put on, I asked her for it; she told me she had forgot to wash it, and she had given it a woman to wash. I went to the woman and asked her if she had got the gown; the woman hesitated to tell whether she had it or not, at last she said the prisoner had been to her and told her that she had forgot to wash it, that she had left it in a tub; she told her, to tell me that she had got it. I then asked the prisoner for the key of her room; she refused to give it me; my husband insisted upon her giving it him. When she was going to give it him, she pulled out something from her pocket and put it into her stays; my husband took hold of her hands and told me to feel in her pocket; I took out eight duplicates of the things that I have got; she absconded; she was afterwards taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner, before - A. I never saw either of them before I saw them in that house; there were some indifferent women in my company; the prisoner Brown came and abused me; I called for some liquor for the women; what it was for I do not know; I paid for it, they wanted me to go with them home; I told them I would. Brown told me he wanted to speak with me in particular; I went out with them; they got me into the Seven Stars; the landlord of that house is a German; I sat down there and treated the prisoners; the liquor overcame me. I laid my elbow on the table and clapped my hand to my head, and fell asleep; when I awoke I asked the landlord if I owed any thing in the house, he said no; I put my hand in my pocket, I could not find a farthing. I had the pocket book in my pocket; but the note and money were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was gone out of it - A. A five pound note, half a guinea, a seven shilling piece, a shilling, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>- THOMPSON. I am a caulker. The first time I saw Mr. Glynn was at the Black Horse; he and Brown were together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Brown - A. I had seen him the day before. We had something to drink there; then the prisoner, prosecutor, and me, went to the Bee Hive, there we had half a pint of gin between us; we went from there to the Seven Stars, we had there a pot of ale and some gin; the prosecutor was pretty drunk; it was between five and six o'clock when we were in the Seven Stars; this Brown set of one side of the prosecutor, and the girl at the bar sat on the other side of him; she got up and took a seven shilling piece and a shilling out of his pocket, and he pulled his watch out; I got up and told the landlord of it; I went out backwards, and when I came in again Glynn was gone out of the house; directly I went to the Black Horse after him, and told him he was robbed; he was drunk and did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober - A. I was disguised in liquor, but fresher than he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present and saw this watch and money taken from him publicly - A. Yes; there were eight or nine girls in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see it - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of it been found - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the watch after he took it out of his pocket - A. I do not know, I am sure, I saw him take it.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the next day, on the Wednesday; on searching him I found a bank of England note, two seven shilling pieces, five shillings and sixpence in silver, and a few halfpence. I asked him how he became possessed of this bank note, he told me he took it for a run down voyage to Gravesend. On my looking at the note I found it was not issued from the bank at the time he stated. The next day he said that he had taken the note from his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Rotherhithe Wall from Nightingale lane - A. It is the other side of the water.</p>
               <p>Q. When you searched him, did you find any watch about him - A. No, none at all.</p>

I brought him back some distance; he then begged I would not hold him by the collar; I told him I would not if he would go quietly along; he then threw the tools down and ran down the street and I after him; I catched him at the bottom of the street; I went back with him to take the tools up. The constable of the district was coming past at the time, he took the tools in his possession; he told me if I would let him go he would tell me where he took them from.

               <p>Q. Why, if your cart was two or three yards off,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140067"/>your cart must be near to them. Now this was not in Goswell street - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you subpoenaed on the trial of Tollson and Lebeck - A. No, I was not; I did not attend before the grand jury.</p>
               <p>Q. You were upon good terms with the defendant - A. I never changed a shilling with him; I was neither upon good terms or bad terms with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in short, you were upon good terms - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it happened that he arrested a friend of yours of the name of Williams - A. He was no friend of mine; he was a man I knew; that was on Friday the 13th.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you sworn that it was the 14th - A. He was arrested in the city of London on the 14th, and on the 13th; I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear that you saw him at the Rose in the Old Bailey; is not that the fact; attend sir; because you know Williams was arrested on that day, that is the reason you know it was the 14th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Give a plain answer to a question - is that your reason for your knowing that Maybrick had arrested Williams on the 14th - A. I saw Maybrick on the 14th, and that is my reason for fixing upon that day, because Mr. Williams was arrested.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have told me that you were always upon good terms with the man; I ask you whether you did not say, because he had arrested Mr. Williams on that day, that you would put him in the pillory one day or other - A. So help me God, I never said that in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps you have never been in prison - A. I never was in Newgate a prisoner; I never went there to see the prisoner Maybrick.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in Newgate - A. Certainly, I have, but never a prisoner there; I have not been there for these twelve months, then I only went to see a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you been to the prisoner and proposed to him that if he would forego his claim in the action of Williams, you would not appear on this prosecution - A. Never, for Mr. Williams is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been indicted for perjury - A. Yes, and they never met me; it is five years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was you indicted here - A. Yes, but it was removed by a certiorari; Mr. Morley was the attorney for the prosecution; it was not-moved by my desire; Mr. Const had a brief of mine. I wish they would try the cause.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Have you ever said in Nightingale's presence, that you would put this man in the pillory - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the 14th or the 13th, that you saw the prisoner at the Rose - A. On the 14th.</p>

I was; I went to arrest Mr. Williams; I believe it was a quarter past four o'clock, I have known the defendant four, five, or six months; he was at the Fortune of War when I arrested Mr. Williams, and Mr. Swan was there a few minutes. I went to the sheriff's office to see the affidavit. Mr. Swan went with me.</p>
