Seeing him getting a little forward in liquor about two o'clock, I begged him to pay his reckoning and go home; he said he knew the company he was in, and was not afraid of being robbed; M'Coull came in about this time and called for a pint of porter, which was served to him; then the prosecutor said he had been robbed; and the two prisoners were gone out of the house.</p>

I saw the pigeons in question the night before they were missing; I locked them up myself; I feed them every day almost; they were of a particular sort; I missed them early next morning, between five and six, I lost eighteen; I have recovered seven, which I am perfectly sure are mine, and two I would not swear to. On Wednesday, the 21st of March, I recovered them at Mr. Wooller's; I am certain they were my property; I recovered two others the 7th of April, at Mr. Lowe's, Spitalfields, one of which I am certain of; I brought them home in the cages lent me, and turned them into the pigeon-house; they all resorted to their nests, particularly two of them that left their young behind; I have not the least doubt in the world. I know nothing of the prisoner; I saw him once before; he offered to sell me a dog within a fortnight from the time I lost my pigeons.</p>

               <p>I am the footman; I know these pigeons: (produced and deposed to): they were turned into the pigeon-house, and they took to their old places; I have not the least doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Miss Debonnair. They are my pigeons; they are tame; I valued the six at a guinea and a half, and a crown for the other; some of them are worth a guinea apiece.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I worked for Mr. Raike, cooper at Stratford, for twelve months. About nine or ten weeks past, I came to town, and stopped in Whitechapel Road, and there came in a person who I knew by sight; we had a pint of porter; he wanted to dispose of some pigeons which he had, and asked me to buy them; I said I could help him to a customer; I told him he might sell them in Holborn; he said he had a dispute with the man, and he thought, if he went with them himself, the man would not buy them; and if I would go and bargain with the man, he would pay me; so I went; the man bid me eleven shillings, which I took, and came away, and gave the man the money; we went to drink. On Thursday evening, he waited for me at the Swan in Brown's-lane, and told me he had seven more; and I sold three for five shillings and three-pence; so, my Lords and gentlemen of the Jury, you will consider in your own breasts, whether you think any person can with safety swear to the pigeon which is brought, which always shifts its feathers twice a year.</p>

I went to bed, I think, at twelve, on the evening of the 18th of April; I am sure my house and shop were safe; in the morning we were alarmed between four and five; when I came down, I found several of the drawers laying on the floor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230011"/>empty, and the greater part of the things gone; I had been robbed of between two and three hundred pounds; the hearth-stone had been broken of a cellar that we let to Mr. M'Cray, an oil-man; my kitchen is on the ground-floor, over Mr. M'Cray's cellar; the hearth part was arched with bricks; Mr. M'Cray has a separate entrance, quite distinct; I lost all the articles mentioned in the indictment, and I believe a good deal more; the prices are low and fair, and much under the real value; I believe I got a warrant against Cropper, from Mr. Staples, between six and seven; I went with the officer to search Cropper's house, between seven and eight o'clock that same morning; when we came to Cropper's, we saw three or four men sitting by the fire, in Cropper's house; I do not know that I knew them; we left some people with them, and Cooke an officer, and Mr. Edge, went up stairs; and I went up also, and found Cook the officer, searching Cropper's wife; I saw them take out of her pocket, a pair of silver sugar-tongs, six silver tea-spoons, and two silver shoe-buckles, which are in the indictment; I said they were my property; she was taken to the watch-house; in the soil of the necessary I found a great many chapes and tongues which had been knocked out of the silver buckles; Mr. Cropper was up stairs; they took him and the others; I staid with Mr. Edge, to search the house; Cohen, a witness, came to the window, and seeing something the matter, he ran away; I ran after him with a little iron crow which I found in the house; I took him to my house; he produced nothing at that time; I got another warrant to search his house; in his wife's pocket we found half a dozen silver tea-spoons, my property, and mentioned in the indictment; then they took Cohen's wife to the office; we found no further property; I did not see the bottle-stands found; I did not see Potts at Cropper's house; Messer I think was there, but I am not certain; Cropper was up stairs when I saw him, which was about half an hour after; I do not know it was Cropper's house; I never saw Cropper before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper. Which way did they get into the cellar? - I suppose through the door.</p>
               <p>Have you any servants that sleep in the house? - To be sure, in a room adjoining the shop; it is a long way from where they lay to where the persons got in.</p>
               <p>Court. Could this disturbance have been made in the shop, without their hearing? - I think I should have heard it; but as they went to bed late, they might not hear it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How high was the archway? - Not so high as this sounding-board.</p>
               <p>Do you think it possible that a person in my situation (being lame) could get into such a place? - The Jury must judge of that.</p>
               <p>Can you positively swear to the things that were taken out of my wife's pocket? - I can, and have, with the exception of the table-spoon.</p>

               <p>I was one of the headboroughs of Whitechapel. I went to Cropper's house before five in the morning, before Mr. Bateman went; when I came to Cropper's house, I clapped my back against the window, and heard a nicking; I stood there, and called to a publican for something to drink; his name is Moody; Cropper came by from Petticoat-lane; he spoke to me; I was at a little distance from Cropper's, about five yards off, on the same side of the way; he passed Moody's house, and then came up to me; he passed me, coming from Petticoat-lane, to go to his own house; in the doing which, he must pass me; I was calling to Moody for something to drink; Cropper said, Moody will not be up this hour and a half; I said he must get up; Cropper was alone, and went past me to his own house; it was quite day-light; as Cropper passed me, his right shoulder was dirty with dry mortar, apparently from a broken wall, as though he had squeezed through a broken brick wall; I took particular notice of that, and that his countenance fell a little; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230012"/>Cropper was in, Messer passed me with his handkerchief under his coat, and something in it, of the size of a hat-crown; he knocked at Cropper's door, and a voice within, Who is there? Messer said, It is me; the door was opened, and in he went; he returned out the same way in about two minutes; in about five minutes after, the prisoner Potts came out from Cropper's with a common corn-sack, and something in it; I followed him; when I came near to Petticoat-lane, I took it off his shoulders; I asked him what he had? he said, a few things he was going to take to market; they appeared to be such as Mr. Bateman said he had lost; they were plated goods, and some small articles in silver; I asked him where he had them, he said from Mr. Cropper; I asked him who Mr. Cropper was? he said he lived in Wentworth-street, and kept an old iron-shop; that was the house from whence he came out; I lodged him in the watch-house, and passed Cropper's, and went into Moody's; Cropper came in presently, and asked Moody for change for a 20 l. note? this might be about half past six; Moody said he could not; then he asked for change for a 10 l. note? Moody said he could not: Cropper went away, and his wife came for a kettle of water; then Mr. Bateman and two runners came to me with a warrant; and in the front parlour, by the fire, we found Mrs. Cropper, Mercer, and two men that were discharged; we handcuffed the men: Mrs. Cropper went up stairs; Cooke searched her in my presence, and found on her several silver articles: we found nothing in the house; but in the privy I found a quantity of tongues and chapes of buckles: Cohen was then taken; and in searching Mrs. Cohen, Cooke found in my presence, in her pocket, some other silver articles; they were committed the next day: Cohen delivered up the plate, and gave an account of the transaction: the things I found on Potts, I have kept ever since, sealed up: (produced and deposed to): and those that were found in the privy; a tortoiseshell tea-caddy, a plated candlestick, a plated mustard-pot, one plated salt-cellar, a plated bottle-stand, and three rims of plated buckles, with the chapes out, and a plated coffee-pot; that is all I found on Potts; these I found in the privy; I have not counted them; I think there is about three dozen; these are the buckles which Cooke took; I cannot say where he got them; he delivered them to me; they are all the rims of silver buckles; they are all broke, but all new.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper Will he take upon him to say he found those things in my necessary? - I cannot say it was his: another house opened into the same yard.</p>
               <p>Cropper. My Lord, it was open to five houses.</p>
               <p>Edge. I saw only two; there might be more.</p>
               <p>How did I behave when you and Mr. Bateman came? - With as much civility as a man could do.</p>
               <p>What sort of dirt did you see on my shoulder? - It appeared to be dry mortar, by rubbing against some place, with pressure on his right shoulder.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take me into custody? - I do not believe he had any thing about him; nothing appeared to me, and I did not think it prudent.</p>

               <p>I am one of the headboroughs. I went to Cropper's house with Mr. Bateman, on the 19th of April last, between five and six in the morning, with Bateman, Edge, and West: there were three men in the house; Messer was one; the other two were discharged: on Mrs. Cropper I found this property; six silver tea-spoons, new, tied together, one pair of silver sugar-tongs, two odd silver shoe-buckles, new; I took them to Justice Staples; but before that, in came Cropper, and I asked him if he had any thing about him? he said he had only a 25 l. bank note, and three or four guineas in gold; this was the bank note; I left it in the care of the magistrate, and took the No. 3997, in two places; this is my memorandum of the number; then I took them to a public house near; Cropper, his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230013"/>wife and others; I searched further at Cropper's, and found nothing: I went to Cohen's, and in Mr. Cohen's pocket I found six silver tea spoons, new; I saw them sealed up and left in the care of the magistrate; I am certain they are the same: the prosecutor, Mr. Edge, and some other gentlemen, were present; I found nothing else: Cohen gave in this parcel in the afternoon of that day, which has been with the magistrate ever since; here is my writing on it: these are table spoons, tea spoons, several sugar tongs, a boatswain's whistle, all new, and the other bundle which I gave to Edge, containing rims of silver buckles; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper. What sort of dirt had I on my waistcoat and coat, which the justice asked me about, a kind of spots? - I do not recollect it.</p>

               <p>Did not I take both you and Mr. Bateman and Mr. Edgehall about the house, and shew you the loft? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the time he was white washing his room was he in his coat or his waistcoat? - I believe he was in his waistcoat, but I cannot recollect; I had no business with him.</p>

Had the appearance of the right shoulder of his coat, when he passed you, the appearance which could be occasioned by wet mortar from the brush of a white washer, or what you described before? - It had not the appearance of wet mortar, but of dry mortar rubbed on; I did not observe the spots on the waistcoat.</p>

I live in Wentworth-street, No. 126, some doors from him; he came and brought me that silver, and said Mr. Cohen, I must have thirty pounds; so I just looked in; I saw there were buckles and spoons; and I went up stairs and took the plate, and brought him down a twenty-five pounds bank note, and five guineas in gold; I said to him, Mr. Cropper, does this come to thirty pounds? he said, whether it comes to thirty pounds or not I shall bring you some more goods, and then we will settle; before he went away I asked him how long he would be before he brought the other goods? he said he would not be long; then in half an hour or three quarters, Mr. Cropper did not come, and I went to his house; I knocked at the door, which was shut; the window was half shut; some girl said, you cannot come in; I went away, and Mr. Bateman came after me and took me; then I went to Mr. Bateman's house; and when I came to the justice I told him I desired to be sworn in, and I delivered them up; the silver found on my wife she took out of the number; I was angry with her for taking them, because we had not settled; there was some red ink writing on the bank note, and my name in Hebrew characters; I had bought goods very often before of Mr. Cropper, all sorts of goods; I am a pretty general dealer; they were only fit for the melting pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper. In what manner do you buy silver? - I gave him always four shillings and sixpence an ounce before: there was no bargain about this: I saw nobody besides him: he brought it and said, here is some silver, and I must have thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>How long is it ago since you was tried at this bar? - About four years and a half.</p>
               <p>What was you tried for? - For stealing of pots: I was never in goal: I was indicted and surrendered.</p>
               <p>Your wife was convicted. Was you ever an evidence against a man and his wife at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230014"/>Hicks's Hall? - Yes: so was you: I bought some bandanas for smuggled: I was a witness for the crown; I was the informer.</p>
               <p>What did you swear you gave for the two pieces of Bandana handkerchiefs you produced on the first examination? - I cannot say above two pounds.</p>
               <p>What was the number of the note he says I gave him? - I cannot read English, and do not know: Mr. Cropper said he would give twenty pounds to any body that gets me into trouble; and a woman who was tried yesterday said I had bought some things of her; and it was a false charge. (The note deposed to.) I am positive it is the note I gave him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Cropper. What passed between you and me at the publick-house near the magistrates? - I said my father was taken into custody.</p>

There is some blood on the rims of the buckles: next those tongues and chapes found in the privy appearing to belong to those rims in size, and number, and shape: some of them are marked with our mark: here is not the whole of the chapes: here is a black stone knee-buckle set in base metal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is of no meltable value? - No. Here is one chape amongst them with my private mark; I have no doubt but they are my property: next the things found in Mrs. Cropper's pocket; on the sugar tongs our private mark, and on the tea spoons, and on one of the buckles, and I remember the other buckle; next the things found in Mrs. Cohen's pocket; and the bundle produced before the Justice by Mr. Cohen, consisting of salt spoons and all manner of articles; this is one salt-cellar we have sometimes used in the house and marked with a D. a great many are marked with our private mark; upon the whole I believe these to be all my property: I suppose these things are not worth thirty pounds in the state they are in; they are fairly worth more than twenty-five pounds as silver: my house is a quarter of a mile from Cropper's house</p>

               <p>I live at No. 13, in Parker's-lane, a hard labouring man; I have known him three years. (The rest of the prisoner's witnesses ordered to go out of court.) I came to prove I saw the first of this row.</p>
               <p>You was one that was there? - Yes; I stood at my own door, and there was a row in the street; some gentlemen were coming up, and one of them said, Troth Pat, which way does the bull run? There was another of our country folks apprehended the word, and he struck at the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked that? Which way does the bull run? - This young man with the fair hair, the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never said such a word.</p>
               <p>Rawley. Another man apprehended the word, and he followed him and struck him, this young man.</p>
               <p>Who struck him? - I do not know rightly; he was knocked down; when he got up, he ran as hard as ever he could lay legs to the ground, and away with him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230017"/>without a hat; and Fitzgerald was not in the case, any more than your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Who had the hat? - I do not know; but I am ready to take my oath that Fitzgerald was not in the first row; and he lost his hat in the first row.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot positively say that this man was in the affray; but I verily believe he was the man that had the tongs.</p>
               <p>Rawley. No, I had not the hat indeed.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of April I heard a man had been inquiring for me, and asked for a job; he came to my house once or twice; he had been assisting my people to get in a heavy piece of timber, and asked for some small beer: I was drinking tea in my back kitchen: I heard the door open, and somebody go up stairs; there is a large room up one pair of stairs which I use as a workshop, and for the men to keep their tools; I stopped to see who went out, and a lady who was drinking tea with me said, that was the man who had been asking for a job; I ran after him, and seeing something stick out behind, I stopped him; I asked him what he had got? he said he had got nothing; I looked under his coat, and there was a saw; I laid hold of his collar and told him I would keep him till I knew which of the men the saw belonged to; I sent for the men; and

I was in a little parlour adjoining to the bar on the 20th of April; I heard the rattling of money; I went into the bar, and I saw the prisoner standing before the till; he was trying to shove in the till, but it was stiff, and would not go in; it was not locked when I had left it last, but it was shut close to; the prisoner told me he went in for a glass of pepper-mint; I told him to take it; the drawer where the money was was half open and half shut; I examined the drawer, and found the gold and silver were taken out of it; I do not know what money was in it before; I know there were above twenty-three shillings in it in shillings, and a great quantity of sixpences; there is always gold and silver mixed together; he left three sixpences and one shilling: I had not been out of the bar five minutes when I heard the money rattle; I saw him push the till drawer; I called Daly, and told him that John had taken all the money out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before the justice did not you swear there was not any gold kept in the bar? - I did not. The prisoner was our waiter.</p>

               <p>I lost a metal watch, chain, and seals, as in the indictment, and two or three trinkets, on the 8th of May, in my dwelling-house. The prisoner is a relation of a very old servant in the family, and on that account has been often employed by Mrs. Le Trobe; by that means she became acquainted with my servants, and with my nursery-maid. On the morning of the 8th of May, Mrs. Le Trobe and myself went from home very early; before nine; upon going out of our bed-chamber, I wished her to put on her watch, which I then saw hang at the bed's head; she went out without it, but gave charge to the nursery-maid not to permit the child to play with it: we did not return home till twelve at night, and I immediately missed the watch from the bed's head; I not easily finding it, I called the nursery-maid, and the whole room was searched; the bed, and every part; I understood the prisoner had been there that evening to see the nursery-maid, in the bed-chamber. I sent for a constable the next morning, by six o'clock; and at that hour the constable, the nursery-maid, and myself, went to Winchester-row, where the prisoner said she lived; we found out the house, but were informed she had been gone a fortnight; we accordingly came home; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230037"/>out all that day; in the evening, I found the prisoner at my house in custody; she was searched before me by the constable, and upon her was found, I believe, about twenty-eight shillings, and two duplicates; I circulated hand-bills, and received an account of the watch from Sir Lawrence Cox's office; I saw the duplicate in the name of Mrs. Le Trobe.</p>

               <p>I am nursery-maid to Mr. Le Trobe. The prisoner was at our house on the day he has mentioned, the 8th of May; we went up stairs into the bed-room, into my mistress's room, to shew her a bonnet, with a child; I left the prisoner to put away the chairs, and came down stairs; she said she would stop till eight or nine o'clock; and when she came down, she said she was ill, and must go home, and come on the Sunday following; the watch was hanging in the bed-chamber when we went up; when my master came home, he missed the watch, and called to me. The constable, a young man, and me, met the prisoner by accident, yesterday, in the street.</p>

I then shewed him the watch; he said that would do, and asked me the price; before I shewed him the watch he said don't you know me; he said I am Dr. Cooper, of Norfolk-street; I recollected there was such a person in Norfolk-street, therefore I had no doubt he was the person; then I shewed him the watch; there were some more watches in a glass case, and that he would take the gold watch also that Lady Caroline might have her choice: he put them both in his pocket; then I shewed some chains; he pitched upon one chain of three guineas, then he went away: as soon as he was gone I missed the other gold chain marked 3 l 5 s. there was no other person in the shop; I saw the chain at Sir Sampson's.</p>

I turned round, and as she moved her hands very quick, I suspected the had got something, and I was resolved I would see what she had got; she bid 2 s. 4 d. for a shawl which I offered at 2 s. 9 d. She said she wanted to go to the pawnbroker's; I suffered her to go to the door, and then I jumped over the counter and followed her, and she dropped the shawls; I have had them ever since; they are my master's property; I am sure they are his property by the mark.</p>

About 10 o'clock, on Easter Sunday, I heard some people at my door; I unbolted it directly, and three or four men forced me down; I do not recollect who; when they knocked at the door first, they threw something over my head; I was afraid to look up or open my eyes, as they swore they would blow my brains out; they asked me what money I had in my pocket; I said about two guineas, or two and a half; they took my shoe and knee buckles; they asked me what money I had in the house; I told them I had three or four guineas in my bureau. I lost nine gowns, they were my deceased wife's, two pair of gold wire earrings, and several silk handkerchiefs; the silver watch and gold rings were mine; they took three or four guineas; they staid in the house between four and five hours. I was released at three in the morning.</p>

I lost five gowns, three shifts, and two black cloaks, and about six guineas, I cannot say how much; after they had taken what they pleased, they supped upon cold roast pork, and sucked 15 eggs.</p>

On Easter Sunday, at night, I was sitting in the bar, about 10 o'clock, some body came to the door, and my brother went to see who it was, and they said they wanted something to drink; two men came into the bar, one with a pistol, the other with a cutlass; the man with the cutlass desired me to lie down, or he would cut my head off; I laid down and he tied my head with a child's frock; after that they wrapped my head up in a blanket, and rifled my pockets; as soon as that was done, they began plundering the bar; I could hear but not see. I lost seven gowns, three black cloaks, and a red one, nine silk handkerchiefs, two tuckers, and some black lace, I don't know how much; a half guinea in gold, and a Spanish dollar; I suppose the whole together about 15 l.</p>

On Saturday night following, Mrs. Randall and her daughter Elizabeth came into my room, and produced a pistol, and desired me to hide it; she said it was her brothers, and she was afraid the officers would come and search; on Tuesday following I came from work, and in my cupboard I saw a gown, I asked Payne whose it was, she told me it was Randall's, I said to her, carry the gown down again, for it shall not be here; she made answer and said the woman is not at home; it remained in my room till Wednesday morning; on Wednesday morning

My learned friend has stated to you the nature of the charge, which is now brought forward against the prisoner; it is in short this species of offence, namely, of assuming the name and character of a Mr. Ramsey, in order to receive, at the proper office for the payment of that sort of money, a dividend upon stock, of which Mr. Ramsey was the proprietor; he, at the time he applied to the clerk of the Bank, saying, that he was the Mr.

             himself, and entitled to that stock. You will easily perceive that the crime imputed to the prisoner is a capital offence; and to Gentlemen of your description, it would be unpardonable in me if I was to engross much of your time, or the time of the Court, in many observations on the utility, the consequence, and the importance in that vast machine of publick credit, the Bank of England. Gentlemen, how infinitely it imports the publick, that every officer in that employ should exert all possible vigilance to guard against the first approaches of fraud at that place, must strike every body before ever such object is mentioned. Gentlemen, the particular circumstances of the present case lay within a very small compass, and are such as I am afraid will preclude the unhappy man at the bar from any possibility of defence; and the officers at the Bank exerting very proper industry on the occasion, when this matter came to light, have done, as it highly became them to do, they have inquired into every circumstance of this young man's life; we therefore have come at his parentage, and the situation he has been in; we have come to the means that he has been supplied for two years past; he has been in London, and has, the greatest part of that time, lodged at the Bolt and Tun, in Fleet-street: at his father's decease he was entitled to a sum of money not amounting to 600 l.; it was invested in the funds in the year 1790: so long ago as July 1791 every halfpenny of that property was sold out; but, during the time it remained there, highly probable it is, that he had opportunities of visiting the Bank and of knowing the procedure of that place: on the 23d of April, the young man at the bar applied to the Reduced Annuity office, for the purpose of receiving the dividend in question - a Mr. Fearing is the clerk in that department; it was then about half past two o'clock when he made his application to Mr. Fearing, saying, that he wanted a dividend; Mr. Fearing looked at him, and asked him his name; he immediately replied, that his name was

Mr. Fearing went on with other questions that were necessary, and asked him what interest was due on the money; he answered without much hesitation, that there was a twelvemonth due; Mr. Fearing looking at the book, and seeing that there was some back dividend due, but not amounting to what he himself specified, then asked him,</p>
               <p>"Are you sure you are right?"</p>

               <p>"It is; and my stock is 2,300 l.; but whether I am right or not in the interest that is due, I cannot be certain, because I gave to my brother a power of attorney to receive for me." Mr. Fearing, upon this intimation, knowing extremely well that if any dividend had been received, on a power of attorney, that there would be means: appearing on the book by which to know it; and seeing that there was no mention at all, or any entry regarding a power of attorney, he again interrogated the prisoner at the bar, whether he was sure of the stock; he again then said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am; my name is David Ramsey, of the navy, a surgeon." Mr. Fearing gave him the dividend warrant, the dividend book was open; he took the dividend warrant, he subscribed to that dividend warrant the name of

            , that is the crime the act has specified, namely, personating another with intent to defraud the Bank. Gentlemen, I need not take up much time in explaining the law, as it has been elucidated by a case that has gone before the Judges, because my Lord knows the case: he had therefore completed the offence in every particle of it; he applied to the Bank clerk for the purpose, and therefore endeavoured to receive this dividend; and he assumed the name and description of

            . Now then, Gentlemen, you are perfectly possessed of the nature of this offence, together with those circumstances that must arise in order to constitute the offence, namely, the application being made so as to manifest the endeavours to receive the dividend under a false and assumed representation of another. Mr. Fearing, on his having mentioned that Mr.

             was his father, not at that moment alarmed about all the other circumstances, which would, if he had had time to consider of them, of course struck a very considerable alarm in his mind; he then asked him, if his father had made a will for, that if it was his father's stock he could not pay it then: the person said to Mr. Fearing,</p>
               <p>"What degree of proof will be necessary for me to receive this?" -</p>
               <p>"You must produce your father's will." -</p>
               <p>"My father's will is in the Commons; but I have a copy of it, and in ten minutes I will bring it." A Mr. Plestow, who had been present, asked him who was the executor, he said himself was the executor; and mentioned two other persons who were executors in the father's will, and one Gentleman named Tozer. Gentlemen, you will find the name of Tozer will become infinitely material. At that time he went away without being interrupted at all by Mr. Fearing or Mr. Plestow; he never returned; the matter resting then under all the circumstances that I have just stated to you, Mr. Fearing thinking perhaps it probable that he should return either on that day, or on some subsequent day, thought no more of the business; but a conversation happening between him and Mr. Plestow, which I am not at liberty to state to you, all the circumstances became strongly possessed on their minds: this was the 23d of April; it was on Monday. On the Monday following, Mr. Fearing going from his department in the Bank into the 4 per cent. office, he there saw, and recognized, the prisoner at the bar; he looked at him, and he was sure it was the man; he had not a sort of doubt about it; he very prudently went to the office where Mr. Plestow was, and told him, and desired him to go to look at the prisoner; as soon as ever he came into the office he saw him, he recognized him, he was sure, Gentlemen; therefore, you see now that this evidence, which will be necessary to support the charge here, will be evidence of person, what they call the evidence of identity. Now certain it is, that in many cases that may be stated, the evidence of person, or identity, may appear to be so evasive that it must, under the circumstances of the case, be received with much hesitation; and men will ponder extremely before they will determine in many cases of the evidences of identity; such, for instance, as a man being robbed on the highway, who is certainly flurried, and his mind not perfectly cool, and not perfectly at ease; you always will indulge a probability in favour of an accused person, that there has been a mistake; but if ever there was a case in the world where the evidence of identity must be stronger than any other,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230060"/>it is in the case that you have now before you. Mr. Fearing perfectly cool, without the least degree of alarm on his mind, but a curiosity necessarily and naturally excited, having every opportunity of looking at the young man; Mr. Plestow with him, having the same opportunity, both being cool, nothing to disturb or irritate the mind, the circumstance making an impression on the memory, so as to keep it alive for a week, when the opportunity arose again of confirming them in this manner; therefore, Gentlemen, with respect to the evidence of identity, those two witnesses, who can have no possible bias on their minds, but rather the contrary, must stand before you while you will search most deliberately indeed every circumstance with they assert, so that you may be enabled, and you will greedily grasp at, if you are enabled to suppose there was a mistake; but if you are convinced that they are certain in their minds that that person is the prisoner at the bar, to be sure then it will be your duty to be guided by that testimony. Gentlemen, soon after Mr. Plestow had seen him, he communicated it to the Accomptant of the Bank of England, the Accomptant went to him, and he was desired to walk into his room, he did walk into his room, communication was immediately made to the Governor, who of course directed he should be detained. He sat in the room of the Accomptant for near three quarters of an hour without asking any question at all; what may be the infence resulting from that, I will not attempt to anticipate, you will, I am sure, according to the best of your knowledge in human nature, give it that interpretation which is fair, wishing at the same time to give it that interpretation that is merciful; but if in your examination of the human heart, you should be convinced this is a circumstance, which added to the others I have related, shall be a manifestation of guilt, of course you, in your duty to the publick, will receive it as such. Gentlemen, soon after this he was taken to the office of Sir Sampson Wright, there he went under an examination; Mr. Fearing and Mr. Plestow both told their story; he told his, so far as he chose to tell it; but at the time he made his application to Mr. Fearing at first, he was differently dressed to what he was on the following Monday; Mr. Fearing and Mr. Plestow, therefore, described that circumstance: he had a black coat on, as he has now; he had an under waistcoat, which struck them both to be the waistcoat that he had on when he made his first application; but in describing his clothes he had on the first day, on the search being made at his lodgings, those clothes were found there. Mr. Plestow and Mr. Fearing had both of them remarked that on the 23d of April he had a ring on his finger of an octagon form; they described this circumstance; at the time of his apprehension he had no such ring on. In course of that activity which had been used by the officers of the Bank, we shall be able to lay before you, to-day, in evidence, that about that time the young man wore such a ring as that: if the ring was not valuable it would not be difficult to account for its being found; however, when his lodgings were searched, many duplicates were found there: Gentlemen, nothing more material appears on the search of his lodgings than what I have described; now then you see we are to revert to the evidence of this being the man that applied to the Bank; and it is desired that you further bear in mind the name of Tozer: when Mr. Plestow joined his inquiries with Mr. Fearing, and asked him who his father's executors were, he mentioned one, namely, a Mr. Tozer; when he was examined before Sir Sampson Wright, he, in accounting for himself, and giving a description of his parentage, and of what he became intitled to at his decease, he himself said, that Mr. Tozer was an executor of his father's will: now, Gentlemen, that circumstance to be sure, strong as it is, if the evidence of Mr. Fearing and the evidence of Mr. Plestow were not to be decided and positive; but if they were merely to speak to random belief, or that they rather believed that that was the person who made the application at the Bank; when testimony of that sort is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230061"/>coupled with the two other circumstances I have just stated, namely, the coincidence of the name of Tozer being the executor to his father, and the other of his wearing the ring I have mentioned; it appears to me that such evidence must be irresistible; but when, instead of that testimony, there shall appear the most clear, unequivocal, unhesitating evidence that that was the man that made his application; it seems that the only remaining evidence will be as to the nature of the transaction itself; when he applied to receive the dividend and personated the character of

               <p>Mr. Garrow.

               <p>What do you call those books? - Dividend books.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect in what particular state of the conversation he signed these warrants? - As soon as he said his name was Ramsey, and I looked at the name, I turned the book to him, and he signed it; I then asked him, seeing there was a reference to the second dividend, what dividend was due; I turned round to him a second time, and when there was more due than what he claimed, I then began to question him more particularly.</p>
               <p>Was there more due than the two? - Yes, there was: on his signing the second book I began to doubt more, and of course to question him more.</p>
               <p>Certainly; that led to these particular questions? - His answer was that his father was dead; I asked him who were his father's executors; he mentioned three names; I do not recollect any of them; we then told him he had no right to receive it; he then said he had an authority, because he was an executor; I then took up the warrants, and told him I could not pay him, as

             did not appear to be dead; he asked me what proof was wanted; I told him if his father had left a will to let us have it; he said the will was in the Commons, and that he had a copy of it at home, which he would fetch in ten minutes time; he went away, promising to return with the copy of the will; but I saw no more of him that day; this was Monday, the 23d of April: I saw nothing of him till the Monday following; on that day, between twelve and one, I was going into the 5 per cent. office, I there saw the prisoner, and it struck me so forcibly that he was so much like the person that demanded the dividend of me, that I went and called Mr. Plestow; and we were both of opinion that he was so much like the person, that we thought it proper to acquaint our Accomptant General.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time, or did you not, verily believe he was the person? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed then as he was before? - No; he was not.</p>
               <p>There was a considerable difference in the dress? - Yes; there was. I informed the Accomptant General, and he came to him; he was desired to walk into his apartment; and he was there examined, and was removed from there to Sir Sampson Wright's.</p>
               <p>Was any thing explained to him for walking in there, or was he merely desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230063"/>to walk in? - He was merely desired to walk in; he was in there three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>He went in of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, I believe, after he had been at Bow-street, the search was made at his lodging? - Yes; I was present: we found the coat and a waistcoat, as near as I can recollect, the same pattern as the prisoner came in to demand the dividend the 23d of April.</p>
               <p>What coloured coat and waistcoat were they? - A dark brown coat, and a red waistcoat, with spots.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed when he was apprehended? - In a very genteel manner; in a black coat and waistcoat, and leather breeches, and boots and spurs, and a whip in his hand; his hair was full dressed, and he had a round hat on; he had a very handsome octagon ring on his finger; it was a large ring, and reached from the nuckle; on the 23d of April he had a large cravat on, and the edges of it laced; there were such cravats found at the lodgings; there was an under waistcoat which I observed to correspond with that which he had on the 23d; it was a striped waistcoat, such an one as he has on now.</p>
               <p>With this impression that the prisoner was so like the person that had been to you, did it appear to you to be the same person? - Upon seeing his face I saw every feature that I had seen in the other; it struck me very forcibly at that time; I wished to be satisfied lest I should make a mistake when I went to call Mr. Plestow.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time or not entertain any doubt whether he was the person? - I was fearful that I should apprehend a wrong person.</p>
               <p>That is no answer to my question: did you entertain any doubt or not? - Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Have you examined to see whether the prisoner had any dividend to receive on the 30th, or any account of the Bank? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he any? - None at all.</p>
               <p>The books of the Bank are perfectly silent as to any business he might have there on his own account? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. The person that you questioned could hardly forbear observing your suspicions? - No; I think he must.</p>
               <p>Mr. Plestow was not so near him as you? - Not till I began to question him.</p>
               <p>I believe your expression has always been that you verily believe; you never went further? - I verily believe the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>You never went further than that? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What time was it that the person appeared there on the 23d of April? - It was from half past two till within ten minutes of three.</p>
               <p>You found the prisoner on the 30th of April standing in the Bank? - Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>On your return you found him exactly in the same situation? - Yes; we did.</p>
               <p>Did you walk round the prisoner? - We walked round the fire place; he stood at the fire; we looked at him two or three times; he remained in the same situation; he looked as if he was waiting for somebody.</p>
               <p>What time might pass from the time you first saw him to the time you fetched Mr. Edwards to lay hold of him? - Ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time this conversation all passed, and you was handing the first book, and then the second, and then the two warrants, had you such an opportunity as that you could observe, and did you observe his person? - I saw him then: I observed his person perfectly well; and I observed the person of the prisoner when I saw him the Monday following, and it so convinced my mind that I was not willing to be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Then what you did was out of caution, not having any doubt in your mind; do I understand you right? - I swear to the best of my knowledge that the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. On the 23d of April you was in the Reduced Annuity office? - I was.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner? - I do.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - I take it to be the person that applied to our office on the 23d of April; on the 23d of April, about half after in two in the afternoon, passing by the division letter R. where Mr. Fearing was; I was desired by him to stop; I went to him.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner with Mr. Fearing at that time? - They were conversing together; I immediately referred back to the dividend, and found that the dividend differed materially; I heard Mr. Fearing ask him what profession he was; he said he was a surgeon in the navy.</p>
               <p>Did you observe his countenance so as to know him again? - I did.</p>
               <p>What was he dressed in? - A brown coat, with a scarlet fancy waistcoat, spotted; while Mr. Fearing was looking at the book I asked him how he became possessed of the stock; he said it was his father's; I immediately replied, what right had he to it if it was his father's; his answer was, that his father was dead, and had left it to him; I then asked him who were the executors; two he mentioned that I cannot recollect; but I perfectly recollect the name of Tozer as one that he mentioned; he had a long octagon ring on his finger; I then told him, that, allowing it to be as he said, he had no right to receive it, as not being an executor; he then said that he was an executor also; I told him if that was the case it altered the property, but then we must have the will; he said the will was in the Commons, but he had a copy, which was at home, and he would fetch it in ten minutes; when he went out of the office I believe it wanted ten minutes of three.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity during all that time, which your curiosity or suspicion excited, to notice his person so as to know him again? - I beg your pardon; I had no suspicion, or else I should have stopped him then.</p>
               <p>Very well. But had you an opportunity of noticing him? - I had: he did not return: on the Monday following, the 30th, Mr. Fearing came into the office appearing very much agitated; he desired that I would go into the 5 per cent. office, that he believed the person was there who personated Mr.

               <p>Now look again; have you any doubt? - No more, Sir, than that of one man's being out of sight of another.</p>
               <p>You have every reason then in the world to believe him to be the man? - I have every reason to believe he is, except the circumstance of a person once being turned out of sight of a naked eye? - He was brought into the Accomptant's apartments; he stayed three quarters of an hour; he asked me no questions; I attended at Sir Sampson Wright's; I went to his lodgings afterwards to make the search.</p>
               <p>Were there any clothes found there corresponding with those the prisoner had on the 23d of April? - I think the same dress that the person that was at the Bank the Monday before had on; I beg leave to mention that the second time of going to his apartments we found a waistcoat of the same pattern; we found several duplicates and memorandums of various things; the numbers, dates, and sums of many bank notes.</p>
               <p>Had he any ring on when he was apprehended? - No; he had not: the prisoner said he had a ring, and was sure he left it there; he acknowledged to wear a ring exactly similar to that I described; we went and found no ring; these papers of dates and numbers of Bank notes were found in his box.</p>
               <p>Looking at the prisoner again, have you any doubt that he is the man? - I believe him to be the same person to the best of my recollection and knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt? - No further than I before mentioned: when he was present<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230065"/>at Sir Sampson's he mentioned that a Mr. Tozer was his guardian.</p>
               <p>He answered to the name of Gortley at the justice's? - He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your attention was certainly not drawn to this person till you was called by Mr. Fearing? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that he said that a man of the name of Tozer was his guardian, and executor to his real father; did he mention that at Sir Sampson Wright's when he passed by the name of Gortley? - He did; he said he was a trustee to him under the name of Gortley.</p>
               <p>He mentioned in fact the name of Tozer as the person with whom he was connected? - He did.</p>

               <p>A 25 l. Bank note, the 10th of Feb. 1792, No. 4195? - Yes.</p>
               <p>These notes were all issued by you? - Yes:</p>
               <p>Were they all new notes? - We had them from the cashier.</p>
               <p>They were all issued in one payment, to one person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In payment of one dividend? - Yes, two warrants to one person.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have heard the charge that has been made against you, and the evidence which has been produced to prove that charge, would you wish to say any thing yourself, or leave it to your counsel?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should like to leave it to my counsel partly.</p>
               <p>Court. Your counsel cannot make a speech for you, he can state no fact to the jury, all he can do is to examine those witnesses which you have instructed him in your brief will be of service to you in your trial; if therefore you wish to say any thing, now is your time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I can bring my witnesses to prove that I was at the Bolt and Tun inn, from two o'clock till a quarter before three.</p>
               <p>UDNEY CARTER sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you keep the Bolt and Tun inn, in Fleet-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have known him to have been at my house some time past as a lodger.</p>
               <p>How long? - About 14 or 15 months, backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>I believe you attended at Bow-street on the day the prisoner was brought up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you tell us whether you have any recollection where the prisoner was on the Monday preceding that time? - On the Monday preceding, I saw him in my house, between twelve and one o'clock, and about two, or after; then between three and half an hour after.</p>
               <p>When you say that you saw him at your house about two, how long did he continue there at the time you got sight of him about two? - I really cannot say, he was then in the parlour eating some cold roast beef for a luncheon.</p>
               <p>What time was he eating his luncheon? can you speak to any certain time which he remained there? - No, I cannot say that I can; the only thing that I took notice of was, that a Mr. Evett in the house took particular notice of his eating a luncheon so near dinner time; he generally dined about three. Mr. Evett was obliged to go down to Weybridge last night.</p>
               <p>What part of the house was he in at that time? - In a parlour just behind the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Where was your situation at that time? - I was then in the parlour with Mr. Evett, when he came in and asked for some cold roast beef for a luncheon.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say any extent of time which the prisoner staid there? - No, Sir, I cannot; business calling me backwards and forwards, I cannot.</p>
               <p>You have known him 14 or 15 months? - Yes, I never saw any thing by him in my house, I never saw any body visit him there.</p>
               <p>So far as his dealings have been with you has he behaved honestly or otherwise? - Perfectly honest and very sober, I never saw him any way otherwise</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Very sober and paid his tavern bill. You do not mean to represent him as having passed all these months at your house, nor any thing like it? - No, Sir, not all the time.</p>
               <p>He has been lately at Bath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you learn from him who he was? - I understood he was the son of Sir

               <p>Had you seen any of the duplicates that were found? - No, not till they were found by the officer; he returned in March; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230067"/>told us that his father lived at New Place, near Exeter.</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear of his having changed his name on account of its being too much like the name of a horse, or any thing of that sort? - Never, Sir, till it was mentioned at Sir Sampson Wright's; I recollect that between twelve and one, he had his great coat on, with a handkerchief round his neck, and he sat down to dinner with this handkerchief round his neck, which was very unusual for him to do.</p>
               <p>That was after three? - Yes, it might be about 20 minutes, or nearly half an hour.</p>
               <p>What was the rest of his dress? - I really cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Was it his brown coat and his red waistcoat? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the black clothes were made? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Were they made before or after that Monday that he had his luncheon? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When were the new boots and leather breeches bought? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did he use to wear a ring? - He used to wear a ring sometimes.</p>
               <p>What sort of one? - Rather a large one, of the octagon shape.</p>
               <p>Had he that ring on of the Monday? - I really cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath cannot you recollect that he had that ring on at dinner? - I really cannot say; sometimes I have seen him with it, and sometimes without it.</p>
               <p>You do not know what is become of it? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Did he use to wear such clothes as a red waistcoat and a brown coat? - Yes, and sometimes a green coat.</p>
               <p>Then, except the black, we have the whole wardrobe here? - There is another black coat I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you understand from him whether Sir

               <p>Was you at Bow-street when he was examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear him say there that his father was a shoe-maker, and was dead, and had left him some little property? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his saying any thing about his father in Bow-street? - No.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, you cannot undertake to prove how this man had disposed of himself from a little after two, when he was eating his luncheon, and almost half past three, when he sat down to dinner? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven respectable witnesses, who had known him above two years, and gave him an excellent character.</p>

Lloyds house, where the prisoner was at work, they gave charge of him, and I took him to the Compter, there he confessed it: he was not promised any thing to induce him to confess.</p>
               <p>It appeared on the examination, that the evidence has been a constable seven years, and that he had not been compelled, but did it for the sake of the profits of situation attendant upon general constables.</p>
               <p>Called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

            ; on the 11th of April my wife hung out all the clothes she had to dry, and when she came to take them in, she missed one of the sheets; she came up, and told me of it, and I went to the pawnbroker's; I found it next day at a pawnbroker's in Oxford Street; the pawnbroker produced a sheet to me, which I told him I thought was the sheet; that it was marked in the corner E. C. with the figure of 2 under it: on examining it, I found part of the letters picked out; the pawnbroker informed me the woman who pawned it came frequently, and I desired he would let me know as soon as she came; I was sent for in less than an hour, and found the woman in the parlour; she said she did not steal it, she had it of one Parker to pawn. I went to Litchfield Street and brought a constable; I searched after the man prisoner and found him, and brought them both to Litchfield Street.</p>

               <p>I am an excise officer, and was so in the year 1789; my business was at Plymouth Dock; there were some people at Mutton-Cooe, between one and two in the morning, landing some casks; every man had a cask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230072"/>and a large stick; I was concealed in the rocks; they passed me and the other officers towards Plymouth Dock; we followed them and took some of the casks away; the prisoner was among those who was in the boat, and he was one who had a cask taken from him; they went behind an empty house, and deposited their casks; I went up to them, and one of them struck me on the head with a bludgeon, and cut my head very much, then three or four fell upon me, and the blood flowed all over my face; they throwed stones after me, and they broke my leg; then they took me to a door, and presently they brought an anker of gin and put beside me; then James Taylor was brought and laid down by me, and his leg was also broke; then the smugglers came and said kill the b - rs; one of them said, O! d - n me, they are dead enough. I don't know that the prisoner did any damage.</p>

               <p>I was an excise officer. On the 2d of April, 1789, I saw the prisoner with a keg on his back, and a bludgeon; my father was laid on the steps of a public house, called the Fortune of War. I am sure I saw the prisoner go back, after my father was beat, to the gang; I saw the prisoner afterwards between the distance of one month and seven; I saw the prisoner at Caursand, with a bill-hook in his hand; I saw him again in a public house, and he asked me to drink, and told me I should not be hurt, I drank with him, and he said I was in the company, but I did not strike; they will all say so.</p>

Mr. Attorney General, who has very important avocations at another place, that require his attendence, directed I should conduct this prosecution; I have an affidavit in my hand of very respectable persons; of the rector of the parish in which the prisoner lives, and of a great variety of other persons, who bear ample testimony to the good character of the prisoner; he is stated to be a man with a wife and six children depending upon him for support; and he comes claiming the mercy of the Attorney General; when ever that appeal is made, you know very well, it is made with great safety; the man has been very properly advised, by those to whom he has intrusted his interest, to plead guilty; and Mr. Attorney General consents, by me, to receive his plea.</p>
               <p>Court. How long has he been in goal? - Some time in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. Do you desire to retract your plea of Not Guilty, and to <rs id="t17920523-90-verdict523" type="verdictDescription">
