There was of it a piece of cheque, some ribbon, and silk lace, such as we make capuchins of. She was examined before Mr. Alderman Alexander on the 13th, and that night Mr. Turner brought me some things that he found in his house; six or eight yards of linen, one yard of muslin, a yard and half of diaper, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090003"/> a pair of cotton stockings. She was searched on the 12th, and some things were found upon her, and some in her box in my house; there were twenty yards of silk stay lacing, half a dozen yards of ribbon. She acknowleged to have taken them out of my shop. I beg leave to recommend her to mercy; she is a young girl.</p>
               <p>Mr. Turner. I was before Mr. Alexander at the mansion-house when the prisoner was there. She had lived servant with me before; I brought her up from a child. She directed me to a lumber-room in my house. I went there, and upon, or rather behind, a parcel of chips, I found the things the prosecutrix has mentioned, tied up in a handkerchief. She used to come to my house at holiday time, or on Sunday. My wife brought her from the country. She bid me carry them to her mistress. She behaved well while with me. She is very young. If the court will order her corporal punishment, I will take care and send her into the country to her friends.</p>

I found the prisoner in St. Giles's after my mistress sent for me, and asked her if she knew any thing of the things missing. She owned she had taken them, and they were in pawn; and said she had not money to fetch them out. She went with us when they were taken out; at a pawnbroker's in Hanover-yard we had two table-cloths; at another in St. Giles's we had two napkins, a cap, and a few odd things; at another in Smart's Buildings we found a shift.

            . I open the playhouse doors always about four o'clock. I had often seen the prisoner about before, sometimes going up the stairs. I observed him that night, the 27th of last month, very busy, with his hands under a lady's cardinal. I had suspected him some time of being a pickpocket. After that he went up into the gallery, and I watched his coming down again; which was in about twenty minutes time. I believe he was suspicious of my design to lay hold of him; he made a push, and ran away through the pit passage towards Bow-street. I ran after him, and a little before we got into Bow-street I seized him, and he dropt a handkerchief out of his left hand the minute I laid hold of him. I took him to Justice Welch's, and searched him, and took six handkerchiefs more, a tobacco box, a woman's cardinal, and two pair of gloves. First he said the cardinal belonged to an acquaintance of his, and he was to take care of it for her; afterwards he said he found it.</p>

I saw the prisoner searched, and the cardinal taken from him. When I came to the tobacco box, I said, What have you got there, tobacco or snuff? He said tobacco, he believed.

               <p>I was going up stairs into the two shilling gallery. There might be three or four hundred people endeavouring to get up as fast as they could. I went up to the door, and the door keeper said there was no room. I waited upon the, the space of a quarter of an hour before I could get down; and going down stairs I touched something soft under my foot, just by the door. What should that be but a handkerchief; I saw part of it. I said, here is something here, madam; will you be so kind to stand on one side, here is something under my feet? The gentlewoman stood on one side, and said there is something indeed. I went to the door, and pulled the door back, and there were all these things. I took them up in my arms. Ah! said they, you have got something indeed. I hallowed out, gentlemen and ladies, do you know any of these things? One said they did not, and another said they did not. Coming down, some of the people said this man has found some things; then they laid hold of me as I was going home, and to be sure they found the things about me; but I am very innocent of wronging any man of these things. I never saw that gentlewoman in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Abbot. In what part about him did you find these things?</p>
               <p>Abbot. Some of the handkerchiefs were in his bosom, some in his pockets, and none of them dirty.</p>

            . I was coming along Covent Garden on the 29th of Nov. The prisoner desired me to go with her, and treat her with a glass of wine. I told her I could not afford that; but, as she seemed to be good-natured, I would give her a pint of purl. I went and gave her two pints. I said I was going to Tower-hill. She said she was going as far as the Fleet-market. I said I did not want any company. She came as far as Somerset house, and desired I would go down the Yard, having, as she said, something particular to say to me.

I know I had my watch when I was in her company, for I looked at it. I missed my watch as soon as she wished me a good night. I went after her, but could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her take it?</p>
               <p>Wells. No, I did not. I asked the men if they saw a woman? They laughed at me. I overtook her in five minutes time, and challenged her with having my watch. She said she never saw me in her life, neither did she ever see my watch. I said, I am certain you are the woman I was with, and you shall go before justice Fielding to night. There came up a gentleman or two, who said, If she has it, if you do not look sharp, she will drop it. Just by Somerset-house Gate, as I was bringing her along. She put her hand into her bosom, and took out my watch, and was going to throw it over the pallisades. I stopped he hand, and said, Gentlemen, you see she has got my watch. I took hold of the string, and she let it go, and I put it in my pocket. [Produced in court.] This is the same watch, my property. I carried her before Mr. Fielding, and gave the same accounts as here. I don't remember he asked her any questions, but committed her.</p>

             was chairwoman to my lodger, and sometimes used to work for me, when I had occasion, in mending of things. She came first to beg for work about the beginning of January last, and worked for me at times till she was taken up in my house on the 12th of November last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lie in your house?</p>
               <p>M. J. Langham. No, she did not. I first took up one Cooksey, about the 17th of May, who had used to go on errands for me, and work for some of my lodgers; but I was soon satisfied of her innocence, and Justice Welch discharged her. I was sure the prisoner had taken some things the day before I took her up. The prisoner Smith and she lived together as man and wife. I got a search warrant, and took Mr. Clay and another constable, and went and search'd their lodgings. She gave us the key of the door at Mr. Welch's. There I found a considerable quantity of goods, watch trinkets and other things, hid in a paper bag behind a bolster: here is one particular etwee and snuff box, which I can be very positive to, found among the rest. [Producing it, with several other things, necklaces, &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>Q. What may these be worth?</p>
               <p>M. J. Langham. They are worth 40 or 50 shillings. I know them all to be my property: Her lodgings were at Mrs. Mears's in Eagle-street, near the Horse and groom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Smith at her lodgings?</p>
               <p>M. J. Langham. No, I did not. The account she gave me for herself was, that she was forced to rob me by the ill usage of her husband, as she then called him: she said her memory was so bad, that she could not recollect the particulars; but she had pawned a great many things at Mr. Bibby's. She went there along with us: she asked for six or seven boxes; they produced eleven patch boxes and snuff boxes. [Produced in court.] The prisoner helped me to pack up these in a hamper, in order to go to Blackheath fair, about the beginning of May. She said, she had sold the counterpane in Mount-street, to Mrs. Rhemas. We went there and found it. [ Produced in court.] This was in my house the beginning of May. I am charged four guineas and a half for it, in case I do not return it where I deal. We found some pawnbrokers tickets in her lodgings, which directed us to Mr. Watson's a pawnbroker. We went there, and found six tortoiseshell pocket books and many boxes. [Produced in court, and deposed to.] Those were in my shop between January and May last. Here are also a great many other things which I found there my property. I found also, by the prisoner Clements's directions, a necklace at Mr. Chaliner's, and some ribbands at Mr. Meads's, and an apron at

            's. These I was informed were sold by the prisoner Smith. I took out a warrant against him, and found him in the house where he and she lodged. I miss a great quantity of goods that I cannot find; but Clements said at the Justice's, that when I turned my back, then she used to take things out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Smith?</p>
               <p>M. J. Langham. I first saw him when we took him, the same night as she was taken up on the day. He was carried to Justice Welch's. He persisted in it that he knew nothing of the matter till the next day, when he was re-examined: then the Justice desired him to give an account of what he had done with the things. This was after he was searched, and a pair of buckles and three stayhooks were found in his pocket. Then he own'd to the apron that was produced to him, that he had sold it to a woman, that is now sick in her bed, for 12 s. her name is Degell. [The apron, buckles, and staybooks produced, and deposed to.] Smith was asked where he had these things? He said, he had them of Betty, (meaning Clements.) The apron was cut from a piece of muslin which she own'd she had taken; and she said, he had it of her with other goods to sell. He owned also that he had had a necklace and some ribbands of her, which we had found. He owned to nothing but what we had found. This muslin that this apron is made of, I sell for 7 s. a yard, and here is two yards of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever trust the prisoner Clements to sell goods for you?</p>
               <p>M. J. Langham. No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clay, the constable, confirmed the account given by the prosecutrix as to Clements's confessing she stole the goods mentioned, and carried them to Smith, their finding some at their lodgings and pawnbrokers; and that Smith owned he had sold the apron to Mrs. Degell, and begged Mercy of the prosecutrix.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Langham entrusted me to sell goods for her when she has been out of town, and wanted me to go to fairs with her.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence.</p>
               <p>I always thought she was trusted to sell things for Mrs. Langham. I know she used to be at her house, and sell things for her, and go about on her business; not that I was there myself. These things I sold. That apron I believe to be the same: I thought she had it of her mistress to sell, and never knew to the contrary. I know she has been trusted with a great many things; I never knew she would wrong any body of any-thing, but I can never believe she had a quarter of the things she is charged with.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did you ever trust Clements to sell Goods for you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, only once. She had an India handkerchief of me, to put about her husband's neck; but she never had any of those goods to sell for me.</p>
               <p>For Clements.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barlow. I know Mrs. Langham has trusted Clements to sell Fire-works on Illumination Nights I have seen her helping in the shop on such nights, but I do not know she ever trusted her with any thing else in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Foreman. I know the prisoner Clements used to be to and from in Mrs. Langham's house; but I never knew her to employ her in any particular thing but in fire-works; if she had, I should have known it, for I had used to employ her myself. I have often heard her talk of her husband, but I never saw Smith till before the Justice.</p>
               <p>For Smith.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I have known Smith from his infancy; he is a carpenter, and was some time with Mr. Philips, the king's carpenter; he bears a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago that he worked with him?</p>
               <p>Silvester. It may be four or five years ago: He received by my order eight or nine pounds at a time. Last June I ordered him eight pounds by way of encouragement to him to mind his business: He is related to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What business has he followed lately?</p>
               <p>Silvester. He has not visited me so often within this twelve months past as before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Crawford, Mr. Denne, Mr. Morison, and Mr. Crown, who had known him from a child, Mr. Perry thirteen years, and Mr. Stevenson seven, speak well of him as to his behaviour before this.</p>

They went to dinner at one o'clock, and returned again about four. Their work was in the vaults that run under the warehouse a great length. After they were gone down some time, I went down, and cry'd, Below. Nobody answered: I went down farther in the vault, and cry'd Below again. No answer yet. I went to the place where they were at work, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090008"/> could see a candle. I met the prisoner at some distance from the place where he should have been at work. I said, what do you do there? He passed me, and made me no answer; he was coming from the capers to his work.

             came in to ask me to fetch down a velvet cap that lay for about 6 d. that she said was her husband's. I left her in the shop by herself, and went and fetched it, and discharged her. I do not remember any body was in the shop by besides her. My usual way is, when I take in goods, to deposit them under the counter, and the next day take them all off, and put them all up in by warehouses till called for. When I came to book the things, the apron and some other things were missing. (The prisoner is one of the last women that I should have mistrusted). Then I thought to lay a scheme to find out the person that had taken the things. I gave it out about the Friday following, that I should be at home by myself, and I knew the prisoner knew that I had given it out. I placed a man at my window in the kitchen, which has a full view of the shop, and I had darkened the kitchen; the prisoner came in about five o'clock, and said, Ship, I want an apron that has been here some time. Then I said, you know that I am at home alone, and I can not go to leave my shop, and nobody here; I can't find it. Then she said, go and fetch that cap, that I brought again the other day. I went up into the warehouse, and took the cap, and came to the stair-head. I heard the gentleman that I had planted in the kitchen say to her, you would have robbed Mr. Ship's house if it had not been for me, I'll take my oath of it. Thinks I this man has been too rash, she has only attempted it. When I came down she threw me the money that was due to me, and said, look for the apron to-morrow, for that will be wanted. As soon as she was gone away, said the man, that woman is a thief, and I would have you take care of her; inquire into her character. I sent to Mrs. Geery that lives near me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Ship. I live in Long-alley, Moorfields. I sent to her to know if she had such an apron as I missed at her house. I had informed the person whose property it was, that it was taken away, and she had brought an d left with me a piece of the same cloth to compare with it if I should hear of it. I sent that piece. Mrs. Geery let me know she had such an apron, which she took in of

               <p>I was at Mr. Ship's shop, and Mrs. Saloway was there. Mr. Ship went and fetched my cap, it was not my husband's. I went home about my business; after that I went to this woman's house for a peny worth of cheese for my supper; something catched me and tore my pattin. I looked down and saw something; I took it up, and it was an apron in a paper. I said to my husband, I have found something here. I shewed it him, and the next day I went and carried it to Mrs. Geery, and said I wanted money on it. She asked me whose it was. I said it was a young woman's apron, and she lent me 4 s. on it. I had been at Mr. Ship's house since, and it is a wonder he did not say to me he had lost an apron.</p>
               <p>Q. to Geery. Did the prisoner tell you whose it was?</p>
               <p>Geery. She said it was a young woman's, and cost her half a guinea, and she saw half a guinea paid for it. I lent her 4 s. upon it, or at least I rubbed it off her score, as she owed me money.</p>

I saw her raise her body over the counter; I imagined it was for some goods that we hang up behind the counter for sale. I said, pray what have you been doing? Nothing said she. I said, what have you in your apron? She said nothing, but some children's petticoats that had been fetched from another place. The boy at that time was gone up for her pledge; I was credulous enough to believe her, and let her go. About two hours after she came again; I was in the same position as before. She told the boy to go up for a handkerchief, which lay for 6 d. The boy came down, and said he could find no such thing. While the boy was gone up, she did as she did before; and it is my method, when I take goods in, to roll them up, and the papers upon them, and lay them under the counter. I went to her, and said you have taken something now. My wife came out of the dining room, and said she has got something; and, upon shaking her cloaths, down fell this gown from behind her.

When I told her I was determined to prosecute her, and sent my son for an officer, she opened the door, and got over the threshold. I got hold of her, but she was too many for me, and got from me; but I got hold of her again about three doors distant from my house, and we had a tight struggle. I had hold of her left wrist, and got her up against a door, and held her till the constable came and brought her back. Then she made an escape, and ran up three pair of stairs; but we had her secured. I begged of her in the kitchen, if she had taken any things the first time, to tell me. At last she told me she had taken two flannel waistcoats. When she was before Mr. Welch, he asked her if she had any other things; she said she had not; she said she had pawned the waistcoats with a pawnbroker in Turnmill-street. I went there and asked for them, and the pawnbroker shewed them to me, and a pair of breeches that came along with them; but she would not acknowledge the taking of them. When I saw them, I remembered taking them in; but I cannot recollect of whom.</p>

It used to be fastened; but at that time it was not. I went to her as she was going out of the door; I took her back, and found three shillings in halfpence in her apron; which she told me were my own. She had three half pence, or five farthings, in the hand that did not hold her apron. She said they did not belong to me. I missed more; but I found no more upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burgoine. I think it was about the latter end of March. They looked about, and saw a sash hanging up near the door upon a brass screw in the dining room. The prisoner said, is that to be sold? I told them it was; I offered it for a guinea. They bad me 18 s. I said it would make more money to any officer in the army, and took and hanged it up again; and they went away about their business and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090011"/> bought nothing. The next morning I set out of town to the regiment I belong to, and did not return for about a fortnight. When I came back, I got my boots off, and went into the dining-room; and, missing the sash, said to the maid, What is become of the sash that hung up there? Said she, I know nothing at all of it. She searched about, but no sash could be found. I imagined those Jews had got it; and gave orders, if ever either of them came, to get them stopped; but they never came there till last Thursday, as I heard of, then I happened to be at the Hog in the Pound in Oxford Road, and in came the prisoner. I said to him, O Mr. Smouse, you are the man that stole my sash. Your sash, Sir? said he; I bought a sash of you. Said I, Dare you look me in the face, and say you bought a sash of me? Said he, I did. Said I, What did you give me for it? Said he, 18 s. I said to the Landlord, Go call me a constable. Before the constable came, he said, Sir, Don't you remember you gave me 2 s. out of a guinea? Then I said, That was 19 s. He said. I can't say which it was, it was thereabouts. When the constable came, he said, he did not buy the sash at all, it was another Jew that bought it. I took him before justice Wright; and, upon his examination, he said, he went to my servant-maid, when I was gone out the next morning, and said, Such was the price of the sash, and bought it of her. Then we sent for her, though she was turned out of my service, partly for losing the sash. When she came, she absolutely denied ever selling it to him, or that ever he paid for it. Then he said, the other person, whom he called

               <p>Mr. Burgoine. No, I had not of her stealing it. I have had a thousand pounds in the house together, and never missed a farthing. I was angry with her, and thought she had been careless. The prisoner told me he had sold it in Monmouth street, and lost three shillings by the sale of it; this was the very day I took him up, before I took him before the justice; and he told the justice the same: After that, he told the justice he bought it of my maid; but he denied it afterwards, when he saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it hanging in that place after he was gone?</p>

There was a silk sash hung up in the dining room by the door; they did not buy it. My master went out of town the day after. What became of the sash I know not, for I never saw it after. Though I went into that room every day, I did not miss it till my master came home. I was before the justice when the prisoner was there: He said before me, It was not this woman that I bought the sash of, it was her master; then he said it was not he that bought it, it was another man that bought it: I heard him tell the justice that he had the sash.</p>

On the 26th of October the prisoner came into my house under pretence of selling a dying speech; there had been a man executed that day; she stood by the fire. Some time after she was gone, a person told me she had slipt a table-cloth under her cloaths (that person was very big, and I believe now lies in). She was brought back, and charged with it. She took a table cloth from under her cloak or petticoats, and delivered it to me. Then I charged the constable with her, and she was committed. [The table-cloth produced in court.] This is my property; here are the initial letters of my name upon it.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on the 13th of Nov. about five in the evening, and asked to look at some grey and white silk for second mourning. I shewed her some: She said it was for a gentlewoman; and while I was taking directions from her, where to send it, upon my slate, she took a piece under her cardinal, and was got out at the door, and a loose part of the silk fell from under her cloak, and hung down pretty low. I, seeing it, went and brought her back again: There was about a yard of the silk unrolled; she had taken the piece, roller and all. [Produced in court, and deposed to.] She intreated me not to proceed any farther. She could give no account of herself. I took her before justice Fielding, who was very well acquainted with her; there she acknowleged I found the piece upon her. She was committed to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the piece to be sent? did she say?</p>
               <p>Holmes. It was to be sent to a gentlewoman at the WhiteBoar, Piccadilly, by 9 or 11 the next morning, for the lady's approbation: She said she had no farther to do than to order it to be sent, and the lady was to pay me for it. [The piece produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>

               <p>Holmes. There is 18 yards of it.</p>

            . I was standing at my own door, opposite Mr. Holmes's, and saw a lady looking at a piece of silk. Presently I saw him standing at the door, taking directions upon a slate; and the lady came out with a piece of silk under her arm, and part of it hung down below her cardinal, and almost touched the ground. I saw Mr. Holmes go and lay hold of the piece of silk and her cardinal, and bring her back into his shop. Then I went over. She begged for mercy; and hoped, as he had not lost any thing, he would not prosecute her, and she would never come into his shop again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was the silk unrolled before she took it out?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was a little way, and was lying on the counter.</p>

               <p>I had some things in a handkerchief, and happened to drink with a friend, and it got into my head, and I was really incapable, and I took it up instead of my handkerchief. I came from Bristol, and have been in town but three weeks. I came to see my husband that is ill, and there is not a friend in the world to do for him but myself: It was not my interest to take it away, but it was a mistake between that and my handkerchief.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged with me several years in a two pair of stairs room: I lett it him ready furnished at 18 d. a week. I was informed by one of my other lodgers, that he had carried a bed out. I went and followed him, and saw a corner of my rug hang out of the bundle. I desired him to bring them back. He said, if I would not go away, he would rip me open. I cry'd out, and people came about us, and he was secured. He had got the bed, the bolster, and the rug, in a sack. I took him before justice Fielding; he said there, he was going to make a little money on the bed.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner ever since he lodged with the prosecutrix. I was told he came out of the house with a bed. I heard her cry murder in the alley. I ran to her assistance, and took hold of him. She desired me to take care of him till she got a constable. He owned he had taken them out of his lodging-room; and, before the justice, he owned he was going to make money of them, but he would give no account of what was become of the blanket and sheet.</p>

               <p>I lived almost seven years with the prosecutrix; I buy old cloaths. When her husband was alive, I asked him to lend me a trifle of money, and he gave me leave to pledge some things in my room; and, when I had sold the things that I bought with the money, then I used to fetch the goods back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090013"/> again. A great many times I have been obliged to do so, even to pay her my rents; and when I was sure of a bargain, then I used to bring them all home again. A serjeant came to me in New Prison, and inlisted me, and gave me a shilling, and I am to have two guineas more; I hope I may serve my king. I have been in the service before.</p>

            . I am son to the deceased; in the year 1752, about the month of June or July my mother died; and very unfortunately, just after, my father going down to see the ship he late commanded, he fell in with a woman reckoned to be a common woman, the wife of the prisoner at the bar. They cohabited together for some time; and the prisoner being out of business, my father went and bought a sloop, and gave the command of her to him; and my father used to go to and fro to this woman, who lived in a mean low way; and his own character being excessively good, he could not bear to be told from time to time what a shame it was to go to this vile woman. I represented to him what I had heard upon the occasion; he seemed sometimes to give heed to what I said, and I did all in my power in order to bring him to reason.</p>
               <p>Court. This may not be material on the present occasion: What do you know concerning the murder?</p>
               <p>Shanks. In regard to that, it was on Saturday the 7th of Nov. I was at the Portugal coffee-house at the Royal Exchange, where a servant of my Brother-in-law came to me, and told me my father was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that servant here?</p>
               <p>Shanks. It was a maid servant; she is not here. She desired I would immediately come down to the house to see him (I had not been there for some time).</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live?</p>
               <p>Shanks. He lived at his own house, Worcester-street, Old Gravel Lane. I made the best of my way to my brother-in-law's, who lives near Bell-Dock. Wapping?</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Shanks. His name is

            ; and he and I went together to my father's house, where there were a great number of people assembled.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner's wife live?</p>
               <p>Shanks. She lived with my father at that time, as well as the prisoner; they all lived together.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they lived so?</p>
               <p>Shanks. Ever since July 1752, not always in one house, but they always lived together when the prisoner was from sea. I went up stairs, where I saw my father lying in bed: I saw him alive, but senseless. I invoked him several times to speak to me, in order to see whether he knew me or not; he did not know me, he was quite senseless.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wound?</p>
               <p>Shanks. I saw no wound: I could not bear to see it, in about three or four minutes time after he expired.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there?</p>
               <p>Shanks. The prisoner's wife stood at the foot of the bed, very much intoxicated with liquor?</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Shanks. I believe it was between eight and nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at that time?</p>
               <p>Shanks. He was at the next house, a public house. I did not see him. As soon as my father was dead, I went to a friend of mine, who lived hard by, to be informed where I should find a constable; and he and I went together, and found one. We came to this public house, where the prisoner was sitting in a back room, it was the sign of the shepherd and shepherdess. Somebody had him then in custody, but who I know not. I charged that same officer with him; and afterwards I charged that same officer with his wife; they were carried before justice Pell in Wellclose-square.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when you first seized the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Shanks. Nothing at all; I could not bear to see him. The justice examined him relative to the murder: He then acknowleged the fact; I have his very words, I took them down in writing, upon his re-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all, tell by your memory what he said on his first examination.</p>
               <p>Shanks. He then did acknowlege he had fired a gun, and shot the captain, but that he meant him no ill will. After this, on the re-examination on the Monday following, the 9th, at noon -</p>
               <p>Court. You may read what you have wrote.</p>
               <p>Shanks. He there declared before justice Pell,</p>
               <p>"that he heard the deceased d - n him, and then he</p>
               <p>"asked him why he d - d him: The prisoner then</p>
               <p>"went into the kitchen to the deceased; and his</p>
               <p>"wife went to the street-door, where abundance of</p>
               <p>"people were gathered; and some little time after</p>
               <p>"the deceased came into the passage or entry, and</p>
               <p>"said, D - n you, Looney, where are you? Upon</p>
               <p>"which the prisoner took up a piece, and said</p>
               <p>"aloud, I will shoot any one that comes in to molest</p>
               <p>"me; when the deceased rushed in upon him, and</p>
               <p>"received the fire in his body. He then declared,</p>
               <p>"that the gun was in its case, and that he did not</p>
               <p>"know that it was loaded."</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090014"/>Q. Did he say who fired the piece?</p>
               <p>Shanks. No, he did not. I can say nothing more relative to the fact. In order to be convinced of that of the piece being in the case, Mr. Pell sent for it, and asked the prisoner whether that was the case belonging to the gun: He declared it was; upon which Mr. Pell looked at the end of the case, to see if there was any hole that the powder had gone through, and there was no such hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at it?</p>

               <p>Shanks. I did; there was no hole at all, nor mark of any powder or shot; I examined it all over.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the case made of?</p>
               <p>Shanks. It was made of a kind of listing, such as is usual for cases; it was quite whole, and seemed to be a new one.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this accident happened before you got there?</p>
               <p>Shanks. I was told my father was shot about a quarter before or a quarter after six o'clock, and it was between eight or nine when I saw the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that lock had been fired off?</p>
               <p>Shanks. I doubt not but that had been put to and fro several times by people in the intervals.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose gun was it?</p>
               <p>Shanks. I know very well that it belonged to my father; it was a very long gun, it was given him by a gentleman deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where it used to be put in that house?</p>
               <p>Shanks. I never was in that house before, since my father lived in it; I would have brought it here, but, my father having left all his effects to that woman, I could not obtain it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the will?</p>
               <p>Shanks. I have the copy of it here.</p>

             and the prisoner's wife were in the parlour together. I had served him three years and a half before I went on board a man of war. I had been out; and, coming home, there was some money due from the Bluecoat Hospital, where I had my education, and I desired the captain to go and get that money, and give me a few cloaths. He said he would. While I was talking to him, Mrs. Looney went backwards into the kitchen; then I heard some words pass between the prisoner and she.</p>

             was lying on his right side, with his head against the skreen, and the prisoner was walking about in the same room; and I saw a gun lying on the floor in the room, but I can't recollect what part of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any case upon the gun?</p>
               <p>Crow. I am certain there was not a case on it. When I went in Mrs. Looney said, there was only powder in the musket; he is not shot, he is only frightened. She was raising his side up with a napkin, I thought he was not shot at first; for I saw no blood. He looked her up in the face, and said, You wicked woman, you vile woman, it is through you this has happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect, when you first went into the room, who was there?</p>
               <p>Crow. There was only the prisoner, besides us that went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you got in before you saw Mrs. Looney?</p>
               <p>Crow. I saw her soon after I got in; the house was full presently. There was one Mrs. Lane came in; she said, for God's sake, let us lift him up into a chair. Then the prisoner desired we would go with him to a Justice of the peace to deliver himself up. Then Newland, I, and another man, went with him to Justice Pell's; he was not at home. Then we went to Justice Scott's; he was out of the way. Then we brought the prisoner to Mr. Bonherrin's, and he sent me for a warrant to take charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the wound before you went out?</p>
               <p>Crow. I had; it was on the left side, a very large one. I believe the deceased was in a night-gown. The wound on his body was bigger a great deal than a musket-ball could have made it; I could put two or three fingers in it; it was bleeding, and his shirt was full of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it appear to have been done with?</p>

I heard him say, he had brought a great deal of money home for five or six years, and it was very hard he could not get a roll and butter.</p>

I went down and mull'd him some; and I and another woman held his head up and gave it him. Then he lay down. I asked him if I could speak. He said, yes. I asked him, if I should send for his son? He said, no. Then he said, a poor innocent man killed; but never mentioned who killed him.</p>

             was dead or not. The gentleman said, he was dead. The prisoner said he was sorry for it; for he had been the death of an innocent man. He walked about a little. Soon after he was carried to Mr. Pell; where he acknowledged, that he had been the death of an innocent man, and that he was sorry for it; that it was all through that vile woman, pointing to his wife with his finger; for she has been the whole instigation of it Mr. Pell asked him, I think, who the house belonged to, relating to him and Mr. Shanks. He said he knew nothing of the house belonging to him; and said he thought he paid the ground-rent; but was not sure. He said, the first falling out was about a roll; he said, It was very hard he had worked so many voyages, and she would not allow him a roll for his breakfast. I think he twice said before Mr. Pell, that he shot him.</p>

            's. I found him lying upon some chairs almost dead, and the room full of people. I desired some of them to carry him up to a bed. When we had got his cloaths off, I found he had been shot in on the left side, and out again on the small of his back, on the same side, slanting downwards about six inches. It went through his lungs; because I saw the air of his lungs coming through his body. He must have been very near the mouth of the piece; for his banjan was scorched; one of his ribs was broke, and carried into his body, as large a piece as half a crown, or thereabouts.</p>

He said, Mr. Looney, I came to settle with my captain; don't make any words, you was always accounted a quiet man. I took my hat, and went out of the house, and said God bless you. I had no design upon any person in the world; about seven o'clock I thought it high time to go home. When I came in this affair happened. Captain

I delivered two guineas and a half to one of them, and Mr. Seaton, I believe, gave six guineas and his watch to the other. Then they rode off the way that we came. This was before seven o'clock, and it was dark. I could not know their faces. The man that robb'd me had a brown coat on. I gave information of them, and a man immediately went after them; who can give a farther account. I cannot swear to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your money in a purse?</p>
               <p>Rouce. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Seaton here?</p>
               <p>Rouce. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Jos. Dingley. Just after the gentlemen were robb'd they stopp'd at my door at the Angel Inn in Islington. They told me they had just been robb'd by three highwaymen near my house, and described their horses. I could not persuade any body to go with me in pursuit of them. I got a gun, and went to the turnpike myself, and found three had gone<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090019"/> through towards Cold Bath Fields. I went there, and up into Grays Inn Lane; I heard nothing of them there; then I went to the Bull inn in Holborn, I heard nothing there; then I went to the Horse and Groom, and asked if there were any such people there; and told them there had been a robbery, and described the horses. The landlord said they had been in there, and were gone about 10 minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I asked him if he knew them? He said, they had had the horses a great many times. I asked him if he knew where to find them? He said, one day he was coming down Fleet Market, and they treated him with some rum and water; and he believed, by inquiring there, he could find them. Then I went home, and the next morning I went to see the gentlemen. We went to Mr. Fielding, and gave information; and, on the Tuesday after, the prisoner was taken in the Fleet Market; the robbery was on the Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>John Quiby. I keep the Horse and Groom, Holborn. I think it was on the 18th of October Mr. Dingly came to me: I had that day lett a horse to the prisoner, another to Rolk, and another to a person that called himself Smith, one was a grey, another a roan, and the other a dark brown.</p>
               <p>Q. What time that day did they take horse?</p>
               <p>Quiby. I think it was about 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all go out together?</p>
               <p>Quiby. They did, and returned about eight at night; I can't tell to half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all return together?</p>
               <p>Quiby. They did. I was before justice Fielding when the prisoner was there; he was searched, and there was a seal taken out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you recollect what kind of horses the three men were on that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I cannot say to that.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the three?</p>

They seemed to be in a pretty great hurry; they said, Make haste, make haste, make haste! your purse, your watch, make haste! I bid them be easy, and said they should have them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body with you?</p>
               <p>Yardley. No, I was alone; I was going to Highgate, and this was within a quarter of a mile of the houses. I gave them my purse, which had but half a guinea in it, and a metal watch with a shagreen case, and a white dial-plate; the maker's name Gray, no number (I believe); there was a common seal, and a cornelian seal set in gold, the seal was a greyhound on his master's monument, with a French motto to it; then they galloped away towards Highgate as hard as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they their faces covered, or not?</p>
               <p>Yardley. It was too dark for me to see that: I cannot describe neither their persons or horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again?</p>
               <p>Yardley. Sir

            . The prisoner and another had horses of me on the 8th of October, I verily believe, but I cannot be positive; I know they had on the 9th, because I have that set down. The prisoner had a horse of me seven times; he and Rolk went out together several times. I lett the prisoner a roan horse very often; he is blind of the near eye, and a cut tail, and gauled on his shoulder by running in a chaise. The seal that the prosecutor has sworn to is the seal that I saw taken out of the prisoner's pocket at justice Fielding's; that was, I think, on the 22d of Oct. I remember the prosecutor said it was a grey hound on a monument, before he saw it. The prisoner said, that Sheridan found it in Covent Garden, and gave it to him.</p>

            . I saw this seal taken out of the prisoner's pocket when under examination on the 20th of October. The prisoner was examined different times, because we know the seal to be Mr. Yardley's seal, by his descriptions of it to us. I live with Mr. Fielding; the prisoner gave different accounts of it, first, he said a man gave it him that is gone to Ireland, another time he said he found it in Covent Garden, as he was walking there one morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I can contradict him in what he says. It was made a present of to me. The next time they examined me, they asked me if I heard the man say where he found it. I said he found it in Covent Garden; the young man is gone to Ireland short of money, and I made him a present of half a guinea, between me and another man; I gave him 5 s. 6 d. and the other 5 s. I never robbed a man in my life. I believed that was pinchbeck; I knew no other till it was taken from me.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner from his infancy. I was at the Blue Anchor, Russel-street, Covent Garden; I cannot say the day of the month, but I believe it was some time in October, it was on a Sunday, there was a young man going home to Ireland, named Sheridan; we thought proper to make a collection for him to carry him home, as he was a labouring man; Mr. Flinn said he would contribute, and pulled out 5 s. 6 d. and I pulled out 5 s. which was all the money I had upon earth. There were three or four more. The money was given him; this is a thing usual with our countrymen when they are going home. He put the money in his pocket, and pulled out a seal; I never had it in my hand, it was a yellow seal with a red stone in it. Said he to Mr. Flinn. I have a seal that I picked up, you have a watch, and I never a one, I'll give you this seal. There were many in company, wishing him a good journey; I did not hear him say where he found it. We staid and had some punch. I never saw Mr. Flinn since, till I heard he was taken into custody. I have known him from his infancy, his character was always a good one. I have worked with him here.</p>

               <p>Foster. I am a Dyer; I worked for Mr Honor and Graham in Montague Close, on the other Side the Water.</p>

A person came to me on the Tuesday sevennight following, and informed me a person had been with his wife the evening before, and offered such ribbands to sell; his name was Jones. I went to his house. I was informed by his wife who he was. I went and got a warrant; and, before I took him, he had surrendered himself. I charged a constable with him, and went and searched his house, but found nothing. Then I came back to him, and desired him to produce the person that he had them of. He did. I charged the constable with them both: I desired the constable to take care of them: He let both of them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090021"/> go, upon their promising to appear the next morning before my lord mayor; which they did, and were committed. He that offered the goods to sale was Saunders Joseph; he said he had them of the other man, which was the prisoner at the bar. Saunders Joseph said he had them of a German, an acquaintance, but did not know his name. I asked him how that person came to trust him with goods without knowing him? he said, an acquaintance recommended him at a public house. I asked him where that public house was? he said it was somewhere in Holborn, but could not tell where; he said he met the person as he was going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of your ribbands again?</p>
               <p>Kent. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. Saunders Joseph offered me a parcel of black ribbands to sell in November last, some single taffety, double taffety, pearl double, and broad edged ribband.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost quantities of such.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. He offered them at fourpence halfpeny a yard, and the worst of them were worth more money; I would not buy any of it. After he was taken up, he produced the prisoner, and said he employed him to sell them for him.</p>

               <p>Joseph. No. The prisoner bid me take 5 d. a yard, but, if I could not, to take 4 d. halfpeny, for he wanted ready money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner bring them to you in?</p>

            . I am Mr. Kent's servant. On the Tuesday sevennight after my lord mayor's day Mr. Jones came to our shop, and asked if we had lost any black ribband? I said we had. He said he lived in Petticoat Alley, and kept a Haberdasher's shop; and, if I went there, his wife could tell me further about it. He said, there were about 90 yards of different sorts of black ribband offered to her by a man. My mistress and I went there; Mrs. Jones told us where the man lived. I sent for him (that is, Saunders Joseph) to a public house, and told him I kept a little shop, and had an order for some ribbands more than I had got, and said, I was recommended to him by Mrs. Jones. He said, the man took them away last night; they are a particular friend's of mine, that lives at the other end of the town; I am going there, and I will inquire if he has sold them, and I'll let you know.</p>

I said I can put you in the way how you shall get on, and get something towards your expences; you shall guard the mail to Hounslow, and I'll speak to the boy to let you go further on to London, as he was going to Essex. He said it was pretty near 40 miles from London. I set out about six o'clock to meet the Bristol mail, and met it. When I came back I said to my wife, Where is Aston? She said, He does not go, he has got his furlough renewed. I was going to set out myself; and just at the time he came in, in a blue furtout coat, and said, he proposed to go, and he would go. He set out with my horse and arms, in order to guard the mail to Hounslow; it was a bay horse, with a good deal of white about his nose, and a blaze; about 15 hands and an half high. He had these pistols (Producing a pair of horse pistols, with brass mounts), and he had a blue furtout coat over his regimentals, no boots on; there was a halter tied about the horse's neck, besides the bridle. He set out about ten at night; this was the 15th of November. I saw no more of him till about seven the next morning; then he was only in his regimentals,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090022"/> without pistols. He said he got very safe there; but only one or two of the horses tired, and he had left the pistols at the Mile-house. Our little boy, who had been with an express, told me the prisoner had robbed a man on Hounslow Heath, and told me the waggoner that was robbed. Then I went to the waggoner, who is the prosecutor, and he told me a man had robbed him who was upon my great horse. I bid the waggoner to go to the Bull, and stay there. I went down and saw the prisoner talking to his wife; I said to him, Tom, here a re a good many people coming after me for a robbery on Hounslow Heath. He said, I will clear you, for I know you could not do it. Then I took him up; he was carried before a magistrate; he denied the fact, and said he had only three-pence half-peny when he went out; he did not deny being on that horse.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at him; be sure?</p>
               <p>Poulton. I am sure he is the man that stopped and robbed me. I know him, for he and I quartered in one house the biggest part of 12 months. I was there four days and two nights in a week, and he the biggest part of the week. I knew the horse he rode very well. He was dressed in a blue surtout coat; he pulled out a pistol, and held it up against my breast, and said he must have my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet the mail?</p>
               <p>Poulton. No, that was got into Hounslow before I came by.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Poulton. It was a small matter foggy, not so bright as it is sometimes; but I saw the moon very plain, it was light enough to see the money when I pulled it out, or to see what o'clock it was. I delivered my money in a canvas bag to him, it was about 50 shillings; he had a handkerchief over his head and under his chin; he had no boots on. He said, if I made any more words, he would blow my brains out. One of these pistols here produced is very much like that he held to me; the horse was a darkish bay, a blaze on his face, and a great snip on his nose, and a halter tied about his neck. I went on with my waggon to Maidenhead, and the first thing I did was to change my bloody cloaths; for, after I gave him my money, he demanded my watch. I said I had no watch. He said, D - n you, you say you have no watch, and you have a watch; and he up with his pistol, and hit me a knock on my head, and see me a bleeding. When I got to Maidenhead, I swore a man robbed me on that horse of Mr. Clack's; I never swore to the man till now.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not swear to him then?</p>
               <p>Poulton. I did not much care to swear to him, though I knew him when he was robbing of me: I did not chuse to be concerned in taking the man's life away,</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did you not say, before the mayor of Maidenhead, you could not swear to the man?</p>
               <p>Poulton. I said I did not chuse to swear to the man; that was my answer.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner to Clack. How long was I quartered in your house?</p>
               <p>Clack. I cannot say how long; but while in my house he behaved as well as any man in England. I belive he was at my house about three quarters of a year.</p>

The prisoner came into my house on the 16th of Nov. about half an hour after nine, with a brother-in-law, and two dragoons; he took out some silver from his left-hand pocket; I don't know much he had; he took out a sixpence to pay me; I said it was not a good one; he gave me another, and I gave him 2 d. out of it.</p>

            . I am petty constable; I had an order from the mayor of Maidenhead to take the prisoner into custody. I heard him say he had but threepence halfpeny in his pocket when he went to guard the mail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As we went to Hounslow with the mail, the first horse knocked up at Salt-hill; we got a fresh horse there. When we came to Crauford Bridge, another horse knocked up. The post-boy desired. I would ride farther for a fresh horse; I went and blew the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090023"/> horn at the gate, and said the horse is knock'd up, give me a fresh horse. I pulled my great coat off, and pistols, and laid them down, and sadled another horse, and went back, and saw the mail cart standing. I took the horse out; he set off again, and left me with the horse that was knock'd up. I rode a little way; he fell down upon my leg; I got up and drove him two miles and a half before me to Hounslow. There the mails were in the mail cart, just going off again. I found my horse in the stable loose. I put on my great coat and pistols again, and came away a foot-pace; he could not walk upon the stones at all. I came home to Maidenhead, and went up the by-way to Mr. Clack's stable, and tied the horse up with a halter. A gentleman got my furlough renewed for four days. Then some body came, and said they had found my colonel's bitch. I went to see her, but it was not the right. By-and-by Clack came and said, Aston, they are going to haul me away, come and clear me. So I went with him to the mayor directly. Then they took me in custody; I am as innocent of the affair as the child that is unborn.</p>

            . I live in Peter-street by Soho-square. My husband is a taylor. The prisoner lodged in the same room I did. My child Edward was five months old. The prisoner was going to see her brother-in-law in Old Bond-street; she took my child (being seemingly fond of it), and said she should not be gone above half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>S. Mulby. She said she was a servant out of place. She gave me part of a pint of beer when she went out with the child; she went up towards Tyburn Road; she set out a little after five in the afternoon on the 20th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the child dressed?</p>
               <p>S. Mulby. In a brown skirt, an old flannel petticoat, an old white gown, an old laced cap, and a black cap over it; old things, I do not think they were all above a shilling value. I did not see the prisoner till about four months after. I saw the child on the Thursday following, being the 23d of June. I had inquired about the streets, workhouses, and hospitals, and I found it dead at St. George's Hospital; it looked as if it had been drowned; it was naked, but I knew it. I have here some of the things it had on, which were taken off it at the hospital ( producing a pair of stockings, yellow shoes, an old coat, and a black cap).</p>
               <p>Q. How did you and this woman live together?</p>
               <p>S. Mulby. We were not enemies, nor over great. She seemed to be fond of the child. My husband was then in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when she was taken up?</p>
               <p>S. Mulby. She said before the justice, that she met with a woman as she was going along that was going to see a place at Kensington. She set the child on the edge of the river, and it gave a spring out of her arms into the water.</p>

            . I am the father of the child. I took the prisoner in St. James's about a month ago. When she was before Justice Wright she owned she had rested herself upon her elbow, on a bridge in Hide Park, and that the child gave a jump out of her hands into the water.</p>
               <p>Fra. Doby. I was going about business, and I met with the prisoner in Monmouth-street, the same Saturday night that she took the child out from its mother's.</p>

               <p>F. Doby. She was sober. I did not speak to her; she was walking along with her hands before her.</p>

            . Was the prisoner sober when she parted from you with the child?</p>
               <p>S. Mulby. I believe she had not drank before that day; she seemed very sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>We lodged in one room. I was an ironer to a landress at 3 s. a week. The poor woman was almost starved, and her child too. I had no money, and made away with an apron for 15 d. then we had some stakes and three pints of beer together. Then I said, if you'll let me take the child to my sister's I'll beg some silk to make it a black cap. She agreed to it. I took the child; and after that I met a young woman going to Kensington. She asked me to go along with her. I said I would, if she would help to carry the child. When we came to a house where are two centinels painted on wood at the door, near the park gate, we had half a pint of beer, and gave the child a crust, and went on towards Kensington. I stopped upon the bridge in the park, and suddenly the child gave a spring into the river. I strove to get it out; but being with child could not; and no foul was coming by at that time; and the woman was gone on. I was affrighted, and did not know what to do. I wished afterwards that I had returned to Mrs. Mulby.</p>

He staid with me about six or seven weeks, and went away on the second of December instant. Last Sunday morning, when my maid got up, she found a casement open, which I knew was shut when I went to bed. I missed about a bushel of flour out of a sack in the kitchen, two cheeses, a loaf of bread, and a pair of stockings from off a line.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure your house was made fast over night?</p>
               <p>Twyford. It was; I bolted the door with two bolts between nine and ten o'clock. A neighbour of mine had lost an empty sack on the Saturday, and he was inquiring about; and at last the prisoner was found in a barn, about a mile and a half from my house. There I went and found about half a bushel of flour, a loaf of bread, and a cheese, and my stockings on the prisoner's legs. I knew the stockings to be my property by a hole at the heel, and the bread of our own baking. He owned before the justice that he took these things for want of victuals.</p>

I stopped her and the spoon, and took her before the justice. Then she said she found it in Leicester Fields. The justice committed her; then she said her name was Duckson, and that she lived in Hedge lane. Last Wednesday she was re-examined; then she owned she took it out of the prosecutor's kitchen, and had scratched the name in part out with a file.</p>

She turned her back to the wall, and put her hands behind her; I threatened her with my stick if she would not deliver it. She dropt the book by my foot, and ran away. There was no person near me at that time but she. A young man came up, and said he saw her go down that lane, and said he would go with me to see to find her. We went, and came back and looked about, and as we came to the spot where she drop'd the book, there was she standing. We took her. I really believe, by the light of the lamp, the prisoner is the same woman. I knew nothing of the tobacco pouch, till the watchman took it off the ground where she was.</p>

She took me to a public house about 20 yards from where I met with her. She said she had been there before. I asked her what she would drink. She said, a glass of Usquebaugh. There was a man with me, that was to see me part of my way home. We had a glass each, which cost me four pence halfpeny. I pulled out my watch to see what o'clock it was; the landlord pulled out his; there were five minutes between them. I put it into my pocket, and came out of the house, and about ten yards from the door the prisoner took my watch out of my pocket with her right hand. I took hold of her by the left. I am very sure of it; for I felt her pull it out. I charged her with the watch. The watchman came, and took hold of her hand. She said, pray don't take me to the watch-house, I'll tell you where the watch is. The watchman took her a little farther; she said, for God's sake, don't take me any farther; and I'll let the young man have his watch. He said he would confine her first. She was taken to the watch-house, and searched; but it was not found. Then the watchman said I should be confined as well as she. The watchman and I went back together; there was no person about; we could not find the watch. I was confined in Bridewell till morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Tuesday morning, the 2d of this instant, between one and two o'clock, I heard watch called; I ran to see what was the matter. Said the prosecutor, A woman has picked my pocket of my watch. How shall I know that? said I; search your pocket. I held up my lantern, and looked him in the face, and found him to be a sober man. Said I, What would you have me do in this case? He gave me charge of her. I charged the other watchman with the man. Said the other man, Let's go back, and see for the watch. No, said I, let's go first to the watch-house, then we will go and see for the watch. Going along, she plucked me by the arm, and said, Watchman, for God's sake, don't let me go to the watch-house; call them back, and I'll tell you where the watch is. I called them; they would give no heed to me. She hung back, and begged and promised to shew where it was. When we came to the watch-house, she was sulky, and would not say where it was. We went to look for it, but could not find it.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutor and prisoner in the public house; I saw his watch out there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had been as far as Oxford Road, and happened to call in Drury Lane, and stopped till about half an hour after 11 o'clock. I came from there very near the bottom of Fleet-street. I went in at the Red Lion in Popping's Alley; and just at the turning the corner I met the prosecutor and another man; he asked me if I could tell him of a public house where the people were up. I said I believed I could, that I just came out of. I stepped back with him; he insisted upon my drinking a dram with him. I did not chuse it, but drank a glass of usquebaugh. He and the other man drank each one; they went away up Fleet-street, and I down. There is a turning into Black Horse Court. When I came to the lowest lamp the prosecutor came and put his hand upon my shoulder, and asked me where I was going. I said, Home. He said, I'll go along with you, and insisted upon going, and put his hand under my petticoats. I said I had a husband at home, he was mistaken in me. He threw me upon the ground, and my coats were all over my mouth. He set his foot on me to keep me down; I belive we struggled a quarter of an hour. I called watch; he called watch. He said if I would not let him do as he pleased (and spoke in a very rude manner), he would do for me. The watchman came up; and he said, I had taken his watch. The watchman said, Look in your pocket, may-be you may be mistaken. Going to the watch-house, I said, I think it would be a great deal properer to go back and look for it; for very likely, as he had opened his breeches, he may have dropped it in tussling about. The constable took me in and searched me. They went out to look for the watch, but found none. After that, he wanted to go away. The constable said, As you have given no proper account of yourself, it is proper to commit you as well as he, and so we were both sent to Bridewell. I never saw any thing at all of his watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When she was taken into custody, her cloaths were not dirty at all, the watchmen know it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Arnold. How were the prisoner's cloaths? did she seem as if she had been rolled in the dirt?</p>
               <p>Arnold. I saw no dirt at all upon her cloaths, neither did she complain of any-thing of that sort.</p>

She told me she had sheets, laced ruffles, sattin, paduasoy, and other things, in pawn; and, as she was likely never to get them out, she said, if I could raise about 4 l. to get them out, I should have the preference in buying them. I, by borrowing, got that money; there were two guineas, one half guinea, and a 4 s. and 6 d. piece in gold, and the rest in silver. She saw me put it into an unlocked drawer; we were to go at half an hour after three o'clock to fetch the things. I went down stairs, and left my child with a friend: When I returned, which was in about two minutes, I found her standing with a shirt in her hand, which she was about. Then she desired me to go and borrow a basket, in order to bring a haunch of venison home with us, that she pretended was sent her out of the country. When I returned, which was in about five or six minutes, she and my money were gone, all but one shilling. She then went by the name of Morgan; this was on the 2d of September, before she married Mr. Errington.</p>

The prisoner asked me, If I could give him money for a bill of exchange for 10 l. or 10 guineas. I had not had the bill a minute before two constables rushed in and took the prisoner away; and immediately Smith snatched the bill out of my hand. Justice Welch sent for me soon after; but I was so affrighted at their suddenly taking him away, that I could give very little account of the matter, not having sight of the bill enough to know it again.</p>
               <p>Brewer Smith. On the 22d of November the prisoner came to me at the Castle in Castle-street, Bloomsbury. He desired, I would call upon him at his lodgings, the duke of Bedford's head. I went in about an hour. We went to Brooks-market, and from thence to the King's-head in Leather-lane: There he shewed me a note or draft; he desired me to go and get the cash for it; he sealed it in a letter, and put it in his pocket. Then he went out; I asked him, Where he was going? he said, A little way farther. And just as we came by Bow Church he said, I must say I come from Mr. Cooper at the White-horse inn, Fetter-lane, and I was to personate the steward of Mr. Mason; I have forgot the name which he told me. We came into Canon-street. He shewed me the house of Mr. Wetherby, a wine-merchant there. Then we went to the cock and bottle, and had a pint of purl there. He said, This should be endorsed, but I do not ask you or any body else to endorse it. Then I went to the necessary-house to consider what to do, as he wanted me to personate another person, and was determined to have nothing to say to it; but I told him that I believed Mr. Ridgeway would pay the money, and accept the note. Then I went to the White-horse in Fetter-lane, and found, upon enquiry, that Mr. Cooper had not been in town since the coronation. I told Mr. Ridgway the transactions we had had that afternoon. Then I went to Justice Welch, and told him the affair. He advised me to take him up. I had appointed the prisoner to meet me at 10 the next day. I met him, and two constables were ready to follow us at a little distance. We went to Mr. Ridgeway's shop; he went in, and delivered this bill to Mr Ridgeway. I gave the signal, and the two constables came in and took him away, and I took the bill out of Mr. Ridgeway's hand. He was taken before the justice. There he acknowleged he himself wrote the bill, and that necessity had drawn him to it, and he did not know but if the bill had been sent to Mr. Mason, he would have paid it.</p>

I went out on the 5th of December about three in the afternoon, and left 22 new gold rings in one bunch, and five old ones in another, hanging in the window. In about a quarter of an hour I had a messenger came and told me what had happened. The other witnesses can give a farther account.</p>
               <p>Elenor Henderson. I am daughter to the prosecutor. After my mother had been gone out about five minutes, the two prisoners came in for a cap, which Flidger had pawned. We have a partition that parts the shop. I went to that part where the things in pledge are for it; I heard a foot come round the counter, and the prisoners whisper. Our maid had just washed by the counter, and, it being wet, I observed the print of a muddy foot as I was going round the counter. They were both together where I left them then. I said somebody had been round. Solowin said, who should be behind your counter? I said, very likely you have. She said, she had not. Then Flidger said, who is to behind your counter? I went behind the counter to see what was lost, and a young person called to me at the window, and told me a woman had been round the counter, and had taken something out. I said they should be searched; Flidger said, for what? They dared me to search them. Then I called a gentleman in; he said, no body should go out of the room till they were searched. Then Flidger said, come into the kitchen. I and the maid went there with her, and she delivered the 22 new gold rings to me, and Solowin had given them to her, and desired I would let them go.</p>

            . I was going by Mr. Henderson's shop at this time; and, stopping to speak to a young woman in the street just by the window, I was looking in, and saw Solowin go behind the counter, and take down the rings from the window. I saw the upper part of her body at the time, and am certain it was she. She took also a little parcel; but she let them fall. I called and told young Mrs. Henderson; then I went into the shop, and am sure to the person, though I never saw her before to my knowlege.</p>
