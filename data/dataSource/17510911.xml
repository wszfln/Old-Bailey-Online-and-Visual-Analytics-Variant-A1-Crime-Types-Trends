I wanted to go to the synagogue there, and thought it would do me a deal of good to read there; and also to lay out some money, if I could see any thing worth while. There were then 554 duckets; I always carry my money girded about my body; I stop'd at the Red Lion at Brentford and din'd and had the money about me then. I paid my reckoning with some English coin; I staid there till about half an hour after three, then I went to Hounslow, to the Coach and Horses; I did not stay there a quarter of an hour. I got to the prisoner's house a little before seven; he lives at Cranford bridge ; I went into the sore room, no body was there, a young woman came in when I call'd for a pint of beer, a penny-worth of bread, and a penny-worth of butter; within half an hour, as I was eating it, the landlord came in; I made a bow to him, and ask'd him if he would drink, and also if he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110003"/> accept of a lemon: he took it, and went out of the room: the young woman came in, and ask'd if I design'd to go further?

I said, I'd pay as a merchant, a groat or six pence. Then she went away again, and another young woman came in and asked me if I was ready to go to bed? this was about eight o'clock. After that I pull'd out a book, and was reading: I had also a pen and ink, and wrote down how to call for beer, butter, &amp;c. I went to bed a little before nine: a young woman lighted me up, and she gave me to understand by signs, I must turn the candle upside down when I was in bed. I gave her to understand I should knock with my stick when I was in bed, for her to fetch it, which I did, and she came up and fetch'd it accordingly, and lock'd the door, and went down stairs. Then I am sure I had the girdle and money about my body upon my shirt; I went to bed so. When it was almost twelve o'clock, I heard the door come open, and saw my landlord, the prisoner, come into the room with a candle in his hand alone. I started up in my bed and ask'd him in Dutch what was the matter? he answered, sleep, sleep, there were no curtains to the bed, the landlord went away, and lock'd the door. I did not move out of the bed but went to sleep, and I believe it was between three and four o'clock, some body took hold on me and put a hand to my mouth, and with his knee squeez'd me to the bed. I struggled up and there were two men, it was the prisoner that took hold on me, I could see his face by the moon light; the other person took from me my girdle and money, and went to the window and drew back the curtain, and shot the money out into his hat. I found the girdle in the room on the ground; the girdle produced in Court made of leather like a purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the prisoner's face before the curtain of the window was drawn back?</p>
               <p>Symonds. No, I could not: he continued holding my mouth; when the other had the money in his hat, I heard him say to the prisoner, I have got the money; then he took the money from the other person, and went down stairs. I got up and opened the window, and call'd I am in distress, once or twice, &amp;c. in the German language, this was as soon as they were out of the room: I heard them lock the door, they came in again directly upon my calling out at the window. The prisoner stood behind, the other person came, and knock'd me down; and in the mean time gave me a punch in the face; I don't know with what; then he took a knife and held to my throat, and said; bush, bush - your life : from which I understood, if I did not hold my tongue, my life was in danger. When they went down, I went to the door, to see if it was fast, and found it shut; I held my shirt up to the wound on my head; he shew'd a small scar on the top of his head: I put my cloaths on, and went to go down but did not chuse it. I watch'd at the window; when it was daylight somebody came and opened the door softly, when there was a coach call'd at the door. I went down, and the coach was gone; the landlord and two servants stood at the door; I went to him and said, you have my money, (in Dutch.)</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat it in the same manner you did then?</p>
               <p>Symonds. I said, you have my moone when you knock me down, you must be slung by the naik, (making signs to his neck) they laught at me; then I laid down my stick and my knapsack at the door, and went away towards London; a servant came after me, and desired me to come back ; I did, then the landlord shook his hand to me, and desired the servant to hold me fast. I was affrighted and took up my things and went away, crying. I went to the Coach and Horses, where I had quartered the week before at Hounslow, there I complained and shew'd my bloody shirt, but could not make them understand what I said, Then I went to Brentford ; there I had chang'd a ducat, and had about five shillings English money in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two persons that came into your room search your breeches?</p>
               <p>Symonds. No, they did not: when I came to London I complain'd to a merchant, Higham Levi, of whom I had be spoke watches to the value of a 100 l. I had also offer'd 40 l. for some second hand cloaths, that came from the Princess of Wales's ; I had also been looking upon some knives, and corkscrews, and was to have paid for these things, when I came back from Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, as you was to dispose of so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110004"/> much money in London, to carry it all with you to Bristol, such dangerous times for robbing as is now?</p>
               <p>Symonds. I only bespoke these goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not lodge it in the Bank or elsewhere ?</p>
               <p>Symonds. I have been a merchant ten years, and have travell'd in Turkey, and other places, and never trusted my money out of my sight.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, the money was first seen in England, by a custom-house officer, who had got the girdle in which it was, to search it; who seeing it was gold coin, returned it; that he also shewed one piece at the Coach and Horses at Hounslow, and told the landlady it was worth 9 s. 6 d. a week before he was robbed, where he had lain one night; that his feet were blistered, and he returned to London again; that it was very light in the room; that he had no hurt on his head before he came there that night. When he heard the coach come, it was between five and six in the morning; that the key was the inside the door when he went to bed; that there is no synagogue at Bristol, but a room where the Jews come together; that he had not sent word before hand of his coming; that 100 ducats of this money was his own, and 350 belonged to chancellor Corroney, the governor where he lives under, and the rest to another gentleman in that dominion, named Gobernator, that he was to have bought fine second-hand suits of cloaths for the governor's lady to wear, and also to buy watches for them.</p>
               <p>Higham Levi deposed, they landed together at Harwich ; that they first met together at Helver, and he saw the ducats when the officer wanted to examine the girdle; that he recommended him to a lodging in Duke's place, at

               <p>This man, the prosecutor, came to my house, when I was in another apartment with a gentleman drinking a bottle of wine. I went into the kitchen, and was told there was a strange man in the bar room, (he had ask'd for some bread, butter and beer, some of my people had carry'd it to him) he was eating it; I went to him, and he made a sort of a congee to me two or three times, he had a lemon lay by him, which he almost insisted upon my taking, which I did, and went out of the room into the kitchen; my man came, and said he wanted a bed; said I, you know I never make beds for foot passengers; tell him he can't lie here. A little time after this, my niece came, and desir'd I would let him have a bed; said I, take the lemon, and give it him, and say it is impossible for him to lie in my house; for I have a family coming, and the servants will take up all my beds. There was a gentlewoman there, which came with my niece, and they then both desir'd I'd let him lie there that night, which I did: the chamber-maid shew'd him up stairs, and fetch'd away his candle; the next morning he came down stairs, and said he had been robb'd. I was much surprized; he said it was by two men that came in at the window, pointing up to the window. I went up-stairs, the curtains at the window were drawn, and the windows were as clean as possible, not so much as the print of a cat's foot, and the key was on the inside the door; he threw down his belt and stick, and went about half a mile towards London; he came back; said I, are not you a scoundrel and a villain to say you have been robb'd, to bring a scandal upon my house? Go and fetch a constable, said I; then he took up his things, and went away. My cook said, I have known two or three people ruin'd by such things,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110005"/> as those, where houses have lost their characters on such accounts. I then went with a friend with me, and pursued him as far as Brentford turnpike; we heard of him two or three times upon the road; then we went to Turnham green, where we had a Negus: we return'd back to Brentford again, but could hear nothing of him there; then we got a man to go and search all the houses in the town, to see for this Jew; we went to the Red Lion at Hounslow ; being fatigued, I staid at Mr. Roberts's till the morning, when I went home to Cranford bridge, from whence I went in a post chaise to Smithfield with another person, and bought a horse: we then went and spent the evening at Sadler's wells, from thence to the Salutation in Newgate-street, and likewise to a great many parts of the town, and were never a-part from the time we got up to the time we went to-bed; this was on Saturday: the next morning, when I got to Mr. Roberts's at Hounslow, he shew'd me the advertisement, which struck me much; I took my horse, and went home and clean'd myself; soon after came a messenger to let me know this man was in Hounslow ; I went to take my horse to go there; somebody told me he had a warrant against me; I thought it more proper to return back than to fly in the face of the warrant; every-body desir'd me to go away till I could hear what it was. I said I had no occasion to fly; they insisted upon it I should; then I went over to Hatton, but said to several friends nothing vex'd me more than to think I should fly for an innocent thing; from thence I return'd to Hounslow; then Mr. Roberts and I went in a post chaise-to London, in order to have advice ; and upon that advice, I went and surrendered myself up to justice.</p>

            . I am niece to Mr. Godard, who keeps the White Hart at Cranford bridge; this day fortnight, in the evening, the Jew came in about seven o'clock; our drawer and I were in the kitchen, who went into the bar room that is near the road; our drawer went to him, and came back again, and said he ask'd for beer, bread and butter; he ask'd for some water; our drawer carried him some, and presently after that Mr. Godard came: I said, uncle, there is a very odd fort of a fellow in the fore-room, they tell me he is a Hermit ; accordingly he went in, and the man pull'd off his hat, and ask'd, in English, if he was landlord ; I said, yes; he had a lemon lay by him that he had taken out of his bag, and insisted upon Mr. Godard's having it; saying, pray, sir, have it; then he took it, turn'd round, smiled, and went out of the room. I asked him, where he intended to lie? but he gave me no answer: I ask'd him again; he said he was a Polish merchant, and dealt in diamonds, watches, and such things; then I ask'd him a third time; he said, he would lie here; I then told him we never lodg'd any foot passengers. I understood him he said he would give 6 d. but since I thought he said, be at any expence, which I mention'd to Mr. Godard ; he said, how could you ask him, knowing I never lodge such kind of people ? At that time he had shew'd me no money; I told him, here is a family coming, and a gentleman and his servants would take up all our beds. He said, he would die here, for here was his money. Then I went to Mr. Godard again, and said, suppose you was in this man's country, and to be turn'd out at such a time, you would not like it; then he said, let him lie in the dining room bed, there being no furniture on that bed. Mr. Godard went to sleep. I believe, by the kitchen fire: I told the Jew he might lie there; then I found him with a book in his hand, and folding his hands together; I thought it was a prayer book. He took out a little leather purse with clapses, in which I saw about six or seven shillings, and paid me 13 d. for his eating, drinking, and bed. I asked him if he would please to go to bed; he said, he'd speak when he had a mind to go to bed. I talked to him a good while; he asked the name of the place, and I told him; he set it down in a book; I saw he wrote backwards. He asked my uncle's name, but I could not make him understand it; then I gave him a printed bill, and after that he could say

             as plain as I cou'd; presently he said he'd go to bed. I called the chamber maid about a quarter before nine; I never was out of the room from him: he went to bed, and the maid fetched away the candle; my uncle was never in the room but that one time with him; he produced no belt nor gold to my uncle or me; neither was my uncle in the room when he pulled out his silver. When I came down stairs between seven and eight the next morning. I heard he had been robbed; then I went up, and found there was some blood on the sheet, the bed only turned down, as is usual, when one person gets out of it, and not disturbed at all: there was one drop of blood by the window, and two or three more by the bedside; the blood looked very black, as though it had been old blood kept in a bottle two or three days.</p>

I ask'd him if he would blow the candle out? he made signs that he would knock with his stick, which he did, and I went and fetched it; he was then in bed, and I pulled too the door, which is a spring lock. I cannot tell which side of the door the key was on, but in the morning it was on the inside. I heard no noise all the night, only that of the coach stopping: my young mistress was in the room with him all the time he was below, but I was in but twice, and saw no money of his, nor heard him say any thing about it.</p>

A waggon went by much about four, I lay down on the bed, and got up again between five and six, there was no calling, had there been any I should have heard it. My Ld.

I and two young men that lodged with me, went up the new street to Whitehall, and went down King-street, Westminster; there we saw Hunter, and Jebb, the last had a sack in which was the carcass of a Sheep; we took him to the watch-house and took it out; we could not tell whether it was a weather or an ewe Sheep; we took Hunter on Monday in the New-way Westminster ; on Sunday Justice Lediard sent the sheep to the prisoners at the Gatehouse, and they were all committed there.</p>

The three prisoners and myself went out with a bag, in order to steal some potatoes, out of the fields at Kensington; we saw some Sheep; then we concluded to have one instead of potatoes; we spread ourselves and drove them up to one corner; we catch'd a Sheep and a Lamb; we let the lamb go, and stuck the Sheep; then we took it into the next field, and skin'd it, and took out the guts, and flung the head into the hedge.</p>
               <p>Q. To the prosecutor; where did you find the skin and guts?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found them in the next field to mine.</p>
               <p>Evidence continues. We put the carcass into the sack, which was the very carcase the Justice ordered to the Gatehouse; we were all concerned in killing it.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's house August the 29th, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, and began to abuse his wife, calling her old whore, and old bitch; she said if he would not be quiet she would go out of the house; she went out, he followed her with a knife in his hand, which he held in his hand two or three minutes before she went out; the door had a hasp and staple, to put a padlock on, he hasp'd it and kept me in; he said God had been very good to him, that he had not done it before now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention what?</p>
               <p>A. Phipps. He did not, my Lord; this was spoke after he had taken out and open'd his knife: he said he'd rip her up, as she did that fowl; she was drawing a fowl for dinner; she cry'd out, the rogue has stab'd me in the belly; and was fallen down. I shook the hasp off the staple, and got out, she never spoke more. He went into the house and sat down, she was brought in by 2 men, she gave one gasp after she was in. They strip'd her directly, there was a wound in what is call'd the Pope's eye, on the inside the sore part of her thigh, the other stab was in the arm; she had bled all through her cloaths; no doubt this wound was the cause of her death. She flung dirt or a brick bat at him, for hasping the door upon me (I believe) but it did not hit him; she said, you rogue, you want to ravish her, as you did you know who; then he ran to her and stabb'd her; she was my mother's own sister.</p>

I was about three yards from the prisoner when he stabbed his wife in the fore part of her thigh; he said, there you bitch; she fell. and then he pulled down her cloaths; she called out to have a constable, saying, the rogue will murder me. She died in about three minutes after he went into his house with his knife in his hand; for I saw her when she was dead, and the wound was on her left thigh.</p>

            . On the 21st of July, between five and six in the evening, my wife and I had been at the chapel at Highgate; we took a turn in the chariot by Hornsey, and coming home again <placeName id="t17510911-16-crimeloc69">in the back lane from Hornsey</placeName>

I imagined they were drunken fellows playing tricks with one another; they were very dirty. The prisoner came up first with a pistol in his hand, saying, we are poor unfortunate fellows, your money, your money. Another man came on the other side, rapped at the glass, and said, your money, watches and rings, make no delay; I then gave him my silver, which was about 15 or 16 s. half a guinea, and a silver medal; then he said, your watch, don't trifle with us; I gave him that; then he saw a little ring on my finger, and said he must have that; I told him it was not worth taking, for it was only a burial ring; he said he must have it, and then I gave it him. The prisoner told the coachman not to look at him, telling him, if he did, he'd blow his brains out, and bid him not stir 'till he was at some distance; they then rode off through Highgate. I never saw the prisoner 'till that day, and about 11 or 12 days after I saw the prisoner before the justice: I described the men and the horses, for the prisoner rode a bay horse of no great value. I told the justice, I believ'd the prisoner to be the very man, and upon my oath I believe him to be one of them; I make no doubt of it, tho' I found none of my things upon him.</p>

I cry'd out, and a young man came up, and said, what, Staffordshire Nan! I thought you had been in Newgate. I don't know that young man, nor have ever seen him since she went from me directly. Two days after, I ask'd a woman who was selling fruit in the Broadway Westminster, if she knew one Staffordshire Nan; she told me she was then in Tothill-fields Bridewell. My husband and I went there, and told the thing, and that I could know her if I saw her. I saw 14 or 15 people, but neither of them the prisoner; then the man call'd her by name, and she came D - g her eyes very badly; said I, was not you in the Park on Sunday night? she said she was, but did not rob any body there. Said I, you rob'd me of 12 s. then she threw a pipe at me through the grates.</p>

            . I am a prisoner in Tothill-fields Bridewell, but have at times, when the governor is out of the way, the care of the prisoners. The prosecutrix came and ask'd for Staffordshire Nan; I took her down, she call'd for Staffordshire Nan; the prisoner was smoaking a pipe, amongst the rest; as soon as she appear'd, the woman tax'd her with the robbery; the prisoner us'd many bad expressions, and threw a pipe at her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you alone?</p>
               <p>Daniel. I was all alone, except my shoes tied up in a handkerchief. I saw three men standing by a lamp, two of them had hats, and one a cap: They crossed over to me: then I turned up to make water, in a yard. One of them got hold on my collar, (for they did not give me leave to button up my breeches) the other on my shoulder on the other side. I thought I saw a sword, but it was a long piece of iron. One swore he would knock my brains out if I stir'd, the other came and took off my hat, and put it on March's head; then Newman put his hand in my pocket, and took out one shilling and sixpence. March said, D - n him, he has more money; then the other took out a pen knife, and took from me my handkerchief, and shoes in it. After this they run from me, two one way, and one another; and thinking to catch one of them, I called out, stop! stop! stop! but I saw no more of them that night. I know the two prisoners were two of the men, for I saw their faces by the lamp. The Evidence and March are the two that laid hold on me. The Evidence had the one shilling and sixpence. I met with two men, to whom I related the matter, and they had like to have been taken that night. I likewise told them where I liv'd. The next day I was sent for, and went the day after that to the Horseshoe in Clerkenwell; there I saw the Evidence; then I went to the Justice's, and in going met the two prisoners coming back. I described the penknife, before I saw it, at the Justice's. [ Produced in Court, and deposed to.]</p>

            . On the second of September, the two prisoner and I set out from an empty house in Black-boy-Alley, about eight o'clock at night, with a full intent to rob. I had been acquainted with March about five weeks, but not so long with Newman. We came up Saffron-hill, and seeing the prosecutor, I walked by him two or three times, and looked him full in the face. I followed him into George-yard, where he was making water, and took him by the collar; Newman had this weapon in his hand; [it was produced in court ; being a piece of iron about twenty inches long, proper to break doors open with,] and March had hold on his coat, not his collar. I took the shoes tied up in his handkerchief, and gave them to Newman; the hat March had, but I took it, and also one shilling and sixpence out of his pocket. March took the pen-knife. This is the very same knife. We were pursued, and March and Newman were taken, but they got away again, and I met March at our place of rendezvous. We went then from Black-boy-Alley to St. Giles's, and I had some victuals out of the money. Next morning we were coming up Purple-lane, and Woodward Harlow laid hold on us. I went and found Newman, after I was admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Woodward Harlow. Going into Purple-lane that night, I met one Mr. Burry. I heard a man cry stop; and seeing a lad run along I laid hold of him, crying, I have got you, but he got from me; however, I got his wig, and this piece of iron. I was told at the end of the lane, that Tim the taylor was seen with two more going through such a place. I saw the prosecutor soon after, but he made a more hubble bubble story of it then, than he has now; he was in such a slutter, I could hardly understand him. He told me he lived by the King's Bench, and mentioned the things he had lost. The next day, as I was coming home to dinner, I saw Tim the taylor (that is the evidence) and March coming along, I took them, and brought them to my room. When I told them of this robbery, I took this pen-knife out of March's pocket; upon which he fell a crying, and said if I would let him go to his father, and give him that knife, his father should give me twenty guineas. Tim said, I am a neighbour's child, and,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110012"/> if I don't do it, he will. Will you speak to the Justice to get me admitted an evidence? March said, he was out of his senses, or the devil was in him when he did it. I sent for Mr. Burry. Then I left March in my room, and took Tim to shew as where Newman was. He took us to Goswell-street, were we took him, and carried him before the Justice; then we took him to March, and March fell a crying. Said Newman, You whining son of a b - ch, what do you cry for, confess and be hang'd, you can do no more at last? Newman owned the wig, and my having him in my arms the night the robbery was done, but would not own to the iron.</p>
               <p>Newman's Defence.</p>
               <p>Coming along I met Tim the taylor; he stopt me, and said what chear? I knew him by fight, and he asked me to go and drink part of a pint of beer; I reply'd, I don't care if I do. He took me up to a wall, and bid me stay there; then he brought me a hat and a knife; as soon as he had brought them, a man came and called out thief; another man laid hold of me, but I slipped from him, and he got my wig in custody.</p>
               <p>March's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was with the other prisoner. We met Tim the taylor, who said he was going to his master's house, but being afraid to go in, we staid waiting about a good while; at last he came running down from George-yard, and put the hat on my head, and gave me the pen-knife, saying I might keep it, for he did not want it. Then Woodward Harlow came and laid hold of this lad, and called out stop thief; I ran, but did not know what it was for. I met Tim about an hour afterwards, he asked me to go and dine off of a shoulder of mutton and onions; I went, but the woman had none; then she put on a sauce-pan, and boiled a whole breast of mutton. She then sent out a young woman for some strong liquor, and Harlow came in, and said if I would not fit still, he would blow my brains out. He took the knife that Tim gave me directly from my pocket. I did not know he had robbed any body.</p>

The moon was about full, and being a light night, I saw all their behaviour. There was a single piece fired before a word was spoke, that I heard; then Old York called out, G - d d - n your soul, resign your prisoner. The gang then drew up against the house. After that they had surrounded it, Old York gave no time for me to consult my assistants, but immediately ordered the whole gang to fire; by his directions they continued firing near an hour, and they shot down 169 quarries of glass from the windows; and there happening to be four gentlemen lodged in the house that night, one of them knew

            . On the 25th of April last, about 12 at night, I was returning home from White-chappel, I had got about half way down Houndsditch; I saw two fellows arm in arm: I did not like the looks of them; I crost the way, they walk'd on, till I came to a place call'd Church row; I stood considering with myself, which way I should go; I went through <placeName id="t17510911-29-crimeloc139">Church row</placeName>

The other unbuttoned the wasteband of my breeches,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110015"/> and put his hand in my pocket, and took out 3 s. then I button'd them again; then he took off my hat, and upon my telling him it was a very old one, he gave it me again; after that the fellow that collar'd me insisted upon bussing me. He put his hand round my neck and did buss me; then he bid me stand still till he was out of sight; I told him I would, he walk'd about 10 or 12 yards from me, and turn'd about with his pistol and said, if I stir'd he would shoot me; there I remain'd till I thought they were quite gone; then I went home. I was very near a lamp, I did not see his face that pick'd my pocket, I saw a good deal of the other's face; I cannot pretend to swear it was the prisoner, but he is exactly the shape, make and voice, of him that collar'd me. I believed him to be the man when I saw him in Justice Fielding's house; I said the same I do now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at the Justice's he was rob'd of 5 s.</p>
               <p>Bright. I said five or six shillings: I think still I lost five not knowing what I had in my pocket, but I swore safely to 3 s.</p>

I met her in Chancery-lane the Thursday following; and told her, she did not use the gentleman well to disappoint him; she said she would meet me in half an hour at the Chambers; I went about my business, and at the time went to the Chambers; there I found her in great disorder ringing her hands, crying saying her master was rob'd; I saw the rooms were very dirty, the bedding taken away, and the feathers scatter'd about; there lay a few feathers upon the mastress; the glasses, which were large panes of Crown-glass, to the book, case shatter'd to pieces, 10 or 12 of them; all the books taken out except a few small ones, which were at the top where the glass was whole. She said the windows were unbar'd; I look'd upon them and said they could not have been opened without hands from within, having all locks to them, being then fast lock'd. They look'd as if they had not been open'd for a twelve-month,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110016"/> I believe they had not for some years. In the back room there were 13 or 14 drawers forc'd open. She said she always kept the key in her pocket, and that she, and her mother before her, served Mr. Lloyd twenty years.</p>

After I had given him my purse and money, as mentioned in the indictment, he said to my wife, who was in the chariot with me, Madam, have you no purse, or money? or words to that purpose: she then gave him her purse, but what was in it I don't know. After that he went on, and I looked out and saw two stage-coaches immediately following us, who stopt as I did, and I saw him attack one; then he came by my chariot, and rode into the town of Action. I had a black boy with me on horseback; I ordered him to follow him through the town, and raise the town. I saw no more of him till one day this week, when I saw him in the Bail-Dock.</p>

            . I was coming from Cornwall towards London on the 31st of August; the people at Isleworth called out, stop a highwayman ; I asked which was he; they then shewed me him, and told me he was in blue; I then said I would have him, and accordingly rode forward, and going very strong after him, they called out, and told me he had pistols. I said I did not value him, nor his pistols neither. I got up to him, and ask'd him if he would surrender? but he rode on; I then struck him twice with my whip; he went to shoot me with a pistol over his left shoulder; I then took him by the collar, and he fired that instant, and some of the powder blew into my face, for I was behind him. I then pulled him off, and we both fell between the horses, who ran away; I got upon his back, and pulled his hands behind him, and he called out to me not to use him ill, saying he was a dead man; this was on Smallberry green. Then a great many people came up after I had secured him, and Mr. Carpenter searched his pockets, and took out the things produced here. The things were all delivered to the Justice. He was dressed in a large blue coat, a black waistcoat, a light-coloured coat under the great coat, and his hair tied up behind. I did not pursue him above a quarter of a mile.</p>

            . I live in King street, Bloomsbury-square; I know nothing of the fact; the prisoner was my servant when he was apprehended, and had lived with me about four years; he always behaved well. I went out of town that morning, and desired him to stay at home till I returned. I never had any reason to suspect him of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that pistol yours?</p>
               <p>Leeland. I believe it is mine.</p>

I asked him whose they were, he said his own; but I seeing Mr. Gladen's name wrote at length on the bottom, said, Don't you know one Mr. Gladen? he said yes; so I carried them to Mr. Gladen's, and the prisoner followed me. He was then secured, and owned the stealing of a sauce-pan, which Mr. Gladen had lost, and sold it, and said he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>

               <p>Q. What goods?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Tea and brandy to be brought from Flushing. Potter was one of the head of the company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your money?</p>
               <p>Salmon. I left mine; I know not what the prisoners left. I was ordered to come there again in ten days time, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners there then?</p>
               <p>Salmon. No, they were not. At this time I was told by one of the company, a west countryman, when to come for the goods, which was February the 23d. I went on the 23d, and lay there all night; and the two prisoners came on the 24th before night. There were assembled at the Buck's Head between thirty and forty, all armed with one thing or another.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two prisoners armed?</p>
               <p>Salmon, They were both armed, each of them had a carbine flung across his shoulders. We went away the 24th, in the evening. Four of our men were first ordered down to Felextow, which is about thrity miles from Thwaite, in order to wait the cutter's coming in, and to take care of the goods; the rest of us went to a place called Cleydon, within four miles of Ipswich. There we staid till the first of March; the prisoners were with us. Being out of money, I was obliged to go home for some that day, When I came to Cleydon, the company were gone back again to Thwaite, to wait there, upon which I went directly to Felixtow; and going along, I happened to overtake a man, one of the company, who was going to inform them the cutter was come in. This was on the first of March, and the goods were just then put on shore. We rode the goods up three or four fields from shore, being afraid of a custom-house smack, that had seized the cutter. We found she was seized about midnight, and we were afraid she would put her boat on shore, and find the goods. There were fifteen hundred weight of goods left on board the cutter, when she was seized, but one boat load was brought on shore the next morning. The main body of smugglers came down to us in the fields; the two prisoners were amongst them, armed, and they loaded their tea on their horses. We rode away all in a body to Claydon, sixteen miles from Felixtow, where we stopped at a publick house, on our horses, to refresh ourselves. At that time

It snowed very hard in the morning; we were very cold, and sent him up for a bottle of gin, and he was apprehended. He rode with a carbine, and the officers knew him.

I asked when I must come for the goods, I was told I must come about a fortnight after, and then they could tell me; then the prisoners were there. I went the second time, and I was told to come about four or five days after. I went at the time, and staid at the Buck's Head; the night following the two prisoners came, and the rest of the gang.

               <p>Larrett. They were, each with a brass carbine. We staid at Cleydon three or four days; there were soldiers in the country, and we thought it not safe to stay there, so some went back to Carbold's house, at the Buck's Head, and some to other places; some to the prisoner Brook's house, for he keeps a publick house, to wait the cutter's coming in. When we had an account the cutter was come in, we rode down very hard to a place called Felixtow; then the prisoners were also with us, armed. We met some persons before we came to the beach, who told us Captain Martin had seized the cutter, with some of the cargoe; the rest of the goods was secured in a field. We went there and loaded, and the prisoners had each of them a share. It was a bitter snowy day, and the prisoners had great coats on, buttoned over their carbines.</p>

               <p>Larrett. I did both of them. Then we went in a body to Cleydon; we staid there and refreshed ourselves a little while upon our horses, and some of our company went to the sign of the Greyhound, and beat the man there, thinking he gave information concerning the cutter's coming, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Pring. I know them well; they were both there at that time, and have been there several times after this. I set out for Kent, and staid but one night, and in about a week after I met the company at Cleydon in Suffolk; this was about the 25th or 26th of February 1747; we concluded no-body should ride without arms, and the prisoners were then both armed. Carbold had a remarkable brass carbine slung under his great coat;

We went to Felixtow, and got there about nine o'clock the next morning, and found part of the goods carried up into a field or two from the beach; it was tea in oil-skin bags to the best of my memory, between 20 and 30 hundred weight, which was left, and the cutter was taken with the rest. When I came there, I found the man we sent over was apprehended going over, and had thrown my orders away; so I had no goods there, but staid in a friendly way to help them to load. Carbold had a hundred weight to his share: I believe Brook was there, but I can't remember to be certain. When we were landed, we returned to Cleydon, and were told the reason of losing the cutter was, that one Hallwood had been to a Justice of the peace at Ipswich, and had given an account that we were at Cleydon looking out, which was the reason the Custom-house vessel went out, which enraged us against him; he keeps the Greyhound, and some of the company went and beat him, sure enough, for it.

               <p>Q. Were the prisoners there?</p>
               <p>Trottman. They were. I went down to Felixtow, in order to wait for the vessel, and staid there three or four days. I went there the 1st of March, which was the day the cutter arrived; we then carried the goods from the beach (it was all tea) into the fields, for fear of a seizure. We saw the Custom-house vessel at a distance, who took some tea as it was coming in the boat to shore. There were about four of us to assist in carrying the goods up into the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the rest of the company arrive?</p>
               <p>Trottman. They arrived about ten o'clock the next morning, and landed the goods on their horses, and rode away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two prisoners come in the morning?</p>

On the next morning I went down, betwixt four and five o'clock, with one of my men, in order to direct some of them to be killed, and we found but thirteen; but as I could not see any place where they could get out, by looking round, I immediately concluded they were stole. I then called upon one John Brown, a labourer, and ordered him to go and look up and down in the little shops, to see if he could find any large lambs. After this I had word from my drover, about three in the afternoon, that he saw a man dressing two large horn lambs in the morning, about four or five o'clock, at the Queen's Head in Rag-fair, and that there was some of the meat hanging up at the front of the house to be sold. Mine being horn lambs, as described, I went to Justice Manwaring, got a search-warrant, and ordered my drover and another man to go there, and call for a mug of beer, and observe what they could. They went, and when I came, which was after them, I saw two hind quarters of ewe lamb, and one of a weather lamb, hanging at the door; I made a stop, and look'd at them. There was

             there, who ask'd me if I would buy the quarters of lamb; I said they were very good, and ask'd if he had more of them. He took me into a back house, or shed, where I saw four quarters of lamb lying, and a hind quarter hanging upon a string in the middle of the place. I asked what I should give for them, and I think he said three pence halfpenny per pound. I said they were very good, and asked who owned them; he said, I own them, and that man, pointing to one Pain, that stood by. I said to Pain, Do you own them? he said Yes, and that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110027"/> man, pointing to Berry. Then I gave a man the warrant, and bid him fetch a constable, and the drover went out with him. As soon as they were gone, Berry endeavour'd to get out, but I stopped him; and when they returned, I went to searching the house. In the vault was found part of the head of a lamb's skin, with my mark upon it, which is a clip down the face. We took Perry before Justice Manwaring ; where we had not been long, before there came a messenger to tell us, that they had taken one of the sheep stealers. I went, and found it was the prisoner Smith, as he called himself, but his proper name is

            . The Justice examined Smith, and he denied it at first, but at last he said he'd tell the truth. He said Pain and he were down at the field - then the Justice made his Mittimus to Bridewell. We took him to my house: there he confessed he stood upon a hog tub without, and the other, Perry, went over and tied the lambs legs, and gave them over the pales; that then Pain and Perry carried them to the end of Virginia-street; there he took the lamb that Berry had, and he and Pain carried them to the Queen's Head door, and knocked up Mr. Hust, that keeps the house ; that they went backwards, and killed them in his shead, and he dressed one lamb, while they took off the skin of the other; that then Pain and Perry carried the skins out, and sold them; that they only gave him some bear; and that he did not know what they sold them for, nor where. I got up on Sunday morning, and went to the Fellmongers, and found the two skins at Mr. Browning's, in Barnaby street, Surry. On the Monday morning I went to my drover, who knows my clip, and took him to Mr. Browning's? where he saw them. There was the grasier's mark, an M, on the near hip, and my mark was a clip on the off hip, about the length of a finger. We carried these two skins to my fell-monger, to compare them with some I had sold there, and they exactly agreed. I also made a clip down the face, but the faces of both these skins were gone. I can swear they are the skins of my lambs by what I saw.</p>

            . I am drover to Mr. Jones, and drove the lambs to Mr. Jones's field the Friday before; there were 15 of them, who were all branded on the near hip with an M. and clipped on the off hip and down the face; they were all horned lambs. I was going over the water to meet a drove of lambs the same morning they were lost. I came to Mr. Hust's house, and heard a knife and steel whetting, but could not see any thing; Mr. Hust ask'd me to go for a keg of gin for him, which I did, and was gone about three quarters of an hour; then I sat down there again, and heard the knife and steel going again. and asked to go backwards to ease myself in the yard, where I saw the prisoner, Smith, cutting the skin off the head of a lamb. I looked up at the lambs, and said, they are two good lambs; he said, so they are, too good for Rag-fair. I let my master know this, so he sent Brown and I, and gave Brown three half-pence to call for a pint of beer at Mr. Hust's. Q. Did you observe the mark upon the skins then?</p>

I live facing Mr. Jones's field: on the night before the lambs were stolen, I was up about eleven at night with a neighbour next door, and there came two men, whom I thought might belong to Mr. Jones; I looked at them very narrowly, and they went off from the light of the candle, my house being at the corner, they stood a little time, and leaned over the pales, looking into the fields where the lambs were, They walked from thence towards my house, and I desired my neighbour to let me have a candle to see who they were, one of whom was a poor looking man with a great coat on, and the other white frock. I said to them, who do you want and one of them ask'd, if I knew one Welch, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110028"/> name I knew nothing of; he said he liv'd in the street, and keeps lodgers.

Mr. Jones came and ask'd the price of the lambs, and I said they were three pence halfpenny per pound; he ask'd if there were any more, I told him there was a lamb in the yard, and he went to lock at it; said he, is it yours? I told him no, it belong'd to them two men, and they say they bought them in Smithfield, I have nothing to say to it; then Mr. Jones insisted upon taking hold on me, but they both got away; at last Smith was catch'd, and brought before the Justice. I was in bed about half an hour after nine o'clock, and did not get up till after six; I sell meat at Mr. Hust's door, and have many months.</p>

I know Perry, he is a tenant of mine; he has liv'd under me about half a year, and I never observed but he worked hard for his bread, and behav'd well; I never heard any body challenge him with being a thief in my life; the morning these lambs were found, (being on a Saturday) I got up between six and seven o'clock to see my shop open'd; this Perry came and asked a neighbour to lend him a stick to go to Whitechapel with his tray, as usual; he used to go a peddling with meat.</p>

            . I have known Perry some time; he is a butcher, and has bore a very good character ever since he came into our neighbourhood; I live in the house where he does, and the night before the lambs were found at Hust's house, I heard Perry and his wife in his own room about nine o'clock: his wife lock'd the door; my wife had been out, she call'd me to open the street door, and ask'd how it came to be fastened so soon; I let her in, and desir'd her to bolt the door after her. I went to bed a little after ten, and got up about three in the morning, and found the street door bolted; I let a man in about a quarter after five. I am a taylor, and was at work, and nobody could come in or out at the street door, but I must see them, I sat in such a position. The prisoner came to me about half an hour after six, and asked me for a stick to go to market with, and after that went out.</p>

My money lay in the one pair of stairs, this was in August, but I don't know the day. She had done business for me two or three times before; I paid her, and she was to have come again the next day, but did not. She came to the sign of the Hampshire hog, facing St. Giles's church, about eight or nine days after, drunk, in a coach, and had bought herself new cloaths, silver buckles, and fine things, a pair of tabby stays, a fine black hat, and fine shoes: she sent for me there, and I went to her; she called for a dram, and paid me 3 s. she owed me before ; she had not silver enough about her, but pulled out half a guinea, and asked if I could change it. I took it, gave her change, and looked upon it, knowing her to be poor and miserable before. I told my money the night before I set her to clean my rooms, and remember'd one half guinea to be a Queen Anne's, and that there was a black spot on it by the side of the cross; I was struck with a damp when I looked upon the half guinea I had of her. I ran home directly, thinking she had been robbing me, when I missed my money, the drawer being open, and not a halfpenny in it: I will take my oath this half guinea is mine, producing it in court, for I never had any body went into my room but her; it was a chest of drawers, and I had the key in my pocket, and they were locked. The day I employ'd her, there were in them 20 guineas and four half guineas, pinned up in a little bag, which was to pay for my coals, and she knew that well enough.</p>

               <p>E. Wilson. He is going into the fourteenth year of his age. The drawer must be broke open, for I could not lock it afterwards. My husband never had any money out without first asking me for the key, and I don't believe he has taken a shilling out of that drawer these three or four years. Upon missing my money, we sent after her, and she was taken and put into St. Giles's Round-house by the constable, the 22d of

I heard her say, if they would go and fetch her master, (if he would give his note) she would pay 4 l. 10 s. a year, till the money is paid; his name is Radman; he keeps the Black Dog in White-cross-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own to the taking the money?</p>
               <p>Flannigin. She said she knew nothing of that. I was with her before the Justice, and she made the same offer there. She was a very miserable creature before, but now she was well dressed.</p>

            . I told the money, I think, on the third, fourth, or fifth of August; there were twenty guineas, and four half guineas in a drawer, in the chest of drawers, which was always kept locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the key?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Sometimes I do, and sometimes my wife; but she had it most, and if money was to be paid, she generally went up for it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this money missing?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I believe it was on the 23d of August,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110031"/> about ten days after she cleaned the rooms; then she came to change the half guinea at the Hampshire Hog; there was a black spot upon one of the scepters, but it is now scratched off, though I dare say there is a dent there. I can swear to this half guinea, if it was put amongst fifty more, holding it in his hand. [The jury well examined it, but could find nothing upon any of the scepters to distinguish it from another.] She was asked how she came by it, she answered, May be some cull gave it me. She said, if I would let her go where she was going to be hired, her master should give a note for 4 l. 10 s. a year, as long as she stayed there.</p>

Betwixt the eighth and ninth of July my kitchen forewindow was broke open; the spring to the key was broke off before, so that by turning the bolt round, the key would fall out; which was the case here. All was fast over night, when I went to bed, which was betwixt nine and ten, but when I got up, which was about a quarter after four the next morning, (having heard a noise about three quarters of an hour before) I found the kitchen window open, as also the door; there was likewise a pane of glass broke before, through which hole it was easy to pass a hand to open the casement. We then missed the goods mentioned, and the linen taken from below. There was a door broke to get up stairs in the garret, which is my work-shop, from whence I missed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110032"/> tools mentioned, and the silver boxes to watches. I had been at work over night, between eight and nine o'clock, with the vices, and saw the boxes lie before me.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I was out this night, and came home about half an hour after ten, and went up to bed. I lay in the work shop, but heard nothing, till next morning Mr. Abraham came to me, and told me all was open below, and the things gone. About a week after the prisoner and the evidence were taken. The evidence told me the tools were at the pawnbroker's on Snow-hill. I went there, and they brought me a hand vice, a pin vice, and dividers down. I went back to Baily in Bridewell, he said they were all there; then I went to New Prison, and the prisoner said, I do assure you the tools are all there. I went to the pawnbroker again, then he brought me another hand vice, and a pair of old nippers. Produced in Court, and deposed to by Mr. Abraham and this evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Sharwood. He did not positively say he was along with the evidence, but he did in part. I did not ask him whether he was one or not that robbed the house.</p>

            . About ten weeks ago, about half an hour after twelve at night, the prisoner and I went to Mr. Abraham's house in Lamb's Court, where we turned the pin of the window, and the key dropped out. I opened the shutter, then put my head throught the hole where a pane was out, opened the casement, and took down a pair of white curtains from that window, and handed out some knives and forks. We both got into the house, where we took a shift, two caps, two aprons, and a table cloth. Then we went up into a garret, which was a work-shop; there we took four silver watch boxes, two pair of hand vices, a pair of nippers, and a pair of dividers. We sold the four watch boxes to one Scampey, a Jew, for five shillings, and the prisoner pawned the tools at three different times upon Snow-hill, at the Three Balls, and I stood at the door each time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he did not meet me near the Fleet-market, and say, As you are cleaner than I, do you go and pawn them for me.</p>
               <p>Baily to the Q. Yes, I did. We had got no money, and I said you may as well get some money on them, for you are cleanest.</p>

Two of the window-shutters were open at the ground window, and one of the hinges was wrenched; the sash slides sideways, but I am not sure whether that was put too before I went out. I missed the goods mentioned in the indictment, and advertised them. Shortly after I was sent for to Justice Chamberlain's, for Baily's brother-in-law came and told me, he thought he could help me to my things. I went with him to Islington, to the Duke of Cumberland's Head, there Baily owned the thing very freely, and I found some of the goods; the others were brought to me by the prisoner's own brother. I asked Baily how he came to serve me so, because I knew him when he was a boy. He said he was sorry for it, and hung down his head. The prisoner directed me to Mrs. Wood's, at the corner of St. Ann's Lane, where I found some of the things. The goods produced in Court, and deposed to.</p>

About half an hour after nine, between Codpiss-row and London Spaw, in the new road, where the prosecutor's house is, the prisoner and I found the shutters all fast, so that we could not get in; at last I stood upon the prisoner's shoulders, and put my hand through the window shutters, pulled back the bolt, and got the shutter open. There were a great many things lay in the window. We both went into the house, took the things mentioned, and hid them in a ditch in a field amongst some nettles. Some odd things we sold.

               <p>Q. What do you charge him with?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. On the 18th of July last, between nine and ten at night, I was going by his door from my lodgings; my husband was gone to his work, being a journeyman baker. The prisoner shoved me into his house.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Did he say any thing to you?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. He did not say any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Was any body by?</p>

               <p>Q. What happened then?</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he standing when he shoved you in?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. He was standing in the street before his own door. The first place is a carpenter's shop, and he shoved me through that into the kitchen, keeping his hands round my waste till he had got me there. I went backwards all the way.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he doing the time before his brother went to bed?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. He was standing by the dresser, where he pushed me first.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Did he undo his breeches?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. He did, in about a quarter of an hour after I was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>

               <p>C. Kensey. I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you hurt?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. I was not hurt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come away?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. I staid there all night, after he had laid with me.</p>

               <p>C. Kensey. No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go home sooner?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. I was afraid to go out, because I heard some people about the door, all night, talking, and he said I should not go whilst they staid there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he aim to lie with you after that?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. No, he did not, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to sleep there?</p>

               <p>Q. What time next morning did you go out?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. I did not go out till next morning day light; I believe it was between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110034"/>Q. How came it you did not call out to them people for help?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. If they had been honest people they would have wanted to open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go when you went out?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. I went to Mrs. Hyde's, a cook-woman's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what he had done to you?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. I staid there three hours. Mrs. Jones, my uncle's servant, came and fetched me home. My husband sent her.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you chuse to go to the cook-woman's house?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. Because I did not like to go to Mr. Sturt's ; for he said I should not come in there. I went to Mrs. Jones's house, and there I told her the prisoner had forcibly lain with me.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her the same day?</p>

               <p>Counsel. How high is the dresser?</p>
               <p>C. Kensey. It was not very high.</p>

               <p>C. Kensey. He was standing against the dresser near me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. I live across the street from where she lodges; the day after this thing was done, the woman came to my house, after dinner her husband came to my house, and desired I would go to her at the cook's shop, and tell her there was one at my house wanted to speak to her; there I found her crying; and when she came I left her husband and her together; he was very angry with her; presently Mrs. Laurence came, then she and I went in together, she told us she was going for some vinegar, and pepper, to eat with some cucumbers, and he stood at his own door; that he clap'd his two hands upon her, and shov'd her into the kitchen, then he shov'd her up to the dresser, and ordered his brother to go to bed; then he blew the candle out, she told us no more. This I know, it is the parting her husband, and she, and will be for ever.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Laurence. The next day I went to her, where she was at her lodgings, at Mrs. Jones's, about one o'clock; she told me between nine and ten o'clock she was going for some vinegar, and pepper, for some cucumbers, and he shov'd her in, and blow'd the candle out; she did not say a word what he did, after the candle was out; neither did I ask her.</p>

I said what do you mean? then he took a pistol out from under his right arm, and pointed it to me, saying, come, come, give me your money. His horse's head was in my chaise; by the posture<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110035"/> he held his pistol, it seem'd to be confin'd under his arm. He said he would not take my watch from me; so I suppose he saw the silver chain hang out. Then I the more readily comply'd ; I held out 4 s. and a few half-pence ; he took it, and look'd at it, and shook his head, and said, it would not do, he must have my watch. I was at a stand, to know whether I should dispute it with him; then he said, come, come, be quick; what are you at? taking out his pistol again. Said I, if you must have my watch you must. He took it, and away he rode, as hard as he cou'd, towards Acton. He was alone, I am very certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . On Monday morning July eight, between seven and eight o'clock, Shepherd came to my door; I look'd out, she said come down and open the door, saying Mrs. Barret desir'd I'd come for her bellows, she wanted them at the Marshalsea-prison; her husband was a prisoner there; I let her in, then she said she was to go up and make Barret's bed; she went up, and kept making a great rattle; I went out, when I came back, I went to lift the box; I was going to put my husband's cloaths where the money was, and the cover came up with my hands. I call'd Shepherd up, and told her the case; she said never be affrighted, may be your husband has done it to affright you. When she got out of the door, she run away. After she confess'd to 14 s. I ask'd her how she did it; she said she did it with one of my husband's chisels; that she shut both the doors, and carried the box into Barret's room, to do it. I ask'd her where the chisel was, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110036"/> told me upon the top of the Chimney-piece; when I came home, there I found it. Our room is on the same floor as Barret's; she went through our room to go to her's; I know nothing against Barret.</p>

               <p>I go out a Nurse-keeping; Mrs. Barret being at the Marshalsea prison, with her husband, I went to see her ; she told me I might lie along with her. I went and told Mrs. Rogers, she was willing I should be there a time. I lay there three nights, on Saturday morning I went to the prison, to Mr. Barret, his wife was drunk at the door, he had given her a black eye; when I came to Mr. Rogers he said, if she or I offer'd to come there, he'd break our necks. On the Sunday morning I went and told her; she said, she would move her goods, and take another lodging. She desired me to go to Mr. Rogers's, on the Monday morning, and bring her bellows; I went and knock'd at the door, she insisted upon it, she should not have them; I went and told Mrs. Barret, she would not let her have them; at night Mrs. Barret came and told me, Mrs. Rogers charg'd me with breaking the box; the next morning Mr. Rogers dragg'd me into an ale-house, and the constable insisted upon searching me; and pull'd out a great many things from my pocket. He took 8 s. and 6 d. out of my hussive, and carried me to Sir Samuel Gore, and then to Bridewell; I never was up the stairs, Mrs. Rogers would have for give me, if I would have sworn against this other prisoner; her husband is in the Marshalsea-prison for debt.</p>

Then I heard the watchman go, past three o'clock ; after that I heard the noise like some shot coming in at the window. I had a candle burning in the room; I desired my wife to lie still, and not to move the curtain, fearing that should give them notice: there was an old rusty sword lay upon the Chimney-piece, which I took and draw'd; I went to the back door and turn'd the key two or three times very fair, but could not get it open. I call'd a man and told him, there was somebody breaking into the house. He got up, but not being able to open the door, I went up to jump out of a one pair of stairs window; then the man came in and call'd, and said, he had open'd the door; I ran out and ran along the lane, there I saw the prisoner at the bar and another man, breaking the window; when I came within three yards of them, they ran away and I after them; they kept along the houses, going along Mile-end road. I call'd stop thief; they turn'd to go into the fields, then cross'd to go over a little bridge, there they both fell down; I running pretty quick fell down upon them, and got hold of both of them; it was exceeding dark, one of them got away; I hugg'd the prisoner with his backside to my breast; he turn'd round, and with an Iron weapon struck me over the head; I believe I might lose my senses some little time; but I know for certain, the man was never out of my arms; I believe the scuffle might last about ten minutes. I had got him upon the ground, and had got my sword up, underhanded, to kill him, by striking the point in him; it was a cut and thrust sword; the blood from the wound, upon my head, was running down my eyes, which almost blinded me. I at that clear'd my eyes of the blood; there I saw

We brought him into the house, and delivered him to a constable: then I found my self bruis'd, and terribly cut. I was naked, he shew'd a scar on his head; we found the window broke, and the end<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110037"/> shutter taken down; all the under part of the window was broke, Some of the things were shov'd out of their places.

            , who called me, and I went out and heard somebody say, I have you. I ran, and just as I came up, I heard a blow ; I took hold on the prisoner, and we carried him to the prosecutor's house. I saw the shop shut up over-night, between nine and ten o'clock, and saw the paper of snuff and the ink-stand upon the dunghill after the prisoner was taken: the window was broke so, that a man might put in his hand or head; a piece of the groove at the bottom was broken off, and one shutter taken down.</p>
               <p>The servant maid deposed to making all fast over-night, before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said he had been admitted an evidence, and one Ward, against whom he gave evidence, was cast and executed. See No. 311, in this mayoralty.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Why was he not prosecuted for this when taken?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I then had the command of a merchant ship of 500 tons, and sailed December 28, but did not return till August 8.</p>
               <p>The Justice's clerk was examined, who committed the prisoner, but no account could be given that he had made a confession of this burglary.</p>

I saw the prisoner bring her down Wild-street, and carry her into the White-horse-yard behind the gate, one was shut, and the other open, and in half a minute I heard the child scream out; she brought it out, and said, hush, hush. Let me go home to my mamma, said the child ; (I was dressing a horse there) I thought it was not the prisoner's own; I saw a woman, and asked her if she knew the child; then I went and laid hold of the prisoner, who said it was her child, and that I had no business to lay hold of her in the street.

I saw this woman coming down Wild-street, and go into White-horse-yard; after she was in a little time, she came out with the c hild in her arms, and the child cried out, pray let me go to my mamma, pray let me go to my mamma. I heard the prisoner say, it was her child: I then went with Mr. Hatfield to the child's mother, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110038"/> there the prisoner offered her a pair of gold ear rings she had at home, if she would let her have her liberty.</p>

On Sunday night last was seven weeks, the prisoner and prosecutor were both brought in to me, and they both charged each other Burk charged M'Ardel with stealing about three guineas ; after some time the prisoner said, if Burk would make it up, he'd send me where I should have the money: he sent me to one Mrs. Clark, in Hanover-square, which is a lodging-house, to ask her for the money. I was to tell her it was the money of her acquaintance's; I went and did my message; she bid me go out and call for a pint of beer, and she'd come to me, saying, if she had any money, she'd carry it with me, but she run away without me. When I came back she was coming away, and talked in Irish to him not to own the money upon any account; my wife was by, and heard it, and told me what she said. I then took her up, and she said when the prisoner changed a thirty-six shilling piece, he owed her some money, so she gave him forty-one shillings; he said he'd give the prosecutor that, and go to harvest work for the rest. The constable has the money, but he is not here.</p>
