I could not kick him in the face: I had my hand round his neck. I got up to walk away, when another man came and caught hold of me Then three or four men got hold of me, and started knocking me about, and I started again. When the policeman came up I went with him, when somebody started hitting me, and they expected me to go quietly."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Allen, in his defence, said:</hi> On the night of this affair I was walking round Pimlico, when I heard cries of "Stop thief!" and I ran, with about a dozen more, and after I had run about a hundred yards two men caught hold of me, and nearly choked me. I said, "What is this for? Why don't you let me go?" I did not see the struggling on the ground, and they must have taken me for somebody else. I am quite innocent. I own I kicked the man. I do not know anything about the chain, I have been travelling the country.</p>

I am a carpenter and joiner, of 13, Caledonian Street, King's Cross—on April 11th, about eleven o'clock, I entered the Lord Keefe, in York Street, Marylebone—I was sober—I called for what I required, and while there my watch chain was snatched by the prisoner, who was by my side at the bar—he did not say anything—I did not see him when I entered the house—I believe he came in while I was there—I left immediately after I had drank what I had ordered—I was in the act of drinking when this was done—as I left the house I saw the prisoner following me outside the house—I did not see anyone else at that time, but I was struck from the rear a severe blow at the side of my head, which cut me—I was partially stunned—I was on the ground—my walking-stick was taken from me—I found out afterwards that my watch was gone; it was was perfectly safe when I left the house—I could not swear to the person that struck me; but I recognised the prisoner, and am perfectly sure of his being one of the two I saw as I turned the corner after becoming conscious—I went direct to the station and reported my loss, and gave a description of the prisoner—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my stick—I had it under my arm when? was struck—the property I lost was about 30s.</p>

I was formerly barmaid at the Punch Tavern, Fleet Street—I have known Ancourt 14 months—I had been very friendly with him, and he had offered me marriage, and borrowed money from me—I was with him one day in January in an omnibus, and he showed me a cheque-book—I saw the amount of £305 or £350 in a corner of it—he asked me if I had any money—I said "No"—the cheques were a pinkish colour—I did not see a name in it, he closed it up too quick—I know Rousby as Captain Yardley—I saw him once at the Punch Tavern with Ancourt, Johnson, and another man who I do not know—Ancourt and Johnson went out—I have seen Johnson with Captain Yardley three or four times—on March 30th, before he was arrested, I met Ancourt—he told me that he was in trouble about the cheques and that Hillier was outside the public-house in Dean Street and a man came up to him and gave him some cheques and Hillier gave them to Ancourt and asked him to take them and told him afterwards that they had been stolen—I have a pen and ink in the bar for the use of customers and this cheque is with that ink (<hi rend="italic">Coloured</hi>); that is similar to what I use—I have corresponded with him and had some letters from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have thirty-five rooms, and he had No. 25—we have a good many customers—I am <hi rend="italic">valet de chambre</hi> and manager—I have a good deal to do—I wait at dinner and breakfast, and prepare the dinner—I do not cook—it was at the end of February the man came, not on March 1st—I do not think it was the day after February 18th—I serve four or five people with breakfast of a morning, and some come down after they have dressed—he had a box, and I hat box and a small box—it was not a wooden box, but a tin one—he had no portmanteau—the box was not very new; it was thin—I never looked to see if there was a name on it—he did not say where he came from—he had a silk hat in the hat-box—he always went out with a silk hat—he had not a dark overcoat with a velvet collar; he had a green-dark overcoat, short—he had no hat but the silk one—this is an interesting case to me; I have listened to the evidence to-day—I heard it very well, arid heard something about a green coat.</p>

I was at Gravesend then. After I got back to London on 25th I got a drop of drink; I do not know where I went to"—he signed that—later on he made another statement, that "I further wish to say I was in the beer-house"—that is, Bott's—"half-an-hour before I was given into custody, I changed half-a-crown; the bad shilling must have been amongst the change. It was given to me by the witness Potts"—he signed that—on the Sunday I saw him in the cell—he spoke about Gravesend and said "I saw the gentleman who keeps the lodging-house. At 9.30 I went to the railway station, but the man would not give me a ticket, and I 'walked to London through the snow and without boots."</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at 66, Anglesea Road, Plum<lb/>stead—I am a florist's assistant—I am twenty years old—in October last I saw this advertisement in <hi rend="italic">The Stage</hi> newspaper. (<hi rend="italic">For amateurs and novices to complete caste of a first-class theatrical production just com<lb/>mencing tour, education and refinement essential; commencing salary; costum's provided</hi>; <hi rend="italic">expenses paid by management; small deposit; interview by appointment; with full particulars, enclosing stamp, to address, Box Y</hi> 927, <hi rend="italic">care of</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Stage</hi>," <hi rend="italic">London</hi>.) I intended to commence work on the stage, and so answered it—I have had previous experience in amateur acting at Plumstead—I received this circular in reply—(<hi rend="italic">of Miss race Anderson's spectacular tour of the drama of</hi> "<hi rend="italic">The Indian Mutiny," by the late Dion Boucicault</hi>.)—and on October 28th I wrote for an interview in the assumed name of "J. Elfod," by which I was known, and on October 29th, by appointment, I went to 27, Chesterton Road, Notting Hill, where I saw Barton—he said, "Your appearance is satisfactory; I am willing to engage you on these conditions, that you pay me the sum of three guineas"—he offered me a part in his company—he stated that they were going on a summer tour, and would be starting in about a month's time—I was to be engaged at 25s. a week—my parts were to be a "Serjeant" and "Sullivan" in <hi rend="italic">The Campbells are Comin'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Relief of Lucknow</hi> in "The Great Miss Anderson's Touring Company"—I made an appoint<lb/>ment for the following Saturday, when my father, who went with me, paid him three guineas and got this receipt, which I saw him write—he showed us some press notices of his playing—he wrote out the parts of "The Ser<lb/>jeant" and of "Sullivan," and gave me the paper while I was there—he did not copy it from anywhere—he said Miss Grace Anderson was gone for a change of air to the seaside, and that he would supply me with a Serjeant's costume smothered with gold lace—he asked for my measurements, and my father afterwards sent them—I took my part away and learnt it thoroughly in about two weeks—I was not still at work as a florist, so that I had leisure—I wrote to him afterwards and called about the middle of November—he said there was something wrong with the measurement of my uniform, and he would take me to the costumier—I never got any costume—my father wrote to him, and I got this letter—I did not wish to resign. (<hi rend="italic">The letter stated</hi>: "Do I understand you wish to resign your engagement? If so, kindly say so; so that I may inform Miss Anderson.") I never saw him again, nor got any communication from him—I received a post-card notice from Acton of a rehearsal, after I had seen this case re<lb/>ported in a newspaper—I did not go to Acton—I have had no part of the three guineas back—these parts are out of <hi rend="italic">The Campbells are Comin'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Shaughraun</hi>, but I understood from Barton they were in the same play.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>). I am a theatrical and fancy costumier, of 2, Arthur Street, New Oxford Street, London, established for twenty years—I have known Barton for eight or nine years—I have done business with him eight years—I have known him as an actor at the Mary<lb/>lebone, Elephant and Castle, Novelty, and Salder's Wells Theatres—I have supplied him with costumes for plays and sketches repeatedly—his dealings have been satisfactory—he is a good actor, especially as "Miles" in <hi rend="italic">The Colleen Bawn</hi>—he is a better actor than a financial manager, who, if not acute, is likely to get robbed—he has mentioned to me the plays of <hi rend="italic">The Shaughraun, Colleen Baton</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jessie Brown</hi>—I dressed <hi rend="italic">The Colleen Bawn</hi> for him four years ago—in the profession that means finding all the costumes, wigs and properties required, including shillalahs, guns, swords, etc., but not scenery—he has recently very frequently come into my shop</p>

               <p>for grease, paints, and that sort of thing, and talked about "boiling down" plays for provincial tours, where the parts, dresses and properties are considerably cut down—he asked for the three pieces what notice I re<lb/>quired—that was last autumn or the summer—I told him three or four days, because I have the stuff in stock, and have dressed it repeatedly—that would apply to <hi rend="italic">The Campbells are Comin'</hi>—usually we are paid a month in advance, but I said to him, "Don't let the money stop your tak<lb/>ing out the piece, conditionally that I know all the towns you are booked for, and you pay at the end of the week," otherwise I should take the stuff back again—I did not require a deposit from him, as he was an old customer—he said he should take out some amateurs, and they would take a lot of coaching before he would allow the piece to go on tour; that it was difficult to get them together, and he could not give me the exact date when he would be able to inform me about the dresses—I required him to put on the bills and programnes, "Wardrobe, wigs, etc., supplied by Edward James Smith, Arthur Street, Oxford Street"—I produce copy of programme of <hi rend="italic">The Shaughraun,</hi> which I have dressed this week for the St. George's Rifles—if ordered, I could supply the same to-night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The talk about the tour was a general conversation—I considered I was going to have the "job"—something light would do for the besieged in Lucknow—amateurs have funny ideas of dressing—the ladies would be dressed very nicely—I do not know that pink silk and diamonds would be correct—I had no order for a Serjeant's uniform—it might be for burlesque—I do not know that I have heard of Miss Grace Anderson in connection with Barton—he said the tour was going to last some time—we had not arranged the price—it would be about 30s. a week for <hi rend="italic">The Shaughraun,</hi> and 50s. for <hi rend="italic">The Colleen Bawn,</hi> the full caste, without the supers; we double for them—I supplied him with dresses some months ago, and an Irishman's dress—I think he bought that right out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He said the "start" would depend upon his rehearsals—on tours you make things do, and you can hire anything—the cost of scenery, lime light, and necessaries of putting <hi rend="italic">The Shaughraun</hi> on the stage would be about £5 a week—<hi rend="italic">The Colleen Bawn</hi> about the same—you could utilise the same scenes with very little alteration, and there would be stock scenery in the theatre—a touring company may start with very little money, and become a great success—very likely, after the Gordon Highlanders have distinguished themselves in India, <hi rend="italic">The Siege of Lucknow</hi> would "take on."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographic artist, of Spring Valley, High North Road, Finchley—I have known the prisoner since 1889—I lent him various sums, and in 1892 he gave me an I O U for £86 3s. 5d.—he went abroad about 1892—I saw him again in 1895—he showed me an extract, and asked me to advance money to get a patent for it—the first sum I advanced was in 1895, and on August 1st, 1896, he came again for £233 for machinery—I kept an accounts book, in which he wrote his name against the sums I advanced—on August 23rd I have an entry of £233; I drew the money in notes from the Birkbeck Bank, where I had an account, and £3 in gold—he signed for several items together—this pencil writing is his—at that time I was paying him weekly, sometimes £1, sometimes £2, and sometimes £1—I made entries of those sums, but not in this book—the first receipt is for £149, another is for £84 3s. 6d.—these marks in the corner of receipt C are his figures and he paid 3s. 6d. out of his pocket—on August 24th I advanced another £10 for registering the patent in my name—he gave me this receipt for it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but I had to ask for it several times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew him as an intimate friend many years before I had transactions with him—we are both Germans—it was about November</p>

               <p>14th, 1896, that I first had occasion to think he was a dishonest man, I then believed he had deceived me—on August 21st, 1896, he assigned to me his interest in these patents for the consideration of £400—we then came to a settlement of account—the balance of the £400 was in my favour, but we arrived at a balance before that date—I handed my solicitor this paper, showing a balance of £20—it is not correct that on August 26th, 1896, the total sum advanced would leave a balance of £65, which I had advanced to be paid to him—it is not true that by August 21st I found that £65 was due to him to make up the consideration money—I was Cross-examined on this very question by Mr. Carson in the libel action—I mean to say that on that date I did not pay the prisoner £60 or £65 to make the consideration money—I paid over £20—Mr. Kemp was my Counsel—he re-examined me, and we had settled up the accounts in August in some way, when I took the assignment, and on the same day I drew the cheque for £233—he was to take the £60, or whatever it was, out of the £233; but that wants explanation; my then solicitor, Mr. Shepherd, asked me what he had received, and there was a balance due to him of £60; but between those dates there was a long interval, and he received other money, and actually received more than £400—he said, "Never mind, you make up the balance between our<lb/>selves," and that is why I paid him the £20, and handed him £233 after<lb/>wards; that included the balance he had to apply for machinery—when I said that he had to take it out of the £233, I suppose I did not see the meaning of it—we came to an agreement to buy the patents for £100, and in order to see whether I had to pay him anything, we set to work to see how much I had lent him up to that date, and I found out in August that I had lent him more than £400—I gave my solicitor the materials to draw up an affidavit, and he read it before me—that affidavit was used in the Chancery proceedings, and judgment has been given—I did not advance the £400 for the machinery alone, nor did it include the £233—I do not say that the words "three and six" on this receipt for £84 3s. 6d. are in Kensett's writing, nor is the "three and six" in figures, they are the prisoner's, and so is the "70," and the "14," and "August," and the writing on the stamp—I have no doubt about it—I came into possession of this actual document on November 14th, 1896—I asked the prisoner for all the vouchers and this was included—it was returned to him—I wanted them to go through the figures to see how he had spent the money, but the figures were so mutilated that I could not, and I gave them back to him, and he promised them back to me the following day—I did not keep the receipts in my hands for three days—I am prepared to say the receipt is not in the same state as it was then—I am prepared to say that the receipts were exactly in the same form as when they were handed to me—they have been in my possession since November 21st, 1896, and my solicitors handed them over to me—my solicitors informed me about January, that an action had been brought by Bennett and Shears against the prisoner, who were seeking to make me liable as a partner—they sent me a statement, but I do not remember seeing one similar to this (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—I first knew on March 3rd this year that he had never paid us the £34 3s. 6d.—I am not aware that I had to pay the amount of the judgment which Bennett and Shears recovered against the prisoner, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250053"/>
               <p>I paid £300 odd—I only saw a statement of what was due to Bennett, Shears and Co.—I can swear, with confidence, that I have not paid them £84 3s. 6d.—I talked to my solicitors about that—I have never said that I would ruin this man—I have said that he is a bad man and a fraudulent man, but not that I would put him into prison—I said that I would prosecute him—a man named Crepin was in the warehouse in 1896—I did not go round to Mrs. Bartholomew and the prisoner's creditors and tell them he was a thief and a scoundrel, nor did Crepin—I know that he was prosecuted before Justice Darling and sentenced to four months—I paid the expenses from beginning to end—I gave no instruc<lb/>tions to Mrs. Bartholomew—I did not tell her he was going to leave the country, nor do I know that Crepin did—I am sure Crepin never wrote this postcard (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), but the Special Jury found that I had and that he had incited Crepin to write these very cards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The action was brought against me for calling this man a thief, and also with respect to these cards—with regard to calling him a thief, the Jury awarded him a farthing, and £5 in respect of stating that he had appropriated money—Crepin retains it still—I was led to think him dishonest, because I found on the counterfoil a figure "2," which looked as if there was an erasure—I afterwards found that he had drawn a cheque for £25 and appropriated the money—in the account he called it £2—he put that in his pocket—I had an account in June, 1896—at that time I owed the prisoner £20—that had been wiped off before that date—the money I gave him afterwards was to pay for machinery, and I believed he had paid for it with the £232—I had no reason to doubt his honesty then.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 213, St. Alban's Road, Watford—I am manager to Mr. Phineas Hands, a money changer, with an office at Charing Cross—I know the prisoner through his coming to the office and cashing cheques for him—on December 20th he called between five and six p.m. and asked me to cash this cheque for £64 for £62 cash—I asked him how he obtained it—he said it was a money transaction of Honor—I gave him £62 and paid it into the bank—it was returned marked as it is now, "Orders not to pay"—there were subsequent proceedings against Honor and Tyrwhitt—there was a judgment against Tyrwhitt—Honor got leave to defend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The writ was issued on December 23rd—judgment was signed on January 16th—before Christmas I did not know that the cheque was a forgery—I knew it was unpaid—upon January 16th I knew it was a forgery—my principal knew also—no criminal proceed<lb/>ings were taken against the defendant till April 18th—Mr. Honor's place is in Jermyn Street, about ten minutes' walk—the cheque bears our stamp, "Foreign Money Exchange, 16, Strand, W. C."—between January 14th and April 18th I had not seen Mr. Honor, neither to my knowledge had Mr. Hands—I applied for a warrant against Honor—in the information I swore that I had been defrauded of £62, and had been put to considerable legal expenses, and had been unable to find Tyrwhitt—we left the matter to our solicitor—between January 16th And April 18th I had not endeavoured to find the prisoner—Mr. Hands, my solicitor, put it into Mr. Newton's hands—he is a relation of Mr. Hands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, living at Bagshot in Surrey—the deceased, Emily Jane Popejoy, was my daughter—she was seventeen years of age in November last—in October, 1896, she went into the prisoner's service at 14, Pitt Street, Kensington—she had been in a situation for about twelve months prior to that, in October, 1896—when she left there she was in good health—there was nothing at all the matter with her—she was not stout, or particularly thin—I did not see her after she went to the prisoner's situa<lb/>tion till she returned home on November 24th, 1897—I saw from time to time the letters that she wrote home—I used to see them and pass them on to her sister—I saw the first letter she wrote home—that was about a month after she had gone into the service—after reading it I sent it to my daughter-in-law (Emily) at Aldershot—I knew on December 23rd that Jane was coming home on the 24th—I knew that from this letter from Mrs. Nicholls—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" 14, Pitt Street, Kensington. December 22nd. Poor Janey tells me she sent her Christmas letter and cards to you yesterday. Mrs. Popejoy enclosed some I gave her to send you. I am so very sorry at this time of all other to send you ill tidings, but she coughed so much last night that I insisted—in spite of her entreaties that I would not, upon sending for the doctor to examine her. I was shocked and distressed beyond measure to learn from him that she must always have been consumptive, and this was probably the cause of her ceasing to be as she should be monthly, She told us when she came here it had ceased five months previously, the beginning of the June, and she came here the following October. I was shocked upon her arrival to see her so thin, but she assured us she had always been so, and that it was not for lack of appetite, as she felt she could eat all day long and all night long and for ever and ever, and then felt she had not had half enough, and we found this to be a fact, the amount of food and drink she takes being most extraordinary, and the doctor says she never was able to digest or assimilate food, and the large amount she took there<lb/>fore did her positive harm, and she always, of course, felt hungry. You must, the doctor says, fetch her home at once and see what native air will dp; it is the only possible chance for her. Poor, poor Janey. I am too distressed even to use a pen, and it will make our Christmas very sorrowful. I cannot leave my helpless child, or I would, unwell as I am myself, have taken her. She must not travel alone, and I have no one just now to send with her. Please telegraph me at once if you can be here by 4 or between 4 and 5 to-morrow, or by the same hour on Friday. She ought not, in her condition, to leave by a later train than 5 o'clock. I mean yourself or one of the family. If she were ever so well physically she could not be trusted to travel alone. There are reasons, which I cannot</p>

               <p>pain you by entering into, why she must never be out of your sight whilst at home, poor dear. We are so very sorry for her and for you, poor Mrs. Popejoy.—Faithfully yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">C. NICHOLLS</hi>. P. S.—She took cold five weeks ago by leaving off her drawers. A week later she accentuated it by another most foolish act. We did everything we could, applied all the usual remedies, and wished her to have the doctor; but she so strongly objected, and begged so to remain on. She was sure, she said, it would be better in a day or two, and cried and implored me not to send for him, or to send her away; but she seemed to waste so rapidly that it frightened me. Thin as she was when she came, she is far more now, and her hair, she says, comes out in handfuls. There has always been great trouble to get her to comb and brush her hair, or to wash herself"—until the receipt, of that letter I had not heard a word about my daughter being ill, or anything the matter with her—my wife made arrangements for her going into service with Lady Harrowby—I saw her when she came home on the 24th—she then looked very pale and thin and very ill—she was put to bed at once, and remained there until she died, on the following Monday—on that day I heard certain statements made by my daughter—Nunn, the policeman, was there—I noticed her nose looked damaged and also her finger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Popejoy, of 13, Lime Street, Aldershot—I am sister-in-law to Emma Jane Popejoy—I had known her from her infancy—in the summer of 1896 she was staying over a month with me—she was then in very good health—there was nothing the matter with her—she was a very well-nourished girl—she was a fine big girl—I knew of her going into the service of the prisoner at 14, Pitt Street—whilst she was there I received some letters from her—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in her writing—the first of these are the first I saw—I did not see any earlier letter that went the round of the family—this one (<hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 6) is some<lb/>thing like hers—I don't know it—I did not see her from the summer of 1896 till Christmas 1897, on her return to Bagshot; she was then in bed—I should not have known her only by her voice—she was a complete skeleton, and seemed very ill indeed—I had gone to 14, Pitt Street, on Friday, December 24th, for the pur<lb/>pose of fetching her home, I got there about a quarter to seven—I went in consequence of some communication her mother had made to me—I had to knock five times before the door was opened by Edith Garrett I then learnt that she had gone home—I did not see Mrs. Nicholls on that occasion, I asked to see her—I then went back to aginst shot, and I remained there till Christmas night—I was at home at Aldershot when I received this letter, signed "C. Nicholls"—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" 14, Pitt Street, Ken<lb/>sington. December 25th. I was so distressed, Mrs. Popejoy, to hear you had had to leave your little ones on a fruitless journey of poor poor Janey. I wrote three times to her poor mother, but receiving no reply made arrangements at very great expense and trouble for a lady from the Travellers' Society to take her the whole way home, and as there are no cabs or flys at Bagshot they were to get out at Ascot and take a closed fly home. I had had to go to bed before you got here with a severe attack of rheumatism to which I am subject, and everything has been disorganised and put out of gear by poor Janey's illness. I should have written to her mother long before, but she so begged and prayed me not, insisting that she had been much worse, at home in winter, but always pulled round again in spring. She had an unreasoning dislike to see a doctor, but I had at last to insist upon her seeing one, and I hope her mother will send at once for the doctor who, she says, attended her in childhood and ordered her cod-liver oil, etc. So she had, I conclude, the seeds of this awful disease from babyhood, indeed, the doctor here said she must have had, and it had taken an acute form months before she came here, which accounts for her having been thin and still wasting in spite of the most ravenous appetite and taking the enormous quantities of food she did, poor dear, and continued to take up to the moment of leav<lb/>ing this house yesterday. The doctor said she had no assimilative power, and so the more heavy meals she took the worse she became, and during the last five or six weeks she wasted away so rapidly, but neither appetite nor sleep failed her she said, and insisted the whole time that she had no pain—all she thought off or seemed to care for, poor dear, was eating and drinking, and almost her last words were her regret that she would not be here to help eat the Christmas turkey, so I am going to send her a little</p>

               <p>by Parcel Post, as soon as the offices are open again, and also some V. H. Coca the same as she was taking before she left. She can tell her mother how my housekeeper made it; we are also sending some Christmas pud<lb/>ding, she took some mince pies with her. Her mother mustn't allow her to eat much at a time of such things she cannot digest, and it might have very serious results if she eats very ravenously to-day of beef and pudding. The doctor bays her disease makes her feel as if she never has enough, and it does her so much harm, so pray beg her mother to be careful, she must have milk, coca, beef tea, etc, and not the huge amount of solid food she has been alway taking. I enclose a booklet for you and some of your little ones as they would not, I fear, get any from poor Janey I sent home to her mother. I wonder if she got them. We have never heard from her. I am in too great pain to write. With much sympathy with you all I am, <hi rend="smallCaps">C. NICHOLLS</hi>."</p>

I am the wife of Frederick Popejoy, a brother of the deceased girl—I had known her for about six years—I remember seeing her shortly before she went into Mrs. Nicholls's service—about a fort<lb/>night or three weeks—she was then a strong, healthy looking girl, and very clean—as far as I knew she had nothing the matter with her—at Christmas, 1896, I had a card from her—beyond that I had no communi<lb/>cation with her—she had been for short periods before she left for London—I was at her father-in-law's house at Bagshot shortly after she came home—on December 26th—she was up at that time, but had gone to bed—I then noticed a very great change in her—I really did not think it was her at first—I helped to partly undress her and put her to bed—she was in a very tilthy condition, also her clothes—she was bruised from head to foot—her arms and legs were very much bruised—her knees were bruised, also a bruise on her throat, and her hands very much, also her toes—two toes were matted together very much, looking as if some<lb/>thing was done to them—sores were running from them—I washed the toes, at which she screamed very much, and we let her alone—a front tooth was broken—a piece of the tooth was gone—my mother and I washed her before putting her to bed—we were not successful in getting her clean that night—she did not seem to take much notice of anybody—she ate something, but very little—she had a little piece of fresh herring and a piece of bread and butter—she ate it, not ravenously, she drank a little of the tea—I remained in the house that night—next day, Christmas Day, I saw her again—she had a little bit of dinner—she was in bed all day—she seemed very low—she had not much that day—on Christmas Day my mother and I washed her again twice—I can't say she was left clean—I thought she was very bad—she did not</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in the room when Nunn was there—not all the time—I did not hear her say anything about dying to the. constable—she was a fine, strong, healthy girl, and quite noticeable for her extra size and extra strength—she was the ordinary size for her age—not of a particular good colour, but healthy looking—she was not particularly pale—she appeared to be strong—I do not remember her having influenza very badly—I had known her about six years—when she was a child she used to run up into the garden in a temper—her mother is getting old—you must not take notice of what she says—she was not particularly excitable—there was a little hair off each side—in front it was quite noticeable—I gave my evidence before the Coroner—there was a little excitement about the case—there was a crowd of people assembled at the railway station—there was an angry mob there—I daresay I felt indignant with regard, to the girl—her clothes, when she got home, were stiff and very dirty—the clothes in her box were all soaked with water, and her other clothes did not seem to have been washed for a long time—they smelt very bad—I said before that she was bruised from head to foot—not her body, but her legs and arms—I saw a bruise at the back of her shoulder, but I could not be certain that I saw any other on her body—I helped to undress her—one of her teeth was gone altogether in front, and a piece was left, it looked as if it had been broken off—she seemed to have very sound teeth—I cannot remember whether I said anything to the Coroner about her toes being matted together, but stuck together, with sores between—I think it was the left foot—they were so stuck together that pulling them apart hurt very much—it was not dirt, but sores—she did not have particularly bad diarrhoea—she certainly did have it a little once during the time she was in bed—she seemed to lay on her right side mostly—she seemed to under<lb/>stand what was said up to the end, right to the last, when Dr. Osburn came—she died on Monday, about eight o'clock—I did not leave her, only just to run down the village for the policeman—she was quite con scious and talking up to the end—I saw her die—she did not die sud<lb/>denly—before she died she asked for my husband, and said good<lb/>bye to him—there were no convulsions, or anything of that kind—she was got home on the Thursday night—I did not send for a doctor—she came home on the Friday evening before Christmas Day—they meant to send for a doctor on the Saturday—they were going to stop him as he came through</p>

I am the wife of George Popejoy and mother of the deceased girl—she was sixteen years old—up to October, when she left home, she had always enjoyed good health—there was nothing the matter with her so far as I knew—I knew that her courses had stopped for two months—she had not been troubled with any cough or any symptoms of anything being wrong with her lungs before she left home. I used to see her undressed when she was washing sometimes—I used to assist her—her body was well nourished and in good condition—she kept clean—before she left home her head was perfectly clean—I assisted her to cleanse it—I made arrangements with a lady at Bagshot for her going into service—I arranged the wages—she was to have 1s. 6d, a week to start with, to be increased to 2s. a week—I got a letter from her the second day after she left—just a few lines—and I got another letter from her within about a week or ten days—I cannot state dates exactly—I cannot read—Mrs. Harding is a friend, and if I happened to see her I should hand her the letters to read to me—she is a near neighbour, and does my writing when I have no one at home to do it—I have given all the letters I can find from my daughter to the police—I could not find the letter which I had at the end of ten days or a week—she told me of the house and what she would have to do, and she began telling me how she lived, that she did a little work besides the lady, that she pushed the young lady out—she said she had dripping for breakfast, meat for dinner, she did not go so far as to say any other meal to my knowledge—she might have done so—that was the only letter I had from her in which she spoke of the food she had—she said she had too much washing to do—my son mostly read the letters to me—Mrs. Harding did sometimes—I heard there was nothing the matter with my daughter about three months before she came home—her letter was peevish—I thought it was her writing, but it did not all match with her child writing—I thought she was not well—I kept the letter a long time, but I have not got it now—the Sunday she died she said, about 7 or 8 a.m., when I first rose, something about her last sleep, she should sleep to-night—during the day she rallied round sometimes, then she seemed worse—I was in the room when the constable was fetched—she had done very little talking—we had told her about the condition her body was in—she knew that she was dying—she wished to see all her brothers and sisters—we asked her about the bruises and how she came to be so thin and so on before the Monday—I only knew about that by what she told Mr.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Nunn did not come into the room on Sunday—he only came into her room on the Monday, and I do not think I left the room—my daughter was inclined to be a fine girl with good limbs, but she was not stout—she was tall—she would have been very pretty—when she went away in October, I never saw her again until she came back, when she was dying—that was an interval of fifteen months—during that time she used to write about once a month—three months before she came home she wrote, and said she had got a bad cough—one letter was written from Southsea—that was not written after she complained of being ill—she said Mrs. Nicholls was going to take her to the seaside—she did not say she was ill—she took her to the seaside for a month about August, 1897—I believe she had got a bad cough, when she wrote about it—I asked Mrs. Harding to write for me—some of us were thinking of going to see her on Jubilee Day—I cannot write—I am not a good judge of writing—this signature, "Mother, E. Popejoy" is not unlike her eldest sister's writing—Mrs. Harding wrote that letter for me—it was about October, 1897, when I had heard she had had this cough—(<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Harding was here interposed, and said on oath that she wrote the letter for Mrs. Popejoy</hi>)—I heard my daughter's wages were raised to 2s. a week at the end of the first month, and afterwards that they were raised to 2s. 6d.—when Jane's courses stopped about two months before she went away, she was a little bit excited at these times—nothing much—she wanted to go away to be alone—I am not sure it was only two months—she was irritated, and wanted to be alone—I never had any difficulty in managing her—I never had any difficulty with her when she grew up—she was a very quiet girl—I deny that I said before "I had at times some difficulty in managing Jane"—when she was put out, or anyone was angry with her, she wanted to go away and be quiet, and rest a bit—she was not easily put out—she never showed it—if her father came home very angry she used to go up the garden out of his way—it is not very likely she would get out of my way—she would get all right after coming in and lying down on the bed—she could not stand being put upon—I never told Dr. Twart she could—I never remember having him to her but twice—she had sometimes the influenza; but when the inspector came there was nothing the matter—I believe she only had one bottle of medicine—when she came home on Friday we talked about, sending for the doctor, but we missed him—we sent for him on the Sunday—she asked for Dr. Twart on the Christmas Day—I know him very well—he has attended me—we went to Dr, Osburn because he was the parish doctor—Dr. Twart was the doctor whom we paid—we wanted to put it on the parish, as I felt it was more than I could do—before she went away she had a very good</p>

I don't like to hear you say that"—I did not go to the coroner's inquest—she had no diarrhoea—there were three motions, not loose, that was only on the last day—you could not call it diarrhoea—she practically passed everything she took, but not loose—she was sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other—she did not like us to say anything to her about her body when she first came home—I first gave her some bread and butter, toast, biscuits, oranges, and honey, a little fowl, Brussel sprouts, and half a glass of elderberry wine—on the second day she had fresh butter and fresh herrings.</p>

I have bacon for breakfast, and the others have bread and dripping. I have a nice place and a kind mistress. I go out in the garden with the invalid"—Jane wrote that, the letter was stuck down, and Mrs. Nicholls said she would post it—I did not see it posted—soon after my aunt came to the house to see me—Jane was pre<lb/>sent when she came—Mrs. Nicholls asked Jane if it was not true that we had bacon for breakfast—Jane made no answer—Mrs. Nicholls said if she did not answer she must go down and go on with her work—she went down—my aunt and Mrs. Nicholls spoke, but I don't know what they said—it was about a fortnight and three days before I ran away—I com<lb/>plained to Mrs. Harrington, the housekeeper, but it got no better.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness living at Maidenhead—I have been living there ever since my daughter had been in the service of Mrs. Nicholls—on January 23th I went to Pitt Street and took her away—I had seen her down at the inquest and heard some of the evidence there—it was in consequence of that that I took her away, and in consequence of what she told me herself—I saw Mrs. Nicholls that evening and told her I had come to take the girl away, as I did not feel justified, after what I had heard and what my girl told me, in leaving her there—Mrs. Nicholls said it was not true, and begged me to leave the girl till the case had finished, as the doctor would be able to prove that the girl had died of consumption only—I said, "That may be so, madam, but I wish to take the girl home"—my daughter, Edith, was present at the last part of the conversation—Mrs. Nicholls appealed to Edith to confirm her statement that the girl not been starved or ill-used—at that time Edith had not given evidence before the Coroner—she said</p>

               <p>only a few days she had knocked her bead against a place in the adjoining room—Mrs. Nicholls said it was her going to Bagshot on that day with Edith Garrett that they had tried to get hold of her, and told her what to say—she said she said to Edith, "Oh, Edith, if anyone had told me you would be so disloyal I would not have believed them"—from time to time I received letters from ray daughter while she was in the service—I have not the letters—Mr. Frayling has them—I received a portion of my daughter's wages in P. O. orders. Between my daughter going into the service and the inquest I never saw her—every letter I received was satisfactory—I thought she was all right, and I did notmind—Mrs. Nicholls wrote to me and I answered her—I remember Miss Chambers coming to see me—she brought a letter—I did not read the contents—I was told that we had diphtheria—I was shown the letter—it was not my writing—my eldest boy was in the house—we had not diphtheria—it was in January, 1897, that Miss Chambers came—she read part of the letter to me—it was a letter about my girl being ill—that was what was read to me—this letter looks like my writing, but I would not swear to it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Madam,—I thank you for the letter telling me about Edith. I am pleased to say my boy is not ill. Please ask Edith to send me word. Yours respectfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">M. GARRETT</hi>"—that letter was to my daughter—I did not come up to see Mr. Nicholls—I sent 6s. to my daughter—that was before they went to Southsea—I never had any complaint from my daughter—I did not hear about this trouble in the papers—I heard it from Mrs. Netter to me—I read the letter while the inquest was going on—I received letters from my daughter, and received a portion of her wages by P.O. orders. Between the time of her going into the service and the inquest I never saw my daughter—every letter I received was satisfactory—I thought she was all right, and I didn't come—Mrs. Nicholls wrote to me and I answered her letters—I remember Miss Chambers coming, to see me on January 7th, 1897, and bringing a letter about my daughter—I did not see the contents—I was told it was all untrne—I was shown the letter—it was not my writing—it was about my girl being ill—Miss Chambers asked me if I had written a letter stating that my son had dip<lb/>htheria—the letter looks like my writing, but I would not swear to it—I also wrote this letter: ("North End, Town Moor. January 16th, 1898. Madam,—I received your letter this morning, and I am very sorry to hear you have been ill. Although I do not wonder at it, as it is enough to break down the strongest person to have such terrible things said of you, after you had treated Jane with so much kindness, as it is not the lady in twenty who would have kept a girl on as you did Jane, when she must have been a great worry to you. I quite believe that Jane must have had reason to dread going home, or she would not have begged so hard for you to keep her on, as she must have suffered a deal of pain, although she would not own to it; and I do not believe it at all likely that a girl her age would have stayed fourteen months in a house where she was starved and beaten, as she would most certainly have Canted to go home, if she had a good mother and father to go home to. I shall be very glad to hear when it is all fettled, as I have never heard of such a case before. I am not at all afraid to trust you with Edith. Hoping</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I also received this letter from Mrs. Nicholls—(Dated January 14th: "I have been too ill to thank you before for your most kind letter Mrs. Garrett. I shall never forget it as long as I live, or your faith and trust as regards your own child in face of this most cruel and unjust allegation. I am sorry to tell you the inquest has been postponed, and we had not to go yesterday. It is such a terrible ordeal for one in my state of health to be passing through, and every day it is prolonged gives rise to the fear that I may break down altogether, and this would be an awful calamity. I need all my strength and faculties to combat the awful lying allegations published in the weekly papers, I am told, though I am not allowed, by my legal advisers and friends, to read them. I know from what I saw at the inquest that they had gathered together very low persons whoever showed an enmity and ill<lb/>will to give evidence against us. All this would matter nothing if the evidence could, as in a Court of Law, be rebutted as it arose, but a Coroner's Court is so different, and he seems to be taking all these witnesses first; Edith and my house-keeper, and a relative of my housekeeper's, who had lived in my house for a short time with Jane this year since Edith came, could all prove the poor creature's voracious appetite, and that far from ever missing a meal, she had five meals a day because she was so thin, one more than they ever had, and that far from ever being ill-treated, she was treated with the indulgence one would extend to a child. That was my only fault towards her, looking over, in answer to her prayers and entreaties, faults that no other human being would have excused, and, in time, compassion keeping her when others would over and over again have sent her away, and this is being brought against me now, as is the yielding to her entreaties not to see a doctor—she misled us altogether by her statements that she had no pain, that she slept well, and as she most certainly eat well up to the last moment, we never realised that she was in any serious condition, until the doctor saw her here on the 22nd, and told me, to my distress, that she was in the last stage of consumption, etc.")—Mrs. Nicholls said that the police had got hold of Edith and told her to say things against her—she said she wanted me to leave Edith with her.</p>

We didn't go away after all as the weather wasn't very hot up to Jubilee Day.

               <p>is such a beautiful pier quite close, and the mistress is a going to take us all to a concert on it on Saturday, and this afternoon she is going to take us all for a drive in the carriage, and Jane will have to sit up with the coachman, like she did before, cause there ain't room for us all else and it all so beautiful, and I will send you my August money when it due 23rd and you can get me what you likes, and put the rest in the bank for me, cause the mistress likes us to be saving, but she thinks I ought to get some little presents for the children here, and send them when we get back at the end of September.—<hi rend="smallCaps">E. GARRETT</hi>"—That letter was written in the presence of Mrs. Nicholls, and from her dictation—she made me write it—she had not a stick in her hand—they are Mrs. Nicholls's words—the words, "Oh, the sea is grand, I never could have thought it was like that," are Mrs. Nicholls's—the 6s. which was sent she put into her ward<lb/>robe—(<hi rend="italic">Another letter:</hi> "Dear Father and Mother and all of them,—I got the parcel quite safe yesterday, and I like the apron very much indeed, and thanks you much, and I shall make the linen aprons some day, but I ain't in no hurry for 'em; this ain't a place for wearing out many clothes; and I found the 6s. in the parcel, and the mistress say it were too kind of you to send, but she thought I might ha' let you keep that, hut I didn't ask you for it <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> and I am going to put 6s. more to it on the 23rd, so that will be 12s. I shall have to put in the bank first start, and I think that is a good lot. The girl whose place I took started her book with 5s., but she didn't put more away the first year, and I haven't been a year yet, and got 12s. She were here five years, and had saved a good bit in that time, and she only had the same wages as I do when she left, and the mistress will arise mine when we get into the next house if I behaves well, and the young lady were so amused at George's pigs going to market, and they were very sorry to hear George were ailing again, and so be I, and love to all, and I were so sorry not to send to Johnny a card on his birthday; but Christmas is very near, and then they shall all have some.—From your loving daughter, <hi rend="smallCaps">E. GABBKCT</hi> Saturday."—Mrs. Nicholls dictated that letter to me, except "Dear Mother and Father, and all of them"—those are my own words—they are in pencil—it was written during the inquest—(<hi rend="italic">Another letter:</hi> "Dear Mother and Father, and all of them,—I send back the papers, thank you very much for sending them; the books was ordered before Christmas, but we thinks it better not to send them off until this affair is settled, and I wants to ask you not to take any notice of any lying things you sees in the paper, 'cause there ain't a word of truth in it. That poor Jane used to eat a lot more than I did, and I got a good appetite, as you nows, and I looks well and feels well—if she didn't it were because she were in a consumption, and wasted away, and it is the most awful lies to say she were ever ill-treated in this house since I been in it, and that is over a year, you know, and she were only here fourteen months; when all comes out, and our doctors have a fair hearing, it will be proved clear enough she died of consumption, and she got her bruises and all that a falling about, as she used to, and she always used to pretend she fall over things she left on the stairs, she never would say it was from weakness. She had two bad falls out of doors about ten days or a fortnight afore she went home, but she wouldn't let us look to see if she were hurt, and when</p>

               <p>she left here, just before Xmas Day, she walked down the stairs and along the hall by herself, and the lady that took her home says she walked across the line at one place were they changed trains; but she only lived four days after she got home, and now they wants to say, 'cause she was so thin, that she was starved, and 'cause she had bruises that she were beaten. I can swear that she were never either beat or starved, and so can the housekeeper. We all had meals together, and all had the same, only she eat so much more than we did and 'cause she were so thin she had cocoa with milk instead of always tea, and don't you take no notice of what's in the paper, nor get frightened about me. I mean to speak the truth. The mistress have always been very kind to me, and she was more so still to her, 'cause she wern't so strong as me. Have the little ones spoilt their things I sent just before Christmas yet? Tell them I shall send them another parcel soon, but I ain't got time to look up anything just now, and give my best love to all of them. And did Kate and Charley go to Sunday-school, as George said they were? And what about Johnny? The young lady were so amused with George's donkeys and trees as he drawed on his last letter. The mistress have always taken such an interest in George's case, 'cause I told her about his rumatics, and she suffers so with it herself, and she is so feeling with anybody that got anything the matter with them.—From your loving daughter, <hi rend="smallCaps">EDITH GARRBTT</hi>."—Mrs. Nicholls told me to write that letter also—I put in the words, "Have the little ones spoilt the things I sent them," etc., without my mistress telling me—I wrote that letter, and it is all untrue—I wrote it because I was afraid of my mistress—I also wrote this letter during the Coroner's inquest:—" Dear Father and Mother and all of them,—We are going down at the end of the week I think to Bagshot and don't you and father let nothing as they puts in them lying papers frighten you about me. Why one of them lying reporters came here and tried his very utmost to make me tell what evidence I was going to give, and told me I should have to say the same as Jessie, a lying cat, as was here afore Jane came. Jane took her place and Jessie left in awful disgrace, got about with soldiers and stole things and all that, and now in her spite as been and told the police that she was ill-used and all that. The housekeeper says it is an awful lie and I am sure it is; the mistress wouldn't hurt anyone. I'm sure of that and I shall tell the truth when I goes and don't care what anybody says, and don't you fear as anybody will hurt me. I shall be took good care of both here and down there. Why, the liars wants to make out that the mistress held her and to every letter she wrote home, and the mistress never ever see her write a letter, she done 'em all in the kitchen, and used to show me some of 'em and they was all full of the mistresses kindness to her, and oh mother she was good to her, helping her to clean her dirty stinking head and all that. I wouldn't sleep with her, and that's how the mistress found out her head was dirty and she gave her notice to leave directly, but Jane was so precious'artful and cunning she always managed to get over the mistress to keep her. Why, she had notice to leave a dozen times, and sorry enough the poor mistress must be now that she didn't make her go. If you are sent to about my wages please tell 'em that you asked £6 a year for me to be raised every 6 months, and now it is got to</p>

               <p>£8 a year, and that my mistress wished when I first came I always sent my wages home to you to lay out for me, and both you and me is very satisfied ain't we, and she always begged Jane to send hers to her mother, but no not her though she did send the postal orders for any things they sent her, and she bought a lot of clothes, and oh the lots of sweets and apples and rubbish she used to buy, and she owed the mistress a lot of money when she left, but people seem so spiteful because she didn't go home with a pocket full of money, and I think that's enough about her, and how is all the little ones. Mistress want's to know how George is. She is very bad herself, and no wonder, and she says I urn to please thank you very much for your kind letter which she will answer when she is a little better. Tell the children I always ment to go home for a little holiday as soon as We had got comfortable settled in our new house. This will put it off a little, but I shall come tell them, and they may look out for a big parcel when I do, and I will get a postal order and send it in a few days out of this month's money, and from your loving daughter <hi rend="smallCaps">E. GARRETT</hi>. Tuesday. We only went out once." They were to deceive my own mother those letters—my mistress told me all except about my little brothers—one of the envelopes is addressed by Mrs. Nicholls—the rest are addressed by me—I still say I was unable to write home to my people without the supervision of my mistress.</p>

               <p>the chest—she was dressed—I used the stethoscope and percussion—I found a cavity in the upper part of the right lung, and incipient tubercular mischief in the left side—consumption—she would have to be stripped to listen to the whole of the lungs—I did not see marks about her—the prisoner was present—I told her the girl was in the last stage of consumption, and could only live for a short time; perhaps a few days, and that if she fainted she might die immediately—I recom<lb/>mended that she should be removed to the hospital or infirmary without delay—I recommended ordinary milk diet—the prisoner asked me to look at the girl's legs, but I thought it was only because she was so thin, so I did not do so—I saw signs of emaciation on the chest, arms, shoulders, and face—it would be plain to anyone that the girl was very ill—she was anbrnic, and excessively weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner said she did not know whether the girl would see me—it is not at all uncommon for girls to object to see a doctor who visits the house—I thought it dangerous to strip her—the cavity in the right lung was caseous, and about the size of a wal<lb/>nut—I have no doubt that she died of consumption, but that it was aided by cold—the consumption might have been of several months' standing—a large appetite is consistent with consumption, but not necessarily—I did not at first make an exhaustive examination, but I found sufficient, as I thought, to account for her state—it was merely a question of making the remainder of her days easy—I cannot understand one of the Doctors saying that tuberculosis had nothing to do with her death—it is impossible—emaciation increases <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the complaint, and might continue, though the patient had sufficient to eat—I do not think it would be possible for a healthy girl to die of starvation with a diet of bread and dripping, beef tea, tea without milk and sugar, with a fresh joint of fresh mutton and vegetables on Sunday, though she were deprived of a meal three or four times a week—sugar is very nutritive—the above would not be a nutritive diet for a delicate patient—I frequently saw Edith Garrett before the inquest—she looked quite as healthy when she left Mrs. Nicholls as she does now—I am sure the girl died of consump<lb/>tion in an advanced stage—it might be that she was suffering from diabetes as well—she had a dry, harsh skin—the prisoner is devoted to her invalid daughter—she is suffering from confirmed cerebral disease—she would be likely to throw out her arms and kick and scream—she used to have fits, but not lately, I think—she would be, at periods, very violent, and would clutch anyone's arm or hand very tightly—I do not think the prisoner's physical condition is such as to enable her to take this girl by the hair and drag her into the house and beat her with an umbrella and stick—at present she is very ill—she has always been very lady-like as far as I know—I have not seen any indications of outbursts of violent temper in her—it would be very bad for the invalid daughter to have any disturbance going on in her presence—she is not capable of giving evidence.</p>

               <p>Magistrate—diabetes was not suggested to me—my first examination of the girl was confined to a quarter of an hour—she must have been consumptive for many months, but not in the condition in which I saw her—the food I speak of would be sufficient to prevent her being starved—it would not be proper food for a girl in that condition—of course the more care you take of a consumptive person, and the more choice the food is, the more likely you are to prolong life, or even to cure the patient—the absence of proper food would tend to accelerate the death of such a person—the kind of food given to consumptive patients fifty years ago is now known to be not proper food—a girl suffering from consumption, as this girl was, would require proper nursing—I do not think she should have remained in her situation for three or four months—I do not think her leaving service and having the same food would have prolonged her life; her work was not hard, as I understand—I was surprised to find her so ill—when there is mal<lb/>assimilation of food I should expect to find evidences of it at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> in the glands of the stomach, or the mesenteric—when there was ulceration,. which would account for bad assimilation of food, you would probably find that ulceration in the colon or larger intestine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M. R. C. S. and L. E. C. P., practising at Bagshot—I was called to see the deceased on December 26th—she was in bed—I examined her, and made notes—I found her extremely emaciated, her skin very red, and discoloured in many places—several large and distinct bruises on both legs and the sides of both knees—the one on the side of the left knee was about 2 ins. by 2 ins., and about a week old—the backs of the hands were scored with sores and abrasions, large deep scratches and cuts—the little finger of the left hand was blackened—the bridge of the nose was broken—her temperature was 101, and pulse bad—I diagnosed bronchial pneumonia and slight diarrhoea—"her mind seemed quite clear when spoken to, although she lies huddled up in bed on the left side, and takes no notice except when roused"—I thought she was very ill, but would probably recover at that time—I saw her about five o'clock the next afternoon, and found her very much worse, and her pulse very bad—I did not think she would live through the night—she died about eight o'clock—a constable was in the house—I had made some communication respecting the police—I made a suggestion in regard to the attendance of the Magistrate before her death—I had no reason to think that she thought she was not going to die—(<hi rend="italic">After objection and some discussion this evidence was ruled to be admissible.</hi>)—I said to the girl, "How did you hurt yourself?"—she replied by the one word, "Mistress"—I said to her, "How did she do it?" and she replied by the one word, "Stick"—I pointed towards her legs where there were bruises—my next visit was paid about 8.30, when she was dead—on December 29th I went with Dr. Greasy to make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the body—I made these notes immediately after<lb/>wards—"the body of a well-proportioned girl in a state of extreme emaciation—there is no food at all in the body, and the muscles and</p>

               <p>other structures are much wasted—<hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> very slightly marked"—that points to the fact that the death has been lingering, and no long struggle—active people who die a violent death have very intense <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>—"<hi rend="italic">post mortem,</hi> straining less than usual"—that points to the fact that the blood was in a rather poor condition—"height, 5 ft. 2 ins.; weight, 65 lbs.; measurement round the middle of upper arm, 51/4 ins.; round the middle of the thigh, 10 ins.; the calf of leg, 81/4 ins.—65 lbs. is only about half the weight that such a girl should be under ordinary circumstances—I measured the arm, thigh, and calf of another girl who was thin and delicate-looking of the same height, but perfectly healthy—she was sixteen years of age—her upper arm measured round 9 ins., the middle of her thigh, 16 1/4 ins., and the calf, 11 1/4 ins.—that was rather below than above the average—on examining the right arm I found diffused patches and bruising above the elbow on the outside of the arm 3 ins. by 2 ins.—"The right elbow—there are several small abrasions near the elbow—there is a large bruise on the inner side of the upper arm extending from the wrist 3 ins. up the arm—the whole of the back of the hand down to the finger tips presents the yellow-green colour of bruising of at least ten days previously—sixteen small wounds and abrasions"—they might be scratches—"Left arm—there is yellow staining of the skin—characteristic of bruising—some time previous, about fourteen days; from the shoulder to the finger tips there are round bruises and two abrasions on the outer side of the elbow—about three or four days old from the date of the death—there is a large distinct bruise" 2 ins. by 2 1/2 ins. on the wrist, and there is a black gangrenous patch 2 ins. long on the back and outer side of the first joint of the little finger—it might have been done by a burn—on the right leg continuous bruises of various dates, but not quite recent extending from the knee to the toes—most marked on the outer side of the knee, and a long well<lb/>defined patch extending 5 ins. by 2 1/2 ins., five distinct bruises on the outer side of the leg, and one rather recent one, 1 1/2 in., on the back of the foot"—we found no abnormal condition of the toes-sometimes a sore is not very noticeable after death, and we might have missed it—the cartilage of the nose was broken away from the bone, but there was no bruise there—it must have been caused by violence and done so long previously that the bruising had disappeared, there were no marks of violence on the head or on the trunk—the hair was normal—on opening the body we found the subcutaneous fat absent—that is the fat between the skin and the muscle—the muscular structure was small and pale—on opening the abdomen we found the peritoneum healthy—the great omentum—the fold of the peritoneum, which hangs down in front of the bowels, was remarkably thin and devoid of fat—it is one of the places in the body where food is almost invariably found—I could see through it, and could hardly detect its existence until we picked it up—the stomach was distended with what appeared to be liquid food given within the last three or four days, otherwise it was normal inside and out—the small intestine was empty and collapsed it seemed to us then; but is a point on which it is impossible to give an absolute statement—the small intestine usually contains a little liquid food—it never ought to be much distended—we found the colon very unusually small and con<lb/>tracted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250101"/>
               <p>—that is the great gut—there were no forces in the flectum or rectum—the whole of the large intestine was apparently empty—th liver was normal, and the kidneys were perfectly natural and small—the walls and mucous membrane of the bladder were thickened and a little congested—it contained no urine—that would be evidence of slight chronic inflammation—she would have the desire to pass water on a small quantity, accumulating—in the heart I discovered a soft yellow clot, and the muscular walls were thin and pale—the valves were per<lb/>fectly healthy and natural—the pericardium—the membrane covering the heart, was natural—in the right lung we found one or two recent pleuretic adhesions, the result of pleurisy—there was no excess of fluid in the pleura cavity—the air cells near the lungs had been strained and burst one into another, so that instead of there being a large number of little air cells there were a few biggish air cells—that was caused by coughing repeatedly in a weak state of health—two-thirds of the lower lobe were consolidated by pneumonia—in the middle of the other lobe there was a caseous or cheesy cavity, and surrounding it a number of yellow tubular nodules—there were no tubercles in the apex of the lung—the lower lobe contained one patch of consolidation, about the size of an egg—no tubercles—the generative organs were those of a virgin—the brain was normal—the cause of death was failure of the hears action, the result of extreme weakness—the pneumonia probably would not have carried her off if she had been properly nourished—the bruises were not likely to have been caused by fails, but by blows or violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have practised for nine years, and have had very large experience in <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>—I think Mrs. Popejoy was the first person I saw on being called in—I am parish doctor there, but I went in my ordinary capacity—I went straight to the room where she was—the mother was quite incoherent and weeping—she said some<lb/>thing about rheumatism, and that was all I got out of her—a clergyman and a policeman were there—a question was raised about taking the girl's depositions by a Magistrate, but it was a wet night, and the police were a little shy about fetching him—in order to judge whether she was fit to be examined I went back to the room, and bent over her and asked the same questions again, and got the same answers—I found extreme emaciation, which would be consistent with starvation—the skin was dry, rough, and discoloured in many places—I do not think the bruises could be accounted for by purples—the injury to the nose might have taken place a year or months before—I heard the statement that three or four days before death her mistress kicked her, and then knocked or pushed her head against an iron bedstead, but no such bruises as I should expect from that were found—it is common for people to go about with their lungs riddled with tubercles, and they do not seem much the worse for it—I cannot say how long the caseous cavity had been dormant—the tissues were indurated—I am still of the same opinion that tuberculosis had no immediate connection with the cause of death—the great probability is she would have lived if she had been, properly fed, and possibly pneumonia would not have developed—we did not weigh the kidneys, but we cut them and stripped off the membrane—the pancreas was normal—the pneumonia did not resemble the pneumonia of phthisis for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250104"/>
               <p>a reason I can give—in diabetes the patient may die of acute pneumonia, diabetes coma, or of actual exhaustion—they generally die of comatose—in the cases I have seen they become unconscious—this girl was perfectly conscious—I arrived an hour or two before her death—at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination the stomach was distended with liquid food—I opened the colon: slit it right up—it was chiefly con<lb/>tracted in the transverse portion—there were no hard pieces—there was a slight thickening in the bladder—it was smaller than usual—she had swallowed her food nicely—I saw a dose of milk and a dose of medi<lb/>cine—the spleen was perfectly natural—we made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination within four days after she died—she had had slight diarrhoea on the Sunday—I asked the condition of the bowels to know whether she required medicine—I expected to find more matter in the large intestine—even milk would become hard—neuralgic pains are not a prominent symptom of diabetes—I saw the girl before her death and four days afterwards, and there was no suggestion of diabetes, and therefore it did not occur to us—<hi rend="italic">post mortems</hi> are always made with the object of clearing up what has arisen during life, and there was not the least suggestion of diabetes, or of the passing quantities of water, which would be a prominent symptom of it—if there had been diabetes one would have expected to have heard of such a prominent symptom—starva<lb/>tion, and not diabetes, was present to our mind—when tubercles have formed there may be attacks of sweating, but there is not always per<lb/>spiration—I saw no marks of violence on the trunk—the tubercular condition, whether chronic or malignant, would be affected by improper food—I saw the bruise on the foot—it might have been caused by a blow from a hammer in August, but I think it could not have existed more than a week or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. There were no symptoms of comatose in the way this girl died—her mind was clear—I saw her about six o'clock—dryness, roughness, and discoloration of the skin are symptoms spoken of in connection with withholding of food—I have never heard of the contraction of the colon in diabetes—I cannot say positively that it is inconsistent with it—I would not describe this pneumonia as tubercular pneumonia.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, of between twelve and thirteen years standing—I have had twenty years ex<lb/>perience in making <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations, and I assisted Dr. Osburne to make this <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on December 29th—I have been listening to his evidence in chief—I agree with him sub<lb/>stantially—death was due, in my opinion, from the aspect of the body to heart failure, due to exhaustion—due to pneumonia, or recurring in pneumonia in an emaciated girl who was evidently extremely weak—from the aspect of the body and the condition of things the emaciation was consistent with food having been withheld for a considerable time, the absence of sufficient food—there was no indication of want of power to properly assimilate her food—that strengthens the opinion I have formed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate: "In my judgment there was not sufficient tubercular mischief to account for so great an</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250105"/>
               <p>emaciation; and looking at the condition of weakness, I say that con<lb/>dition was consistent with the absence for some time of food, and not merely want of food assimilation"—that is my opinion now—I think there was not sufficient tuberculosis and pneumonia to cause death in an otherwise healthy subject—the tubercles were dormant—they would not have caused death if the girl had not been emaciated—I think the emaciation was previous to the pneumonia—the tubercular cavity was quiescent—the nodules round the cavity were not active—I had not diabetes present in my mind—I said before the. Magistrate that there was nothing to show whether there was diabetes or one way or the other; that it is often attended by great emaciation, and that she might have suffered from diabetes without showing any signs of it in the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination beyond the emaciation—I hold to that—in diabetes I should not expect to find the kidneys enlarged; they are sometimes—in this case they were normal—there was no urine in the bladder—occasionally in diabetes you get that condition of bladder—the existence of nodules round the cavity is not evidence of the activity of the cavity, nor of the spreading of the disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. In the event of a person suffering from diabetes I should expect those who lived in the same house to know of it—I should call it a remarkable case where the diabetes condition was concealed.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians—I practise at 31, Weymouth Street—I am physician to St. Mary's Hospital, and lecturer there on Medical Jurisprudence—all the depositions before the Coroner and the Magistrate were submitted to me—I have been here during the trial, and have heard the whole of the evidence, and given my best attention to it—having regard to the medical evidence, I consider death to be due to heart failure, following on general debility and pneumonia—the general debility was due to starvation—I mean the ingestion of food which is either insufficient in quantity or wanting in quality—the conditions are: (1) skin rough, dry and wrinkled, and with stains on it, described as brownish stains; (2) the general absence of fat from the body; (3) the extremely thin condition of the momentum and the intestines generally; (4) the rather wasted and pale condition of the heart; and (5), which I consider important, the absence of tubercular disease in the intestines in a way which was visible to the naked eye—on the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> what is invisible to the naked eye in the intestines could not have been the causation of death—as regards the disease found in the right lung, the area was limited, as neither apex of the two lungs were affected; those are the dangerous parts to be affected by tubercular disease; there was this one cavity in the middle of the upper lobe of the right lung; that was chronic, and in a very stationary con<lb/>dition; it is all practically included as being a factor in the causation of death on account of its localised chronic stationary condition; the little deposits around the cavity, including those two nodules, are obviously not due to recent infection—the girl could not have been in an advanced stage of consumption of the lungs without there having been a consider<lb/>able spitting of blood before her death, which would have increased to the end—it is not my experience that a voracious appetite is ordinarily found in consumptive patients—my experience is rather the other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250106"/>
               <p>way—it is rather difficult to get them to take sufficient food—her chances of recovery from tuberculosis, followed by pneumonia, would have been much greater if the body had been better nourished—I do not think medical attention would have effected much in the con<lb/>dition of the lungs—the pneumonia would have been very much ameliorated if it had been attended to earlier—under reasonably favour able conditions the girl would probably have lived for years if she had been in a position—gone to an ordinary institution, for instance—she would have died of consumption possibly—she would probably have lived to an ordinary age if she could have been sent away, but not in this country—I find no evidence of the existence of diabetes—I have carefully considered that—those symptoms have been accurately described: exces<lb/>sive thirst, the frequent passing of urine, being much wasted, dryness of the skin and mouth, emaciation, and the mind remaining clear till come supervenes before or at the time of death—those are the leading symptoms, and they are generally accompanied by constipation—here there was looseness, though there were symptoms of constipation just at the last—there was evidence consistent with diabetes only so far that death from diabetes may occur and there may be no <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> indication of it; but there would be the indication of great pus some time before, and the passing of a great quantity of water—those are the most important factors, but there is one other, excessive low spirits, and in diabetes the mucous membrane is generally thicker than in this case it was—contrac<lb/>tion of the colon I consider quite inconsistent with diabetes—I have never known a contracted colon in connection with diabetes in the way described—a cord-like one—that is a fairly constant sign of death from starvation—ill-usage accompanied with the withholding of food would undoubtedly tend to accelerate death—the mental operation, apart from the physical effect, would tend to increase the mischief—if the bruises described were produced by physical ill-usage they would be a factor in hastening death—the ill-usage would not be a strong factor—ill-usage, plus want of sufficient food, might be a factor in developing pneumonia, though not a strong factor—not so strong as the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been engaged in several cases of this kind for the Treasury—I mean plus the deprivation of food—it would only be a small factor—the two together would be a factor—I practise as a physician, but I have done a good deal of taxicological work, but I have been more frequently engaged in these cases than in poisoning cases—the reason of my disagreement with Dr. Osburn and Dr. Creasy is partly that the tuberculosis is stationary, and partly that Dr. Vaudry did not ascer<lb/>tain whether she had the symptoms of spitting of blood and severe sweating at night—I do not discredit him; it is only a question of opinion—undoubtedly he did detect tuberculosis—spitting of blood and the non-appearance of that symptom is the strongest point against the accuracy of Dr. Vaudry's opinion—when Dr. Quain says that 50 per cent, of the cases are not attended with blood-spitting, he does not say acute cases—undoubtedly there are many cases of phthisis without spitting of blood, and there are cases that go on for years and years, but we are dealing with acute phthisis—Dr. Vaudry said the girl could not live more than a few years; but your extract will</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250107"/>
               <p>not apply, because the word "acute" does not appear—the girl did not live more than a few days—I say that tuberculosis was quiescent and latent, partly because the tubercles were not in the membrane, and partly because of the condition of the little nodules surrounding it, and they were pale and of long standing, on account of their colour—I mean some months—the disease had reached a stop—there was a caseous cavity, with it distinct membrane lining—activity produced caviation, and further observation showed a certain amount of fibrous tissue in the periphery—the material inside was of a caseous character—there had been some softening down, but there was no action going on—there was no evidence of recent activity—a number of small patches might have produced originally one development of the cavity, the others remaining stationary round it—we call the apex of the lung the dangerous part in tuberculosis because it is the part from which it spreads more rapidly—we always call it the dangerous area—the chances of recovery are less—I do not think in this case that the tubercular area was materially added to—only a small area was shown to be in work in one lobe of the lung—I did not see starvation mentioned in the depositions, so that I may have been the first to mention it—one must always, before arriving at a conclusion that it is death due to starvation, think of the possibility of the presence of other diseases which might stimulate starvation, and I must eliminate their probability, or, if you like, possibility—I found it necessary to eliminate diabetes—that was only honest—the symptoms are not entirely the same—diabetes, commencing on persons of this age, would become more rapidly dangerous—there might be six months between its com<lb/>mencement and the death, or less—rapid emaciation is one of the leading symptoms, and great thirst right up to the death in acute diabetes within the last few hours of life—the passing of water may cease towards the last, but practically up to the end that goes on, say to within twenty-four hours—it depends upon when coma comes on—it varies—coma is not necessary, but one expects it—I recognise Professor Allbutt as a leading authority—I agree that the strength gradually diminishes, and the patient dies in a dazed condition without actually becom<lb/>ing comatose—I know the book very well—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Termination—Death occurs in many cases of one or other of the complica<lb/>tions to be described of which pulmonary phthisis is perhaps the most common. Very often the patients strength becomes diminished, and be dies quietly in a drowsy condition without actually becoming como<lb/>tose; but in many cases the accidents that precede death come on more or less suddenly from some slight cause such as fatigue, excitement, or a chill; and death is preceded by coma of a peculiar type. Any acute in<lb/>fectious process is peculiarly liable to terminate fatally in diabetes; this has been abundantly illustrated in the last few years owing to the great prevalence of influenza, which has proved fatal to many diabetics even where no special visceral complications such as pneumonia has been mani<lb/>fested; as a rule these cases have died comatose"—that is consistent with what I said before—I also agree with what he states with regard to diabetes, mellitus, broncho-pneumonia, and gangrene—in this case we nave a history of the broncho-pneumonia and slight pleurisy with any fluid; also tuberculosis mischief in the lungs; that the condition of</p>

               <p>the lungs in diabetes is not always pancreatic—that would not point either way, but perhaps it would be a little against diabetes—menstruation in women is more frequently absent through other affections than diabetes—it is very common for young girls to suffer from the absence of menstruation—girls of this age do suffer, especially in a badly-nourished state—I agree that the appetite gets more and more voracious in diabetes except towards the very last, and that there is a great appetite, especially for starchy articles of food, and mainly for things which the patient ought not to have—I agree with Dr. Quain, and have seen cases where the patient will be still or do anything—that may indicate a change in the mental condition in acute diabetes—I agree that the satisfaction of the appetite produces no feeling of satiety; that even in diabetics the appetite will fail in the later stage—except for scratches the skin is not dry, and the scratches found may have been caused by something else—irritation between the toes might depend upon the cleanliness—this girl was in a dirty state when she died—there might have been the tendency to scratch—the itching would be about the genitals and all round her—the temperature might rise nine out of ten in acute, but not if one takes chronic, diseases—I agree that one of the symptoms is a weakness of mind and that heart failure occurs in most ordinary cases of diabetes—if there is constraint undoubtedly there would be evidence of diabetes—unfortunately, in this case, there was no oppor<lb/>tunity to examine the water—there is the evidence that the girl was in the habit of getting out of bed during the night, but we do not know for what purpose; if we knew she did it to pass water we would be more suspicious—diabetes would be the theory if it were shown that she passed a large quantity, but it must be due to irritation of the parts—I should want the two things in order to admit your point—if you could satisfy me upon that, the theory of diabetes would be strengthened—one cannot possibly exclude diabetes, but the extreme possibility is it did not exist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw no other symptoms consistent with diabetes but a voracious appetite—that may have been due to the fact that the girl wanted food—going to the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> signs in diabetics, the intestinal mucous membrane is generally thickened or enlarged—in the deceased it was not—in diabetics the kidneys are enlarged—in the deceased they were healthy and normal in size—in diabetics the heart is generally normal—in the deceased it was small, wasted and pale—there remains only emaciation as consistent with diabetics—in my opinion it was most consistent with starvation.</p>

                  </hi>, M. A., M. D. (Camb.), F. R. C. P. I was formerly a fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge—I am senior assistant physician at St. George's Hospital, lecturer on pathology in the medical school there, and senior assistant physician at the Victoria Hospital for Children—my opinion on this matter was taken a week ago—I have read the evidence of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination given before the Coroner, the evidence of Dr, Luff and all the depositions at Bow Street, including the general evidence in the case—the roughness of the skin was compatible with quasi-starvation and with diabetes—I think in this case the condition of the skin would depend chiefly on the diabetes, rather than on the lung disease—I should expect it to be dry, scaly, and wrinkled—in diabetes there is a tendency to get a form of bronchial pneumonia which spreads along the bronchial tubes—if it affects one part of the lungs extensively it may become entirely consolidated; if the bronchial pneumonia is small in amount the areas of consolidation imitate very slightly the appearance of tuberculosis, and in some cases the micro<lb/>scope must be used to determine—the low caseous form of bronchial pneumonia, breaking down, is comparatively often met with in the terminal stage of diabetes—constipation is the ordinary and usual thing, but diarrhoea may appear towards the termination of the disease—two of the best recognised symptoms of diabetes are intense thirst and voidance of large quantities of urine, frequently during the night—the first may dis<lb/>appear ten days or a fortnight before death, and the second may diminish about a fortnight from the end—coma and lung complications are the two most frequent methods of death in diabetes, I have examined <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> ten eases, and been present at nine, and have seen a good many cased during life—in my experience, the pulmonary disease is, perhaps, the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250110"/>
               <p>commoner cause of death; and then coma may occur on the top—in other cases death results from extreme exhaustion—when I speak of lung disease, I mean the destructive disease of the lung which occurs in diabetes, which has the appearance of pneumonia, but which is probably an acute tubercular pneumonia, specially liable to occur in diabetes—it is difficult to fix that appearance positively with the naked eye—the tubercles would be visible to the eye, but are often only distinguishable under the microscope, and are liable to be confounded with other tubercles—in a case of typical diabetes you would probably find parts of either one or both lungs solid, and of a yellowish-white colour, very apt to break down—it might occur in corresponding positions in both lungs—the breaking down produces a cavity—any person looking at the state of those lungs might form the opinion that it was croupous pneumonia, whereas it might possibly be tubercular pneumonia, and then it would be an ordinary complication of diabetes—there might be no naked eye positive evidence of tubercles—I think the appearances described are compatible with the view that this was a form of bronchial caseous pneumonia, in confluence with diabetes, and becoming permanent in the lower part of the lungs—croupous pneumonia frequently occurs in the cause of diabetes as well—I think the cavity by itself is unlikely to cause death—in the absence of any fibrous tissues round these caseous nodules, I should say there was no indication to regard them as being old—I think I am justified in drawing the conclusion that the cavity was recent, and that would rather strengthen my opinion that the caseating cavity was active—I have made over 1,150 <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations, generally—the nineteen I spoke of apply to diabetes—I agree with Dr. Luff that taking all the medical things in the case it is impossible to eliminate diabetes—I think there is a positive element in favour of its being the cause of death, and that is the hyper<lb/>atrophy of the walls of the bladder—if the patient had not had sufficient to eat or drink the amount of water passed would have been diminished and that would lead to disuse of the bladder—if an excessive quantity of water was passed the bladder would have had more work to do, and would have got bigger to do its work, like other muscles, the bladder being a hollow muscle—I think on the evidence of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> signs and death symptoms diabetes would be the more satisfactory cause of death—if it were shown that she got up for the purpose of passing water it would strengthen my opinion—ill-usage such as Edith Garrett has deposed to would be a factor—if the cavity and nodules were at the apex of the lung it would be in favour of its being ordinary tubercular disease, and would be consistent with the tubercular disease of the lung that accompanies diabetes; you do not find that tubercular disease elsewhere in the body as a rule—purpura is a rather rare accompaniment of diabetes—with purpura, it being a condition of the blood vessels in which the walls are brittle and the blood likely to leave the vessels, any slight force, such as grasping the arm in a friendly way will leave a mark—in her state of health the mere handling of the deceased for the purpose of lifting or washing her might possibly account for some of the bruises, especially on the arms, I could not pay it would—gangrene is a known combination in diabetes—the absence of subcutaneous fat is consistent with quasi<lb/>starvation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250111"/>
               <p>and with diabetes—the muscular structures being small and pale is neutral, and so also is the healthy state of the peritoneum—the omentum generally contains a fair amount of fat—the fact that it was remarkably thin, almost transparent and devoid of fat is consistent with acute diabetes, I think—the small intestine being empty and collapsed points rather to quasi-starvation than to diabetes, but if the patient had but very little food during the last four days, and there was some diarrhoea, it would tend to explain the emptiness of the intestine—if she had an orange only on the Friday; then I should not expect necessarily to find any food in the small intestine—diabetes in an acute form may terminate fatally within six months with people of her age, and in that case the noticeable changes are most rapid—I should call acute diabetes cases which begin and end within six months; it is more rapid and fatal in young people—the fact of the colon being unusually small and contracted and practically empty is, on the face of it, in favour of quasi-starvation, but if the girl had diarrhoea it would tend to explain it—generally in diabetes the kidneys are larger, but not always—there is nothing against the diabetes theory in the described condition of the heart—the pancreas is not necessarily affected in diabetes—starvation is described as giving rise to atrophy of the pancreas; in quasi-starvation it would be diminished in size—from reading the account of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> I consider the amount of change as described in the lungs was quite sufficient to bring about death in a person who was previously to that in a fair state of nutrition—if the tubercular disease was latent I think it would be less affected by bad food than if the tubercular disease were active, and voracious appetite occurs in diabetes—it is by no means rare in diabetes to get a change taking place in the nerves, especially, perhaps, in the nerves of the legs, which bring about a condition in which the person has a difficulty in moving the muscles of their limbs in a satisfactory way—I think it would be more pronounced as the disease advanced in virulence—the skin of a diabetic person is less tolerant of any injury than the skin of a healthy person—teeth may decay and drop out in diabetes—the voracious appetite may disappear just before death, and the amount of urine may diminish—on cessation of the menstrual flow I should lay no stress; it is consistent with diabetes—blood spitting may be latent in a diabetic subject—so far as I have any evidence to go upon I agree that it is impossible to eliminate diabetes as the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say diabetes was the cause of death, or a con<lb/>tributing cause of death—I think the doctors who conducted the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> would be better judges than I of what was seen—my opinion is that the appearances as described were consistent with the view that they were the irregular caseous pneumonia, which is particularly likely to super<lb/>vene in the course of diabetes, and which is probably of a tubercular nature—tubercular and croupous pneumonia are different, but they may under certain circumstances resemble each other—I think I could confound the one with the other from a naked-eye examination, under certain con<lb/>ditions—I think a competent and careful man might confound them in making a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> with some forms of tubercular pneumonia—I think the duration of this caseous cavity in association with the described con<lb/>dition</p>

               <p>of the lower part of the lung indicates a late stage—the mere pres<lb/>ence of an old cavity in the lung in a case of diabetes might show that previous to the onset of diabetes there had been consumption, but that I do not take to be the interpretation in this case—I should say the dia<lb/>betes had lasted not less than perhaps 5 months, from the emaciation, not from the lungs—the leading symptoms of diabetes are, I think, thirst, the effort to appease it, and the passing of water in very large volume and at very short intervals—constipation is the ordinary accompaniment of dia<lb/>betes—if it was diabetes, in this case at least, during some period of five months, there must have been thirst and passing of water in a marked degree—this was a very rapid case of diabetes—I should not say thirst would continue up to the very end—the disappearance of thirst 10 or 14 days before the end is not the rule—it might occur—so with the voidance of urine, it is not the rule, but it is rather commoner—the yellow colour of the nodules would be evidence of the consumption being less acute than if it were grey—I think the tubercles were comparatively recent be<lb/>cause of the absence of fibrous tissue around them—they are not within a week or two if this is yellow—I put their possible age at 6 or 8 weeks—they are first grey and then yellow—if they were ordinary tubercles and there had been fibrous tissue they might have been any age—I consider the thinness of the omentum consistent with death from insufficient food—I do not think I can answer whether it is indicative of it—I should expect to find that condition if there had been long-continued depriva<lb/>tion of food, but it does not exclude diabetes—I do not think a case is recorded of the co-existence of this state of the omentum, colon, and intestines with death from diabetes—I think the thin and contracted condition of the colon is indicative of starvation—I should not call three motions in four days, one of them loose, diarrhoea—the absence of foeces is consistent with insufficient gestation of food—in diabetes you would expect, other things being equal, to find fences there—I should expect the walls of the bladder to become thin if starvation were accompanied by the deprivation of liquid, though the bladder might be contracted, and so its walls might appear to be thicker—the thickening in this case is consistent with slight inflammation, and cystitis is consistent with diabetes—inflammation of the bladder is a much more common cause—it is fairly common in diabetes—in about 40 per cent, of the cases—the cause ascribed by Dr. Osburn is quite consistent—inflammation of the bladder may be caused through exposure to cold reducing the resistance of the body and the bladder particularly, or from unclean habits accompanied by vermin, or a fall by a person with a full bladder—the more complete the deprivation of food the more marked would be the atrophy of the pancreas—the pancreas may be the last abdominal organ to atrophy—I do not feel I can express an expert opinion upon that—the kidneys are generally somewhat enlarged in diabetes—if purpura existed I should expect to find signs of it all over the body—I do not know that in most cases of diabetes the intestinal membrane is thickened—it is unusual on the diabetes theory that it was found in this case—I should rely on the weight of the liver rather than the size—in diabetes the heart is smaller than usual, except where there is some complication like disease of the arteries—I think in cases of acute diabetes it is generally atrophied if there are no complications that make it larger.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the thirst ceased the voidance of water in excessive quantities would cease in relative proportions—diabetes, though perhaps commoner than it was, is not a common disease—when I expressed the opinion that it; was impossible to eliminate diabetes as the cause of death, the state of the colon, and intestines were present to my mind—it is quite possible for a person to live with one-half of the lung diseased and to keep fat inside—I do not say it is probable.</p>

I was spoken to about this annoyance which was going on—some of the letters were given to me, and on April 6th I saw the prisoner leaving a newspaper shop in Blue<lb/>cross Street, Leicester Square, where letters are addressed—I said to her that I had seen the Marquis of Worcester, and that he had complained about her threatening letters, that she must discontinue sending them, and likewise not go to St. James's Place, for if she did she would be arrested—that was the very day on which the postcard was sent—she said she had a claim on the marquis, and then she mentioned the names of several other gentlemen—she described them as her friends—I took these steps and put a constable outside the house—at the Police court, just after she was committed for trial, the prisoner made a statement to me—she said she was in armed—I arrested her on April 15th—I read the warrant to her—she said, "I wrote the letters at Bath. Two private detectives sent we to Glasgow; but I found the ticket was taken to Carlisle. Beaufort has done this; Worcester would not. Can Magistrates do as they like?

                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer, of 139, Lillie Road—on April 1st I was going towards the City with my son on an omnibus—we came down the Old Brompton Road and got off at Sussex Place—we were going to South Kensington Station—my son got on to the refuge in the road, going across the road, I did not—we were together—I was waiting to cross the road a few yards away from him—he was ahead of me—I saw him leave the shelter, and an omnibus came sharp round on to him, and the pole caught him and knocked him down—the prisoner was driving it—I know the point at Thurloe Place where the <hi rend="italic">'buses</hi> stop, where the shops are—the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> was on the wrong side of the road—if it had been on the right side it would have passed on the other side of the refuge—I saw a Road Car <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> on the proper side of the road—the defendant's <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> was behind it, and the prisoner pulled off to the off side—I saw no reason why he should have pulled across—I went for assist<lb/>ance, and afterwards he was taken to the hospital in a cab and I followed—I have lived near this place for twenty years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I travel by this road very frequently, not every morning—coming down Sydney Place the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> would leave South Kensington Station on its right side—its proper course would have been to keep to the left of the refuge up to the corner of Harrington Road, which is parallel with the refuge—the proper place for setting down and taking up is in Onslow Place—I have never, up till now, seen a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> pass on the wrong side of the refuge—I did not see anything to account for the driver taking that unwonted course—I did not see a gentleman on horseback just before this happened, but I did afterwards—I did not hear two persons, one on the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and one on the refuge, speaking—I did not hear what the driver said—it was the Road Car which prevented me from passing on to the refuge—the wheel of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> did not go over my son; it rather shoved</p>

Coming out of Sydney Place across Onslow Square to pull on the point which is on the near side of the obelisk my attention was called to a horseman. He seemed confused, and I did not know which way to go. Thinking to give way to him, I pulled my horses to the off side. That was before I reached the refuge, thinking he would be coming between the refuge and me. Instead of that he turned round and went on the off side of my <hi rend="italic">'bus.</hi> I pulled the near side rein to give him a free passage. In the meantime deceased was meeting me.

                  </hi>. I am second clerk at Westminster Police-court—on January 15th Mr. Safford took the depositions, and on January 22nd I read over the evidence to Ostime upon a charge against John Perry before Mr. Sheil for larceny from the person of Mrs. Bolton—Ostime was the first witness—on 22nd he was re-called and added something to his deposition, which I took—I read it over, and he signed it—no correction was made—the deposition was transmitted to the North London Sessions—Ostime was bound over to those Sessions. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Frank Ostime saith,—I am sub-inspector of Police Department of the District Railway Company. On December 10th about nine p.m. at Westminster Bridge Station I saw prisoner and another man on the platform going westward. I kept observation on them, and saw them go into a second-class carriage. I got in another compartment. They left the train at Earl's Court, and crossed over to the City platform. They entered a second-class compart<lb/>ment of a down train going back again. I entered another compartment. At South Kensington they all alighted, and waited on the platform from where they had got out till another train came up. On the arrival of the 9.55 Great Western train they entered the second-class compartment, in which was a woman. Prisoner sat opposite her; the other man sat on her left side. I followed them in another compartment to Sloane Square Station, where I saw the woman alight. I was unable to speak to her. I went to the compartment from which she had alighted, and said to the prisoner and the other man in the compartment, 'The game's up, Jack; you will have to come out at the next station. I am going to search you to see what you have got on you.' The man not in custody replied, 'All right, Ostime; you are taking a liberty. We have done nothing.' Prisoner said nothing. We all went together to Victoria Station. I went to the door of the compartment for assistance, when the woman who had alighted at Sloane Square came up to the carriage. She said, pointing to the prisoner and the other man, and in their hearing, 'These are the two.' The guard said, 'Will you charge them?' She said, 'Yes.' I requested them to alight. They did so. Just before alighting the prisoner said to the woman,' What have we done? We have not got anything; you can search us.' I, with the station inspector, took the prisoner and the other man to his office and sent for a police constable. While we were waiting his arrival a train ran into the station. After it had started, and was nearly out of the station, the two men took hold of me, threw me bodily out of the office on to the platform, jumped on to the foot-board of the last coach, and made their escape. I knew the prisoner well by sight.</p>

I am a sub-inspector of the Police Department of the District Railway. At 2.45 p.m. yesterday, July 23rd, at Blackfriars Station, I saw the prisoner and two other men not in custody come on the platform.

               <p>the compartment he was in, and told him he would be charged with frequenting the line to commit felony—he said, "I've done nothing." On Wednesday last (22nd instant) I was at Victoria Station of our railway, and I saw the prisoner and the same two men enter the station. They went on to the platform, and when the train came in they all entered a third-class compartment. The prisoner sat on the right of a female, close to her, the two others sat opposite. I entered the adjoining compartment, looked out of the window, and saw prisoner put his left hand into the folds of the lady's dress. All three men alighted at St. James's Park (although they had booked to Aldgate East), and sat on the seat. I spoke to the female. On the arrival of the next down train the three men walked up the train and looked into various compartments, and eventu<lb/>ally entered one in which a female was alone. Prisoner sat next to her and the others sat opposite. At Temple Station they again alighted, and walked up the train, and entered another third-class compartment of the same train. The three men all alighted at Aldgate (Metropolitan) and went towards Brick Lane. I saw prisoner and the two other men each day this week on the line, and on other days acting in a similar way.</p>

Those men are gone"—I said, "Gone?" and he said, "You should not have left me"—I said, "You knew where I was; if you wanted me why did not you call me"—a passenger-suggested sending a telegram—I was going to telegraph before that suggestion was made, and I ran to the box to do it—the telegraph office is opposite my office—I went alone—I wired to Sloane Square in the hopes of catching the train and the two men—Ostime said they had jumped into the last coach—I sent for the police—two constables came—Ostime was there—I believe he gave them some in<lb/>formation—I am certain Ostime did not telegraph—Ostime limped a little, but he seemed composed.</p>

It was the last coach they got in"—I said, "Were you hurt?"—he said, "I slightly sprained my ankle"—I said, "Did you telegraph to the next station, Sloane Square, to have the men stopped?"—he said, "Yes, but it was too late: the train had left there"—I told him to make a report of the whole matter—he said he fell on the platform, that they had thrown him down out of the room just outside—he said, "I know one of them well, you know him, too, well"—I said. "Who?"—he said, "Perry. We had him at the Mansion House"—the same day he made this report, which I submitted to the manager, Mr. Powell—it is addressed to him—it is in Ostime's writing, and is signed by him—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "December 11th, 1897, Mrs. Bolton robbed of her purse, alleged by John Perry and another man, in second-class carriage of down Great Western train between South Kensington and Sloane Square Station, 10th inst. I beg to report that about 8.45 p.m., yesterday, 10th inst., I was on the platform of Sloane Square Station, and on the arrival of an up Great Western train I saw two men whom I recognised as expert pickpockets in a first-class carriage. I kept observation upon them for about an hour, during which time they travelled to and fro between Westminster and Earl's Court in first and second-class carriages, in which were ladies, but so far as I could learn no person lost anything until about 9.55 p.m., when I saw these men enter a second-class carriage of a down Great-Western train at Kensington, in which was a lady alone. On the train reaching Sloane Square I saw the lady alight. I watched the compartment, I being two or three compartments away, and seeing that the two men did not alight I suspected they had stopped the lady. I therefore entered the compart<lb/>ment in which they were then seated alone, and told them they would have to get out at the next station, when I should have them searched One of the men said, 'All right, Ostime; but you are taking a b——y liberty. We haven't got anything.' When the train left Victoria Station I was about to alight to call assistance, when the lady I had seen alight at Sloane Square came to the compartment with the guard and said these men had stolen her purse, and she would charge them. When Station-Inspector Shenton came up I requested the men to alight, and a crowd assembled. I, accompanied by Inspector Shenton, took them over to the station-inspector's room on the up platform. Inspector Shenton left me in the room with the men and walked back along the platform as far as the refreshment bar, where he stood talking to the lady who had been robbed, and a small crowd of persons who surrounded them. I whistled to him to come to me, but be apparently did not hear me. While in the room I asked the men for their tickets, but they were unable to produce any. As the 10.11 p.m. up Circle train was running out of the station I opened the door to see if a constable had arrived, when the two men rushed at me together, caught me by the arms, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250137"/>
               <p>flung me bodily out the room on to the platform. They then ran and jumped on to the foot-board of, I think, the last coach of the out<lb/>going train. I recovered myself, and again caught hold of one of them, but he swung his arm round and knocked me towards the month of the tunnel, but I saved myself from falling by catching hold of the signal ladder, and beyond slightly bruising my right foot against the bottom of the ladder I was not hurt, but the two men got clear away. I at once requested Station-Inspector Shenton to telegraph to Sloane Square, but the message arrived too late for anything to be done. The lady who was robbed gave me her name as Mrs. Bolton, 'Devonia,' Lordship Lane, Forest Hill, and said her purse contained about 10s. or 12s. in silver and a first<lb/>class season ticket on the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway. I gave particulars of this matter, with particulars of the two men, to Police-constables 150 B and 203 B, who were called in, and asked them to have it circulated. On the return of the Great Western guard from the Mansion House he handed Station-Inspector Shenton 12s. in silver, which he said he had found under the cushion of the seat in the compartment in which these men had travelled. I also instructed Station-Inspector Shenton to tell the ganger to search the tunnels between South Kensington and Victoria, which he did, and during the night the purse, with the season ticket in it, was picked up by Ganger Staines on the ballast between South Ken<lb/>sington and Sloane Square. On asking Station-Inspector Shenton why he left me alone with these men he said he went to look after the lady who was robbed, as he was afraid she might not wait to charge them, and he suggested that I ought to have looked myself in the room with the men, and then they could not have escaped. One of these men was a big strong man, nearly six feet high, and I know him to be a boxing man. The other was a man named Perry, whom I charged at the Mansion House Justice Room on July 24, 1896, with attempting to pick pockets on the line. On that decision, after he had been sentenced, he turned to me and said, 'You f—r, I will put a knife in you when I come out.' This man is a very expert thief, and is a trainer of pickpockets.

Alfred Powell, Esq., Manager."—I afterwards spoke to him from time to time with regard to this report—about three times a week—mentioning Perry—I said, "It is very strange this man, who is so well known, does not get re-captured"—he said he could not make it out—he went to the East<lb/>end with Detective Chibnall, but he always returned saying he could hear nothing of him, the East-end being an expected resort of Perry—on January 15th Ostime reported himself at nine a.m.—he said, "we got that, fellow Perry last night"—I said, "That's a good job"—he said, "I was sent for late last night to go to Gerald Road Police-station. Shenton went as well. I picked Perry out, but Shenton made a mess of it. He picked out a boy of about eighteen"—I afterwards attended at the Westminster Police-court—formal evidence was given of the arrest, and Perry was remanded—Ostime has been in the habit of making reports to me—I am well acquainted with his writing—to the best of my belief Exhibit "E" is his writing—I have seen him write by</p>

I had got two men in the station-master's office; they threw me out and jumped on the foot-board of the last coach and made good their escape"—I said, "Who are they? I believe you know them"—he said, "Yes; one is Waxy"—I said, "Who is Waxy?"—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Perry" and "We should know him. We shall find him round Aldgate. I have had him before. He got three months at the Mansion House"—he said, "I picked them up at Westminster Bridge and followed them to Earl's Court, where they alighted, changed platforms, and Centered the train going east. They alighted again at Gloucester Road, and waited till a Great Western train, came into the station, Perry and the other man. They entered a second-class carriage"—I said before the Magistrate that he said, "As the train was running out of the station Perry and the other man, whose name I do not know, got into a second-class carriage with Mrs. Bolton"—"At Sloane Square Mrs. Bolton alighted, and I entered the carriage with the two men, Perry and the other man"—then he said, "The game's up, <hi rend="italic">Jack.</hi> You will have to get out at the next station and be searched"—at Victoria he said they were taken to the station-master's office by Shenton and himself; that Shenton left him with the two men, who knocked him down and made good their escape—I made inquiries and saw the prisoner again on December 13th, and went with him to Brick Lane, Spitalfields, and patrolled the vicinity, with a view to find Perry and the other man—the prisoner said we would find him round Brick Lane and Aldgate—I think he mentioned that Perry lived at Quitter Street—as we were passing Catling's coffee house, 9, Brick Lane, he said, "That is one of the places he uses"—I stopped and looked through the window to see if I could see Perry from his description, and the prisoner walked away 20 or 30 yards—the coffee shop was full of men, from 25 to 30—I do not think I could be seen—I glanced from the side—I was in plain clothes—I rejoined Ostime, and we stood or patrolled outside Aldgate East Station about three-quarters of an hour—so many people nodded to the prisoner that I asked who they were—fellows between 18 and 25—he said, "They are some of the boys," meaning thieves—not seeing any<lb/>body</p>

               <p>send any more letters to 78, Quilter Street—I am not sure where this was sent—he said "Care of Station Master"—he lost one, and told me two or three weeks after he had not got it, then he told me he did receive it, and to put "District Railway"—it must have been in December—I do not suppose he had seen me for a week, because of my bad hand—I am not sure whether I answered it—I have sent him a good many letters—when I met him I introduced my friend, and arranged that he was not to interfere with him—he wanted a gold watch, and suggested the Mansion House as the best place to get it—I went to the Mansion House with my friend and another man, but seeing a suspicious sort of man I went away—I told the prisoner about it—he said I had made a mistake—I said I did not think I had—I saw the pri<lb/>soner behind a hoarding—he said, "That man cannot take anyone in custody without referring to me"—I do not remember what I did next—I was arrested by Detective Mew on January 10th, and prosecuted under the Prevention of Crimes Act, and sentenced to eight months' hard labour on January 12th—I was released on September 11th—the latter part of September I met the prisoner in a billiard-room in a house in Aldgate—he asked me when I was going to start—I said I would start, and two or three days afterwards I resumed operation between Earl's Court and the Mansion House—sometimes the prisoner was with me—he had several sums of money from me during that time, and all through October—at the Police-court I said £20, but he has had a good deal more, including the £8—I will say £20 at the end off October—I have met him at West<lb/>minster railway station, as a rule at his own suggestion—he gave me a sign—if torn up papers were thrown this side the line he would be on the other—if they were on the other side I should find him at Gloucester Road or Kensington—at Westminster station there was a little glass window—no one would notice it unless shown—against the pay-box, where he could see everybody, and they could not see him—you could see his bat, but not his face, and in going to the public-house opposite Big Ben I should look for him first—about the end of October I met him in Aldgate about nine p.m. in the billiard-room of the public-house at the top of Middlesex Street—he asked me to go to the Charing Cross up platform after the play-houses were out—I went with him—he stood behind a gentleman while I stole his pearl pin—we went to St. James's Park station, and he passed me out with no ticket—took me back on the other side with no ticket—and I went to the Mansion House or Cannon Street—we had a drink—the ticket collector said, "All right, coming back?"—I left him there—I gave him the pin—it was not very valuable because it was a bored pearl, but I never saw the pin on him—the beginning of November, with three men I referred the police to, I met the prisoner at the corner of Middlesex Street, near Aldgate East Station—we had drinks in the bar—he said, "I want to recover a pearl pin" (it was a diamond with a pearl) "which was lost at the Mansion House about four weeks ago"—I made inquiries—he said I could trust him, the person who lost it was a shrewd man, and did not want to have anything to do with the police; but he would give £5 to the person who worked it back, and Ostime was to give me £3—I went to places where I was likely to get it, but could not—I sent him a letter and</p>

Your friends did not have what I was speaking about. Since I saw you I have found it at Netting Hill, and hope to make a bit out of it in a day or two. If you want to do any business with me, you have only to drop me a line and make a meet. I should think you ought to get a good living up our way this time of the year. Hoping to see you soon.—Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">FRED</hi>"—shortly after I received that document I went to Bristol—I was away about two weeks—the end of November I returned to the billiard-room in Aldgate—on December 10th I went on the District Railway—I was I not there on the 9th, as a lady witness says in my case—my companion and I took two tickets from Aldgate to Charing Cross, by which we could go up and down the line as many times as we liked by crossing the bridges, without being challenged at Kensington, Gloucester Road, or Earl's Court—when we got out at Westminster the prisoner was not there, and we went on to Kensington—I was following my companion to a second-class compartment when I saw the prisoner standing with his back towards me against the stairs—I pushed him with my shoulder as I passed him—he followed to the second-class compartment, and came in with us—it was at Kensington, next to Sloane Square—my friend sat on the side of the lady who was in the carriage—I think there was another lady in the carriage—I sat opposite, and the prisoner came and sat next to me—the purse was stolen—there were two robberies before Mrs. Bolton's—there were three in about three quarters of an hour to an hour—the lady got out at the next station—we went on to Earl's Court—it was a dark green lap-over purse which my friend stole—it contained 6s. 8d. or 6s. 8 1/2 d.—I put the money separate in my pocket—Ostime asked for the purse as he wanted to take it home—he put it in his pocket—at Earl's Court the three of us took the train back—we got into a second-class compartment—there was another lady, and we occupied the same position as before—the purse we stole that time did not contain any money—it was a light lap-over purse, and full of papers—the woman got out, I think, at Gloucester Road—we looked over the papers and gave them to the prisoner, purse and all—at Kensington my companion and I got into a compartment with another lady, Mrs. Bolton, who gave evidence against me, just before the train went out—my friend sat by the lady's side—I sat opposite—the purse was stolen at Sloane Square—the lady got out—then the prisoner got in, and looked along the platform where the lady was going—he said, "It is all right"—my friend said, "Feel the weight of this, Fred," and gave the purse with its contents into the. prisoner's hands—he balanced the purse in his hands and gave it back and said, "They are quids," meaning sovereigns, by the weight of it—my friend opened the purse and looked into each compartment, and said, "It is not gold, it is silver"—he counted the money, and there was £1 1s. 3d., made up of sixpences, five shillings, and about five shillings in threepenny pieces—we shifted towards the far window, the prisoner opened the off window, and the purse was thrown out—we shut the window up again, and I took all the threepenny bits as I thought, and added to them, and</p>

               <p>gave the prisoner 8s. out of that purse, but I found I had one in my hand after I put the money under the cushion—I gave the prisoner the threepenny bits because, like five-shilling pieces, they can be identified, and he was not likely to be searched—as we were counting over the other money the train got into Victoria, and as I was giving my friend his share of the 6s. 8d. the prisoner said, "Look out <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> here she is, with a guard at the door, Do away with the money. I will search you," or "have you searched and do my best for you, and make it all right"—the prisoner was on my left and the friend opposite, near the same window—the guard opened the door and said, "This lady accuses you men of having her purse"—the prisoner got up and went to the door near where the lady was standing, and said, "Do you mean me, lady?"—she made a reply I did not catch—something about "two"—I was putting the money under the seat—the prisoner was in front of me, standing at the door—after a little altercation between the prisoner and the guard, Inspector Shenton came up—he said, "He is one of our detectives," and then to prisoner, "Take them to the office"—the prisoner said to me in a stern voice, but winking his eye, "Come on out"—I stepped out and he walked by the side of me—as we crossed the bridge to the other platform the prisoner said, "Do away with your ticket Jack and tell (so-and-so) to do the same" (as he was walking behind) "you know they are wrong, they will do you"—the tickets were for the up line—I crushed my ticket and threw it on to the platform—before I entered the office, when my friend was close to me, I told him to do the same—when the prisoner was with us in the office he said, "Whatever comes I will do my best. They have gone for the police. I thought they would search you and be satisfied"—my friend said, "She has got me for it, I have no other chance to get off, let me go away"—the prisoner said "How?"—I heard a train coming in so I said, "Let us both go in this train"—the prisoner considered for a minute, peeping out of the door on to the platform, then he said, "You push me down to straighten me with these people"—meaning the railway people—the prisoner bided his time and then said, "Do it quick, here they come"; and opened the door—my friend went off first—he stopped in the doorway—I stopped him and went off too—the prisoner might have staggered, I do not think he fell—lam positive he did not—we got into the same carriage, but into different compartments, when the train was in motion—on arrival at Sloane Square I put my dark brown overcoat on my arm—we jumped out, passed the ticket collector and out of the station—I was clean-shaved—my height is about 5 ft. 6 in.—I would not betray my companion—he is an inch taller than I am—I saw Ostime about a week afterwards in Brick Lane—my friend was with me—the three of us went into Goddard's public house—I saw two persons I knew—I called for drinks—Ostime said, "There was rather a commo<lb/>tion after you went, they did go on—I delayed them sending a telegram on to detain you at the up stations as long as possible, to give your train a good start, and if you had gone on further they would have had you because they were waiting for you"—I was about to tell him where we got away, and he said, "I know all about it"—he said, "The ticket collector said one of you pretended to feel in his coat, and said, "I have dropped my ticket from Victoria"—he said he had blamed it all on to the</p>

I think a hard felt hat, a coloured tie, no moustache, a brown overcoat, "which," he said, "I was obliged to give, as other people have seen it," and that my friend was 5 ft. 11 in.—he said, "I brought Detective Chibnall down for a blind the other day," meaning to Aldgate, "bat he is only a <hi rend="italic">mug,</hi> so it is all right"—he said he had been to the lady, she knew nothing, and the guard knew less—he said he had found the money, and the purse was found—he did not say he had taken them back—he said, "Everything lies with me"—my friend gave him a half-sovereign, and I gave my friend 5s. towards it—I said, "If the police round here should take me, they have seen my coat, they would know me"—he said, "I will be tot and make that all right"—Moss Levy, a book-maker, was there, and nodded to him—I only knew him as "Mossy"—I called his attention to the prisoner—the prisoner said, "Let me go out first, you come after<lb/>wards"—he went out first—my friend and I followed—on December 21st or 22nd, going to the billiard-room in Aldgate, I met the prisoner at the corner of Commercial Street—he said, "I was just coming to look for you"—we went into the public house at the corner and had drinks, and I gave him a sovereign as he pleaded poverty—he said it was all blown over—we separated, and he said he was going on to the District Railway—I next had handed to me this letter by Mr. Catling—I cannot swear to the envelope—(<hi rend="italic">Read Exhibit "G "</hi>: "Saturday.

I don't wish to go into details at present, but with your help no doubt you will hear things from witnesses which will surprise London. In his, Mr. F. Ostime's, evidence he swore he ain't saw me since December 10th; if you will bind and order the persons I refer you to, you will hear a lot. I have one letter from him about, the 5th of this month requesting a sovereign, which I sent to him c/o station-master, Victoria. I gave him two half-sovereigns before, one about December 20th in Aldgate, another the end or beginning January. Several persons saw me go in the public-house; one man was in saloon with a friend; he saw him, and I told him who he was. I gave him half-sovereign then, this person saw me. This last fourteen months he has had my money, whenever he sent. Nor am I the only one; he knew where I lived, and knew he only had to send to Commercial Street police; that is what makes me believe there has been fool play. He told me about this affair himself, and he got the men away and delayed the person wiring along to next station, and put it all on to the station inspector to clear himself. Told me inspector was suspended, and he was reduced live shillings a week over it. He lets those he fancy work without any fear, and he gets his share. I used to do the same, but left him long ago, although he has sent letters requesting me, as you will hear and see. I believe Mr. Button will speak to you next week.

I am the brother of a man named John Perry, who is at present under<lb/>going a sentence of twenty calendar months' imprisonment at Wormwood Scrubs. I came to this Court while my brother was under remand on the 15th January. I had some conversation with the prisoner. After my brother had been remanded on the 15th I saw the prisoner Ostime in the Waiting Room here. Prisoner spoke to me first. He said, 'Are you <hi rend="italic">Waxy's</hi> brother?' <hi rend="italic">Waxy</hi> is the nickname of my brother John. I said, 'Yes, sir. I think they call you Ostime. He said, 'What are you up here for?' He said,. 'I suppose it's to bring them letters up.' I said, 'Yes, I've brought them up on me—my brother wishing me to bring them up.' He said, 'Well, he'll be a b——fool for himself if he brings them to light. I've got something in my pocket for which he will go down.' I had the letters in my inside pocket. I said, 'I can't help it; it's what he wished me to fetch them up.' He said, 'All right. He knows best. If he's going to act dirty like that I can be the same. I have got something in my pocket which he'll go down, but I don't want to. We know each other too well for that. You tell him so.' He says, 'If he leaves everything in Green's hands (that's the solicitor) he'll get out of it. If he doesn't, there'll be a fall.' I took the letters home again. Detective Mew came up before the conversation ended, and Ostime then walked away. No one else was present but our two selves in the Waiting Room, near the cells. It was about ten minutes after the Court was all over." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined:</hi> "This conversation took place after my brother was remanded—after the first remand. I could not tell you the date. I know my brother requested the letters up on his remand. My brother was taken into custody and remanded a week. I brought the letters on the first day. My brother asked me three days before he came up to bring the letters here. He told me with his mouth. I saw him at Hollo way Prison during the week's remand. I did not go to the prisoner Ostime and say, 'Is your name Ostime?' He did say, 'Yes; are you <hi rend="italic">Waxy's</hi> brother. I did not say, 'Yes; how do you think he will get on?' I did not ask how he thought he would get on. Ostime did not say,' He is sure to go down; but you had better leave it in the</p>

               <p>hands of Louis Green, his counsel.' The other detective, Mew, said that. He was not present at the conversation between me and the prisoners, fort was present after It was the prisoner who advised that my brother should leave himself in the hands of his counsel, Louis Green. I had a little conversation with Serjeant Mew that day. Ostime was not present. He spilt away when he saw him coming. I have made a statement to Inspector Conquest, some time last week. It was signed by me after it was read over. I have been convicted twice, and been to prison twice. The first time was in 1893 for felony. I got six months. The next time was in 1896 for felony. I got six months again; that is all. I have been convicted more than twice—about four times for felony; put' it at the highest, five times; I have not had penal servitude. The longest time I have had was fourteen months. That was about eighteen months ago. I was released eighteen months ago.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector, B.</hi>) I was on duty at Gerald Road Police-station on the night of January 14th—Perry was detained there when I commenced duty at 10 p.m.—I took the charge against him about 10.30 or 10.45 p.m.—Ostime was present—according to the usual practice, Perry was asked his address—he gave 78, Quilter Street, Hackney Road—a telegram was sent to that address—9, Osborn Street was not mentioned—Perry had been in the cell an hour when I was requested to send a telegram—I got no other address.</p>

I have a warrant for your arrest. You will be charged with being an accessory, before and after the fact, to the robbery of Mrs. Bolton at Victoria Station on December 10th last; and, further, with assisting Perry and another man to escape"—he said, "I do not understand"—he was taken to Rochester Row Police Station and charged on the warrant—he made no further answer—I searched him—I found this pocket-book in which is the address, "c/o Mr. Catling," and then something in short-hand; also reward tickets in the book for services rendered, ranging from 4th July, 1894, to 10th December, 1897, and this official railway diary—I went to his apartments, at 5, Brookfield Road, Fulham—I found this dark green purse, a sovereign purse, and a lady's card case, a lady's reticule, and a hat brush in a leather case, with a monogram which has</p>

Dear Sir,—I received informa<lb/>tion stating that you are in quest of the letter I received from that gentle<lb/>man Master Ostime. I have enclosed the article. Mr. Conquest, I am willing to do all you want me to on one condition, that is that you will give me your word I'm not prosecuted.

I am a clerk in the office of Registrar of Joint-Stock Companies at Somerset House—I produce a file of documents connected with the company called Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons, Limited, incorporated on March 25th, 1896, with a nominal capital of £8,000—by the memorandum the object of the company is that of acquir<lb/>ing and carrying on the business of pianoforte manufacturers carried on by Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons at Bartholomew Works, Kentish Town—Francis Edward Jordan, 116, Chancery Lane, W. C., registered that company—among the documents before me Mr. Francis Richard Jordan is described as acting secretary to that company—the names of all the seven signatories are Brinsmead; and first among them is the name of Mr. Thomas Edward Brinsmead—there is a further agreement, dated March 27th, 1896, filed on the 31st, under which the three Brinsmeads, Thomas Edward, Edward George Stanley, and Sidney Walter Brinsmead, purport to sell the business to the company for a sum of £6,000 in fully paid up shares—there is an agreement filed under the date of April 2nd between the same parties to the issue in different proportions of fifty £1 shares apiece to each of the three Brinsmeads, 3,850 to Francis Richard Jordan, and 2,000 to Emily Ann Eli, making up 6,000—that second agreement of April 2nd purports to be signed by Francis Richard Jordan, as secretary of the company—under the date of April 22nd, 1896, a special resolution for voluntarily winding-up the company was passed and confirmed on May 9th, 1896; under which Jordan was appointed liquidator in the winding-up—the last summary of capital and shares connected with that company was filed on July 29th, 1896, showing the total number of shares taken up as 6,007, 6,000 of which have been dealt with in the different proportions, and the seven original shares to the signatories to the memorandum—there is a consent by the old company in the same file—on June 29th there is a consent by Jordan as liquidator of that company for the registration of a company under the same name:—this is the file of the second company that was registered on July 22nd, 1896, called Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons, Limited; the object of the company is that of acquiring as a going concern the business of pianoforte manu<lb/>facturers</p>

               <p>then carried on by the three Brinsmeads at Bartholomew Road.

H. Davis and the company, both of them—the subject matter of both agreements is the allotment of shares to Davis—no return of capital or share issue has been made or filed of the second company—3,000 ordinary and 2,000 deferred shares were allotted to Davis under this agreement—there are no more agreements on that file filed at Somerset House, except the copy of an order to wind up, dated December 3rd—it was an order of Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams—I do not know that that order was unsuccessfully appealed against—the file I have here is the file in relation to the registration of a limited company called the "Consolidated Contracts Company," dated December 30th, 1895—the object is to carry on the business of financial agents and company promoters, at 15, Queen-street, Cheapside—Mr. E. Allan Cleverton was secretary to the company—here is a summary of capital and shares made up to December 23rd, 1896, and I find that 692 £100 ordinary shares and fifteen founders' shares have been issued—James Wilson is the holder of all but seven shares, including the founders'—there is an agreement on the file between James Wilson and the Corporation dated March 23rd, 1896, which is signed on behalf of the Corporation by Mr. W. H. Kaye and Mr. H. Bernard, who are described in the agreement as directors of the limited company, and the same secretary, Mr. Cleverton, is a signatory to the agreement—the date on the register of the Institute of Investors is March 27th, 1897.</p>

               <p>which called my attention to a vacancy, and in consequence I went to the office of Messrs. Latham and Company, at Arthur Street East, in the City—I saw there the defendant Kaye in the first instance, and after a subse<lb/>quent interview he took me to see the defendant Bernard—my first inter<lb/>view was with Mr. Kaye, when he went over the particulars I gave him, and it remained unsatified until I saw Mr. Bernard in Cannon Street, but I could not quite remember the number—it was at the office of the Railway Municipal Building Company—I cannot quite remember the exact name of it—Mr. Kaye was there when I saw Mr. Bernard, and together they ratified the appointment—the offices of the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi> when I first took up my duties were at Arthur Street, at Lathom and Company's, and after<lb/>wards moved to 15, Little Trinity Lane—there the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi> continued to be published first of all from Lathom and Company's, and afterwards from Little Trinity Lane—it was a going paper when I was first appointed—I should say between fifty and sixty numbers had been issued—I think it was a monthly paper—when I got there the first number had No. 52 on it—it had always been going monthly—I was acting as sub-editor at the date of the issue of the paper of July 20th, 1896—this is a copy of the issue of that date (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contains a copy of a prospectus of Edward Thomas Brinsmead and Sons, Limited, together with an application form for shares at page 3 of the issue—on page 8 there is what purports to be an editorial article upon the company—I got the manuscript of that article from the printer, a Mr. Judd—it had been already printed when I saw it; I got the galley proof—I looked on Judd as the printer, but he got it printed by Wyman—the proofs were submitted for publication to the defendant Ainsworth—the articles or proofs were formerly taken for approval to him at the Cannon I Street office, and latterly to Queen Street, the office of the Consolidated Contracts Company—the proof of this particular article was sub<lb/>mitted to Mr. Ainsworth by me, with all the other articles and the contents of the paper—I took it and submitted it to him in what we call page form, made up as it is now—in galley form it would be in long slips, as it first comes Out—there may have been one or two corrections made in the proof which I submitted to Mr. Ainsworth by Mr. Ainsworth; I could not be certain about it, I could not specify them—roughly speaking, I should say 200,000 copies of the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi> were issued on this date, July 20th, 1896—whenever a company was adver<lb/>tised that was about the number—between 150,000 and 200,000 copies of the newspaper would be printed—the average circulation when there was no such advertisement would be between 2,000 and 3,000—to my knowledge, the Consolidated Contracts Company brought out com<lb/>panies—the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi> was only used for the purpose of companies they brought out—the only advertisements of new companies when there were these large issues were for companies brought out by the Consolidated Contracts Corporation—I remained in the service about eighteen months, I should think—during that time I was in the habit of seeing Mr. Ainsworth from time to time at Queen Street—I would go to him in relation to the publication of the paper—I was sub-editor—there was no editor—there was nobody above me—I took my instructions from Mr.</p>

               <p>Ainsworth with regard to the conduct of the paper—I might have taken them from Mr. Bernard when Mr. Ainsworth was away, but from nobody else—I remember seeing Mr. Kaye during the time I was employed there, but in no particular relation—he would come to the office, but I should not go to him for any instructions—when he came to the office I presume he came on the work of the Consolidated Contracts Corporation—he would not come to me; I should merely see him in my capacity in the office, when I was sub-editor, not in any editorial capacity; but he would be in the office while I was there—I do not know from whom the money was obtained for the payment of the expenses of the newspaper; I had nothing to do with that—I had some salary as sub-editor—my salary was paid to me by a Mrs. Davis, who was a manageress of the publishing department of the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi>—another department of the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi> besides the publishing was the sending out of circulars connected with any companies of the Consolidated Contracts Corpora<lb/>tion that were advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi>—money was paid by cash, never by cheque—cheques came under my observation during the time I was there, for payment for advertisements to the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi>—I have seen one or two cheques signed in my presence by the defendant Kaye during the time of my service—I could not say for certain whether those were in relation to advertisements—I have had a cheque from Mr. Kaye signed in the name of Kaye—I have not had cheques from Mr. Kaye signed in any other name—I saw cheques of Lathom and Co, signed by Mr. Kaye—he signed "Lathom and Co." sometimes—Lathom and Co. was Mr. Kaye, I should think, I do not now; at all events he signed the name of Lathom and Co.—I do not know anybody else as Lathom and Co. except Kaye—the cheques signed in the name of Lathom and Co. by Mr. Kaye were given to me by Mr. Kaye for com<lb/>mission for advertisements I might have obtained for the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi> not in relation to the publication of advertisements—practically during the whole time I was there I had no monetary transactions with Mr. Bernard—I had business connection with the business of the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi> with Mr. Bernard with regard to obtaining advertisements for the paper—there was a can<lb/>vasser employed for a short time to get advertisements, and he brought in none at all—I suggested to Mr. Bernard that I could obtain them in the stead of the canvasser, and I did so—Mr. Bernard acceded to that, and I did it—that brought me into business relations with him, because a certain sum was to be paid to me by Mr. Kaye for obtaining those advertisements—the arrangement with Mr. Bernard and the payment arising out of that arrangement was made with Mr. Kaye—there was more than one payment—a cheque was given in the name of Lathom and Company by Kaye—that arrangement was during the latter part of the service—during the time I was in service I saw Mr. Ainsworth about twice or three times a month—Mr. Bernard about the same number of times—Mr. Kaye nearly every day, I suppose—I went to Mr. Ainsworth's office for the purpose of seeing him, and the same with regard to Mr. Bernard—that was another office, but on the same floor—there was general office between—I mean a general room between them, and each had his own private room inside—the Consolidated Contracts Corpora<lb/>tion and the Consolidated Exploration and Finance Company was up</p>

I am an auctioneer, and sell by auction electrical properties at 72, Finsbury Pavement—I know these premises in question at Ferdinand Street, Camden Town—up to June 24th, 1896, the premises were occupied by me on behalf of the Acme and Immisch Electrical Company which had gone into voluntary liquidation—I think about April, 1896, the order was made—on Juno 19th I held an auction sale of the furniture and effects belonging to Acme and Immisch—about a month before the sale I remember seeing one of the young Mr. Brins<lb/>meads—that would be about May 16th—in consequence of my con<lb/>versation with young Mr. Brinsmead I saw the defendant Jordan at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250163"/>
               <p>No. 116, Chancery Lane—as far as I know he was there conducting a business as company promoter, I understood—he had an office there—I could not say from memory if his name was up outside—young Mr. Brinsinead wrote to me, and asked me to call—when I called, he said he was turning Brinsmeads into a limited company, and he wished to take the factory, if possible, as a portion of their works—he said he wanted the lease for Brinsmeads—he did not say any particular Brins<lb/>mead—in consequence of my conversation I placed the matter before the liquidator of Acme and Immisch—I think I communicated the fact that the liquidator declined to Jordan, and I think it was communicated by the solicitor as well, but I would not be certain upon that point—I may have done it by a letter as well as by a visit—afterwards I was again approached by Mr. Jordan to see if I would accept some other lessee—he wrote to me, and be came to see me as well—himself and Mr. Alabone were the second suggested lessees—that was submitted in its turn to the liquidator, and they were accepted after awhile—the lease of the premises was assigned to them about June 24th, 1896—I don't know the exact date—I cannot say anything about that lease—I did not pass it over—this is the first time I have seen it—at the auction sale on June 16th, 1896, Jordan gave instructions for certain things to be purchased at certain prices two or three days before the sale—the things bought on that occasion under the order were a 10-horse power boiler, a 20-horse power engine, a dynamo, a band saw, Worthington pump, a meter, some shifting pulleys, electrical fittings to be used at the building for the purpose of lighting, and some office furniture—the total price which was paid for those articles, I think, was £337 13s., or something like that—the arrangement first of all with regard to payment was that they were to be paid for directly after the sale almost, or within a few days of the sale practically—that arrangement was not carried out—after the money had been owing for a little while we started pressing for the money, and in consideration of a certain amount being paid we let it stand over—it was paid first in an instalment of £25 on July 3rd—a man was kept in possession until the balance of the money was paid, and he was still in possession of those premises on August 5th—it was on August 7th, in the afternoon, that he left—the name of that man was Clark—on July 28th I made an arrangement for the sale of the articles—I gave notice of that arrangement to the defendant Jordan—I remember Jordan and Brinsmead coming to my office—Thomas Edward Brinsmead came then, and somebody else, I think—£175 was paid on that July 30th in notes—that left a balance of £137 13s., which was paid on August 7th in one sum, and by that cheque, dated August 6th, but it was paid on the 7th—I gave him a receipt for the balance—Jordan asked me to date it back to the last day of the preceding month, I believe—I declined. (<hi rend="italic">The pictures were handed to the witness</hi>)—I see the top picture here on the left-hand side—there is shown there a board with the names of Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons upon it in very large letters at the top—it never was put up while I had anything to do with the place—it is not a representation at all of the Ferdinand Street Works—I understood it was to represent the old Maiden Works in Kentish Town somewhere—I did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250164"/>
               <p>the old Maiden Works—at all events it was not at Acme and Immisch's—I did not see the words "Pianoforte Works" up on the actual building—I do not think I have been on the place since August 7th—I did not see the words "Pianoforte Works" appearing there as I left them—the right-hand picture purports to be a picture of the back of the works, where there is what is technically known as a "traveller" and some staging—with regard to that "traveller" and staging that was sold to a firm of engineers at Charlton—it was gone before July 1st—a large building that looks like a chapel or a large public hill belonged to another firm of pianoforte people—Chappell, I think, is the owner—the ground landlord of them—I cannot say if they were ever carried on as Chappell's Pianoforte" Works—the building we see under the staging and the "traveller" was the engine house—the picture repre<lb/>sents the shed and the engine house—about the beginning of July there was some timber brought in—there was no business carried on there in the beginning of "July—after July 1st they were starting putting shelves up, and different things like that, I think, no pianoforte making—we had a man living on the premises; he held the keys—just at the finish they were doing some parts of pianos (<hi rend="italic">two blocks were handed to the witness</hi>)—no building like that ever appeared with regard to the works—that block was on the premises, and was lent without permission to Mr. Jordan—it was parted with by somebody without our permission to repre<lb/>sent the works as they were some time before—in that middle picture there was no chimney at all there when I had to do with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LAWSON WALTON</hi>. I suggest that the founda<lb/>tion of that block is a building that has no existence—it is a block in the possession of the Acme Immisch Electrical Company—three or four years before this block was made for advertisement purposes—whether for advertisement purposes or not that building has been concocted and then drawn—that was done originally by the Acme Immisch Electrical Com<lb/>pany, or someone connected with it, and their name was across it on the band—their name was there, and I found it when I took possession as liquidator—I have never seen prints of it—I have never taken the trouble to compare the building in the middle with the one on the left—excluding the chimneys I have in the building on the left three erections on the roof—and in the building in the middle three on the roof—in the building on the left I have three storeys of rooms—in the building on the right three storeys, exactly the same number of windows—I was not present at the Police-court when Clark, the man who was left in posses<lb/>sion, swore that these blocks had been in the possession of the Acme Immisch Works since 1888, and represented the back view of the building which is portrayed in the picture on the left—it is im<lb/>possible for the buildings to have been like that—in regard to the building it might be made to represent the front view of this building, but as far as the ground and the trees and so on it is impossible—there is nothing in the building that is consistent with Mr. Clark's statement—to look at it the windows may be the same, but there was nothing in the front of the Acme Immisch Works like that—from the number of windows it is the same, but you get the back view in one and the front in the other—at one end of the building here another building comes out—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189804250165"/>
               <p>it is not shown—it is attached to the same—in this building there are only the things on the top and the windows—the top is alike, and the sides are alike—it differs, because the building at the present time (and was then here) has got an end to it—I knew these premises about two years—the Acme and Immisch have had it about two years—they may have been in existence ten years—I only go by the people on the place who were supposed to have made that block—it is inconsistent, that block being a picture of the building ten years ago, and the building being altered since, because that company was not in possession then—I swear that that company had not got them in 1888—the Acme and Immisch had them about two years before the time of the sale—I do not suggest that those buildings are ten years old—I do not know what the condition of things was ten years ago, or what the con<lb/>dition of the block was ten years ago—the buildings never did exist—I saw the place before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CRAIG</hi>. I saw Mr. Jordan at the time of the assigning of the lease—Mr. Jordan said that Mr. Brinsmead wanted to take it—I did not know what Brinsmead he meant at that interview—I understood it was not John Brinsmead and Sons, and said I would require somebody other than the company to become my tenants, my assignees—I referred to the presence, at one of the interviews, of Mr. Brinsmead's son, or one of his sons—Mr. Brinsmead, the defendant, was no party to the negotiations which culminated in the assignment of that lease—he might have been at the solicitor's—negotiations for the assigning of that lease were conducted with Jordan, and someone other than the defendant Brinemead—as to the payment for the engine and the goods sold, beyond being present Brinsmead took no part in that—Jordan was the gentle<lb/>man who contracted and paid—on one occasion Brinsmead was present—I understood that they could not pay me the money till they had had a board meeting, and therefore they came to my office when they had held a board meeting to pay the money—Jordan told me—the cheques received were cheques drawn by Jordan—and the bank notes were handed to me by Jordan—I really could not say who they were handed to me by in the office—he was present anyhow—he was the gentleman who con<lb/>tracted with me, and had to pay—Mr. Brinsmead was never my tenant in any way at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Jordan</hi>. A month or five weeks before the sale at Ferdinand Street one of the young Brinsmeads, the son of the defen<lb/>dant Brinsmead, applied to me for a lease of the premises—you did not say you were promoting a company, and wished to take the lease of the Ferdi<lb/>nand Street premises in conjunction with Mr. Brinsmead, or that you were turning the business of Brinsmead into a limited company; you did not say whether it was "John" or "Thomas Edward Brinsmead. "I first spoke to you considerably earlier than your letter pf May 30th, 1896—I have a letter here, May 20th, and there are letters earlier than that—the first time you spoke about it the, word "Brinsmead" was simply spoken of, not as "Thomas Edward," or anything—I have no other letter, whether it was mentioned as Thomas Edward or what—the first date we met was either May 17th or 18th—I had one other cheque for £25 from you besides those referred to already—I have one for £125</p>

               <p>for services rendered in getting the lease—professional services—your total payments to me are over £500; somewhere about that—you have the exact amounts—there is £125 cash—that makes a total of £503 12s. 6d.—the block was supplied to you or to your man without my permission—it was in the possession of the works—if there is any misappre<lb/>hension about that block, I cannot say; it was due to my predecessor rather than myself.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Lindsay and Co., printers, 19 1/2, Cursitor Street—this prospectus of the first company, Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons, Limited, was printed by my firm—I think the date is on it—April 9th, 1896—it was in the early part of 1896—we were employed to print that by Mr. Jordan, the defendant—we printed that in the ordinary coarse—it is headed, "Private and con<lb/>fidential Not for circulation. Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons"—on July 17th, 1896, we had a further order from Jordan—that was for 182,500 views—this order was given personally—on July 22nd, 1896, we had another order from Jordan, for 11,000 of the same views—we printed all these views and delivered them at the Argua Printing Company in Tudor Street on July 22nd or 23rd—they were printed from electro—this is the block—these are two of the same—we have only really got one here—that is the original—that would be the one supplied to me—the other has got that name in, but it is a view of the same place—Jordan supplied that block to us—he gave me no instructions as to what I was to do with that place where the blank is in the block—that place was already filled in with type—with "Pianoforte Works"—the Consolidated Contract Corporation paid me for printing these views, by a cheque for £157 15s., paid on July 23rd.</p>

               <p>pianos—I have had this block in my charge for eight years—it was made in the year 188 8 to the best of my recollection, and it was then placed in my charge—I have worked for the Acme Works for ten years, and I was in charge there—I see the tram lines on this block—at one time, until about March, 1896, there was one pair of tram lines went into the back yard—none after March—there never was a yard in 1896 like the one shown there—there never were any arc lights after March, 1896—I said this block was taken in 1888—the state of things was never like that—that chimney belongs to a builder in Chalk Farm road of the name of Steed—that would be about six yards from the front entrance of the premises in the same position as shown there—it is in the middle of the building—it is rightly shown there—while I was there those words "Pianoforte Works" were not on these premises, and never have been—they were in the front part of the building leading into Ferdinand Street—they were put up just before I left—the end of July, I believe—"Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons" never was put up there, and is not there now in that place—it was put on the other side of the building altogether, and at the end—not where it is represented here—I remember Jordan coming with Mr. Brinsmead often—I know Mr. Brinsmead, the defendant, by sight—he was there every day—all day long—I remember them coming one day with a photographer about eight o'clock in the morning, my breakfast time, and my breakfast was ready and I wanted it, and I thought if I gave them this block I should get rid of them—I thought they would take the block instead of taking a photograph—they took photographs on that day as well—I believe it was the end of June—it was before any men came there or before they had actually taken the premises, I believe, to the best of my recollection—Mr. Brinsmead was photographed—I believe you will see him there—if you had one taken off the block I believe you could see him and Mr. Jordan too with their coats off—he appears in this picture with "Thomas Edward Brinsmead"—I think you will find him standing at the door—there are three people standing there near the door with their coats off—they are the two in the doorway—the third is a man named Landle, who worked for Huddlestone—at the time they were taken there was no board with "Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons" on the left-hand picture—there was not one on the other side at that time—the Acme Works was up then—the board on the other side was "Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons, Limited"—it was put up in July—the picture on the left-hand side has "Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons," and that is what I meant by saying there was never such a board and there is not now—at the time this photograph was taken the words "Pianoforte Works" were not on a board of that kind in the middle picture—the board was put up with "Ferdinand Street Pianoforte Works" on the front side of the building at the end of July when the name was put up.</p>

               <p>not know what business was going on there in the time this block was prepared—I was not there—the Acme Works were just moving into it from Tabernacle Street in the City—a business that had been established elsewhere was moving into these large premises—that block was prepared simply for advertising—it was a private firm, and they got it up for advertis<lb/>ing—I believe a photograph was taken by a man of the name of Arthur C. Cockburn, and this block was prepared by somebody—I do not know by whom—Chappell, the pianoforte people, built this place themselves, for piano<lb/>forte making I have been given to understand—they did not occupy it, but it was occupied by the electric people—the building represented in the centre picture was there—if you photographed that building you could not help photographing the chimney at the back—from where the photograph was taken you could not—the chimney was there and it must get itself photographed—there never were these arc lights at all—there never were two tram lines—the incorrectness of the view so far as that is concerned is found in the block made by the Acme people ten years ago—nothing was then put up, in fact, along the front of the building where now appears on this block the words "Pianoforte Works"—there never was—there was no board up at all—on the front of the building, the left part, there was "The Acme and Immisch Electric Works, Limited"—they both show the back—we have not a front view here at all of the windows—the picture at the right hand and the picture in the middle both show the same side of the building—the boards put up of the Acme Company are where you see it hanging over now—on the left-hand corner, where you see the board hanging over on to the roof looking over the Chalk Farm Road on to the railway; on the front, that was the board of the Acme and Immisch Electric Works, Limited—that was not the only board they had up—they had one in the front of the building, on the other side altogether—those boards were taken down before August, in the middle of July, and those others were put up in July—I saw there White, I think it was, repainting those boards—they were put up in the same position as they were before, but they put some extra boards with "Ferdinand Street Pianoforte Works" on them—one extra board was put up on the same level, on the front, not on the same side shown here—in July the place was not full of the material and stuff belonging to the Acme Company; it had all gone away—there were a few things which required removal—the four men set to work to remove only the benches—they shifted the dynamo out from where it was into the yard—they also shifted the engine—that was the first four men who came in who were doing that work—in the middle of July twelve more men and boys came—from the Bartholomew works, so far as I understood—that is to say, pianoforte makers, and then some timber and quartering came in—between the middle of July and the beginning of August men were at work concreting the engine-room floor; we moved our engine out of there in, I believe, the end of June or the beginning of July; I will not be quite right about it—the floor where the engine had been was concreted—that was done directly we moved the engine—it was in the nature of repairing the floor of the engine house—I was in and out the premises until August 15th—I was not there much in the day time, but I lived on the premises—these men came in on the Tues<lb/>day</p>

I am a pianoforte hand—bellyman and marking off on the sounding board is my particular part of the work—somewhere about Bank Holiday of August, 1896, I went to the Ferdi<lb/>nand Street premises—to work—Mr. Edward Brinsmead and Mr. Jordan engaged me; there were one or <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of them when I went after the job—my brother was working round there, and he came round and told me, and I went and saw Mr. Edward Brinsmead—he thought there was a job there, and I went there—it was not the defendant Brinsmead in the box here; his son, I think—I was engaged on day work at first—I remained there on day work about a fortnight or three weeks, and then I was put on piece work—I finished August out there; about a month—I left because I was kept waiting for work—I could not got work to do—I earned 10s. 6d. a week on piece work—the week I gave up I only earned 10s. 6d., and then I thought it not good enough and came away—I did not see any piano sent out from the place while I was there—there were no proper materials for making and completing a piano—about 40 hands were at work there when I first went—they remained about a week after I was there, then about half of them were discharged—some of them were labourers, and some carpenters—there were several piano hands there, but not doing piano work—I remember seeing Jordan there pretty often—he used to be there to pay us on a Saturday up to the time I left—I saw him there on several other occasions each week besides paying days—I saw him at the Mansion House after this case had been started—after I had been subpœed as a witness I saw him to speak to—about a week before we went to the Mansion House I saw him round at my premises—he came round with Mr. Brinsmead's son and Mr. Heybell—he offered to give us £5 if we would say we were brought into the case, and did not know what we were saying at the time we swore our affidavits—we had sworn one—by "us" I mean me and Mr. Heybell—the affidavit I swore for the Chancery proceedings—I did not say any<lb/>thing to him—he was going to wire to us the next day and send us all the particulars, but we never received the wire nor the £5.</p>

I am not aware that I said before the Magistrate that there were thirty of the hands at piano work, preparing and getting the things ready for piano work—I do not; believe I said it—when I first went there I fixed my bench up—I fixed a lot of benches for the purpose of making pianos—I have had experience as a piano-maker since I was about thirteen or fourteen years of age—I am a regular piano hand and my brother was, too—he was working for Mr. Hughes at Finsbury Park, and he heard of this job and told me—he went in the holiday week for a few days to oblige them—my brother was regularly working at Hughes, but he came to this place in the holiday week for a few days to oblige the Brinsmeads, or whoever it was—he is an experienced man—after the benches and presses were put up I went to my regular work, which was putting sounding boards up—I had bridges and bars to put up on the sounding boards—I did that—and had</p>

I am a commission agent, of 38, Windsor Terrace, City Road—in May, 1896, the defendant Jordan came to me—he brought me a prospectus of Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons, Limited (<hi rend="italic">Produced and read</hi>)—I know nothing of these alterations in the manuscript, I am not certain if they were in it when I saw it—I have been asked before, and I thought, perhaps, these alteration were made in my office in this particular copy—they may have been made by Jordan, or they may have been made on Jordan's dictation by one of my clerks for my information—they were not there when it came to me—I do not remember anything of that—I saw that prospectus last November twelvemonth at the official Receiver's Office—that particular copy of it remained in my possession—I had more than one copy—I conversed with Jordan with reference to the company as set forth in that prospectus—he told me that the Brinsmeads were relatives of John Brinsmead, or of that particular family, that they were practical piano manufacturers, or practi<lb/>cal piano workmen, and that they wanted capital in order to engage in a profitable business—he did not tell me anything as to whether any profits could be shown in the business they had carried on up to that time—I understood it had been carried on without profits owing to the lack of capital, he told me that—I considered the matter, and found it was too speculative for my friends—I asked some friends, and introduced Jordan to the Consolidated Contracts Corporation—I called on the Consolidated Contracts Corporation first and saw Mr. Harrison Ains worth and Mr. Bernard, the defendants—I first of all saw Mr. Kaye, and then the other two defendants—that was at the office of the Contract Corporation, at Queen Street, Cheapside—I introduced a copy of the prospectus that you have just shown me—I said Jordan was the man who had the business, and that if they would agree to look into it and pay me a commission for the introduction I would leave the papers and put them into com<lb/>munication with Jordan—I told Ainsworth, Bernard, and Kaye all that Jordan had told me about the business—I told them there were no profits up to the present time—they were to give me ten per cent, upon the profit they made after making a deduction for the expenses—I left them one or two copies of the prospectus—I cannot say if the alterations in manuscript which have been referred to had been made at the time I left a copy of the prospectus with the defendants—my impression is it did not contain alterations—a clean proof without alteration it must have been which I left with them.</p>

Ainsworth and Bernard have not handed back to me the draft prospectus I handed to them—to the best of my belief the exhibit is similar to that I handed to them, except that the copy handed to them did not contain the pen and ink alterations—I know nothing about you having anything to do with the settlement, or printing, or issuing of the prospectus that eventually was issued—this is the particular copy that I produced to the Official Receiver.</p>

C., July 14th, 189—" to "Joseph Henry Davis, Esq., care of Bunbury and Co., 28, Finsbury Circus, E.G. Dear Sir,—Please call here to<lb/>morrow at one o'clock without fail, to arrange that matter.—Yours faithfully, W. H. KATE"—the year is blank—I then received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—" 15, Queen Street, London, B.C. July 15th, 1896. Dear Davis,—I left you a note last night asking you to be at the office at 15, Queen Street, at one o'clock. I have to attend the City of London Court at 10.30, but if I am not at Queen Street at one o'clock ask for Mr. Bernard, who knows about this, you can sign the documents as well. If you are in give bearer a reply if you are not in wire one.—Yours faithfully, W. H. KAYE"—I called at No. 15, Queen Street, on July 15th—I saw Kaye there, and I signed a paper in the presence of others—I could not identify them—it had something to do with a pianoforte business or a pianoforte manufactory—I had an hour from my office in Finsbury Circus—that was the hour when I got out to have my dinner or luncheon, from 1 to 2—I saw the name of Brinsmead on the documents—I think I got a sovereign on that day, to the best of my recollection, I could not swear to it—I went to the office again after that, and each time I went there I signed some document—William Henry Kaye produced the other documents to me—I did not see any of the other defendants on either of the occasions there—I never read any of the documents I signed—this is my signature at the bottom of these three documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not know I was buying and selling a pianoforte business for £76,000, I had not anything to sell—I did not know I was taking premises in Ferdinand Street, and letting those to the company—each time I signed the documents I got a few shillings: 10s. onetime, 15s. another, 10s. another time—I got the £5 ultimately—Mr. Kaye waived the two-fifths, and said I could have it:—that was when he made the last payment to me—when I saw the name of Brinsmead on the first document I signed, I said to Mr. Kaye that it would be a good company seeing the name of Brinsmead—I did not know</p>

               <p>whether it was John or Thomas, or what—I said that because I knew it was a good firm, by repute, that was all—he said yes, it would be all right—it is not true that I was so satisfied as to the expansion of the business with the additional capital, that I was prepared to guarantee a dividend of 8 per cent.—I never saw the prospectus, nor did I know anything about allotment or shares whatever—I was not in very good health on August 19th and Mr. Kaye thought a holiday would do me good—he wanted me to go to Scar<lb/>borough—he knew I had been unwell for some time: I suffer from chronic bronchitis—I told him I could not afford to go, I had no means—he said he would find me £10 to go away where I liked for a week or two—I went on the same day that he gave me the £10—he suggested my hurry<lb/>ing off—he came and saw my little bits of furniture put into a van and taken away for storage—I stored it, because he said I might be a week or two, and he paid the rent that was due in advance because I had given no notice—he paid for the warehousing of my furniture—he went down with me—I did not leave my address behind when I went away, there was no necessity for it—I had no letters that I expected coming after me—a writ at the suit of Richardson had been served on me about a week before I went away—I took it up to the Contracts Corporation—I took it up to the company's office and gave it to Mr. Kaye—I went and asked him what I was being sued for—he said, "It will be all right," I was not to bother about it, they would see me all right, make it all right the company would—I went to Bournemouth—I went there because I had some friends there I knew very well—I told Mr. Kaye where I was going—I stayed from August 20th till December 10th or 16th—I was at Bournemouth for one month, and I wrote constantly to Kaye, no one else, to know what my movements were to be—he said I could go to Southampton if I wished to—the letters are here—I asked if I could go to certain places, and he acquiesced in my request—I stayed away in different places till December 15th—I was living all that time by receiving £3 per week every Thursday in Postal orders, signed by Mr. Kaye the letters were—these are the letters and telegrams (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—ultimately I wrote to him that I was tired of being away, and could not get any satisfactory answer from Kaye why I was kept away, and ultimately I came from Brighton up to their office in Queen Street a week or so before Christmas. (<hi rend="italic">Read: from Kaye to the Witness.</hi>) "Dear Sir,—Your letter of the 30th ultimo reached me on my arrival from Brighton too late for me to answer it yesterday. I do not exactly under-stand your letter, but as my people are away it is impossible for me to put your proposal before them. I shall continue to send you £3 a week, and will remit you that amount to-morrow. This, I think, will do for you, and I may mention that should the matter turn out satisfactory you will not find that you have been forgotten"—that is September 31st, 1896—this is 12th September: "lam in receipt of your different letters, and should have answered them before now, but have been unable to do any<lb/>thing in the matter. I was under the impression when this affair was put in your way that I was doing you a good turn, but if you think the pay is not sufficient I cannot in any way increase it.

There is nothing doing in London, and from what I can see you will have now a spell of fine weather. I do not suppose you will have to stay in the country much longer, but I cannot say to a few days. I shall remit you £3 as usual"—that is dated October 27th, 1896—October 31st: "Dear Sir,—I am in receipt of your favour of 29th inst. I can<lb/>not tell you definitely when you are to return, will let you know" as soon as possible"—the next is dated November 11th: "I enclose you postal order for £3 (three pounds), which please acknowledge. I cannot tell you definitely what date you will be able to return, but will let you know as soon as I can."—15th November: "I am in receipt of your favour, and regret to hear that your wife is so ill. I enclose you postal orders for £3, which please acknowledge. I may mention that the affair will terminate very shortly, so that I shall have the pleasure of renewing my acquaintance with you"—the next one is November 30th: "I cannot say what day you will be able to return, so do not trouble about giving notice; as soon as I know what date you will be able to return I will send you a wire"—December 16th: "I enclose you £3 as requested; I am sorry to hear that you are so uncomfortable in your apartments; I am unable to let you know what date you will return; you will do so as soon as possible"—there was a telegram—I think that is the last letter—in consequence of not getting anything more satisfactory, I came up of my own accord—Kaye sent me £1 to come back with—I was writing all this time myself—I was anxious to come back—this is not my signature on the back of this cheque; neither of them—I never, so far as I am aware, authorised any one to sign them—perhaps one of these docu<lb/>ments might have been an authority—I did not get any of this money, the £20,000 or £15,300—I never saw the cheques till they were produced to the Official Receiver.</p>

I bad known Mr. Kaye seven or eight years—I knew he was connected with the Consolidated Contracts Corporation—I was a clerk at the time, and, of course, could read and write—I understand ordinary business, not extraordinary—I know what a public company is theoretically, not practically—I understand what turning a business into a company is—I understood it; was a promotion of a company, but what turning it into a company was I did not know—I supposed that the Consolidated Contracts Corporation were engaged in pro<lb/>moting a company—I had no idea that the Consolidated Contracts Cor<lb/>poration were buying a business, and were selling it to a company, nor did I know that forming it into a company means taking the business of the private firm, and selling it to the company—nor did I know that they were forming it into a company, nor do I know how else they would turn a business into a company—I presume that is the sub<lb/>stance of it—I did not know enough of promoting a company to know that sometimes the promoters, instead of themselves appearing in the char<lb/>acter of the purchaser of the private business or the vendor of the private</p>

John Brinsmead and Sons—I saw quite clearly by that that whatever this business was it was not the business of John Brinsmead and Sons—I saw it more clearly after than I did at the time—I see it clearly now—I believed the prospectus to be right—I have not taken any pains since that time to ascertain what orders have been received; I have left it in the hands of Mr. Maskell—I have not ascertained the names of the people who were going about soliciting orders—I take the prospectus as correct—the machinery and such like might have been there, but I have never been to see—I take this as being correct, that is all I can say—(<hi rend="italic">the document was read through</hi>)—the very next day I thought there was something wrong about this prospectus, because I saw the statement in the paper that it was not John Brinsmead and Co.—it was in consequence of that that I made my application to Mr. Maskell: it was through that—I saw a statement that John Brinsmead and Co. were the old firm, and that was not John Brinsmead and Co.—when I got that statement I daresay I looked at this very prospectus, or referred to the prospectus to</p>

               <p>from business—I was formerly a member of the firm of Hailing, Pearce, and Stone, of Waterloo House—about July 29th, 1896, I received a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Investor</hi> newspaper by post—I read in it the prospectus of Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons, Limited, and also the article on page 8 of the newspaper—I read the prospectus very carelessly, I must admit, bat I read the article, and that led me to apply for shares—I went to the office of the company, 94, Cannon Street, immediately afterwards, to get the prospectus with the application form in it, and I filled up the form applying for 200 ordinary snares—that is my application form, and this is my letter enclosing cheque for £1,000—I paid up in full because I was in the country, and I thought I should get the whole allotted if I paid in full, in order to secure the allotment of the whole number of shares—I received the allotment letter and the banker's receipt on the same day—at the time I paid this money I believed the business was Brinsmeads of Wigmore Street, I had no idea of any other—I knew Brinsmead by name as the old-established business—a printed statement came with the prospectus—the one with pictures showing the whole of the works—I supposed the business at Ferdinand Street was Brinsmeads, and that it was being carried on at that time at Ferdinand Street as well as at Bartholomew Road—I believed the statement as to the eight hundred orders alleged to have been obtained during the preceding month—I thought it was a very extraordinary thing, and therefore dividends would be sure to come in with such splendid orders—I received by post the circular—in August—I do not remember the statement in that circular that over sixty men were then employed—of course, I must have read it—yes, I read it, certainly—I also received the certificate of September 1st—I read them both, and took them on to Mr. Maskell, the solicitor, within a day or two of paying the money—I then discovered that it was a swindle, and that other people were carrying it on—it was not Brins<lb/>meads at all—I immediately saw Mr. Brinsmead at Wigmore Street, immediately after I went to Mr. Maskell, and then went to the office of the company—I there saw a tallish young man—I asked for Mr. Wilson, tho secretary—whether I saw Mr. Wilson I do not know—I did not see him—I think his name was Wilkes—I saw him at the Mansion House—I addressed him as if he were the secretary of the company—he answered as if he were acting in that capacity—by my instructions Mr. Maskell applied for a return of the money I had paid—I never got it.</p>

John Brinsmead &amp; Sons "; those 30 years led me to believe that it was the same firm—I did not think that John Brinsmead &amp; Sons had ceased to exist—I thought it was an addition, that was my impression—I did not investigate it thoroughly—my letter is a sufficient indication of that.</p>

The firm manufactures largely for the trade, as well as for private buyers, and these orders emanate from some of the best houses in the kingdom;" "orders have been received from various houses for over 800 pianofortes"—reading the whole of that I came to the conclusion that it Was Brinsmeads—I thought it was impossible for a new firm like that to have 800 pianofortes on order.</p>

John Brinsmead and Sons," is not true, in so far as an important position is concerned—his position was that of a mechanic—he was doing small cabinet work in connection with the cases—he was working by the piece and was earning from £2 to £3 a week—his two sons, Mr. Edward George Stanley Brins<lb/>mead and Mr. Sydney Walter Brinsmead were also in our employ as mechanics, earning less than their father—one was what we term bellying, and the other was fitting-up—the statement in the prospectus, "Mr. Thomas Edward Brinsmead has for many years personally superintended the Adjustment of the delicate parts of pianofortes," is not true—his work was on wood-work, absolutely—he had nothing whatever to do with the Adjustment of the delicate parts of the pianofortes—"Mr. Edward George Stanley Brinsmean has been mainly responsible for the extremely beauty<lb/>ful</p>

Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons—I first represented them on January 14th, 1896—I had payments to get from them that had not been made to me, and I continued to get orders down to, I think, about November 15th and from a date in January—I obtained orders for their pianos in Birming<lb/>ham, Bath, Cork, Dublin, Belfast, Colchester, Wisbeach, Grantham, Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Glasgow, Bournemouth, Devonport, Plymouth, Falmouth, Tor<lb/>quay, Hartlepool, Aberdeen, and other places—I visited these different towns on more than one occasion—I have got here in my book a record of the different orders I obtained—I got altogether 235—from some of the persons to whom pianos were supplied I got what are called repeat orders—after they have had a piano and sold it an order for another one, that is a repeat order—I obtained orders of two or three different classes—I represented many other manufacturers, but these 235 were all Thomas Edward Brinsmead—the difference is by having different classes—a cheaper class of instrument would not clash with a higher class of another grade—I have a little knowledge of pianos—I considered that the pianos made by Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons were extremely well made and good pianos for the price that they were sold to the trade for—where I had obtained an order for a piano, and it had been delivered, and I visited the same tradespeople again, I found that the pianos met with approval—during the time I was travelling about in this country, and Ireland and Scotland as well, I found that the demand.</p>

This letter, Exhibit No. 1, is a letter from Mr. Kaye to the witness Davis asking him to call—it is dated from the Exploration Company, whose offices were at 15, Queen Street—Mr. Kaye was a director of the Exploration Company as well as of the other company—Mr. Lomax was not a director of both—Mr. Lomax was a director of the Consolidated and Exploration and Finance but not of the Consolidated Contracts Association—I believe they had the same offices, they shared them—they had the same outer office for the clerks, but a different board room or private office for the two companies—they had a joint staff of clerks—the inside two rooms were, one side for the Contracts Corporation and the other for the Consolidate Exploration and Finance—the doors were labelled separately—there were brass plates on the folding doors—the office outside was for the joint staff of clerks—the Consolidated Exploration and Finance was on one side, and the Consolidated Contracts on the other on the folding door—I believe Ainsworth was interested in the Exploration Company to a certain extent—he was also interested to a certain extent in the Consoli<lb/>dated Contracts Corporation—the principal men at the Consolidate Contracts Corporation were Mr. Ainsworth and Mr. Bernard—they are joined together—the principal men of the Exploration Company were the directors, who were, I think, Lomax, Brown, and Kaye, and Jervoise as well, but I do not know much about the directors of that company—a Dr. White was, I believe—I never attended their meetings—I believe the two companies had the same secretary—I kept the accounts of both—Bernard would have a connection with it as being a shareholder in the Consolidated Contracts Corporation which held shares as a company in the Consolidated Exploration—I have no idea how many—I do not think, until June of last year, the Contracts Corporation held nearly all the shares in the Exploration Company—they held £10,000 in deferred shares—I cannot answer from memory how many ordinary shares the Contracts Corporation held—they held very largely—till June of last year there were shareholders in the Exploration Company other than the Consolidated Contracts Corporation—I should think there were ninety other shareholders besides the Contracts Corpora<lb/>tion—I have not the least idea from memory how many they held.</p>

John Brinsmead and Sons about the injunction against the company Thomas Edward Brinsmead and Sons—I knew of their taking proceedings at the end of July, 1896, to restrain the company from advertising in such a way as to lead the public in any way to think that their pianos were John Brinsmead and Sons—it was heard early in August—I knew all about that—I was attending to the matter—that application was heard on the 8th, then on the 11th, and then on the 12th there was judgment—I cannot be sure about the earlier days—my belief is the proceedings had been commenced at the end of July, July 28th, but I cannot be sure about the date—these proceedings were pending or being heard on August 8th—on August 6th there was a directors meeting, and there is a minute: "The solicitor reported that he had arranged with the vendor's solicitor for the immediate completion of the purchase"—I did not know anything about that—Mr. Thomson was fully aware of the pipers—I was acting in communication with him and under his directions in attending to these proceedings—I did not know that on August 8th arrangements were being made for the immediate com<lb/>pletion, instead of waiting till September 1st—I first heard that on September 1st, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not know anything of this matter till it had entered into the stage of litigation—the litigation was towards the end of July with John Brinsmead and Sons in respect of the use of the name, and that was being contested by the company, and it was appealed, and I attended to that—apart from that litigation, I had nothing to do with Mr. Wilson—whatever the date of that letter may be it had reference to the litigation by John Brinsmead and Sons—when I came to see the papers I saw the names of Davis and Wilson and Son—I found in the transaction of sale and the purchase of the business that Davis had been used as a nominee of the Contracts Corporation and Wilson in the same way as nominee of the purchasing company.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Barnsbury—I am a pianoforte fitter—I have been engaged in that occupation for ten years—in January, 1895, I entered the employment of the defendant, Thomas Edward Brinsmead, and continued in his employment until the business was turned into a company, and down to November, 1896, to the winding-up—I was working in the first place at the Bartholomew Works, Bartholomew Road—Brinsmead worked with us, and his two sons also worked with us—there were other men also engaged in the work of making pianos at Bartholomew Road—I remember before the premises at Ferdinand Street were taken—I went to Ferdinand Street—when I first entered their employment, in January, 1895, we were making slightly over one a week, and it increased to four a week—the business was increasing—I remem<lb/>ber a number of men being employed to get the Ferdinand Street premises Into order for our work—that was towards the end of July, 1896—I saw between twenty and thirty men there getting the premises ready, I suppose, as nearly as I can recollect—as the premises were got into condition to be used the men commenced piano work there—when we removed from Bartholomew Road to Ferdinand Street at the end of July I should think there were between sixteen and eighteen instruments, finished and un<lb/>finished—there was sufficient room at Bartholomew Road to do the work we were engaged upon—there was not sufficient room at Bartholomew Road to make as many as sixteen pianos at one time; as regards the width, there were sixteen to eighteen instruments in stock at the time we removed—we could not have made sixteen in one week—when I got into the Ferdinand Street premises I continued working there—at the Ferdinand Street premises there was sufficient material for the amount that was being turned out at the time—when I commenced work at Ferdinand Street the work increased—the men employed there were skilled workmen—as the work increased there men were taken on one at a time, and when the company was wound up I should judge there were forty or fifty men, including one or two porters, and also one or two boys—they were taken on from time to time, so that at last there were as many as forty or fifty men working at the same time, including two or three boys—I was working at the time the pianos were being prepared for the Musical Exhibition at the Agricultural Hall—the men were working overtime at that time—I never worked overtime in my own branch—I know of one man working overtime on pianos for the exhibit<lb/>tion—I worked the ordinary hours myself—there was always work for me to do, barring the slack time during the summer; it is necessary in most pianoforte trades.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fully qualified medical map, of Broadway, Tooting—I first saw the deceased child on February 22nd—it then had symptoms of bronchial pneumonia, and had several sores, due to bad nutrition and neglect, one on the chest, and one on the shoulder—I gave it some medicine, and told her to come the following Monday morning and let me know how it was, and I would go and see it—the ointment ought to have lasted three or four days, I told her to apply it to all the sores—she came again on March 1st, and brought the child, the bronchial pneu<lb/>monia was better, but the sores were still bad, and in my opinion they had not been dressed at all—I asked her if she had used all the ointment—she said, "No"—I gave her some further remedies, and told her to bring I it again in a day or two—I saw it next on the day of its death, February 20th—she said that the child had a fit about three a.m., and she thought it was going to have another—I told her I would go in the course of the morning, but in half-an-hour some one came, and said that the child was lead—I called about 12.15 and saw it, and saw some bruises on its face—I declined to give a certificate, and communicated with the Coroner's office—I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the child's weight was only 17 lbs. 14 ozs.—I noticed a bruise on the face, another on the chin, one on the right foot, several others on the body, and both feet were swollen—it had suffered from rickets for more than three months—that might be due to artificial feeding—I think it had been suffering before November 19th—want of care would make the rickets worse—it would be obvious to the mother, as it would get bow legs—I noticed sores on the point of each shoulder, and on the <hi rend="italic">scapular</hi>, which I attribute to bad condition of the skin, and the sores to bad nutrition of the skin—there was an abrasion on the side of the head, and considerable bruising all round—it was a severe bruise, and considerable force would be necessary to cause it—there was slight bronchial pneumonia of the right lung, but it was not likely to accelerate death—there were no diseased organs, and nothing whatever to lead me to believe that it was unable to assimulate food—the cause of death was weakness from mal-nutrition, and not being taken out into the air, especially in a ricketty child; and being treated severely, and occasion<lb/>ally slapped and shut up in a wash-house and coal-cellar would reduce its condition, which was obvious to anybody—it could not possibly have forced its head between the railings of the bedstead because it was in too weak a condition to do so—mal-nutrition, want of air, and inattention on the part of the mother would accelerate death.</p>

I am under-delivery foreman at Cotton's wharf—on April 2nd, about 1.30, the prisoner came and asked if I was calling for Donaldsons—after taking the order out of the office, which was my duty, I said, "Yes; where is your van?"—he said, "Round the corner"—I said, "Bring it round here"—he brought a truck—I said, "This is rather a funny sort of van"—he said, "This is a truck, but I am Donaldson"—I gave up the three bags referred to in the order, and he went to the office and signed for them in the delivery book, and left the warrant—we had received the order for delivery to Donald<lb/>son on the Friday—I had lost the list of the deliveries between Donald<lb/>son's place and Fenchurch Street on the Tuesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am junior clerk at Cotton's Wharf—I was present when Nicholls gave three bags of coffee to the prisoner—I gave his order to pass the goods out of the warehouse—the word "van," which was on it, has been altered to "truck"—I saw the receipt signed for the goods in this book in the name of "F. Jones," and I gave the person this ticket—I do not know the prisoner.</p>
