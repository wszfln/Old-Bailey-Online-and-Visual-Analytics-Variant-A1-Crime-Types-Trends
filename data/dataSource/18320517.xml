               <p>WILLIAM BEAMS. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Tebbs and Sons, proctors, Doctors' Commons. I produce a paper, purporting to be the will of George Friend, which I received from the prisoner Morgan, in the office of Messrs. Tebbs and Sons, about the 23rd or 24th of March; their office is in the City - nobody was with him when he brought it; it was brought for the purpose of obtaining probate - I put several questions to him - he described himself as the executor named in the will, and a relative of the deceased; he brought it to me to be proved- I asked him about the amount of the property; he said he was not prepared to say what it was - he called on me several times on the subject of the will; a few days after his first calling I received intimation from Mr. Hughes, solicitor for the prosecution, and from two persons calling themselves next of kin, that the will was supposed to be a forgery, in consequence of which I told Morgan it would be necessary for me to see the witnesses, and he brought the prisoner Dalton; I had a conversation about it, principally with Dalton - when they came in Morgan said the man with him was Dalton; I produced the will, pointed to his name on it, and asked if that was his name and hand-writing - he said, "Yes, that is my name and handwriting;" this is the will (looking at it) - Dalton said the will was made at a public-house in Whitechapel, and that it was written by Teighe; that Morgan had asked him(Dalton) if he could make the will for his relative, Mr. Friend - that he said he was not in the habit of doing such things, but that his friend, Mr. Teighe, he thought would make it, which he consented to, and paper and pens being procured. Teighe proceeded to make it; he said this was done at the Seven Stars public-house - that after the will had been made it was read over to Friend, the deceased, at the Seven Stars, and the deceased then made his mark to it, in the presence of the witnesses, and then he (Dalton) and the other witnesses signed their names to it; I told him it had been stated that the will was forged, and it would be necessary to be particular in what he stated - I told Morgan at that interview, that it would be necessary I should see the otherwitnesses, and any witnesses who could prove that he was a relative of the deceased: I think I told him this after Dalton's statement - they then left, Morgan promising to bring the other witnesses; a day or two afterwards Morgan brought me a woman, calling herself Mary Mason - I have since heard her called Brannan; I could not swear to her if I saw her; she stated that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170004"/>her name was Mary Mason, in the presence of Morgan - he said he had brought that woman up, who could say something about his relationship to Friend, the deceased, and she said she had been in the company of the deceased and Morgan several times, and upon those occasions had heard Friend, the deceased, call Morgan his nephew, and Morgan call him his uncle, and I think she added that she had heard Friend say he wished to do something for his nephew, Morgan - I think she said she did not know any thing about the will: Morgan introduced Teighe to me three or four days after this; he said that was Mr. Teighe, the writer of the will, or the witness to the will, I cannot say which; I produced the will to Teighe - he took it in his hands: I said, "I believe you are the writer of this will, Mr. Teighe, are you not?" having looked at it attentively, and read a great part of it, he said it was his handwriting - I called his attention to the name purporting to be his signature, and asked him if the name 
               <persName id="t18320517-1-person116">
                  Robert

               <interp inst="t18320517-1-person116" type="surname" value="Teighe"/>

             was his hand-writing; he said it was - I asked him when and where it was made, and under what circumstances; he stated, in Morgan's hearing, that he and Dalton were walking along Whitechapel together, they went into a public-house opposite Red Lion-street, Whitechapel - they went into a room where there was an old man with 
               <persName id="t18320517-1-person117">
                  Andrew 
                  Morgan

             and a woman - that Dalton asked him (Teighe) if he would make a will for the old man; he said he would- that pen, ink, and paper were then brought to him, and he inquired of the old man his name, and how he wished to dispose of his property - that Friend, the deceased, then stated the names of the several persons to whom he would leave his property, and the amounts he wished to leave them (I am not quite positive whether he called him Friend or the deceased) - that having completed writing the will, he then read it all over to the deceased, that the deceased appeared to understand it, and then said he would make his mark to it - that the deceased did make his mark to it, in the presence of himself and the other witnesses - that the witnesses then signed their names to the will, and I think he added that he then gave the will to the deceased, and the deceased gave it to Morgan; I then told Morgan he must bring up the other witness, Mary Pringle - he said he had already been in search of her, but could not find her, and he had heard that she was gone into the country - Pringle was never produced to me; I told Morgan that as there were other persons who asserted themselves as next of kin, and he having 'said he was next of kin, and the nephew, it was necessary he should bring forward persons to prove his relationship - he said he was the nephew, that the deceased was born at Ayr, in Scotland, and that he was the brother of his (Morgan's) mother - that he had been sent for by his uncle, the deceased, from Liverpool; I think he said it was in December last, being at Liverpool, he met a man named Burns, whom he knew, and Burns told him he had lately come from London, that previous to his leaving London he had seen his uncle, the deceased, Friend, and that he had requested him to tell Morgan he wished to see him, and in consequence of that he came to London in a short time after: a day or two after this conversation be brought me a letter - (looking at a letter produced by Lea) this is it: he was alone then - he said that was a letter he had written when at Shields, to a Mrs. Teighson, in answer to a message which she had sent by a woman to him, when at Shields; it has the North Shields post-mark on it - (read.)</p>

               <p>MRS. TRIGHSON, North Shields, 6th of March, 1832.</p>
               <p>I return you my most sincere thanks for your informing the bearer to let me know that my uncle, George Friend, of No. 31, Glasshouse-yard, Minories, desires me to return to London as soon as possible, and when you receive this letter I hope you can make it convenient to call and inform him I do not think I shall be able to be in town before the latter end. of March or the beginning of April; so no more at present, from your's &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A.MORGAN.</p>
               <p>This letter was directed to Mrs. Teighson, at No. 12, White Horse-place, Vinegar-lane, Commercial-road, London, but the letters son had been evidently added to the name Teighe, in a different coloured ink.</p>
               <p>MR. BEAMS. I said to Morgan "Why did not Mrs. Teighson bring that letter up with her;" he replied that she was engaged that day, and could not come, but he would bring her on the following day, and on the following day Morgan came, and a woman with him - I asked the woman if her name was Teighson, in his presence; she said it was -I then requested Morgan to leave the office, as I wished to speak to her privately on the subject of the letter, and he left; I had a conversation with her about the letter - nothing more passed between us in Morgan's presence; I called him in, and they went away together - I said nothing to him about what had passed between me and the woman; Morgan afterwards produced a man named Corbold to me, as a person who had known him and Friend to be related; Corbold merely stated that he had heard Friend call Morgan his nephew, and Morgan call Friend his uncle; the will has never been proved.</p>

             PRINGLE. I am single - I have been married. About March last I lived at No. 6, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel - Mr. and Mrs. Fallon lived in the same house with me, and Morgan lived in the same room; Mrs. Fallon was called Paternoster also - she is the prisoner at the bar; I never saw the deceased, Friend, in my life - in March last, three or four days after the Fast-day, I saw the prisoner Morgan write a paper in Fallon's room; Fallon, Paternoster, and I were there at the time, and Fallon's little boy, who is seven or eight years old; a sheet of paper was sent for - they did not at that time say what was going to be done with it; Morgan read it to me after it was done, and said it was a will.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose will? A.Mr. Friend's - I recollect his reading that Thomas Fallon was to have 50l., Paternoster 40l., Mrs. Pringle 10l., and the poor of the parish 10l.; Morgan said Mr. Friend was his uncle, and he was to have the rest of the property after the legacies were paid.</p>
               <p>Q. On another day after that, or the next day, was another paper, different to that, produced by Morgan? A. Yes - it was on the next day; this is the paper (looking at the will) - Morgan read it over to me; Fallon and Paternoster were in the room - the legacies were less than they were before; I do not recollect that Morgan said any thing about the legacies, nor who had written that paper; Morgan said several times that he would give all the legatees coffee - I had not heard the word legatee before; the

               <p>Q. Was not you rather surprised at finding a legacy left you by a gentleman you never knew? A. Yes - I said I wished I had the money then; I did not go to the proctor's, because they thought I was not staunch enough.</p>
               <p>Q. If your memory had been good enough you would have gone? A. I do not know whether I should - (here the witness wrote her name) - there was never any charge against me except about the cloak; Mr. Coard, of Lucas-street, made no charge against me - he said he wished I would try and get the tickets of some things which had been pawned by Mrs. Fallon, and a woman who worked for her and a girl; I was with a girl when she pawned some things in the Minories - I did not pawn them; I have pawned many things on my own account - I wanted to give my own name; the girl said, "Don't give that name, because it is your own;" I cannot swear what name I gave - I never had any thing for making affidavits, nor was any thing promised me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. If they had given you the 10l., would you have taken it? A. I do not know, for I always said they would not get it - if I had thought I had a right to it, I should have taken it; I did not sign the paper - I cannot write the name of Elliot; I cannot write all the letters of the alphabet - I can write Carnell and Pringle, that is all; when I signed the name Carnell, I was representing that a man was present who was not - I was not aware that I was doing wrong then, though I have found that out now; when I used the name of Elliot, I stated that I was aunt to a man named Johnson, which was false - the second paper, which is this will, was brought up ready written; I do not know where it was written.</p>
               <p>Q. Read these names, and tell me which is first? A. Robert Teighe. John Dalton, and Mary Pringle, as witnesses; that is just the way in which they were read to me- I cannot read them here, but I recollect them, as they were read to me; I do not know what word stands before Robert Teighe; they said witness was put under my name here - it was read to me at the time; I have seen this paper a good many times since it was written - I know this word is witnesses, because I was told so: Morgan brought it in this state, and read it to me - he said, "Do you think you can write like that?" I said No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You made the affidavit in the name of Elliot, to oblige Morgan and Fallon? A. Yes -I received no money for it, nor was I promised any; they wanted money very bad at that time, to pay their rent, and I did it to oblige them; I used to work in the house with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170006"/>them, and what money we earned we shared alike, but I never had money only by board and lodging - (looking at a paper) I wrote this at Mr. Hughes'; I have written in short Mary for Mary Ann - it is written the best way I can.</p>

            , who lived in Glasshouse-yard, Minories. On the morning of the 17th of March he was found dead in his room in Glasshouse-yard - I always wrote his name for him Frind; he was no scholar - his wife was my husband's aunt- she had been dead about fourteen years; I have been in the habit of going to see him once a week or once a fortnight for the last forty years, either my husband or me - I always kept his accounts for him; I always understood he had a trifle of property - he told me the night before he died that he was nearly seventy-seven years old, but he was only seventy-six.</p>

               <p>Q. What state of strength was he in for the last two or three months? A. He walked with two sticks, his knees lapped one over the other, and he was very heavily rupturned - he was an hour and a half going to the bottom of the Minories; he told me so - his legs went across one another: he could scarcely drag one foot after the other; I have seen him walk - he walked with very great pain and difficulty, and very slow - that was his state in January, and for months before; I am very confident he had no acquaintance with any of the prisoners, or he would have told me - he had no acquaintance at all, he kept none; he was so very near, he would not let any body know he had money; he had been a shoemaker, but latterly had been employed opening and shutting shops, and carrying heavy loads - he was never a seafaring man; he was born at Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of any relative of his besides yourself and husband? A. yes, two second cousins, Mrs. Collins and Mrs. Lewis - they are married; he had no nephew at the time of his death, nor any other relative; he told me he had no relation but a brother, who was dead, and these two women - I was with him on Saturday, and went on Tuesday; he was then poorly - I was there daily four days before he died, and was with him the evening before he died; in the afternoon as he died at night he was up, and perfectly sensible (he never kept his bed) I said, "Mr. Frind, you are very ill, as life is uncertain, and you have got some money, have you settled who you will leave it to?" or words to that effect, "And where would you like to be buried if you should die;" he made no will - he never mentioned such a thing as a will to me; he never mentioned either of the prisoners to me; his two female cousins had been to see him two days before he died; I had never seen them myself till then - they attended his funeral.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Perhaps you expected a legacy yourself? A. I did not - I thought he might think I wanted his money, and never mentioned it till then, as I thought he might live many years after me; he was very infirm in his limbs; I know he used to shut up Mr. Mills' shop, but cannot say how long that was before he died; I was ill in bed for about five weeks, and did not see him all January - I do not exactly know whether I saw him before the 15th of February; my husband attended him when I was ill - Mills' shop is forty or fifty houses from where he lived; he lived on the ground floor, and let out the two upper rooms - he had kept the house for twenty-five years; Mills is a stay-maker - it is not a very large shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Have you made any claim to the property? A. We had no claim; we stated it to the broker, and he told us we had no claim - I told Mr. Lake, the landlord of Frind's house, there were two nearer relations than me, and he said I was not entitled to any thing - we never claimed his property; we only went to the broker to be satisfied what property he had.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew this man for forty years? A. Nearly so; he could not write nor read - I saw him last before I was ill two or three days before New-year's day; he was very lame then, but had a good appetite - he could eat the round of a quartern loaf, but was very infirm in his legs and body, and had been so for three months before I was taken ill - he went regularly twice every Sunday to Dr. Povah's church, in Duke's-place; I have been there with him - he was a long time walking: I used to meet him there, and go home with him, and have been three quarters of an hour or more going; I never heard of his doing business on Sundays - he was very strict; I never knew him go to a public-house on Sunday - I think I once heard him say he went and had half a pint of porter, because he was very ill, and could scarcely reach home - that was twelve months ago; it was because he was poorly.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he still go to church when you saw him after your illness? A. I do not know; it is nearly twelve months since I went with him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARDING. I am a Greenwich pensioner. Frind married my sister; I have been in the habit of going to his place in Glasshouse-yard for the last fourteen years, since I have been home - I went to see him about Christmas last; I saw him while my wife was ill - he had been an ailing man for years; he was very infirm indeed, and badly ruptured - he had no wounds on his legs, but was lame; he walked very had with two sticks - one knee went over the other, and he could scarcely make a walk of it; he was in that state last Christmas, and for some time before; I went to see him every time I came to town, which was once a month - I saw him last on the Friday before he died; he had no nephew - he had two cousins; their names were Silk before marriage, now one is Collins, and the other I do not remember - my mother's maiden name was Cumber; I know of no other relations which he had - I never saw the prisoners till they were at Lambeth-street; Frind was a very eccentric man, and never kept any company at all- I never had any conversation with him about his property; if I mentioned any thing of the kind to him be always waved the subject - he never told me he had made a will.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Perhaps you thought he would leave you something? A. I did not expect but what he would, for nobody ever went to him, except me or my wife; he was ill for a number of years, but he used to crawl out to shut up Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170007"/>Mills' shop, at the bottom of the Minories, sixty or seventy houses from where he lived - I have gone with him, and put the shutters up for him; they are very light - he never frequented a public-house, but always had his beer at home; I suppose he shut up Mills' shop till within the last six or seven months - he might have done it a few days before he died, for all I know; I may have seen him twice while my wife was ill - I called on Lake, the landlord, after Frind's death, with my wife; I did not claim any thing; I only went to know about burying him - I did not claim his property; I told Lake what Frind told me I should have, which was his watch - I asked for nothing else; I asked a pensioner if I could make any claim on the property - I went to Mr. Johnson, the broker, to know what he died worth, as I thought he might know - he might have acquaintances which I knew nothing about.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What was Johnson? A. A stockbroker; it was a year and a half ago that I helped Frind to shut up the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him in January, and he was very infirm, do you think he could walk to Whitechapel-church? A. I do not think he could; he kept lodgers - my wife can tell their names, as she kept his books; I think there were lodgers in one floor in January, but am not aware whether there were any on the other.</p>
               <p>MRS. HARDING. He let two rooms to separate lodgers; I believe he had only one in January - it was a man and woman named Steward; they did not pay, and he turned them away, but he had other lodgers at the time of his death.</p>

I said Yes; Bishop's is a wine-vaults just round the corner from where Frind died - they asked me what property it was; I said I did not know, for it was advertised, and I may have said in the newspaper, and after that Morgan asked Smith, the landlord, to let him have a newspaper - I did not know the name of the person whose property my husband was taking care of; I did not see a newspaper brought - they wished me to have something to drink, but I declined; this was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and about twelve I took my husband's dinner to Glasshouse-yard, and found Morgan and Fallon standing by the door outside, and my husband standing outside with his back against the door, with a pot of porter - Morgan said,"Here she comes;" they offered me the pot to drink - I said No, and said I was very much astonished to find them there with my husband; they said if I did not like to have that, I might have ale, or any thing else; I said No, I would have nothing - Morgan said to my husband, "Open the door and let us go in," and said he belonged to the property, for he had got a will and power; he put his hand to his coat, as if to take out some papers - my husband said, if he had he had better go to Mr. Lake, his master: Fallon afterwards said to Morgan, "Come away, it won't do" - he took him by the arm, and took him away from the door; my husband said he had not got the key of the door, as they said they wanted to go in - I had been in the house with my husband's meals, but did not stay many minutes, and did not notice what was in it; I was not asked what sort of property was in the house, nor what property Frind bad left.</p>

Morgan called on me on or about the 27th of March, and asked if I knew the deceased, Frind, (I did not know Morgan before) - I said I had known him about twenty-five years; he asked if he had got any property - I told him he had, and that all I knew of was the first 20l. which he bought into the 5 per cents, as I was present at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170008"/>the time, but I could not exactly recollect the year; I referred him to Mr. Johnson, the broker, and told him it was most likely he could get information of the sum there; he did not say why he made the inquiry - there was another person with him, I believe one of the male prisoners, but cannot swear who - I had seen Frind before Christmas, and many times since, I should think within a week of his decease.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, was he in a state of health to walk from Glasshouse-yard to Whitechapel church? A. I should think not, according to outward appearance; I do not know what his feelings were - the Seven Stars is five or six hundred yards from Whitechapel church: it is opposite Red Lion-street - it is better than a quarter of a mile from Frind's house; I do not think it likely that he could walk there; my house is three quarters of a mile from there, and perhaps half a quarter of a mile from his house - he never called at my house in his life; when I saw him it was at his own house - I was intimately acquainted with him; I have lived where I now do two years next October, before that I lived at Mile-end; he did not visit me there - it is nearly seven years since he was at my house; I have often seen him out since Christmas - I met him in the Minories I should think about a week before his death; he used to walk with a kimbo walk, with his knees almost down to the ground, quite stooping, with two sticks - the last time I met him he was about one hundred and fifty yards from his own house; I have not seen him further from his home since Christmas; he could scarcely walk - he would walk a few yards, and then stand up to rest; he wanted me to make a will for him about sixteen years back, but I refused.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was rather an eccentric man? A. He was; he had always a small defect in his knees, but not equal to what it was a few months before he died - I think I saw him last about the latter end of February, but cannot be positive when it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You had been intimate with him twenty-five years? A. Yes; he was chiefly a porter - I was then a gun-maker, and lived seven or eight doors from him for nineteen years; we were very intimate - I never heard of his having any relations; I never heard of a nephew named Morgan - he never spoke to me of his having any brothers or sisters.</p>
               <p>JAMES NOTMAN. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 4, Anthony-street, St. George's, I have seen all the prisoners; I know Fallon particularly - he called on the 21st of April, at my house: I was at home at work - he said he called to know if I was one of the relations of Frind; I told him I was, by my wife's side - he said he could prove the will which Morgan had presented at Tebbs' was a forgery; I asked him how - he said he saw it before the ink was dry, that it was written on the 24th of March, and Morgan had no more right to the money than that boy, pointing to one of my boys, who was at work; he said that Morgan had been tried for forgery before, with a person named Driscol - he said he (Fallon) did not know the deceased, and had never seen him, nor had any of the parties- he said they were going that day (21st of April) to prove the will at Doctors'-commons; I told him they would have to prove it somewhere else first, and said I meant at a public office - he said he was surprised we had not done it before, and when we did I was to leave him till the last; he said he did not wish to come forward voluntarily, and if the parties knew that he had come to tell me any thing about it, they would not mind sticking a knife into him or me either, for if they would run their necks into the halter for one thing they would for another - he then said, "Supposing I could bring forward a witness who never signed the will:" I asked him if that was not Mrs. Pringle - (I had not seen the will, but knew there was that name as an attesting witness:) I told him I understood Mrs. Pringle was a witness to the will - he then said if I would call on him next morning, perhaps I should see Mrs. Pringle; I called next morning at his house, then went to a public-house, and in the course of the day he introduced Pringle and Paternoster; he went out for the purpose of bringing them - I do not think he introduced them by name; he brought them in - I do not think he said any thing: Paternoster staid about two hours - we were drinking porter and talking about the will all the time - he went out to bring Pringle in, and brought her and Paternoster: I was sitting by the fire-place in the back parlour - several other persons were there; my uncle was there, and after a few moments Pringle called my uncle out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said while you were there? A. After Fallon brought them in he asked me to get a bit of paper, and told me to write on it something which he would tell me, which I did; this is it (looking at a paper) - he said what is written here, in the presence of Paternoster, quite lond; I wrote it from his mouth - (reads) - "

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Pringle wrote this in your presence, to show how unlike it was to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170009"/>writing in the will? A. Yes; that was her observation - this is as well as she could write, as she had a very bad pen, and she could hardly write at all; it is not easy to make out what it is - (looking at the name written by Pringle in Court) - I should almost swear this is her hand-writing, but what she wrote at the public-house was with a very bad pen: I expect to get some of the property if the will is set aside, as my wife was a third cousin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You had not mentioned your name and address when Teighe asked where you lived? A. No, but I told him I was a relation of the deceased; he was a stranger to me - I told him it was rather strange he should say the deceased was born in Scotland, and I had a certificate of his being born at Deptford: he made no answer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say your wife is a third cousin? A. yes; she is very distantly related - Mrs. Collins and Lewis are my wife's aunts; I have known them ever since I married my wife - Lewis' husband's name is George; I only saw Frind twice - I never heard Friend had a nephew; quite the contrary - I never heard he had a nephew at all; I have heard my wife's grandfather say that Frind had a brother who died when he was a young man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Was the paper you and Pringle wrote on, in this state at that time? A. Yes, and it merely laid on the table - it is very soft paper; my own writing on it is not so good as usual - allowing for the difference in the paper and the accommodation I believe this other to be Pringle's writing; I do not believe the signature to the will to be her writing.</p>
               <p>Morgan. Q. Did I not give information both to you and Lewis respecting my proctor? A. I never saw you till you were at Mr. Tebbs', and that was the only time I saw you till you were apprehended; I know nothing of Mr. Tebbs giving you a letter to Mr. Lake.</p>
               <p>Fallon. Q.After having three or four pots of beer at the public-house, and a glass or two of rum, did you not say it was a shame to sit there and not send for the women who worked in my house? A. I never said so - I cannot say how much we drank; he went out to dinner, and on returning brought the females - Fallon sat there three or four hours after that, but Paternoster did not; I was certainly the worse for what I had drank, because I had had no-dinner - I did not take Pringle out, and give her rum; Mr. Lewis went out with her while I talked to you.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Where have you seen Pringle write? A. I have seen her write at my house six, eight, or twelve times since this transaction.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BRANNAN. I am a widow, and live in Fashion-street, Spitalfields - I am acquainted with Paternoster, Dalton, and Morgan. On the Sunday week after the Fast-day, the 1st of April, Mrs. Paternoster came to where I live, and said Mr. Morgan wanted to speak to me about some business; I was to go down to her lodging, No.6, Lambeth-street - I went there with her, and found Mrs. Pringle, Mr. Fallon, and Morgan there; Morgan said he had some property left to him, and he would give me 5l. if I would go with him to a gentleman, by St. Paul's, to say that I met him and an elderly gentleman in Whitechapel; that he went into a public-house, and had a pot of beer with that old gentleman, and that, in the course of conversation, I heard the old gentleman call him nephew - that the old gentleman said he was getting old, and he would leave him something to make him comfortable; that after that they parted, and the old gentleman's name was

            . I keep the Seven Stars public-house, High-street, Whitechapel, and have kept it between four and five years. I have seen all the prisoners, except Teighe, at my house frequently; I cannot be positive that I have seen Teighe there, but the other four I have frequently seen there together, and have seen Morgan there frequently by himself alone - Morgan came to my house some time since Christmas; I cannot say the exact time, and I said, "Well old chap, where have you been? I have not seen you for a long time past - you used to be a customer of mine; I think I have not seen you these twelve months, have I?" - he mentioned the number of months; whether it was more or less than twelve I cannot say, but I think it was more - I should think this conversation was at least five or six weeks after Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was later than the 15th of January? A.Indeed I cannot say the time; he said he was come about some property that he was likely to get; that he was sent for from somewhere a good way off - whether it was Ireland or Scotland, I cannot say; I saw him again a few days after, and said to him, "Well, old chap, are you likely to get the property you were talking about?" he said Yes, that it was willed to him, and all the world could not hinder him of it; I asked him if it was any con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170010"/>siderable property, and I think he told me it was about 500l. or 600l.; I am sure it was as much as 500l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his being at any time supplied with a sheet of paper at your house? A. A party was supplied with a sheet of paper; I have not the least doubt of his being one of them - I think it was before the conversation about the property being willed to him, but I am not sure; I think he was one of the party who had the paper, I also think the female prisoner was one and Fallon - I am not quite sure of the other: there were four or five there - I know the other two have been at my house, but whether they were there on that occasion I cannot say; I think it was most likely foolscap paper.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say you think, do you mean that you doubt about it? A. We use two sorts of paper, but I think it was large; I believe the paper was about the size that this will is upon - I have seen the old gentleman, Frind; I think I saw him at my house about twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he at your house at the time these people were writing? A. That I cannot answer; I do not recollect seeing him, and should not think he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see an infirm old man who could not stand upright, but walked with two sticks, and his knees knocking together? A. I think not - I do not recollect it; he might, or might not be there - I cannot recollect that I saw him; I do not think that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect that you did not? A. If I could recollect one, I might the other - I only saw the old gentleman who was at my house twelve months ago once; I was not aware that was Frind then, but have been told so since by my customers, not by the prisoners; he was an oldish man, and walked stooping, with a stick or sticks- I do not recollect about his legs; I know he stooped: my house is licensed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long has your house been licensed? A. I have kept a licensed house for thirteen or fourteen years, and have been in that house four years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you believe that you have seen that old man at your house this year? A. On my word I cannot say - I am not sure that I did, or did not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You saw him twelve months ago, have you seen him since? A. I have no recollection of seeing him since.</p>
               <p>JOHN COWDEROY. I live at No. 12, Whitehorse-place, Commercial-road; I was formerly a publican, but am now out of business. I know Dalton - he called on me about March last, but I do not remember whether it was before or after the Fast-day; he asked if I would take a letter in for him, which I consented to do - he said his wife had robbed him, and he had found out that she had sent the money down to North Shields by her son; that he had written a letter, as if his wife wrote it, and I was to take a letter in if it came for him - I knew his name at that time; the letter did not come in his name, but in some other - he said it would come in some other name, but in but did not mention what; a letter came in about a week, ten days, or a fortnight - this is very much like the letter(looking at one) - it was very much like this, and had a yellow seal and figures like this on it; here is 1l. written on it; I gave him the letter myself when he called - he opened it in my place, and I saw it was blank; it had no writing at all in it; my wife took the letter in - we often have letters come for other people; I took this letter off the mantel-piece, and said, "Is this your letter, Dalton?" he said Yes - it was directed to Mr. Teighson, No.12, White Horse-place, Commercial-road; nobody of that name lodged at my house - I did not notice the post-mark; I am not in the habit of taking in letters for other people - I believe this letter to be the one I gave him, from the direction, the seal, and the mark on it altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was blank when it was opened? A. The letter had no writing in it; he had said a letter would come, not in his own name, and as I had nobody in the house of that name, and it having my address on it; my wife took it in - eight or nine persons live in my house - it is a lodging-house for sailors; I may sometimes have twenty sailors - I know their names when they come; I have known Dalton three or four years, and never knew any harm of him; I was never in trouble myself, and was never in a criminal Court, except to give evidence here some years ago; I was never charged with felony in any Court - I was once charged with an assault; I knew a man named Oliver; he was transported from here - my name was never brought in question; I have been in Whitecross-street prison, and in the Fleet - I was in Clerkenwell prison for eleven months, under a fine for having a private still - I was sent there from Lambeth-street office; I was never bail for a man in my life - I swear positively I was never tried on any charge of felony, or for any thing except about the still; I was fined 30l. for that, and had not the money to pay - I was never tried for an assault; I was once fined.</p>
               <p>MARGARET COWDEROY. I am the wife of the last witness, I remember taking in a letter of the General Postman, who comes regularly - I paid 1s. for it; I received no other letter for which I paid 1s. - this is something like the letter; I remember it had a yellow seal - I kept it two or three days, till Dalton called; it laid about in the room -I was present when my husband gave it to Dalton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember Dalton calling on you on Good Friday, Easter Sunday, or Easter Monday? A. No - I borrowed 5s. of him once, and he named something about expecting a letter and an enclosure of 5l. from his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago is it that Dalton lent you 5s.? A. Not six months ago; I think it was before I received this letter; I saw Dalton open the letter - it had no writing in it; I was going past him in the room as he opened it, I saw him turn the leaf over, and am positive it had no writing in it - he did not seem at all surprised at it.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW PLACE. In March last I was the General Postman for White Horse-place, Commercial-road. I delivered this letter according to the direction, on the 8th of March; it has the North Shields post-mark on it - I have been sixteen years in the Post-office; it has the genuine post-mark stamp of North Shields - the delivery mark is the 8th of March: the postage was 1s.; I do not recollect delivering any other letter there about that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect leaving one directed to Mrs. Dalton at that house about that time? A. I do not; I have been so long on that walk that I have a good recollection of what happens - I deliver very few<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170011"/>there; I knew Cowderoys before they lived there - I cannot recollect every letter, but I remember delivering this; I may have delivered letters there which I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. If there had been an enclosure in this letter, what would have been the postage? A. Two shillings - here is 1l. written on the back; that is done by the post-master at Shields - letters are calculated by 1l. postages, and then put aside.</p>
               <p>JOHN COWDEROY. When I gave him the letter my wife told him the postage was 1s. - I do not recollect whether he paid it.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On Tuesday, the 24th of April, I apprehended Teighe at No. l 17, Eastfield-street, Limehouse; I asked if his name was Jones - he said it was Teighe - I told him I took him on a charge of forging a will: he said "Very good:" I asked him on the road to the office if he knew Dalton - he said he did; I asked if he knew Morgan: he said Yes, but he did not know much of him - I asked if he knew Fallon; he said he did not: I apprehended Fallon and Paternoster the same morning, at No. 6, Lambeth-street - Paternoster said her name was Peacock; they were both in the room: I told them I apprehended them on a charge of forging a will; Fallon said the man who made it ought to suffer for it - he said it was very odd a person he knew nothing of should leave him a legacy in a will; Paternoster made the same remark, and said she wished she had it, as it was left to her; I asked Fallon if he knew Morgan - he said he did: I asked if he knew Dalton - he said he did; I afterwards went in search of Dalton, and found him in Church-lane, Whitechapel, in the street - he lived at No. 11, Princes-street, Princes-square, Ratcliff-highway, at the house of Mr. Frazer - I could not find him there; I told him I had been looking for him, and took him respecting a forged will - there were two persons with him; one of them said, "What is this about? what is the matter?" Dalton said, "Oh, it is nothing, it is all right;" he said he had been signing a document for a person whom he knew - he did not name him then; I took him to the office, searched him, and found in his pocket this paper - he then said the person's name he had signed the document for was

            . I am married, and live at No. 18, Green Dragon-yard, Whitechapel. I saw Morgan at my house, in London, on the 6th, 7th, or 8th of March; he came without either hat or handkerchief on - he came to borrow a hat and handkerchief; I had no hat, but lent him a handkerchief off my neck; I have not had it again- I know it was very early in March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is that your only reason for fixing the date? A. Yes; it was very early in the month - I think it was on a Tuesday he came; I know it was a market morning, as my husband had brought me home some things from market; market mornings are Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays - I know it was on a Tuesday; I should not like to swear that, but I know it was early in the week, on a market morning.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you lately had a child? A. Yes; it was born on the 7th of March - I was confined in a room down stairs; it was two or three days after my baby was born that I saw Morgan; I live on the ground floor, and a person coming there would come into my room.(The will was here put in and read, see indictment.)</p>

               <p>Dalton's Defence I have kept a sailor's lodging-house for many years; I and Teighe were walking together on the 17th of January; we went into the Seven Stars-Morgan, and old gentleman, and a woman sat there, having beer, and shortly after we were there, Morgan, who knew me, spoke to me; the question was put by the old gentleman to Morgan, "Probably your friend, Mr. Dalton, will draw up the paper I was speaking to you about?" I said I was not capable of doing it, but no doubt my friend Teighe could do it, and by Frind's wish it was drawn out by Teighe.</p>
               <p>Teighe's Defence. I have only to corroborate the statement of Dalton; what he has said is true - I never saw Frind before nor since, nor do I know whether he is living or dead; I am not interested in the will, and do not see that it has been proved against me in any way.</p>
               <p>Fallon's Defence. I neither prisoner con saw the will wrote or drawn out; I know nothing about the concern -I was not present.</p>
               <p>Paternoster's Defence. I know nothing of the old gentleman, nor did I ever see him - I know nothing of any money being left to me. (The following letter, found in Dalton's box, was here read, at his request).</p>
               <p>North Shields, March 23, 1832.</p>
               <p>DEAR MOTHER, - I embrace the opportunity of writing to you, hoping to find you in good health, as it leaves me at present, thank God for it - I wrote to you on the 14th of this month and expected an answer by return of post, but no answer has ever been; I am going to America, and will endeavour to leave the monthly money at London or Shields, but hoping to receive an answer, before I sail from here, I will write to you again as soon as I receive an answer to this letter - by return of post.</p>
               <p>Your dutiful son,</p>

             CLARKSON. I am a proctor, and live in Doctor's-commons. On the 9th of February the prisoner Peacock brought this will to me, to be proved; I am certain of her person - I saw her very frequently; she described herself as the sole executrix named in the will, and in consequence of her instruction I prepared the affidavit which I hold in my hand: I was present when she swore the affidavit, and upon that, probate was issued in the usual course - she afterwards directed me to write to Mr. Heathorn, owner of the ship Eliza, to demand payment of what might be due to the deceased; I do not know whether any body was present then - this was after probate had been granted; she sometimes came to me alone, and sometimes had persons with her; I think she was alone, and sometimes had persons with her; I think she was alone when she brought the will; she was sometimes accompained by Elizabeth Brennan; I do not think that woman attended till after it was alleged the will was forged; I do not recollect that it was her who came at first - after probate was issued, a decree was taken out to recall the will.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. I have the decree; here is the original book of the Court, which I produce from the clerk of the papers - it is the original book in which the entries are made by the registrar of the Court; he is the officer who has the custody of the book - I do not know the registrars' hand-writing.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. I believe this to be the hand-writing of Mr. Ingleby, one of the registrars.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does the will you produce purport to be the will of Shiell or Shields? A.Shields.</p>

            , widow, the party cited, and brought in probate of the will of the party deceased, and appointed William Geering Clarkson to be her proctor - present Frederick Clarkson, who brought in the decree, and declared he opposed the said will; William Geering Clarkson propounded the same, and asserted an allegation on admission the bye day."</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GEERING CLARKSON. In consequence of the suit instituted, Peacock came and retained me as her proctor, to defend the suit; I desired her to come to me, and bring all the witnesses who knew any thing of the transaction - I told her it was intended to be charged as a forgery, and I wished to know what she could bring forward in support of the will: in consequence of this she came to me with the prisoner Driscol and the other subscribing witness, who was Brennan, and another woman, who was not a witness to the will; I do not remember when it was, but it must have been before the day of the allegation - instructions were given to me to prepare the allegation in the suit by all the persons who were in attendance, and whom I have named; they all four spoke to me, in each other's hearing and presence; what they said formed the statements made in the allegation - I do not think it was read over to them after it was prepared; Peacock stated that the deceased called on her, and stated that he was going to sea shortly, and was disposed to make a will before he went, in her favour - that the deceased appointed the time and place in the evening where they should meet to draw up the will- that they met agreeable to the appointment, and the will was drawn up at the time and place named in the allegation; I took the contents of the allegation down from their months - this is it; I drew it up in the beginning of February.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.Have you the original memorandum made from the parties' instructions? A. No, but I drew this paper up within twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is the allegation verified by the oath of any person? A. No, the time had not arrived to do that; I expected that Driscol would have verified it - they have never been produced as witnesses in support of it: I have discontinued proceeding in the suit until the result of these proceedings are known; that is all - if it is not taken down so it is a mistake.</p>
               <p>COURT. You may look at the allegation to refresh your memory, but it must not be read. Witness. Mrs. Peacock said the will was executed on the day it bore date, and in the presence of those parties - I asked her who was the writer of the will; she said it was a person who was at sea, a friend of her half-brother's; they stated that the will, when drawn up, was executed by the deceased affixing his mark - I asked them all if the deceased had requested his name to be written for him; they all said he begged his name might be written for him; and then he put his mark to it; I asked Driscol and Brennan if their names subscribed as witnesses at the foot of the will was in their hand-writing; they each of them said it was - I asked if they put their names at the time the deceased executed the will - they both said Yes, and that it was done in his presence; the will was at this time in the registry, and none of them saw it; I had no other business in hand for Peacock at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You used the word deceased - is that what you mentioned to them? A. I might have said testator - it was stated to be the will of Shields, who lately died on board the Eliza.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the name of Shields ever mentioned, or did you speak of him as the deceased or testator? A. They did not attend me on any other subject - I told them there appeared to be a difference in the names set forth in the will and that in the decree; this was previous to drawing the allegation.</p>
               <p>Q.Then the name was the subject of conversation? A. Yes - Peacock had brought the decree to me as soon as she was served with it, and it was then I told her to bring her witnesses; Shield's name was mentioned in the presence of all of them, because I mentioned the difference in the name in the decree - they said they could not profess to say which was right, whether it was Shields or Shiell; Driscol said he had been to Heathborn, the owner of the vessel, to ascer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170014"/>tain the amount of the wages due at the time of the deceased's death; Mrs. Peacock and Driscol went repeatedly to Heathorn - they said so; Driscol said he had been to Heathorn in the presence of all the others - I am not certain whether Brennan said she was present at Heathorn's, or whether it was another woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe the female prisoner was the first person you saw? A. Yes - she represented herself as executrix; I saw her two or three times before I saw Driscol - I cannot say whether Brennan attended before the whole four, but a woman had attended with Peacock; I should think it was not Brennan - that woman did not enter into the particulars; I did not ask her till I found it necessary to go into the merits; I had not at that time asked Peacock to produce a witness to the will - I think Driscol did attend before the probate was called in; it has not been revoked yet - I had told Peacock the will was suspected to be forged before Driscol came at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When the four were together, did not Mrs. Peacock give the principal circumstances on which you framed the allegation? A.She did - I have paid no money over to any of the parties under the will; I was examined before the Magistrate; Brennan was not examined in my presence- I never saw her before I saw her in the Commons; I am sure she said she was present at the execution of the will on the day of its date, which is the 11th of December, 1830- she said it was her hand-writing; I put the same question to Driscol - Brennan said, that besides Driscol there was a Mr. Cous in the room; I think I understood there were other persons present at the public-house they met at to execute the will - she said Mrs. Peacock, Driscol, herself, Mr. Cous, and the writer of the will, were present; the name of the writer was not mentioned - he was stated to be the brother-in-law of Mrs. Peacock, or the friend of her brother-in-law; she said there were five in all present - I understood the writer of the will was a seafaring man, who was in the South Seas, and I did not trouble myself to have more than three persons as witnesses; I did not require the attendance of the publican, or any of his family; the publican's name was not mentioned, but the sign was stated to be the Nag's Head, Cotton-street, Poplar - nobody from that house was examined in my hearing before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Was all this statement made in the hearing of Driscol? A. Yes - I had seen him once before on this business.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.When the four persons were there, did not Driscol express a wish to see the will? A. I cannot say whether he did, or did not; it is very likely - if he did I should have said the will was in Court.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he die on the voyage home? A. A. Yes - it is reported in the log-book; there were wages due to him - I do not know how much; his father made application for them first - Driscol afterwards applied for them, in company with a woman; I have seen Peacock at my office, but whether it was her, or another woman came at that time, I cannot say - (looking at Brennan) I think that is the woman that came with him; I have seen Peacock at my office, but whether she accompanied Driscol I do not know - she came about Shiell's wages; Driscol called on the same subject - we declined giving him any information, because we had paid the wages to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170015"/>father; he said the woman who was with him had the will- what woman that was I do not remember; he threatened to take proceedings against the ship; he said he came to claim John Shiell's wages, who died on board the Eliza-I think I saw him at my office on the subject two or three times, but I am not positive, because I saw him about other ships on many occasions; I saw him there about almost every ship that had been paid - he accompanied the seamen who were to be paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Without referring to the ship's articles, do you know whether John Shiell was a man or a boy? A. No - there are names here without marks, which are attested; a dot means that they are all attested - Marshall has attested the four first names.</p>
               <p>Q.There is no witness to the name of John Shiell? A. Yes - there is no attesting witness' name; the sum 1l. 5s, per month against it, in the column, is not a lighter ink than the rest - the designation of a landsman on the list would apply to a boy, as well as a man.</p>
               <p>ANDREW SHIELL. I have every reason to believe this name to the ship's articles is my son's writing; he wrote an excellent hand - I received letters from him at Spithead after he left; I live at Camberwell - my son went three voyages before this; the letters I received from him are dated on board the ship Eliza, and I know them to be his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Tell me whether you will swear the signature to these articles to be his hand-writing? A. I cannot swear positively, but believe it to be so; there is a great variance in person's hand-writing at different times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You know your son could write? Yes - he was a tall thin lad, about five feet ten inches; I got this log-book from the chief mate of the Eliza - it is my son's private log-book on board that ship, and in his hand-writing; I received my son's payment on the 5th of January -I received all he was entitled to.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATHORN re-examined. The party applied to me after the crew were paid; we did not state that we had paid the wages, but declined giving any information; I paid the wages myself, and paid them in cash - I never mentioned to Driscol that I had paid the father; we always declined giving any information - I cannot tell what my clerks may have done.</p>

            . The name at the bottom of this will is my hand-writing; there was no man in the room when I put it there - I heard nobody say he published that as his last will and testament, or that it was his will or any thing of the kind; Peacock did not tell me what it was - I did not read it, nor was it read to me; when she took me to Mr.Clarkson's she said she had brought one of the witnesses; she said nothing else.</p>
               <p>The will was here read, with the affidavit of Elizabeth peacock annexed to it, stating that she was sole executrix to the deceased, who died on board the vessel; that she had applied to Mr. Heathorn for information, as to when he died, who refused to give information, and the crew having gone to sea she could, not obtain the information. Sworn, the 9th of February, 1832, before G. Coote, Surrogate; present W.G. Clarkson.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK CLARKSON. I know this to be the signature of Dr. Coote.</p>
               <p>ANDREW SHIELL. The will is not in my son's handwriting, nor is the name Johu Shields his, to the best of my judgment; I do not believe the cross was made by him; he wrote a good hand - I never knew him make a cross instead of signing his name.</p>

            , at the bottom of this will, is my hand-writing; I put it there last Christmas - I think it was after Christmas; I was up in Fullen's room at the time - the three prisoners were present; I do not recollect the paper being read to me at all - only they said they expected Mr. Myers to sign his name to the paper, and as he did not come they asked me to sign it, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had this paper when you first saw it? A. Mr. Driscol wrote what he had to say on it, and after, he wrote the first witness' name at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he first write on the paper what there is there? A. Yes; it was him I first saw with it; I saw him writing on it - I cannot exactly say what he wrote, but I saw him writing on this paper; I saw him write this name at the bottom here, and then I signed mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name he wrote? A. I cannot read - he wrote a name that was not his own.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you tell that, if you cannot read?

             is the female prisoner - she went by that name then; I do not think the name of Elliott was mentioned at that time; I knew that when I went to the proctor's - I was in the room - all day, I dare say; Fullen and his wife lived in the room - I do not know whether Driscol brought the paper in; he came about the middle of the day - Mrs. Fullen and I were both sitting at work; Mr. Fullen came in, and Driscol came in not a great while afterwards; I cannot say who first began to speak about it; I was sitting down, and, to the best of my recollection, Driscol said, "Why, it is no harm for you, mother Francis to sign your name to it;" Mr. and Mrs. Fullen said it was no use waiting for Myers, for he would not come - I did not take particular notice whether they both said so; I think it was Mr. Fullen - he spoke so that the whole party could hear; he said it was no use waiting for Myers - Mrs. Fullen told me that Myers was to be concerned in the will; that he was to have been a witness to it instead of me - when it was said it was of no use waiting for Myers, Driscol asked me if I could write; I said I could write my own name - Driscol gave me the pen, and I wrote my name at the bottom - the paper laid on the table before Driscol and me; he put the paper to me, and I wrote my name - that was after I had seen him write - Fullen was there in the room, sitting very near the table; he could see what was doing, and hear what was said - the female prisoner was near enough to hear what took place; she was not two yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to sign your name as Carnell? A. I lived with a man of that name formerly; he is dead now- when I put my name to the paper, Driscol, Fullen, and all of them said that would do; they all said they would take it up to the procutor to ministrate for the man's money, Driscol did not stop there any time after it was done - Mrs. Fullen kept the paper; I went with Mrs. Fullen to the proctor as a witness three or four days after the paper was signed; Mr. Burchett was the proctor - Mrs. Fullen said they could do nothing unless I went up as a witness for them: it was at her request I went - she told me what I was to say when I got there, about knowing the man a good while, and that he used to be backwards and forwards at the place for a year and a half; they told me the man's name, but I cannot think of it now - I told the proctor what she told me; he wrote it down, and I signed it - this is it; I believe it was read over to me before I signed it - I had no knowledge of the man I went to speak about; I never saw him in my life - I went with Mrs - Fullen over to the proctor's for the probate, but it was not ready; I saw Mr. Burchett when I went - we went out and waited till about half-past three o'clock, then went again, and it was ready: she paid for the probate. and took it away with her - this is it (looking at it)</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you go with her to Great Alie-street? A. yes; I waited outside while she went into the owners where the money was to be paid - she told me she was going to get the money she had been administering for, and it was under 5l; she came out and told me the clerk was gone, she must go again next morning, and that she had left the probate there-she had it when she went in; I did not go with her the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Who do you live with? A. At the house of one Mrs. Jones; I support myself by my own labour - nobody has given me any money, nor maintained me - I lived with Carnell, who is now dead; I was married to Pringle, and I lived with one Francis - I never went by any other name; I signed an affidavit in the name of Elliott, for Mrs. Elliott.</p>
               <p>Q.Who is Mrs. Elliot? A. The female prisoner; I am almost sure I called myself by the Christian name of Mary- as far as I can make out the name in the will it is Ellioty; I do not know whether it is tt or ty - I made my mark to the affidavit; I got no money, nor the promise of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170017"/>any; they afterwards gave me 3s., which they owed me; I am sure it was a debt - I work at slop work; I never walk the streets, nor pick men up; I was sent to prison for a month once from Lambeth-street - I never signed the name of Pringle but once; I signed the name of Carnell and Elliott at the proctor's, Mr. Clarkson's - that was on another occasion; it was an affidavit - when I signed the name of

            , Mrs. Peacock asked me to go as aunt to the man, but I was not his aunt; I signed my name for her, as she said she could not do it, because she had business at Clarkson's; I told them I was the aunt of Johnson - I did not look over Driscol when he was writing, and do not know what he wrote; I did not know what I was signing at the time - they said it was no harm, I might as well do it as not; it was the first paper I signed - I afterwards signed an affidavit for her, and they were the only two I ever signed; it was at her request - I had nothing from her except what she had borrowed of me; she gave me 3s. to get my gown out of pawn - I never made an affidavit on any other occasion: I positively swear that no man was in the room except Fullen and Driscol - I told nobody what I had done; I was taken into custody on Mr. Frind's business - they put me down as a legatee in that business; when I was taken to Lambeth-street on Frind's business, the two papers I had signed were brought forward, and I owned to them; Lea took me to the proctor's, to see if I knew my own handwriting, and if I knew the gentleman - I was not placed at the bar of the office; I was there as a witness.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What were you sent to prison for a month for? A. For pawning a cloak; I made the affidavit in the name of Elliott, at the request of the female prisoner - Morgan and Fullen also requested me to go and make it; I was not taken into custody as being concerned in Frind's business - they took me to the office, and asked if I could find bail; I said not: the gentleman said there was no occasion for bail, as I was a witness, and I was discharged.</p>

               <p>THOMAS MILLER. I am clerk to Mr. Burchett, a proctor of Doctors'-commons. In January last this will was brought to our office by two women; to the best of my belief the last witness was one, and the prisoner Peacock the other; Peacock said she had brought that will to be proved - I looked it over, and handed it to Mr. Burchett, who came in; he then put several questions to Pringle, who was called

No.3, Fan-court, Baker's-row, Whitechapel-road, Middlesex, widow;" that name and address was given to me by the female prisoner as the residence of the executrix - she gave it as her own direction- Mr. Burchett wrote it down; it is the description she gave of herself - I then wrote the jurat on the will; Mr. Burchett went to get it sworn - the female prisoner went with him; they returned to the office; the probate was prepared in the course of the day; (looking at it) this is it; they were desired to call about three o'clock for it, and the female prisoner, to the best of my belief, called; she paid for it, and took it away.</p>

               <p>Driscol's Defence. I have to remark that I know nothing whatever of the transaction in any shape; with respect to what the woman swears, I consider it will be quite invalid; she admitted before the Magistrate that I had no money for it, and that, I believe, the evidence for the prosecution will corroborate - it is not likely I should implicate myself in such things without fee or reward; she admitted before the Magistrate that she had committed perjury, and said she did not know the obligation of an oath, and said she supposed she would willingly swear to more if she was desired - as to my calling at Fullen's house, I had business there; I kept a shop in the provision business; Fullen had meat and things, for which he owed me a few shillings, and sometimes I owed him a little, as he knew seamen, and got me lodgers, for which I had to make him a recompense; I know nothing of the transaction - I have never seen or heard any thing about it; I was taken to give evidence in another case about a week before; the evidence I gave did not satisfy the prosecutors - I was let go, and on that occasion Lea mentioned something to me about a will at Clarkson's, but I took no notice of it, and in about a week he took me at my own place; if I had been aware of any thing of the sort against me I should certainly have left home - the only evidence against me is Pringle's, and if she is to have credit before a respectable Jury, I know not what will become of the liberty of the subject.</p>
               <p>Fullen's Defence. If it was written in my place I know nothing of it - I can neither read nor write, and never saw the man write.</p>

            , and lived with him in March and April. The prisoner came there on Sunday, the 18th of March, and on the following Saturday, and slept there all night - he did not come to see me; master and mistress did not know of his being there - he slept in the same bed with me- he got up about five o'clock in the morning, and breakfasted with me; he went away about six - he lent me a round smock-frock, to go up a chimney to alter the flue; it had no mark nor stains on it then - I saw it afterwards, and saw stains of blood on it; it was exactly like the one he lent me, but I cannot swear to it. On the morning of the 4th of April, between one and two o'clock, I heard a noise, like a window smashing; I was in bed - I heard it about three times, and heard footsteps in mistress' bed-room, and heard the person go out of the window; I sleep up one pair of stairs from that bed-room - nobody slept in the room that night; mistress slept, in the next room to it that night - I heard a noise as if a drawer was drawn open; I went into the room between one and two o'clock, and found the window all beat in - it is a sash window; I went into the room with mistress, and she missed a box - I looked out of window, and saw two ladders tied together up at the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Do you keep a memorandum of the days people come to your house? A. No; he left master's service on the 13th of March - he did not come to see me afterwards; there is a maid-servant in the house - he was only there two days while I was there; I cannot swear to the smock-frock - I think it is the same.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FAIR. I am a horse-patrol, of Bow-street, On the 9th of April I went to Acton, and searched two boxes of the prisoner's at the Police-station; I found a smock frock, with several spots of blood on it, a few by the arms, and one on the left-hand pocket hole; I found a silver penny in the pocket of it, which the Police-serjeant has; I apprehended the prisoner at Barkham, in Berkshire, on the 7th, and brought him to Hayes - he was examined on the 9th before Mr. Newdigate, in my presence - I said nothing to induce him to state what he did; what he said was taken down in writing - I advised him not to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170019"/>say any thing; about two hours after I locked him up I had a message to go to him - I went, and took him out of the cage; (I had told him when I took him that it was for Mr.Freeman's robbery) - he said he had been very unhappy in his mind ever since Mr. Freeman's robbery, and wished to make some confession; I said nothing to induce him to state any thing - I took down what he said at the time(reads); he said that he tied Mr.Freeman's two ladders together, and placed them under Mrs. Freeman's bed-room window, then went up, broke the whole of the lower sash, and entered the room - went right up to the wardrobe, took out the box, heard an alarm, ran to the window, and down the ladder; he cut his hands in getting out - that he went away, and opened the box, examined it, and found it contained the same quantity of jewellery and money, as Mr. Freeman had stated that day before the Magistrate; that he was truly sorry for the office, and ready and willing to discover where he had concealed the property - I went with him to Barkham the following day; he took me to his father's farm-house - he took me to an out-house, took the property out from where it was concealed, and put it into my hands; I have had it ever since - here are two gold watches, nine gold rings, five brooches, a breast-pin, a pair of ear-drops, three gold chains, a miniature picture, two pairs of bracelets, a hair-locket, a spoon, a scent-bottle, two guineas, eight 10l., and seven 5l. Bank notes; he produced all these, and said he had thrown a paper with some small coins over a fence at Acton, and that all the property was Mrs. Freeman's - I was present before the Magistrate at his examination; this is his statement (looking at it) - I saw the Magistrates put their names to it, and saw him sign it; it was read over to him - (read)</p>
               <p>David Elliott, charged before us with burglary, voluntarily says, that in the first place he went to Mr. Freeman's house, at Hayes, at eleven o'clock at night, and went to the cow-house, remained there two hours, and tied two ladders together, put them up against the house, and broke a bed-room window, and thereby got into the house - went direct up to Mrs. Freeman's wardrobe, and took out the box, heard the bell ring at the same time, which made him (the examinant) make a frightful noise to keep Mrs. Freeman out of the room, then took the box, and made his escape out of the window; was not in the room two minutes, cut his thumb with the glass of the window, went off as fast as he could run to the bottom of Botwell-common, when he broke open the box, took out the property, and tied it up in a handkerchief; whether he lost any of it he does not know- went as far as Richmond-bridge, and did not know what to do, sat on the bridge a long time, after that went to Acton and Wormwood-scrubbs, then at twelve o'clock in the day went back to his lodging at Acton, took the property out of his hat and placed it in his boxes, the next morning he concealed the property in a ditch bank close by; then he had no rest night nor day, was truly sorry for what he had done; on the Friday morning Mr. Frogley's coachman called him up, after that he buried two handkerchiefs which were covered with blood - he was afterwards taken up, and his boxes were searched, and after being taken to Hatton-garden Police-office he was discharged; his father then took him home to Barkham - he first took the property from the ditch bank where he had left it; when he got home at his father's he concealed the property in a stable and afterwards in the thatch of an out-house; sometime this week he intended to send it all home, but was taken up again; he afterwards confessed to the Policeman Fair, and pointed out the property to him - 8l. of the property produced by Fair a 5l. note and three sovereigns, were his own property; the Policeman did not hold out any promise to him, to induce him to make the confession to him.</p>

               <p>THE REV. JOHN NEVILLE FREEMAN. I do not think the prisoner's intellect remarkably strong; I always thought him very honest - my opinion is that it is his first offence, and that his mind was weak.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>JANE EDGAR. My mother is laundress to Mr. Birch. On Wednesday, the 11th of April, I was at his chambers from a quarter past ten o'clock in the morning to a quarter past twelve; I then double-locked the doors, and left them quite safe - I went again, in consequence of information, about six, and found the outer door broken open, by taking off the iron plate of the door-post; there were several marks of violence on the wood work - I missed a counterpane and five sheets off the bed; they had just come from the wash, and were put there - I missed a shirt out of the drawer, a hat, and other articles, but I did not exactly know what was gone till Mr. Birch returned - I had seen all the things safe in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does your master keep a clerk? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. You never saw these men about the chambers? A. No.</p>
               <p>JAMES RICHMOND FOLKARD. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Clerkenwell. On the 13th of April, about four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170020"/>o'clock in the afternoon, Roberts pawned a gun in a wooden case with me for 4l.; I produce it - he was alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. You had known Roberts some time, I believe? A.Between two and three years; he lived at the Horse and Groom, nearly opposite my house - he pawned it in his own name; I have been in the habit of taking pledges from him, which were sometimes redeemed by himself, and sometimes by others - he was ostler at the Horse and Groom, but I do not know whether he was so at that time.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS. I am a constable of Marlborough-street. I apprehended Roberts on Saturday, the 21st of April, in Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell, at his lodging - I went there about three o'clock in the afternoon; he was not at home; I waited till one in the morning - he then came home - I told him he must consider himself in custody, for pawning a gun at Folkard's, that he would have to account how he became possessed of it, and he might answer me how he pleased - I did not say it would he better or worse for him; he then said, that on the day he pawned it he was coming across Smithfield-market, and saw a gentleman carrying a gun and portmantean; he asked him if he should carry it for him; the gentleman allowed him to carry the gun, and afterward asked if he could pawn it; that he said he could pawn it where he was in the habit of pawning things; that the gentleman waited opposite while he went and pawned it for 4l. at Folkard's that he came out, joined the gentleman, and walked a little way with him - he gave him the 4l, and he gave him half-a-crown for his trouble; that he did not know the gentleman - he had never seen him before or since; I took him to the office; he was remanded for re-examination on Monday, the 30th, and that day, while he was locked up backwards. he said he wanted to speak to me very particularly, and I was to bring his old woman down with me - I took his wife down from the front of the office to him, at the lock-up place: he then said it was Sam Crowson who gave him the gun to pawn; in consequence of what he further said to us, his wife went with me and Goddard to a house near Canterbury-street, New-cut, Lambeth, to Crowson's, and found he had moved that morning - he was not there; I traced him to No.4, Glover's-hatch, and found him there - I told him he was charged with robbery, and we must take him into custody; he and his wife were there - they had only come in that day - there are only two rooms in the house. one up stairs and the other down; on searching a box up stairs, which was not locked, we found these stockings, and in his pocket I found three duplicates - I saw Goddard find in the upper room, a hat, which Mr. Birch afterwards identified; Crowson had claimed it as his - he said he had no other, and he would be d - d if he would walk through the streets without a hat - one of the duplicates is for a shirt, pawned at Stafford's St. John-street; the pawnbroker produced it at the office, and give it up - I brought a great many other things away out of the box; Crowson claimed some of them, and some he did not - I gave Mr. Folkard a copy of Stafford's duplicate; I have had the stockings ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are the pawnbrokers here? A. No; I went to the house in the Newcut in consequence of what Roberts and his wife said -I found three famales in the house; I do not know their names - it was not said, in my presence, that Mrs. Henson was owner of the house or furniture; I did not take the women into custody - I made them turn their pockets out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. How did you find Roberts? A. By Folkard's information; he did not tell me it was in consequence of his wife saying he had better tell the truth, that he said what he did - I found no stolen prpperty at Roberts,.</p>
               <p>HENRY GOODARD. I am a constable of Marlborough-street. I went with Clements, and waited at Roberts' till near one o'clock - I went with Clements, on the 30th of April, to a house in Glover's-hatch, New-cut: I knocked at the door - Crowson opened it; I told him a burglary had been committed that we were officers, and had come to search his place - while Clements was searching the room below, I desired Crowson to step up stairs; when we got up I asked him for his hat - he took a hat off the bed and put it on; I then took it from him, and saw the maker's name in it was as described in the Police reports; I then began to search, and in a cupboard upstairs found two crow-bars and a number of skelton keys, a phosphorus-box, and several files - I tried two of the keys to Mr. Birch's lock; they fitted it - also the key of a padlock, which Clements tried - I have had the hat ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were the women up stairs? A. They were in the room below, with Crowson - they came up after; I did not not hear the name of Henson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say any thing about the hat? A. He said it was his hat, that he bought it of a Jew for 8s. 6d.</p>
               <p>MR. BIRCH. This is the gun which was taken from my chambers; it is the property of Mr.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.You had worn the hat but little? A. No; I have not the slightest doubt of it - it was made specially to my own shape - I have no doubt it has been worn by another person for some weeks; I have a boy, but he does not attend my chambers while I am from town - he gives up the keys to the laundress; I was absent about six weeks - I ordered the boy to call on the laundress, to know when I was coming to town, or if there were any letters to send me - I had not lost these keys before I went out of town; I suppose they were taken at the times of the robbery - I lost nothing from the cellar; one was a key of the bin in the cellar - I returned to town on the 16th of April; I kept one key hanging up in the kitchen, and the key of the padlock in the drawer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170021"/>of my bed-room - I missed the keys when I returned to town.</p>

I produce a great coat, smelling-bottle, and umbrella, which I found at Glover's-hatch, New-cut, Lambeth, on the 30th of April, at the prisoner's house; we apprehended him there that day - the things were up stairs; the shirt, cap, and smelling-bottle in a box with other things; as I took the things out of the box he owned several of them - he had got the coat on his back; I did not take that from him till the 7th of May, when I found the prosecutor had lost such a coat; I am sure he had that coat on on the 30th of April - he was committed for re-examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found the prisoner in the lower room, I believe? A. Yes; I never heard that the house belonged to a woman named Henson - I traced the prisoner to have moved there that morning.</p>

On Friday, the 6th of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I left my house with my wife - I locked the house, and fastened the window with a gimblet; I came home ten or twenty minutes before nine, and saw a man, with one leg inside my parlour window, and the other leg out - that was not the prisoner; I had a child in my arms - I saw the prisoner at the same time, standing with his back leaning against the wall, opposite the window, within two yards of it - I gave an alarm, and they both ran away together as soon as I called Stop thief! the prisoner was pursued, and I overtook him in Hackney-road - I am certain he is the person; there was a glimmering light from the opposite side of the street, which shines down the court - I saw him running and ran after him, after throwing my child down; I lost sight of him myself, but am sure he is the man - when I got back I missed my fire-irons and tea-caddy, which I had left on the drawers in the parlour; the window had been forced open, apparently by a chisel or something - the wood where the gimblet was was broken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170022"/>out; I saw the fire-irons and tea-caddy that night at the station-house, Mile-end-road, in possession of the officer.</p>

No; the reflection of it throws a light on the house; it is opposite the court on the other side of the street; you turn round four or five houses to get to my house - it was not exactly dark at the time: it was near nine o'clock - there were lights from the different back windows; I saw both the men run away: a man, named Gangey, was taken up as the one who got out of the window, but I did not believe him to be the man - my wife swore to him by a cast over his eye; I swear I fastened the window that night - the prisoner ran away the instant I collared the other; having a child in my arms I could not hold him - I did not see him with any thing; the fire-irons were new, and had come in that morning.</p>

On the morning in question I was looking out of my window, which is opposite the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner with another person; the prisoner lifted the sash up by degrees - I suppose he went to it five or six times, opening it about an inch at a time, and then walked on - when they had got it quite up the prisoner got in; I immediately went down stairs, and got a rattle - I opened my front door, sprang my rattle, and went over to the window; he jumped out - I tried to catch hold of him, but could not - he ran, and was taken by Branch; there were five more by the place besides him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You had an opportunity of seeing the person and shape of the man? A. I had - it was possible for a person to go down stairs when I returned to my room after the struggle; there were four strange persons in the house besides the prisoner - I did not look at their shirts or braces; their countenances and the colour of their hair were different to his - they took off their night-caps, to enable me to see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Policeman first examine the prisoner, and say he observed no tear or any thing particular about his dress? A. No - he was not examined in his bed; he appeared to be asleep when I first went in - I had awoke the other gentlemen, and they did not appear confused; it was not the appearance as of a person disturbed from sleep; when he came out of the bed-room after us he was in his shirt - I observed that he walked backwards; he never put his back so that it could be seen - he opened the door, and stepped backwards, so that his back should not be seen; I saw his countenance, and was satisfied from the first that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, "A most uncomfortable circumstance has occurred, a gentleman has been robbed - as there are three gentlemen in the house besides you, I should like to see you?" A. I do not know whether I did or not-Mr. Harrison or myself spoke to all the gentlemen as we awoke them; I did not desire to see his shirt in bed, saying the person's shirt had been torn - I was as confident of him at the house as at the station; when I saw his shirt it put aside all chance of my being in error in selecting him; I told the Policeman to keep an eye on him before he went down stairs - I am satisfied he is the man.</p>

On the morning in question I was at the station, in Covent-garden, and from what the prosecutor said I had the prisoner's coat and waistcoat taken off, and afterward his neckcloth - the gathers of his shirt from the neck appeared fresh torn, and there was no button on his shirt-collar; I afterwards received from Mr.

             a shirt-button, which I compared with those on the wrists of his shirt, and it corresponded - there were no buttons on the collar; this button had been attached to something, because there are fibres of thread to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you the shirt? A. Yes(producing a very dirty one), it is a common thread button - there have been two on the collar; the shirt was as dirty as it is now when I took it off the prisoner.</p>

On the 19th of April, about eleven o'clock at night, or a quarter past, there were a few persons drinking in my tap-room - the street-door was not fastened; I went up into my bed-room, which is on the first floor, and as I opened the room door a man stood before me, in the room; I took hold of him by the arm, and screamed out - he did not speak nor struggle with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get away from you? A. Yes; I went part of the way down stairs with him, having hold of his arm; I never recollect seeing him before - I picked up a chisel down stairs, by the side of the bar; I do not know who dropped it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he partly drag you down stairs? A. I held him by the arm as he came part of the way down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pull you down? A. No, he never took hold of me - he appeared to want to get away; he was quite a stranger to me; he did not get out of my hands - I cannot swear to him - he got down stairs before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he given into custody in your house? A. A man was given into custody; nothing was taken out of my bed-room nor removed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The man got away from you, that is, you lost sight of him? A. Yes; I cannot swear to the prisoner's features, but his dress appeared the same - I will not swear he is the man I had hold of in my room, as I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you believe the man who was secured in your house is the man you found in your bed-room? A. I think he is the man; I believe he is, but cannot swear to his face.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before had you closed the door? A.

At the examination the witnesses varied very much in their statements; the prosecutrix always persisted that she knew nothing of me - I had to shift my clothes and put a hat on, but she could not swear to me - the gentleman said I passed him in the passage, which I did, but I wish you to understand the parlour door is right at the foot of the stairs, and if I had come down there is a door leading right out into the street; and as I came down the passage I should come four or five yards out of my way, and run where I was sure to be taken; I came out of the parlour, hearing the cries - there were four or five others in the parlour at the time; it is a night-house - she never said any thing about a struggle before.</p>

I am certain of it; I never lent him any money - I had not been wrestling with two men at the George the Fourth; a man asked me if I could wrestle at the time I was laid hold of- I ordered a quartern of gin there; I did not give any body my keys or money to take care of for me - I have sometimes left my watch and money at a public-house, not when I was drunk, but before I got drunk; I did not give Dancer my money to take care of - I have not been to the George the Fourth since, and given people a sovereign to drink the prisoners' health.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long were you at the public-house? A. About an hour, not more-there is a singing club held there, but there was no singing that night; we had a pint of half and half between four of us, a 1d. worth of gin, and part of a glass of rum and water - as I came out I had another 1d. worth of gin; I left my companions at the door; they were old friends - I was robbed two or three minutes walk from the house; I did not cry out when I was tripped up - I did not see the prisoner at that moment, because I could not see behind me; I do not think there is a lamp in the street - it was a very moon-light night; the prisoner did not say he had come up, hearing the alarm; the greatest distance he got from me was from the kennel to the middle of the road, not more than a yard and a half - his back being white enabled me to keep him in sight; I was as sober as I ever was in my life; as soon as he broke my chain he turned his back to me.</p>

I had been spending the evening with a friend - I left about half-past twelve o'clock, and coming down Pelham-street, in my way home, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I was intoxicated, and I was some distance from the place where the person, was robbed; and when they came near me, I mixed with the mob; I was knocked down and taken into custody - I have been in a respectable business as a publican, and business run so bad, that I was obliged to give up my house at a sad loss of all I possessed, and ever since I have supported my wife and child by honest industry; I have always borne the character of an honest, sober, industrious man; I now throw myself on your mercy, for I am innocent of the charge.</p>

            . I am single - I was living at the prosecutor's, and went to church with him; my box was safe then - I did not return till the end of the service; I went up stairs immediately - most of the property was taken from a bed-room up stairs; I found the drawer taken out, and the property stated as mine all taken away; I consider it worth 5l. - I also lost nine or ten sovereigns and some silver - my property altogether was worth about 20l. - I found it at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you found a great many people in the house when you returned? A. Not a great many; I think the carpenter and locksmith, and a female friend.</p>

            . I live in Tottenham-row, Kingsland-road, near the prosecutor's. I had been on an errand, and as I returned I saw a man standing within the prosecutor's door, about ten minutes past eleven o'clock - he was within the street door, which was wide open; I thought he had no right there, and stood to watch him - I saw two men behind him; they saw me watching, and stood some few minutes, then came out with a bundle, shut the door after them, and walked at rather a quick pace - the first person I saw was Mrs. Bumstead; I told her, and she gave an alarm - I saw sufficient of them to recognize their persons; I did not see them again till about half-past three o'clock that afternoon, when they were at the station-house; I was certain the three prisoners were the persons, and not as now: I did not see Mr. Bowyer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Do you mean to represent that you saw Jones in the house? A.He is the man I saw on the step within the door - I did not see him go into the house; I saw him come out - I call the step of the door inside; I do not know which of the three had the bundle, but one of them had - it was about the size of a peck measure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Who shut the door? A. I cannot say; I do not know which was the last man; Jones came out first - I never said I was merely passing, and did not stop at all.</p>

            . I live in Newland-row, about thirty yards from Malkin's, and am a carpenter. I was standing at my door, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock; I could see Malkin's door from my house - I saw a man standing at the door without his hat; the door was open -I looked to see if it was Malkin, as I thought it odd he should not be at church, as he always goes; when the man saw me he drew back into the passage, and I went into my own house; I had not been there five minutes before a woman informed me Malkin's house was broken open - I directly went to church to fetch him; I came back with him - there was nobody in the house then - the door was shut, and a broken key in the lock; I got a pair of pincers and opened the door with the key, which was in the lock; it was a skeleton-key - I saw a trunk broken open in the back parlour; the house had been plundered and was in confusion - I had not spoken to the man who was at the door; the prisoners are strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Jones is not the person you saw at the door? A. That I cannot say - I never said he was not the person; Mrs. Buxton passed me as I stood at my door - the man at that time stood at the door; he drew back into the house before I saw him - I could see him head, but not his body for the wall.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Is your house next door to Malkin's? A. No, on the other side of the way - when I saw Mrs. Buxton there was some man at Malkin's door; Buxton was standing still, to the best of my recollection - she afterwards passed by.</p>

On Easter Sunday, between five and ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170032"/>minutes past eleven o'clock, I saw Godfrey standing at the door of Malkin's house - the door was wide open; I looked at him and went on - I saw no other persons there; I did not know him before, but am certain he is the man - I saw him at the Police-office on the Friday after, and am quite certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you there when Mrs. Buxton was? A. I did not see her; I pointed Godfrey out from among several other persons.</p>

            . I live in Morning-lane, about a mile from Malkin's. On this Sunday I was walking across Pigwell-field, and saw the three prisoners running; they are the men - I never saw them before; they were about half a mile from Malkin's house - I lost sight of them for about half a mile, but before that I saw the middle one wiping his face with a handkerchief, and one of them take something out of a piece of white paper, and put into his pocket; I cannot say which of them it was - I saw them again at Homerton, walking in Mr. Bristow's field; I saw Jones, the Policeman, and gave him information - he and Robson ran after them, and they were all three apprehended; I am sure they are the three men I had seen before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you been in custody yourself? A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence. I was going to the washerwoman for my linen, and no doubt went by Malkin's house; a boy came up to me there, and said there had been a robbery committed down there; I went back, saw nothing, and went on - then a girl came up to me, and said, "There they go down there;" I immediately followed as far as Marsh-gate, where I was taken - they were quite out of sight then; the brooch belongs to me, I have had it a long time.</p>
               <p>Robinson's Defence. The Policeman says he took the key out of my cuff - I had it in my pocket, and threw it out at the station from my pocket; he caught hold of my hand, and said, "You are going to put it up your cuff;" I declare I never was in the house.</p>
               <p>Godfrey's Defence (written.) - I went to Ball's-pond to see a person, of the name of Mrs. Maisham, who was very ill, and is since dead; and likewise to call on a relation of hers, for whom I had fixed a stove the week before, and who told me they had a copper and another stove to fix; and my object of calling was to ascertain when they would have it done; as I was entering the gate of their house, I heard the cry of Stop them! I turned round, and saw some persons running; I run after them, and had overtaken them as the Police came up, and took me into custody - in regard to the money found on me, 2l. of it was given to me by my deceased friend; the rest of it I received from my father for work done for him, and the rest from other people for whom I had worked. I have a father and mother who have brought up a large family, who never brought any disgrace on them; and sorry am I to think, by my running after the mob, I have inadvertently brought this trouble on myself. I am truly innocent of the charge, but should it please God that I get through this trouble, I will strictly guard my actions.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave both Jones and Godfrey a good character.</p>

I had not known the prisoner or Mansfield till the 14th of May, when I was standing at my door, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening - I then saw the prisoner in the passage of a chandler's shop, kept by a person named Thompson, and Mansfield was standing by the public-house next door to him, in the street; Pearce then came out of the passage and joined Mansfield, and in a few minutes I saw them both go to the door of my father-in-law's house, which is next door to the chandler's shop - there is a batch-door to my father's house, about three feet six inches high; my father has been a soldier, and now keeps a marine store shop - I saw the prisoner put his hand in, open the door, and hold the bell from speaking; there is a bell and a bolt to the door; I had not then shown myself - Mansfield entered the shop immediately; I waited a short time, and then went over - I asked the two persons how they dared to enter the shop without giving any alarm, or ringing the bell, and the prisoner answered it was no business of mine; I said it was my business, and how dared they to enter there - Pearce then said he came to buy a second-hand jacket; he was then on the threshold of the passage door - Mansfield was in the shop, and had his hat off, and was in the act of getting into the bin where the rags are kept, under the counter, at the back of the partition which separates the shop from the passage; Pearce was then going out of the passage, and as he went out he told me he would knock my b - y brains out; he then went out, and said to Mansfield,"Come, Tom, this won't do here;" Mansfield then followed him out, and they stood there for some time - I begged and prayed of them to go away, and said if they did not I would charge the first Policeman who came by with them - Pearce then again told me he would knock my b - y brains out; I said there was no occasion for that - I thought they were about to rob, and I several times desired them to go away; Pearce then made at me, to hit me, and struck at my head with his fist - my father-in-law, who had then come out, caught the blow; my mother-in-law then came out, and pulled me and my father-in-law into the shop, and shut the batch - she had also told them several times to go away; Mansfield had before that made a blow at my father-in-law, while he was outside, and my father was on the threshold of the door - neither my father nor I had offered to strike either of them; but after the prisoner had made the blow at me my father took up a piece of an iron bedstead inside the passage, and in his own defence struck at them, but he did not hit them, the passage being so low it caught the ceiling; Pearce then took a long shut knife from his pocket, opened it, and made a blow at my head with it - I put my hand up; it just missed my head, and cut my little finger, it was a cut about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170033"/>an inch long, and nearly to the bone; it was not a stab, it was an over-handed cut - my mother's doctor saw my finger, and dressed it the next day; the prisoner only made one cut - the blade of the knife did not touch my head; I felt it brush my hair, and if my hand had not been there it would no doubt have cut my head - when the prisoner drew his knife, Mansfield drew his knife also, and made a blow at my mother; they then went away, and as they were going, Pearce said, "You b - rs, we will serve you Portuguese fashion;" I saw no more of them till they were at the station.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am sure I must not be in my senses to strike a man innecent - it is not my country fashion to draw a knife.</p>

(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>London, 12th of March, 1830, No, 47, Lower Thomes Street.</p>
               <p>To Mr. COHU, Guernsey. - Dear Sir, I still wait the return of the 50l. bill; I have not heard from Thomas and Son - I intended to have sent you to-day a statement of account, by which you would have seen how we stand, but I have left so little time I have not time to write; I have been a good deal mortifield by a call from Mr. Hall's clerk, by a letter from you - the anxiety under which it seems to have been written, they could not fail to understand - the emotion I felt at the time I endeavoured to conceal; confide your interest to me, you will never be betrayed. [Then followed an account of goods.] I am in advance now: these heavy bills cause me great uneasiness - I have been obliged to take Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person427">Freeman</persName>
            's acceptance for his supplies, which I enclose you; this young man is sole owner of the Edward, 150 tons - of course there can be no doubt; it is also to be proved by the Custom-house register - he is a particularly honorable young man, and the bill is unquestionable, but not being payable at a banker's, I could not well discount it here; it is at three months' date; for the pipe of wine I took of him I am to allow him 40l. - I shall ship it for you, per Mary- you had better draw on me for the amount, and remit the proceeds to me: get the enclosed bill on Freeman cashed, and remit the proceeds, to enable me to meet the bills coming due.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. In what business was the prisoner your agent? A. For the sale of biscuit and flour; he allowed me to draw on him, and I have done it repeatedly - he was not my agent for the purpose of getting bills discounted; I was at Guernsey in December, 1829, and March, 1830 - (thirteen letters and documents were here handed to the witness, who deposed that those marked A to G inclusive, and one marked with a (*) were written by his authority, by a person in his employ, and those marked H to O were his own hand-writing.) I have known Mr. Freeman since I came to England, but not before; I do not know his handwriting - I came to England the beginning of February this year; the prisoner has frequently accepted bills for me - I believe he has accepted some accommodation bills but am not positive, for we did not balance accounts till the 28th of June, 1830, and I did not know how we stood.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you received acceptances from him in blank, and filled them up at your own discretion? A. Yes, once, I believe, and it was only one bill, I believe; I do not think I have had more than one blank acceptance - it accommodated me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170035"/>Q. Did you fill up one of those blank acceptances for 500l.? A.Perhaps I might, but not more than one, to the best of my recollection; I cannot recollect the amount- I acknowledge to have filled up blanks; I cannot tell whether it was one or more. I am a native of Gnernsey.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say "blanks?" A. I do not understand English well - I may have filled up more than one.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. To what amount may you have had transactions with the prisoner? A. About 1400l. -I recollect filling up one blank, and think that was the latter end of 1829; I cannot tell to what amount I had then had dealings with him - he continued to be my agent till I received this bill; he received no more goods from me after that, but he had goods in hand for sale - he had written to say he could not get my price for them - I was in London in June, 1830, and we settled accounts - (looking at an account) this is in Chalmers' hand-writing; this was made out after I had received the bill of exchange - I discounted the bill he sent to me, it was in Mr. Hutchinson's hands - he did not discount it for me; I took it up before this account was made out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the settlement of accounts, by which it appears the prisoner owed you 60l., was made after you had taken up this bill? A. Yes - I arrested the prisoner for debt on the 29th of February last; I arrested him as the drawer of the bill of 131l. 18s. - I had seen Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person428">Freeman</persName>
             then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before that talked to Chalmers of your intention to arrest Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person429">Freeman</persName>
            ? A. I had not seen Chalmers, to the best of my recollection - not before I arrested him.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you applied to him concerning giving evidence against Freeman, the acceptor of the bill? A. I had by letter; I must have known in January that Captain Freeman was in England.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you applied to the prisoner to be a witness on Freeman's bill? A. Not to be a witness.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see the prisoner's wife on this business? A. Not at all; I wrote her two notes after I arrested the prisoner - I was waiting in the public-house in Mansel-street, close to where Mrs. Chalmers lived; I also wrote to Mr. Vie on the subject; I called on him on the day I made the deposition at the Mansion-house about this forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did Chalmers arrest you? A. Yes, for 50l. and upwards - I brought forward the charge of forgery before he arrested me; Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person430">Freeman</persName>
             had made a charge - I appeared at the Mansion-house, and preferred a charge of forgery against him on the 2nd of March; I was there more than once - I cannot recollect when I signed my deposition; this is my deposition (looking at it) - it is dated the 22nd of March; I think I was arrested at the prisoner's suit on the 6th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Both actions are still going on? A.Nothing has been done since; here is a memorandum in my own handwriting - it is an abstract of the correspondence; this pencil memorandum is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is it true, as you have written here, that you arrested Chalmers on the 29th of February? A. The 26th of February, I believe; I was arrested on the 6th of March - when I stated my intention to appear at the Mansion-house the prisoner said he would surrender himself, and did so, and I stated the case; that was after he had arrested me - he appeared at the Mansion-house, and the Lord Mayor allowed bail.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The Lord Mayor committed him, I believe, on the charge of forgery? A. Yes - he afterwards got bail before one of the Judges; Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person431">Freeman</persName>
             had not returned from abroad at the time I settled accounts with the prisoner, and I had no means of knowing whether the acceptance was genuine or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Let us have this clear - had the prisoner arrested you before you took him to the Mansion-house? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said he did? A. Yes, sir, yes; I appeared at the Mansion-house on the 2nd of March - the prisoner was not there then; I was arrested on the 6th of March; I made no deposition on the 2nd of March, but on the 22nd he appeared at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Sixteen days before you made your deposition against him, he arrested you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WHITEMAN FREEMAN. I am captain and owner of the Edward Lombe. About the middle of February, 1830, the prisoner supplied me with biscuits - he supplied me as a principal; I knew nothing about the agency - I left on the 10th of March; (looking at the bill) this acceptance is not my hand-writing, nor did I authorize any body to sign it for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You purchased biscuits? A.Biscuits and flour, to the amount of 111l., I think; we had a written agreement, which my attorney has - this is the agreement on one side of this paper (looking at it), and the other is the bill; I was going to the Swan River - the agreement is my writing, but it is signed by Chalmers; I paid for all the provisions, except 24l., which was left unpaid when I sailed - I paid other tradesmen part of their bills, and they were willing to wait for the remainder till my return; I wanted money to trade with - the prisoner took a pipe of wine at 50l. in part payment, as the agreement states; that was my inducement to purchase of him; I believe he tasted the wine before he signed the agreement - I gave him the choice of four or five pipes, which were in the London-docks, in bond; he stated which he would take, and I gave him an order, to transfer it to him - he never complained to me of its not being worth half the money; he wanted me to take something off, as he could not sell it for what he agreed to give for it - (looking at a letter, dated the 9th of March) this is my writing; I have offered the 24l. to the prisoner, but he would not accept it - that was after he was in Newgate; the solicitor said it was proper, and requested me to go with him to Newgate, which I did; Mr. Cohu did not threaten to arrest me - a man, named Field, came and threatened to arrest me; I suppose he was Cohu's servant - he now fills the situation the prisoner formerly did; I did not see the bill in Field's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to swear Field never presented the bill to you, and you requested proceedings might not he taken against you? A. I did not request any thing of the kind - Field threatened to arrest me; I said, "You may do as you please, I will never pay a bill I have nothing to do with" - I had seen the bill before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you promised to remit the prisoner your balance from the Cape of Good Hope? A. I do not remember -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170036"/>it is eighteen months ago; I may have written him to that effect - when I got to sea I pasted all my bills and papers together; I never saw the prisoner after I left London -I was in London or at Gravesend on the 1st of March, 1830.</p>
               <p>Q. When applied to for payment of the bill, was not your observation, "I thought all my bills were paid?" A. I do not remember making that observation.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any knowledge, when you went out on the 10th of March, 1830, of any bill on you drawn by Chalmers for 131l. 18s.? A. I had not; I had given no such bill - it is not my hand-writing; I know two gentlemen named Alexander Lewis and William Way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go before the Lord Mayor once or twice? A. Twice; three weeks, perhaps, elapsed between the first and second time - I signed a deposition the first time that I went; this is my deposition; it is dated the 22nd of March - I do not remember signing any other; I read a paper the first time, and signed it; it was merely to state that was not my signature - the prisoner was present the second time that I was before the Lord Mayor, not the first; all I swore the first time was, that it was not my signature - I do not think the prisoner was there the first time, I am not sure; I do not know whether he attended voluntarily before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at it again; do you mean to say it is not in any respect like his writing? A. It is like it in some few respects, but in material parts it varies very much - the W and h are not joined; the t is not turned at the bottom, as he does; the formation of the W varies very much from his; he always turns his t's at the bottom, which I have seen - the name Freeman is very unlike his all the way through - the letter F is in some little respect like his, but the reeman is not at all- (looking at the letter marked 1.) this signature is in all respects like Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person434">Freeman</persName>
            's - I should say it was his; the t is turned here at the bottom, though it is not a regular circle - the two e's in this are very thick, in the other is open; the m is different; it is very thick in one, and very plain in the other - the shape of the letters are not similar.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the t in this letter turned as Captain Freeman generally turns his letters? A. Yes; it is not turned at all in the bill - I have seen him write a great many times.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the General Post-office, London. This letter has been put into the London Post-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Can you tell whether it was put in at the head office, or at any other? A. This was put in at the chief office - it was a paid letter put in after seven o'clock; at the chief office, I can tell that - (Bill read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen, I feel so oppressed with my present situation I cannot collect my thoughts to address you properly. This proceeding is sanctioned by law it is quite clear, but whether it be a speculation on the feelings of a warm hearted female, to procure the payment of a certain sum, or a just prosecution to satisfy offended laws, it will be for you to say when you hear certain documents and letters read to you - I shall not say a single word of reproach to the prosecutor; his letters will show what his proceedings have been. I supplied Captain Freeman with biscuits and flour about this time two years; there was an express agreement that he should pay me cash; the goods were sold at a very low cash price; he requested me to take a pipe of wine in part payment - I held out to him that I would, acting as agent for a person at Guernsey - I sold the goods at the price I did, on condition that I should receive cash; I told him clearly that my correspondent was a very needy man, and was drawing on me at very short dates, and nothing but cash would answer our purpose, but if it would accommodate him, I would take one pipe of wine; the goods were delivered on these terms; he pressed very much to have them on board, saying his passengers were harrassing him with having no provisions on board - I sent them; and in the mean time had no opportunity of seeing the wine - I had orders to taste it, but at the time there was a very severe snow storm - I applied to several brokers to taste the wine, but they said in that weather they could give no opinion of it; and when I did taste it, the best pipe the broker represented not worth 35l. - I stated this to Mr. Freeman, who said I could have my choice, and that the pipe No. 4 was certainly the best, but I found that the highest value it was stated at was 35l. - I got an order for the transfer, and found somebody had got it transferred to them, and were to have paid cash for it; I found what was left was not worth half the money; in the mean time I endeavoured to get money from him, as drafts were coming due on me every day; on one occasion I got 12l. 10s. out of him, that is all I ever got before he left London - he then said, "I have a great many small debts to pay, I know you will take no proceedings against me till I get to Plymouth - I have a good many passengers to take in there, and will remit you the money from Plymouth, and charge the wine at a fair price;" I agreed to take no proceedings- he sailed: week after week passed, and I heard nothing from him; I began to fear he would sail, as I had been served by captains before - I then looked at the account in a very different light, as it was to have been paid in cash down; I drew out in my mind what the account was between us, by the time he might return to this country from the Swan River, and for the enormous risk of the debt I added a fair per centage; it is usual in the East India trade to charge about 30 percent. - I made this addition, deducted what I had received, and setting the pipe of wine as a collateral security, I drew out a bill, which, in my own mind, is nothing more than an accommodation bill;" I drew for 130l. which I sent down to Plymouth, with a few hurried lines, saying, if he had not sent the money for the goods, to send the bill back accepted, as I wanted money;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170037"/>I addressed it, according to the best of my recollection, to Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person436">Freeman</persName>
            , at Plymouth; the bill came back to me in a few days accepted; as I understood by him, enclosed in an envelope, merely saying, "Enclosed you have the bill," with nothing but initials to it; I shall be able to prove the receipt of that letter, most luckily for me - I may call it the salvation of me; I can bring a person who saw me take the bill out of the letter, and the observation I made at the time - the prosecutor's evidence shows I did not endeavour to use the bill, as I remitted it to him; he immediately got it discounted for the purpose of remitting me a banker's bill for the amount, and did I apply that to my own purposes? No, in no shape whatever - he had at that time bills running on me for about 600l. more than the almost goods I had in my possession - they did not exceed 150l. and there were acceptances of mine out to about 800l. - he had clearly overdrawn me 600l.; two bills came due about the third week in March, which were endorsed to his brother for his accommodation - these he was particularly anxious about; they amounted to 146l. - the amount he remitted me for Freeman's bill I applied to the purpose of those bills, so that in no shape whatever did I derive any benefit from it. If it is attempted to be shown that subsequently I might have endeavoured to take advantage of this, I can prove I could have contemplated no such thing, for there were bills coming due about the end of March - so far from my wishing to inveigle him to send me more goods, he not having sent me money to take up bills, I returned them back to him; it will be seen by my letters, that I advised him to send goods to other persons and not to me at all. Wheatley and Chapman held his bills to the amount of 100l., and I wrote to him to send them goods to satisfy them - I wished to have no more of his goods in my possession; it will be seen by the correspondence that after that bill was due he continued drawing and begging me to accept, and he would be sure to send goods, which he completely failed to do - one point I wish to refer to is, that a person named Field has been an active agent in this business; Cohu became acquainted with him in his journey from Guernsey - he had been requested to look out for Freeman's arrival; now Field did call, and I expected him here as a witness on their part; Field did call at Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person437">Freeman</persName>
            's lodging, and said he called respecting this bill, stating the name, the sum, and what it was for; Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person438">Freeman</persName>
             then said he thought he had paid that bill, or some such observation, but he would see to it, and desired no proceedings might be taken in the meantime - Field says he called about ten days afterwards, and though he knew in whose hands the bill was, he had made no endeavour to see it, but said he should like to see the bill - he asked Field to go to the house where it was; they went as far as Bishopsgate church - Freeman then said, "I have an appointment, call at my lodgings in half an hour, and I will go with you," and when he called he had gone away in the meantime - on seeing Field he said,"I have seen the bill; do you know where Chalmers is?" Field said, "Yes, he is on the continent" - he said, "Do you know any thing of the transaction between us?" Field said No, and then Freeman said it was not his hand-writing; how the signature became attached to the bill I do not know - I will prove how it came into my possession; it is certainly strange that Mr. Freeman should let ten days go by without endeavouring to see the bill; it is not the character of seamen generally - one would have supposed, while he was sailing across the line, he had time to recollect what obligations he had to meet, and it is singular he should pretend to go with the man about the bill, and get rid of him in the manner he did -Again, Mr. Cohu, when he came to London, instead of calling on me in a gentlemanly kind of manner, he sent Field to state he would take proceedings - I appointed with Field that we should meet next day, the account should be arranged, and I would render him any assistance I could in recovering the amount due to him by Freeman; as to hostile proceedings against me I defied him in every way - I was ready to meet him like a man of honour; instead of keeping the appointment, at eight o'clock next morning I had the pleasure of receiving a sheriff's officer, with a writ; our appointment was at eleven - this object appeared to me to be that the arrest should take place in presence of my wife, (who, it was well known, was within five days of child-bearing,) and to obtain the money through her friends, or he could have arrested me just as well at the Angel, at Islington, where we were to have met - while I was waiting for bail Cohu and Field called at the lockup-house, and stated to the officer that they had the copy of an affidavit, which Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person439">Freeman</persName>
             was about to swear at the Mansion-house that day; their object, I presume, was that while my mind was irritated I might pay the bill- my father-in-law being out of town it was two days before I got bail; Cohu, well-knowing the condition of my wife, went there with Field to endeavour to gain entrance into her chamber, but was prevented by the nurse; he went to a public-house next door, and wrote two notes to convey to her mind that I was there on a charge of forgery - the object was to get her to write to her father to pay the bill; being foiled he wrote himself, but got no satisfaction - after I got out I called at Cohu's lodgings, having looked into the accounts, for I was so harrassed with his business that I declare for two years I did not know how affairs stood between us, whether I owed him money or he me - he had drawn on me to the extent of nearly 4000l. in one year, and the utmost amount of goods sold was not above 1100l. - his letter will show he was to allow me a per centage for all bills drawn previous to sending goods; I found I had omitted to charge the commission altogether, which, with payments made, instead of my owing him money, I found a balance considerably in my favour; I have shown the account to several intelligent people, who are satisfied that money is due to me; I called, and told him there was a balance of 50l. due to me, and that on condition of his giving me satisfaction for bonds I had given at the Custom-house for shipping his goods, I would immediately give him his accounts, and strike a balance; but with respect to the charge of forgery I would go to the Mansion-house and wait from twelve till two o'clock, if he chose to come forward - I did so, and three days after that, I arrested him - at least a fortnight after that the charge of forgery was again brought forward; I heard of their intention, called at the Mansion-house, and told Mr. Cope I was ready to meet any charge they had - I called again, and stated the same thing; they said the party had applied, but they had no warrant, and did not like to take a person without; they very soon appeared, the charge was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170038"/>gone into; I was afterwards bailed by Lord Tenterden, and surrendered here last Saturday: I have now given as distinct an account as I can of the transaction - I will now make a few observations on the character of the parties; there is such a thing in law, I believe, as presumptive evidence; the presumption in this case in certainly all the other way - it is quite clear I had no inducement to send him a forged bill - the whole nature of the transaction falsifies it completely; he was always on the obliged side; if you find me guilty, you must have arrived at the conclusion that I committed this act for the purpose of injuring myself, without benefit: when my father-in-law came to bail me, he in the most delicate manner said, "If you have any difficulty in showing how you received the bill, let me take it up at once, and have no more about it;" but I felt I was innocent of the charge, and would brave it - the prosecutor is a man I have done more for than any man in the world.</p>

               <p>The following letters and documents, as referred to in the evidence, were then read.</p>
               <p>(I.) Plymouth, March 9, 1830.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - It is with the greatest regret that I am compelled to inform you that in consequence of three cabin and one steerage passenger, who had engaged a passage (from this place to Swan River in my ship), having broken their engagements, I have been disappointed in receiving near 200l., and am therefore not able to fulfil my engagement with you; I will remit the balance of your account from the Cape, with six months interest, and will take off 5l. from the price agreed for the wine; I hope you will give me the credit of wishing to do what I promised; if you know any one connected with any one here, you can refer to Mr. Pearce, my agent here, for the truth of what I have stated relative to the passengers. Hoping you will not think ill of me for this unforseen circumstance, and promising that on a future voyage, I shall make a point of returning your civility. I am, Dear Sir, yours, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The agreement referred to contained particulars of the biscuits and floor to be supplied, making a total of 100l. 2s., at the foot of which was the following memorandum, "The above to he paid for as follows: by pipe of Madeira wine 50l., the remainder to be paid in cash on delivery.

Sir, I have received news of the cargo of corn that I have ordered from Dantzic; by the next post, I shall have the invoice; in consequence, I propose to draw on you, according to my proposal some time ago to you, with your kind grant, though advising me to be cautious, which I am most certainly; so that I shall not value on you for more than about 500l. sterling, payable at about two or near three months, when the corn comes down; so that if you have not received goods from me, to meet these bills, let me know, that we may so arrange it as to meet those bills in due time. Sir, if the bills you receive from purchasers would not be due in time to meet the necessary bills, if you have them discounted, I have no objection to give you full satisfaction for that - so that you may rest assured of finding me a faithful friend.

I am come from Guernsey for the purpose of settling this most unpleasant business, but which, I declare again, must be soon settled, otherwise the consequences will be very serious.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not see him at the Bell till four o'clock on Thursday morning? A. No; I have been engaged in six or eight smuggling ventures - I began about three years ago, but have been in gaol thirteen months of that time for smuggling; I have never been with a company; I was never a tub carrier.</p>
               <p>Q. The company carry bats or sticks to carry the tubs with? A. Yes; a bat is a stick - the company are quite a different party to what is called the protecting party, who carry arms; the company only carry the goods, and have no fire-arms; we were fired upon directly the boat struck on the beach - we had done nothing then; no shots were fired at us; the preventive men fired to give an alarm - they were about twenty yards from the beach; two shots were fired - we did not return them; three other preventive men came to protect the other two - the row had began then, as far as I can recollect; the armed men came down - there were no shots fired into our boat; the firing of the preventive men was to make an alarm - nobody was killed in our boat; a man was killed on the beach after they were on shore - he was one of our party; it is impossible for me to tell whether he was shot by the armed party or the preventive men; they were altogether in a crowd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170041"/>when the row began - he had been out of the boat about ten minutes when he was shot; we were out of the boat when we offered to give up the spirits.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you mean by the men being altogether while they were firing, were they in a crowd, all huddled together? A. Yes, they were all bustling about; one man was wounded, and one killed; it was one boatman, and one of the company - I gave evidence before the Justice about this; the prisoner was not present - I do not know the Magistrate's name: it was at the Custom-house - I was sworn yesterday - I was not sworn at the Custom-house, but at the office; I have heard of a reward of 500l. on convictions of this kind, and have seen a reward of 1000l. where death takes place - I have been on board the Stort revenue-cruiser since this transaction - she is in the employ of the Customs; I have been there as a prisoner, by order of the captain: I did not expect to be tried - I do not know what I was kept for - I never asked; I asked for liberty, and was told as soon as an order came I should have liberty - I am a prisoner now: I think my liberty depends very much on my giving evidence here.</p>

            . In February last I was chief officer commanding at Camber. On the 1st of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was on the full of the beach, near Rose cottage, and observed an alarm-pistol fired; I immediately said to my men, "Come on my boys," and proceeded to the spot; we went down the beach, and perceived a boat full of water, and a number of tubs laying along the beach - I saw a number of persons on my left; they appeared to rise, as if they had been laying down, and when all had risen there appeared about one hundred of them: I presented my pistol, and said, "If you advance I will fire;" a discharge of fire-arms then took place - I returned the fire, and fell; I was wounded; the discharge came from under the full of the beach - I could not see the body of men from whom it came; I had been out from nine o'clock - this was the first firing that I had seen; I laid on the beach till I was taken up - I fell from the loss of blood, and on recovering turned to my men, to know why they did not fire; I then observed a man approach me with a large stick, in a position as if he was going to strike me; I was trying to raise myself, and when I saw him about to strike, I drew my pistol from my left breast, and fired at him; I saw no more of him - I suppose what that man had was a bat, but it was the only one I saw that night; a bat is generally a hop-pole, cut to about seven feet long, what we should call a bludgeon; I fired once afterwards, and a man came and took me up - five shots were extracted from my body, and I am now quite disabled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You saw the alarm-pistol fired, what was the object of that? A. To acquaint the force on the beach that goods were about to be landed - I only saw one pistol fired; that was eastward, I was westward of the boat; the object was to bring all our force down to the spot - our station is on the sea side of the full of the beach, if the tide allows of it; we can assemble six or eight men by firing a pistol - our watch-house is not quite in the centre of the station; it is near Rye harbour - we have a principal station and a detached one; the men can come sometimes much quicker than at others - I cannot tell how many came up, as I was shot almost directly; they came from east and west.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether the firing came from the preventive men coming to assist you, you cannot tell? A. Yes, as I lay on the beach I saw one man loading a duck-gun - that was after I was shot; whether my shot took effect I cannot tell - that man never struck me at all.</p>

On Wednesday the 1st of February I was in the service of the Coast guard, stationed at Camber; at twelve o'clock at night a boat came on shore - there were some persons on the beach at the time; I was three hundred or four hundred yards off, but saw them after I went to where the boat was; there might be about one hundred - some were facing east and some west, and the rest were making a line between them and the tubs; they were carrying something in the open space - I never saw tubs carried with bats; I have heard they do so - the men forming the lines had guns in their hands; I saw ten or twelve guns - I heard firing, and received a shot in both thighs, shortly after the boat came in - when they were coming our people fired an alarm, and then the smuggling party fired, and shot me in both things; I do not know the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Could you distinguish the smugglers from the preventive men? A. Yes, because they sang out to me to keep off, and as I would not they shot me directly; I could see our party; they were not then huddled with the smugglers - there had been a good many shots fired before that; some smugglers carry tubs on sticks or poles, and some on their shoulders - I was not near enough to see how they carried these.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q.Did the smugglers and the preventive party continue separate? A. I did not see our party; they were eastward, and I was west with four or five others - they were on one side the smugglers, and I on the other; I was with another young man - the wound did not make me insensible; I remained on the ground about three-quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>HENRY BEST. I am a commission-boatman on the Coast guard service. I was on the Camber station on the 1st of February; I was on the beach a little before twelve o'clock with a man named Holtman - I saw a boat coming in rather to the west of us; I went up to her - when she struck the beach four or five men, who were in her, were washed overboard or jumped out; two swam eastward and two west - I saw tubs in the boat, and drove those men towards the boat again to prevent their landing; I fired a first and second pistol in the air for our men to come up, and the men who were with me fired one pistol - this was the first firing; I saw persons assemble on the beach - after I had drawn the men back they came right over the full of the beach; the full is much higher than below - there were about fifty persons - when I first saw them they were armed; five or six of them had muskets: after our alarm pistols were fired there was firing from the full of the beach, both east and west - Captain

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you fired the signals, was there any body that you saw about except the boatman? A. No; the other party were not in sight - I do not suppose they could see for what purpose I fired; I was one of the first who went up to the boat -I went within three yards of it; Holtman was with me -I did not hear the men offer to give up the tubs; I heard nothing of the kind - there was a heavy sea running; I suppose about fifty men were carrying tubs away on their backs; I never saw them carry them on poles - I have been about five months in the service; I saw some of them with sticks, but what for I cannot tell; I do not know that I saw the prisoner there.</p>

            . I am a labourer at Rye. Some days before the 1st of February, I was applied to to get about thirty men, which I undertook; I do not know that it was said what they were wanted for; on the 1st of February the person asked if I would go and get those men, and order them to be at Gold's-hill-bridge by seven o'clock that evening; I went and told them to go, and every man appeared according to his time - the same person met them at the bridge; I went with them from there to a barn at Smith's farm - that is not near the coast; we were ordered to stop there till a man came to take us to where we were to go; we found some more people there - the man came and took us down to where the goods were run at the Camber station, within a few rods of the spot; we were ordered to lay down at some distance before we got to the coast, in the next place to the full - the full being between us and the sea - we laid there; I should think there were sixty or seventy of us; some laid down and some walked about - the full is higher than a man's head in some places; we laid there about an hour - and about half-past eleven o'clock I heard the report of a pistol or something; we were then ordered to go forward to the full to get the goods - there was more firing before we got there, and when we got to the full, there was a great deal of firing - a great many of us retreated; there were people behind us to keep us from going away, persuading us not to retreat - I knew the prisoner very well before that - I saw him that night two or three fields from the full; I saw him at the first place we stopped at; he had a bat in his hand - I did not see him on the full; there were other people with bats - the prisoner was with the men with bats, and took part in keeping the men from running away without the goods; he did nothing else - he kept his bat before them, and persuaded them not to go away without the goods; I did not see him strike any one - the firing ceased a little then; one George Booth said, "They won't hurt you, for the firing comes from our own people;" the company were not then so much afraid, and went on to the sea side - this was the labourers - I saw more than six men with guns; a great many tubs were carried away - there were a great many on the beach, and some floating in the water; the men took them up, slung them on their backs, and carried them away; the armed men fired, and kept the preventive men off, else they would have hindered them - after we delivered the tubs, the person who engaged me gave me an order to get refreshment at the Bell, at Iden, and we got it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I take it for granted you did not know there would be any blood shed on the occasion? A. No; I did not know there was to be any firing or arms; the prisoner had no fire-arms - he was one of those to prevent the men running away; I did not see him go over the full at all - if the company had known they were to be armed they would not have gone near them; I have lived in the neighbourhood fourteen years -I have only been lawfully married once; I was married against my will when I was nineteen - the woman ran away; I do not know whether she is dead or not; I have since married again - I have gone by my mother's name, which is White, as I did not wish the other woman to know where I was; I am a labourer - I have not been a smuggler further than labouring; I have done that about six times - they gave me the nick-name of Christian, and I have answered to it; I have been in the army, but was never taken as a deserter - I was in Battle prison for fourteen days, charged as a vagabond; I was charged once with poaching, and paid 5l. for it - I was not in prison for that - I have been in prison at other times for drunkenness; I have not been in prison for any thing else.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. Were the parish officers present at your marriage? A. Yes, they took me there; I had a family born before I was married.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BASHFORD. I am a labourer, and live at Brook-land, in Kent. I know Thomas Hyland, who lived at Iden; he came on the 1st of February to ask if I could get him a few people - I engaged ten; the prisoner was not one of them: I met him and another about half a mile before I got to the sea; they had long bats in their hands; I had not engaged the other men - I went to the sea-side, and saw some tubs brought away; the prisoner stood there to keep the company from going over the sheep-pen fence; I was there about a quarter of an hour; when the company left (Noakes was with them) they went towards the sea; we stopped in the full a little while - we went to the sea-side for about three-quarters of an hour; the last place I saw the prisoner at was at the full; he got in before the company, with the bat, to prevent them running back; the bat was seven or eight feet long, and thicker than my wrist - I got some tubs, and carried them a little way over the full, but not far, as I got wounded in the knee, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170043"/>went into the blue sheep-house, where people get shelter in wet weather.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where have you come from? A. From the prison; I was taken on the 27th of March, charged as one of the party; Piles was another; I was taken before a Magistrate, at Bow-street, on the 28th, and carried to prison; nobody appeared against me there; I was taken to Bow-street again on the 6th of April - they asked if I knew any of the people: I was produced as a witness, I suppose -I was asked by a man in prison if I would split; he did not tell me of reward; I have heard of such a thing, but did not know whether it was right or wrong - I saw no paper about it, and do not expect any part of it; I have done this to get my liberty, and to save being tried myself - I would not have gone if I had thought there was to be any firing; the company had no notion of it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FARMER. I am a bricklayer, and live at Iden. I was at the Bell on the 1st of February, or within a day or two of that - I cannot say the day; I remember about four o'clock in the morning, after I had been at the Bell, hearing some persons going by my house - I looked through my window to see who it was, in consequence of what I heard at the Bell; I suppose thirty or forty men were going by towards the Bell - it was too dark for me to see if they had any thing; I was at the Bell again two or three evenings after this, and saw the prisoner there - the landlord told him they kept coming for their allowance, and he did not know who should have it, and who should not; that John Stonham had been - Noakes said he was to have his allowance, for he went down and got his tubs like a man; about the 22nd of March I saw the prisoner again - there was a conversation about one another being afraid of being taken, and he said he himself had the biggest right to be afraid, for he called the fire-arm men, and went down with them and brought away a pair of tubs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the landlord here? A. I have not seen him; I know of nothing to prevent his coming - I gave information of this conversation, on Friday last, at the Custom-house, and told a gentleman of it about a month afterwards; my reason for for doing so was, that this running of goods is getting to too big a pitch, and I thought it ought to be stopped - that was my chief reason; that and the fire-arms is my only reason - I have seen a reward stuck up; I do not know how much it is, as I cannot read - there were three rewards, but I cannot tell what they were; one was 200l., I think - I remember one of 1000l.; I heard this before I went to the Custom-house - I cannot say whether it was before I told the gentleman of this; I had 3l. given me to pay my expences up here, by the officer of the Customs at Rye; I have received perhaps 10l. at different times -I cannot say what it was for; if gentlemen give me money, I receive it - I will not swear he has not given me 15l. or 20l.; I swear it was not 30l. - I received 1l. or 2l. at a time; I have agreed for nothing - I expect my passage to be paid back, and no doubt they will give me a trifle.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Is all the money you received, on account of taking up this man? A. No, not all, I had given information about some goods.</p>

               <p>CHARLES RICH. I bought that black horse about ten o'clock on the morning of the 18th of May, of Godwin.</p>
               <p>JAMES FARREN. I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 18th of May, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner go up to Beck's black horse; he took hold of it, and drove it away - he was with Godwin; they drove it away together; but the prisoner being in the neighbourhood, and having seen him working in the garden a few days before, I thought Beck had sold it to Godwin, and had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STAPLES. On the 18th of May, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the two horses go by; one was black and the other roan - one man was behind them, and the other by the side; I cannot be positive whether the prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WHITE. I was going up Barrow-lane, and met the prisoner and another following Mr. Beck's horse down; they were about one hundred and fifty yards from where I had seen Farren - I am certain of the prisoner, as I knew him before; he lived at Turnham-green - I had no suspicion of him, supposing the other had bought the horse of Beck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How far were you from me? A. Not five yards - I asked if you had seen my pony; you said it was down the lane, and I found it there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is not feasible I should steal a horse where the people knew me so well.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any one but him and his companions near enough to have cut it? A.Several were passing; a gentleman came out of a house, and crossed over - I cannot say whether he was near enough - another person passed between the prisoner and the lady soon after: when I laid hold of the prisoner he said nothing - I went to the lady, and saw her reticule had been cut; she claimed the handkerchief - the prisoner was then in custody; his companions went away.</p>
               <p>JAMES ADAMSON. I am one of the City patrol. Moore gave the prisoner into my charge - I had not seen him before - I have Miss George's handkerchief; she claimed it -I do not know who gave it to me in the confusion; I searched the prisoner, and found this knife in his pocket - it has a buck-born handle.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH SMITH GEORGE. This is my reticule. I was walking with two ladies; it was entire then, and had a handkerchief in it - I afterwards saw the handkerchief and reticule before the Magistrate.</p>

I was working in their warehouse on the 12th of April; Richard Baker was with me - this wire was deposited in the first floor back room; the prisoner worked on that floor, four or five yards from the room - property has been missed at different times; Baker called me out about four o'clock that afternoon: I saw the prisoner coming down Miles-lane, from the premises - there is a cistern in the room he worked in; we followed him to Princes-street, by the Bank - I then went and asked where he was going; he seemed confused, and said, "Going, going? I am going home;" I said he had something which did not belong to him, and told him to go on with it to where he was going - he went a little way, and then said, "Do you think I have any thing belonging to you?" I said, "I think you have"- I collared him, put my hand in his bosom, and pulled out two pieces of wire, which weighed about 4 lb.; I felt that he had got more, and I said, "You have more - go and take it to where you were going with it;" he would not go on - I said, "If you don't I shall take you to the Mansion-house;" Baker came up, and said, "You scoundrell, you have been robbing Mr. Curtis to a great extent,"- he then said it was the first time; the property was not mine, it was Mr. Matthews', but I have some property on the premises; three parcels of wire were found on him - it was wet; Mr. Matthews and I went to the the cistern in the room where the prisoner worked, and found part of a ring of wire there, corresponding with what he had about him, and about 35 lbs. of copper; the cistern was not the proper place to deposit it - there were 3 cwt. or 4 cwt. of the same kind of wire in that room.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BAKER. I live in Newcastle-court, Strand. I and Curtis followed the prisoner from the premises in Miles'-lane; I saw the wire taken from the cistern - it corresponds with that taken from the prisoner, which was wet.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BARRETT. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody; I found three bundles of wire in his hat, and three about his person; Curtis gave me two.</p>

On the 7th of April I was at home, with another servant; there came a double knock at the door about half-past twelve o'clock - I went, and saw the two prisoners, who were strangers; Goodman asked if Mr. Thrupp was at home; I said No - he then asked if Mrs. Thrupp was; I said No; he asked if it would be long before they returned - I said in half an hour or an hour; Barnard said,"You had better leave your name;" they both came into the hall, and asked me to lend them a pen and ink; I fetched one from the front parlour, leaving them in the hall; then Goodman asked me for a piece of paper - I brought the paper, and they went into the dining-room; I said, "Write it here at the side-board" - Goodman then wrote "Mr. White," and they went away; master came home soon after, and what he said caused me to look, and I missed the three spoons from the dining-room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did you hear your master say that he had had money from the prisoners? A. No; he has got the spoons back - he has got back all that he lost; I had not seen Goodman before - I do not know how soon I saw him afterwards.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.How long altogether were they with you? A. Not more than five minutes - I am sure of them both.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever said you were sure of Barnard, but not of Goodman? A. No; I took the spoons to Queen-square, but the prosecutor had them in his possession before that, for he threatened us with an action of trover, and we applied to the Magistrate about it - these are the same spoons.</p>
               <p>JAMES McCARTHY (Police-constable T 115). I took the prisoner on the 16th of April.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did your master go before the Magistrate? A.Not in my presence; he did not attend to prosecute this case; I swear that I do not know that he has received from the prisoners any money; I have not heard him say he would not prosecute; I know the spoons by the crest and the initials - I have been there eight years.</p>

On the 11th of February the prisoner came, about three o'clock in the afternoon, to look at my apartments; my servant showed him up stairs - he said he wanted them for a lady and gentleman, and said he should come again in the evening, or on Monday morning; I had to let a sitting-room and two bed-rooms - I went out in the evening, and in the meantime the prisoner came again; I returned at twenty minutes before nine, and then my watch was gone, which I had seen safe at eight o'clock, in the back room; I am sure he is the person - the watch has not been found.</p>

I was at home when the prisoner first came, and am sure he is the person; he came again in the evening when my mistress was out, and asked if she was at home - I said No; he then asked if I would allow him to look at the bed-rooms, to see if there was a cupboard in them - I said there was; I went up to the room with him - he then asked me to let him sit down till my mistress came home, which he did; I went down, leaving a young lady in the room with him - in about ten minutes he sent her down for a glass of water, and as she was going up again she met the prisoner on the stairs, and he went out - he had left a card with me, with the name of Mr. Clint on it.</p>

            , Esq., Earl of Belfast. I left his service on the 12th of March last - the prisoner succeeded me in that capacity; I gave him an inventory of the various articles which had been in my care, and among the rest was twenty-one papers, containing 6 lbs. each of wax candles; on the 17th of April Lord Belfast sent for me - the prisoner had then left his service; I looked at the inventory, and upon calculating the consumption of the house, a great number of candles were missing - I found a bill of some tallow candles and some soap had from Mr. Tucker; I went there, and found some wax candles, which I believe were what I had left at Lord Belfast's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How long afterwards did you go to Mr. Tucker's? A. I think on the Thursday following, which was two days after the prisoner had left.</p>
               <p>HENRY GOODEVE. I am porter to Mr. Tucker, a tallow-chandler, in South Molton-street. In consequence of some directions which I received from Pavey, I went to Lord Belfast's on the 17th of April; I saw a bricklayer, and asked for the butler - the prisoner came to the door - he asked what I came for; I said from Mr. Tucker's for the wax-ends - he went towards the door, and asked if I would have a pint of beer; I made no answer - he said, "Don't be a d-d fool, have a pint," which I did - he then went back; I went with him - we went to the steward's room, and he pulled open two drawers, and said"These are the wax-ends;" I saw they were entire candles - we put them into the basket, and I took them to Mr. Tucker - there were 34 lbs. of them; I delivered them to Pavey, and said I thought it was not all right - he said he thought so too; on the Thursday following I was ordered to take them back again to Lord Belfast's, and Clements the officer took them; they were the same candles - they had not been moved from the basket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. At what time did you come for them? A. A little before ten o'clock in the morning; I did not go to another door before I saw you; you did not say that you supposed I should have been more cautions, nor did I say I fetched as good candles from other houses.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PAVEY. I am shopman to Mr. Tucker. On the 9th of April I bought 8 lbs. of wax-ends of the prisoner for 10s. 8d., and on the 17th I sent the porter to Lord Belfast's, on seeing the entry in the order book, but I did not make the order, and do not know who gave it; the porter brought me back 34 lbs. of candles, and said he did not think it was all right - I was of the same opinion, and put the candles aside; they were given to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I saw this man in the shop while I was making the bargain with John Tucker to send for them the next day.</p>
               <p>JOHN TUCKER. I am not master of the shop, but I live there. On the 16th of April the prisoner came and desired me to send to Lord Belfast's the next morning - he asked if I could send at nine o'clock; I said I would inquire, which I did of the man below, and entered the order in the book; I saw the basket when it was brought- we agreed that the candles should not be touched, as they were not wax-ends.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA FREDERICK CLEMENTS. I am a Police-constable. I received the candles on the 19th, and took the prisoner on the Monday; while I was taking him to Marlborough-street office he said he took the candles to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170048"/>sell, to pay a little bill he owed to an under butler, and if I went to a house in Clarence-garden, I should find some pieces which he had broken off the first candles he had sold; I went there, and found them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BODEY. I am under butler to Lord Belfast. The prisoner was house steward; I used to receive one pair of candles a day from him, but no more.</p>
               <p>LORD BELFAST. The prisoner was my house steward; I certainly never allowed whole candles to be sold by any of my servants.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you obtain from him information of what he had taken, in consequence of your offering to forgive him? A. I made the proposition to him, but he would not tell me of any - I found a great number of things; I knew I was robbed, and I had some of my men searched; I considered the prisoner rather as a check upon them - I have no doubt but that he is reclaimable.</p>

On the evening of the 25th of April I went for a coach to Oxford-street - I shut the door after me when I went out; on my return I got off the coach-box, and met the prisoner just coming out of the street-door, with my master's cloak in a bag - I took him; I had been gone about ten minutes; he said a gentleman had sent him with the bag for my master's cloak - I took him by the collar, and gave him to the Police-officer; this cloak is my master's, but not the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did he not say that a gentleman named Penny had sent him. and given him 1s.? A. No; he said a gentleman in Bond-street sent him, but he did not mention his name, nor produce the 1s.; he was about six inches from the door - this is my master's boat cloak, and it hung in the hall; there are two female servants in the house.</p>

I was on duty, and saw the prisoner when he was brought to the station-house - I had left the station about six o'clock in the morning, and returned at ten; I then received information that the prosecutor had been robbed of his watch and money - I went to the station-house window, from whence I could watch the prisoner's lodging; I saw him and his mother go to the private door of his lodging together, about eleven o'clock - his mother opened the door with a key, and they went in; I went and knocked at the door - the mother opened it; I asked where the man was; I went into the passage, and caught the prisoner, at the corner of the stairs - I told him he was my prisoner, on suspicion of robbing a man of a watch and some money; I took him to the station-house nearly opposite, and searched him - I found on him a knife, a pen, and a card, with three powders, which the prosecutor identified; I asked him if he recollected showing a Policeman some money in the street; he said he did not, but if he did it was his own - he was then drunk; I found on him 13s. 8 1/2d.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GWILLIAM. I know this knife by the handle, and a little bit being broken off the point - I can swear to this pen; I had three 5l. notes and one sovereign - one was a Shrewsbury and Ludlow note.</p>

On the night of the 30th of April I left my shop to fetch some beer; I saw the prisoner and another in Bryanstone-square - I had known him from infancy; he asked how I did - I was in the public-house about two minutes; on my return, my wife told me the shoes were lost - the prisoner was described to me; I went to his mother's - she came with him to my shop; my wife gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>SOPHIA CHAMBERLAIN. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 30th of April my husband went out, and I heard some voices near the shop; I saw the prisoner put his hand into the shop door, and take three shoes from the window - he put them under his coat, and went down the street as fast as he could; I could not follow him, as I had a child in my arms - I am sure he took them; it was one pair and an odd shoe.</p>

             (Police-constable, D. 131.) I was on duty in Cumberland-street. I took the prisoner - he said he knew nothing about the shoes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, denying that he had taken the shoes, and stating that hearing he was accused, he went to the shop to clear himself.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAMBERLAIN. He said so at the time I charged him with it; the shoes have never been found -I cannot tell who was with him.</p>

            . I was with the prisoner all that evening; he came to me at eight o'clock, when he left work; he said, "Will you take a walk?" we went to Crawford-street - it was then ten minutes past eight o'clock; he said to me, "There are two young fellows down Bryanstone-square, and they will have a pair of shoes;" I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170052"/>said, "Never mind them, let us go on;" he then met the prosecutor, and spoke to him - I was with him till eleven o'clock, when he was taken; I can swear I saw the two persons near the shop, and one of them is James Baldwin - he has confessed he took the shoes; I spoke to an officer about it, but he said it was no use to take his own evidence.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAMBERLAIN re-examined. Q. What time did your wife tell you this? A.About nine o'clock, and I saw the prisoner about half-past eleven; this witness was then with him, but I cannot say whether he was with him at first.</p>

             re-examined. Q. It was an observation of the prisoner's that those persons would take the shoes? A. Yes, and I remained in the prisoner's company; he had no opportunity of taking them - we gave ourselves up, because his mother said that Mr. Chamberlain had been accusing William of taking three shoes; we went down together, and the prosecutor's wife said it was him - I said I would go too, and they said there was no occasion for that, as the man who was with him had a hat and a coat on, and it was not me, unless I had been home, and pulled a hat and a coat off.</p>

On the 26th of April six men came to play at skittles in my yard; I believe the prisoners were three of them, but I will not swear to them - I had two chests of carpenter's tools in my ground; they stood one on the other, and the top one was locked - in the course of the afternoon there was a complaint that the tool-chest had been broken open, and I went and found it so; the men whom I had seen at the skittle-ground had an adze and some other coopers' tools.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Brown's service as charwoman on the 26th of April. I recollect some men coming to the house, and going to the skittle-ground; all the prisoners were among them - they called for a pot of porter, and played at skittles; there was a door shut, but I do not know by whom - I had never seen it shut before; I have heard it is more handy for throwing the skittleball when it was open; two of the men went away about half-past twelve o'clock, but neither of the prisoners - it was not till after they were all gone that I heard of the chest being broken open; no other person had an opportunity of doing it but those I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I suppose your master has a tolerable good custom? A. Not so many; I was the only servant - I carried the porter to them; I had not seen the prisoners before, but I am sure they were there; I am confident no other persons came there while they were at play; I believe it rained, and the wind was rather high - I missed the saws not more than two minutes after they were all gone; I had seen them safe three days before; I do not know who had been there in that interval.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BROWN. I had seen the chests safe at nine o'clock in the morning, and no other person had been there till these men came to play at skittles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How near were the chests to the door? A.Close to it: and they threw the skittle-ball past the door; I have had some conversation with Holdway; I did not tell him to say that he saw the prisoners open the chest - I said, if he did not tell the same story as he did before the Magistrate, I should consider him as bad as them; I did not say, I would get a fresh indictment, and charge him in it - he did not ask me what he was to say, nor did I reply, "All you have to say is, that you saw them break the chest."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had he said before, that he saw them break the chest? A. He certainly had.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOLDWAY. I have known the three prisoners two or three seasons at the West India-docks; Stone applied to me to have a game at skittles; I saw the other prisoners in the ground; there were five persons there beside myself; I was stooping down, and on turning I saw Stone striking at the chest with a chequered adze - I saw an old hinge between the lid and the chest, which caused an opening, through which any one could introduce their hand; I said, "Come, come, let's have no larking here, leave other people's things alone;" we played one game more, and another pot of beer was brought, which we drank nearly out; Simkin, who was there, then said, "I am going," and I went with him - we went away, leaving the three prisoners and another man there.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH ALLEN (Police-constable K 62). On the 27th of April I went to the West India-docks, and took Atkinson and Stone; I afterwards took Kett, at his father's, in the Willow-walk; they all admitted they had been at the skittle-ground, but said they knew nothing of the articles.</p>

               <p>JOHN GREEN (Police-constable H 120). I was in George-street between two and three o'clock in the morning, on the 17th of April; I heard the alarm, and went into the room - I got a light, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner with his left hand - he charged her with robbing him of 2l.; I took her to the station; I found nothing on her; I went back to the house, and found 1s. on the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told you there was a shilling on the mantel-piece, and it was all I had. Witness. No, you did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor gave me the 1s., which the officer found; he said it was all he had - I said I would not stay with him for that; he then called Watch! and gave charge of me - he had given me a glass of gin at the night-house; I saw no other money nor purse - he said he had been served so two or three times, and he called Watch!</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOUGHTON. I was not five minutes with her, and was making my way out - I did not give her the 1s., nor any gin; I did not mean to pass the night with her; I wanted a private lodging - I live at Gravesend; I know London very well, but did not know the streets exactly - I am sure there was a light when I went to the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN GREEN. There was no light there - there was a candle and candlestick; I got a light at Kate-street; there was a very poor bed in the room - I do not think any person could be in the room while there was a light, without the prosecutor seeing them - there was only one door to the room, but that was open; there was a cupboard with two shelves in it - it was on the second floor; the prosecutor was sober.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Richardson - Moss called my attention to the boots being lost on the 19th of April, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, and I stopped the prisoner in the passage of a pawnbroker's shop - he put these boots down in the passage, and asked if his sister had been there.</p>

The prisoner came into our service on the 25th of February, and left on the 17th of April; she left her box, which was searched by Bradshaw in my presence on Good Friday, and five cambric handkerchiefs were found in it, which are mine - I think the box was locked; it was brought into the parlour by the other <rs id="t18320517-63-deflabel366" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know of her box having been searched before that? A. Yes, and none of my articles were found then; she was not going away - she had given me warning before, but afterwards expressed a wish to stay; we had a dispute about her not rising early enough in the morning; she said if I was not satisfied with her I had better get another person - she had left the key of her box with the other servant; I do not know her motive for leaving it; I made no use of the key - I did not have it in my possession at all; the box had been searched, and some other things found before that - the officer then took the key from the prisoner and searched the box, but not very minutely - on the second search a handkerchief was found in a pair of stockings, and the other handkerchiefs rolled up in different things; the prisoner had only a week's wages due to her when she absconded - I had no opportunity of paying her; the other servant is my cook - she is not here: the officer searched her box the first time as long as I directed him; my husband is not here - I suppose he is at his office; he is an artist and a publisher of architectural designs; he knows of this prosecution - I do not know whether he knows I am here as a witness; I saw him this morning, but did not breakfast with him; I do not know what might have occurred between the prisoner and the cook.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the box was searched twice? A. Yes; on the 17th I discovered I had been robbed, and on the 18th her box was searched; I found some things in it, but not these articles - she then sent for her box, and it was about to be delivered up by the cook, but a lady, who was with me, suggested that it should be searched again, and in the interim the prisoner had gone and the key was left with the cook; on the second search these handkerchiefs were found - I had had no quarrel with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BRADSHAW. I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner at Battle-bridge - she came to the door, and I said, "Do you know what I take you for?" she said, "I know nothing about the silk, the other things I found among the rubbish;" I went to Mrs. King's, and the handkerchiefs were found rolled up in articles of dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was the prisoner present? A. No, she was at the station - the cook was present; I did not go to search for property in the box, but, as the prisoner, was in custody to see what belonged to her, and take charge of it - I was not there at the first search.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never put them into my box.</p>

On Friday, the 11th of February, I went out about half-past six o'clock, returned between twelve and one, and found my house broken open and this gun gone, which I had left over the mantel-piece; there were footmarks on the window - I found it the same day, nearly a mile from the house, covered over with sod, and a handkerchief tied round the lock to keep it dry; I do not know the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q.What bundle? A. The child was in a bundle; I said, "Oh, cook, Oh, cook, you have hanged the baby;" she said, "Hush, hush, Mrs. Simmons, you will hang me- I shall be hanged; shut the door, and keep it secret from master;" Mr. Jones, the doctor, was in the house at this time, and he came into the room, looked at the bundle and the baby, and perceived a piece of tape round its neck - he took it away from its neck, and threw it by the window; Thomas, the inspector, has it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Had you seen a good deal of the prisoner? A. I am generally there on Saturdays, and when they are without a servant; she was mild, well behaved, kind, and good-natured - the child was wrapped in the prisoner's own night-gown and black apron; they appeared to be wrapped round the child - night-gowns have strings at the neck; she was agitated - she came down stairs into the kitchen for three quarters of an hour, after she delivered herself; there is no Mrs. Rhodes.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH EMMERSON. I have been housemaid to Mr. Rhodes, for three months, and have known the prisoner during that time - I slept in the same bed with her, and did so on the Thursday night. I got up about nine o'clock on Friday morning - she was in bed then; I had heard nothing particular in the night - she came down to breakfast, and I saw her up stairs about half-past one o'clock; she requested me to retire to the kitchen to my business, as she was very poorly with a bad head-ache - we were then up stairs in the room joining the bed-room; I went down stairs in about half an hour, went up again in five or ten minutes, alone, and saw her there; Simmons came up - we went into the prisoner's bed-room, and saw her apparently sitting on the pot; I saw stains of blood about her clothes; I asked what was the matter - she said Nothing, and requested us to leave the room, which we did - I requested Rhodes to send for a doctor, but before he came, I saw her - Simmons assisted to undress her, and the dirt in the room was cleared away - Mr. Thompson came into the room; the pot was shown to him in the next room - after he went away, we suspected all was not right, and requested her to open her box, which she refused - I left the room - I was called immediately after, and went up -I saw a bundle laying on the floor; I saw it opened by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170056"/>Jones - it contained a baby - I do not think it had been opened before I went in - the prisoner desired me not to make a noise, to let Mr. Rhodes know it - I saw Mr. Jones uncover the baby, and take a piece of tape off some part of its body; I cannot say what part - he placed the tape on the floor - I left the room, and saw nothing more; I cannot say whether the prisoner is single or married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was she a kind, well-conducted woman, and very humane? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES THOMPSON. I am assistant to Mr. Jones, surgeon, of the Strand. I went to Mr. Rhodes' between three and four o'clock, and saw the prisoner in bed - I asked her what was the matter; she said she felt a violent pain in her stomach, but was better then - I inquired the cause of the pain; she said she had not been periodically unwell for two months before, but was then relieved, was much better, and thought she should get up; I left the room - one of the servants came out, and showed me the pot, which had a quantity of cloths, and blood on it; I went back to the prisoner alone, and asked if she had been with child; she denied it - I left, and did not see her again.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JONES. I am a surgeon. On the 13th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Rhodes', No. 4, Fountain-court, Strand, and saw the prisoner laying on the bed - she said she was a great deal better than she had been, and had been down stairs, but feeling fatigued, she came up again; I left her, and was beckoned into the next room by the servants, who showed me the pot - it contained a quantity of blood, cloths, and water; I was then confident there must be a child, and recommended them to search the room: when I went into the room again there was a child laying on the floor - the bundle was untied, and the child laying on it, when I entered - I found a piece of tape laying on the child, some-where about the body; the child appeared to have been born some hours; it was not quite cold then - I noticed a mark round the neck, and left the further examination of it till next day, when I examined it with Dr. Lee and Mr. Beavan, about noon, and under this mark I found extravasated blood in the cellular membrane, under the skin - the child was well formed in every respect; its lungs fully inflated with air; in fact it had every appearance of having been born alive - of having breathed; there was a bruise on the back of the head, which I consider most probably occasioned by a fall; I do not remember any thing else which struck me, except that the after birth was unusually small.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not before the Coroner express yourself not quite so strong, and say you were inclined to think it was born alive? A. I most likely said so; the naval string was unusually short and small - it was not separated till I cut it; the impression on my mind is that the mark round the neck could not be caused by the navalstring - the mark was much smaller than I consider the naval string would have made; the tongue protruded from the mouth, and the left side of the face appeared more puffed than the other, and drawn up; the vessels of the brain were filled with blood, and there was a spot of extravasated blood on the left side of the brain; every thing induced me to think death had been caused by strangulation; I attended the prisoner afterwards, but had no conversation with her about this - previous to the dissection, when I mentioned to her the mark round the neck, she told me she could in no way account for it; the mark on the head might be caused by a pressure at the birth - the tape was a string of the night-gown: somebody applied it to the neck of the child - it appeared to correspond with the mark on the neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it within your knowledge, that a child may be strangled by natural causes in the progress of its birth? A. It frequently happens; that would be more likely when a woman delivered herself - I should think it often happens that they have an absence of intellect at the moment of delivery; it is frequently the case in deliveries that the head may protrude, and the child breathe, and yet death happen before the delivery is complete; the circumstance of the lungs floating in water, is an unsafe criterion to ascertain if a child has been born alive; I cannot say this child was wholly born alive - I think if the tape had been applied to the neck immediately after death, it would leave a mark, while the blood was warm - if it had been put round the neck, or had been round the gown, before the blood had ceased to flow, I think the appearances might have been the same; we tried the lungs, and they were perfectly inflated - there were no appearances on the brain corresponding with the bruise on the skin; no bone could be fractured in so young a child, it would give way; I always provide myself with thread to tie the naval string - I think it probable if the child was strangled in its birth, that the tongue would protrude - it is very difficult to come to any conclusion further than that the child had breathed - it must have breathed several times, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Dr. Lee and and Mr. Breamer, a surgeon, confirmed the evidence of the last witness, that it was not possible to decide whether the child had been completely born alive.</p>

             THOMAS. I am superintendent of Covent-garden division of the Police. I accompanied Mr. Jones the surgeon, to Mr. Rhodes' house, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - I saw the prisoner in bed; the child was enclosed in a night-gown and black apron; the night-gown was next the body - Mr. Jones pointed out to me a discoloured mark round the child's neck, close to the jaw, and handed me a small string which was discoloured with blood; in fact it was saturated through - here it is; I then examined more particularly the wrappers, and found the collar of the bed-gown had only one string on it, but there was a fragment on the opposite corner of the collar, which showed that a string had been torn away, or broken - the string appeared to agree with the fragment, as well as the state of it would allow; I turned to the prisoner, and asked how she accounted for the death of the child - she said, "I don't know any think about it; I cannot tell; I have not done it;" I asked if she had made any provision of clothing for the child; she said, no, she had not, for she had no money to purchase any thing - I asked if any one knew of her situation - she said she had never acquainted any one but the father of the child - she had informed him some months ago; that he was a long way in the country, and she would never say who he was; she subsquently told me his name was Harris or Harrison, and that he had lately married; she was inclined to say more - I said she had better not - I placed her in custody, and she had every care taken of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170057"/>Cross-examined. Q. Did you state before the Coroner that she said she had lately got married? A. I am not certain - I think I did, but I am sure she stated so; she appeared in an exhausted state, which was my reason for not entering into further conversation - I went to see her daily while she was confined to her room, and I found on my first visit she had entirely forgotten all that had passed at our first interview - she subsequently appeared unconscious of what had passed before; she said Harris had promised her marriage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the state of mind I was in, I was unconscious of what I said or did.</p>
               <p>MARY ARNOLD. I live in Herberts-passage, Beaufort-buildings. About three weeks before this occured, the prisoner desired me to purchase her a piece of diaper to make napkins of; she afterwards asked if I had purchased it - I said I had not; a piece makes a dozen napkins - she desired that my daughter should make them for her.</p>

            . I am in the employ of George White, of Fenchurch-street, a tea-broker. On the 23rd of April I had to clear twenty-one chests of tea from the East India warehouse in Jewry-street and Fenchurch-street; I was called into the yard of the warehouse in <placeName id="t18320517-66-crimeloc384">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Was any body in the cart with him when he drove from the yard? A. The officer got on the cart just as it was going out of the yard, but he was advised not to go with it, and got down; we never intended that he should take the tea away; I was acting as clerk to Mr. White, Mr. Richardson's broker - there were four of us watching the cart; he did not drive the direct way to the New inn - the north side of St. Paul's Church-yard was open, that is an unusual way for carts to go down; he evidently took off his hat to give a signal - he lifted it gradually off his head, and put it down again three times; I was behind the cart, and cannot say whether any body noticed it; these six chests were a distinct lot from others which I had to clear - I examined them with my warrant in the yard; nobody could have cleared them without my master's authority.</p>
               <p>JAMES MILWOOD. I am a labourer to the East India Company The prisoner brought me a regular list of the numbers of these six chests for me to deliver; I looked them out for him: Mr. Moul's name being on the list, and knowing it was not his writing, I went over to Mr. White's, and then returned to the warehouse; the prisoner had a horse and cart - Moul came, and said the chests belonged to Mr. Richardson; he ordered us to put them into the cart, and said he would follow it to the New inn, as the prisoner had a piece of paper with a direction to the New Inn; we followed him there to see if we could see the person who employed him, but could not see any body take notice of him; he was then charged with having stolen them, and said he was employed by a tall gentleman dressed in black, who gave him the list, told him to come to the warehouse for the cases, and bring them to him - he said he did not know who they were for - he was dressed as a carman; nobody came for the tea, and we kept him in custody; Pearson claimed the cart, and another person the horse afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you he could neither read nor write? A. I did not ask him - he said he knew nothing that was in the paper; he showed me the direction where he was to drive to in the first instance - I looked the goods out for him, and said, "Who are they for?" he said he did not know; I asked how he came by the order - he said he was employed by an old gentleman dressed in black in the Old Bailey, who gave him the papers, told him to go to the East India warehouse, and they would deliver the chests to him, and he was to bring them to the New-inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you this long before he was in custody? A. Yes, and we detained him till Moul came; we should not have put the tea into the cart without Moul's order, as we detected it - Moul said he meant to watch him, and find out who was the party who employed him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL RICHARDSON. I am a <rs id="t18320517-66-viclabel385" type="occupation">tea-dealer</rs>

We cleared twenty-one chests of tea on the 23rd of April; Moul did the business for White, our broker - we had provided our waggon to convey them to our warehouse in Upper Thames-street; I know nothing of the prisoner, and did not employ Pearson's cart: the tea was worth 105l.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MOUL. I saw the tea after the prisoner was taken, and am certain it was part of what White was employed to clear; the numbers and marks are on the warrant - one empty chest is here; these papers are not my hand-writing - I do not know whose it is.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DEVEY. I apprehended the prisoner, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170058"/>found six chests of tea in the cart; Moul claimed them, and they were delivered to Mr. Richardson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did any thing pass about the list? A. I received it from the yardsman, and have it here, with the direction; he told me it was delivered to him by a tall gentleman in black at the end of Fleet-lane, Old Bailey - that he knew nothing farther than that the gentleman told him to get them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it, more than that the gentleman gave me the direction, and said I was to take them to the New inn; when I got there I looked into the coffee-room and all about the yard, but could not find him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner pleaded poverty.</p>

This copper was safely fixed in my cellar floor on the 9th of April, at night, and about seven o'clock next evening a gentleman gave me information - I found it was gone; I found it in the officer's possession next morning, and saw it fitted to the place - my door is kept shut, but opens by a drop latch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.What sort of a copper was it? A. It had a particular roughness on the edge.</p>
               <p>JAMES GLIBBERY. I am a Policeman. On the 10th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I apprehended the prisoner in the Old Bailey, with this copper, wrapped in green baize; I asked what he had got there - he said, a copper, which some man had given him to carry, and he was to meet the man in Goswell-street; I took him to the Compter, and then he said he did not know where he was carrying it to, nor where he got it - I found out Woodbridge, and compared the copper at her place; it fitted the brickwork exactly - I am convinced it came from there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was walking along - I suppose? A. Yes; I suspected him from his manner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HERITAGE. I am an assistant-clerk at Worship-street. On the 10th of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing the prosecutrix's shop; I observed the prisoner, with another man, come out of the private door - the prisoner had something on his shoulder in green baize; the other shut the door very quietly, which caused my suspicion, as he crossed, and the prisoner kept on the same side - I followed them to the Old Bailey, and gave Glibbery information; the prisoner said a man, who he met in the street, gave him 6d. to carry it: I said I had seen him bring it out of a house; he said he had not been in any house.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BODY. I lodge at the prosecutrix's - I have used this copper for eight years; I am positive of it - I heard no noise in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there more lodgers? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was accosted by a man in Fleet-lane, who asked me to carry the copper to Percival-street, to a Mr. Wright - I showed the Policeman the man, who stood at the corner of the court for three minutes, and then walked away.</p>

               <p>ANN SIMMONDS. I am the wife of John Simmonds. My daughter, Elizabeth Ann Simmonds, had a necklace on on the 16th of April, and was playing at the next door to my house, in <placeName id="t18320517-77-crimeloc449">Devonshire-street, New North-road</placeName>

               <p>JOSEPH WARE. I am the son of William Ware, of Dean-street. On the 16th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was standing opposite Devonshire-street; the two prisoners ran past me, and Brown gave something to Parton - I ran after them, and saw Brown taken at the top of the bridge; I saw a white ball in his hand while he was running, but it was not that which he gave to Parton - he had that when he was taken.</p>
               <p>DAVID GORDAN. I am servant at the Robin Hood and Little John. About noon, on the 16th of April, I was at Bridport-place, about fifty yards from Devonshire-street; I took Brown to the station-house - I saw some beads afterwards picked up in a garden in Hyde-place.</p>
               <p>PHILIP REGNARD. I live with my father in Bridport-place. On the 16th of April I was in the North-road; Mrs. Simmonds came out of Devonshire-street, and said some boys had stolen her child's necklace - I saw the two prisoners running, and Parton ran by the garden wall, where the beads were found; as he ran close by the wall I saw him take the beads from under his jacket, and throw them over; I took them up.</p>
               <p>JAMES MILLER (Police-serjeant N 8). I took the prisoner into custody; I found this ball in Brown's hand, and received these beads from Regnard - I had known Parton before; he at first denied this, but afterwards said he did it for want.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH ANN SIMMONDS. I am six years old. I was by my mother's door; Brown came and gave me some chalk, and then snatched my necklace - Parton was with him, and they ran off together; I told my mother - this is my necklace.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I had nothing to do with it.</p>

I went to Mr. Turrill's, in Oxford-street, on the 5th of April; I saw Williams there - I told him Mr. Turrill had been robbed, and asked him to step up stairs; I then asked him to get his duplicates, if he had any about him - he said he would fetch them; he went up stairs - I followed, and he gave me a pocket-book, containing several duplicates, amongst which was one for a dressing-case, pawned for 1l. 15s., and one for five pencil-cases, pawed for 10s.; he said he intended to have restored them again, and he did not think there was any harm in taking them - I asked him if he knew a man named Rogers; he said he had not seen him for six months, but he afterwards admitted that he had seen him a few days before, and had drank with him; I then went with Clements to James-street, Lisson-grove - he brought from a house there some property, which Mr. Wright identified; I do not know what Rogers is - in consequence of what Williams said I found four prayer-books, which were pawned at Mr. Dobree's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. You desired Williams to produce the duplicates, and he did? A. Yes; he made no attempt to prevent my seeing them.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK CLEMENTS. I am a Police-officer. I took Rogers at the Cape of Good Hope, in Titchfield-street, on the 5th of April; I said he would have to give an account of a robbery at Mr. Turrill's - he said he could not, for he knew nothing about it; I asked where he lived - he would not tell me for some time, but at the office he said it was at a coal-shed in Great James-street, Lisson-grove; I went there with Goddard and Wright - a key which I took from Rogers opened a box which I found there; I found in the box this Bible, wafer-seal, three sticks of sealing-wax, and other things; I took them to the office, and asked Rogers how he accounted for the possession of them - he said he had received them from Williams; I went the same evening with Mr. Wright, to Jewin-street, and after waiting several hours, I apprehended Evans - I asked him if he knew a person named Turrill's; he said he did - I asked if he was in the habit of going to that shop frequently; he said he was - I asked if he had ever pawned any thing for Williams; he said he had, and after some hesitation he recollected himself, and said he had pawned a dressing-case for 35s. - that he took out a waistcoat at the same time, and took the remainder of the 35s. to Williams.</p>

I went out with him, as he describes - I locked my room door, and had the key in my hand; we returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - it was then nearly twelve o'clock at night; as I was going up stairs I saw our room door open, and some of the articles in the passage and on the stairs - Britton had parted with us nearly a quarter of an hour before.</p>
               <p>ANN RYAN. I lodge in George-street, in the two pair back-room. Mary Bryan came to me between one and two o'clock that night; I was in bed - she lives in that house - she knocked me up, and asked me if I would allow her to leave her husband's coat till the morning, for fear he should pawn it, which I did; she came in the morning, and had it away - I did not take particular notice of it; to the best of my knowledge it was a blue coat; it was not this coat; there was a coat shown to me at the office, but they did not ask me any questions about it - I never said, "This is the coat;" they never asked me; a paper was read over to me, and I marked it - I attended to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them read, "Between one and two o'clock this morning I was in bed, when she (the prisoner) knocked at the room; I let her in - she then said, "Mrs. Ryan, I am sorry to disturb you, will you allow me to let this coat (the coat produced) remain in your room;' I said Yes, and she left the coat; and this morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I gave her the coat again?" A. She asked me to let her leave her husband's coat; the coat was not shown to me at the office.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENNETT. I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in Belton-street; a young man spoke to me - I went to the house, and found some articles on the stairs; I desired the young man to go into his own apartment, and I waited; the prosecutor and his wife then came home - they spoke to me on the stairs, and then went up; I found their room broken open - I told them to go into their room, and put out their light; I then heard them open their window - I went out, and made a sign for them to put it down; I then waited a few minutes, and Britton, the prisoner, came, and went into the prosecutor's room - I went up, and took him; the prosecutor was rather intoxicated, and he threw it in Britton's teeth that he had been transported before - Ryan, the witness, has been tampered with - I have had a great deal of trouble with her; it was near five o'clock on Tuesday last before we could find her - these are the things which I found on the stairs.</p>

             (Police-constable E 130). Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, on the 23rd of April, I received information from Ryan's husband that a coat had been left there; I went and took Bryan there, and demanded the stolen property; she said she had no coat but the one that was under the staircase, outside the kitchen stairs - I found this coat there, with a great stone on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you know that there are eight or nine lodgers in the house? A. I know there are a number of them - I did not make any further search; she told me she had found this coat in the passage - I was in the kitchen when she told me this; Ryan and her husband live there - I took Bryan's husband, but he was discharged.(Proprly produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You heard no conversation between the two prisoners? A. No; I do not think there were more than ten prisoners in the street - there had been an alarm, and that induced me to look into the street - they both ran off.</p>

               <p>Baxter's Defence. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and ran to see what was the matter - I saw a person running ahead, and called Stop thief! I saw Wilson in custody - I walked up, stood about five minutes, and I was taken.</p>

The prosecutor called to me; I went up - he said he had lost his watch; he was in liquor, but seemed to know what he was about; he described the prisoners, and I took them at the Two Brewers, in Whitecross-street, in company together, and one of them, (I cannot say which,) threw this watch under the settle - I took it up.</p>
               <p>Johnson. Q.Were there not other persons there? A. Yes; two men and one woman, but it was one of you two who threw it down.</p>
               <p>Brown. He swears false; if he saw it thrown he must have seen who threw it - the prosecutor came to the sign of the Frying Pan, and gave us drink there.</p>

               <p>RICHARD MUGGERIDGE. I saw the prisoner going into the chapel; I soon afterwards heard an alarm - I was present when the money was found; I found a box of turpentine in his pocket - he said he was brought up to the medical profession, and had a brother a minister in Ireland.</p>

            . I am a reporter. On the 19th of April, about two o'clock, I was passing the Strand - I saw the prosecutrix before me, and on coming nearly opposite No. 48, I saw the prisoner and some other person push against her; I then saw a green purse, or cardcase under the prisoner's feet, which he was trying to conceal - I pointed him out, and he was taken; I went after the lady, and told her of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he was searched at the station-house? A. Yes - I cannot say what was found on him, but nothing that the lady could identify: he was within five or six yards of the spot where the robbery was committed; I had come from Charles-street, and had followed the lady down the Strand; after the robbery I run after her; for perhaps, one hundred yards - there was nothing found on the prisoner to cut the reticule with.</p>

I searched the prisoner's boxes on the Monday morning - I found in one this towel, this apron, and one yard and a half of ribbon; and in another, two books, a pair of shoes, and a key, which opened a chest of drawers in her mistress' room - there was a dress and some other articles in pledge, which the pawnbrokers have given up.</p>

I was playing with the baby in the shop, on the 10th of May, and saw the prisoner come and take two books up - he put them in his coat, buttoned it, and got three yards from the shop with them; I called after him - he brought them back, threw them down on the stall, and went off; I ran after him, and a butcher stopped him; he struck the butcher, and a Policeman came and took him; these are the books - I thought he had some more books, as he had a bag with him; when the Policeman took him he struck me in the face.</p>

               <p>BARTHOLOMEW SCANDLAN. I am a patrol of Castle Baynard ward. On the morning of the 10th of May I saw Mr. Dobbs' counting-house; the window was broken in, and I saw some glass laying on the ground; I saw a light, and heard a whispering - I looked through the shutters, and saw two men turning the papers over, and throwing them on the ground; I went for assistance, and the watchman came - I opened the shutters, and jumped in at the window - I took one of the prisoners by the collar, and put him out at the window to the watchman; I looked for the other - he hid himself for some time, and then got out of the window - I found on Jones a towel, some steel pens, some halfpence, a stick of Sealing-wax, and two or three keys; all the lower part of the sash was broken, and this instrument was standing against the window; I believe the shutters had been forced by this - the door was fast.</p>

               <p>Jones. Q. Did not I come up the wharf when one of your people struck us? A. No, he jumped out of the window while we were looking for him, and began to beat the watchman who had charge of White, whom I had put out of the window.</p>
               <p>DANIEL MONAHAN. I am a watchman. I went to the counting-house, and White was taken under the desk - Jones was looked for, but he got out of the window;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170069"/>there was no other way of getting in but by the window; the place was secure in all other respects.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MOORE. I am a watchman. I took charge of White when he was put out of the window by Scandlan and in a very few minutes Jones was coming out of the window, and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL WILSON. I was constable of the night. I saw the things which were found on Jones - these are them.</p>

               <p>Jones' Defence. I and this young man were drinking on the over night till past two o'clock in the morning - we were locked out, and went down a wharf to go on board a barge; we heard a rattle spring, and went up: the watchman met us, and struck this man on the head -I struck the watchman again, and Scandlan put these things into my hat, which he picked up from the wharf; he has often said he would do for me.</p>

               <p>THOMAS TIPPER (Police-constable T 152). On the 15th of May I was in the parish of St. Dunstan, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner near St. Dunstan's church, with two others - they went behind a gentleman; the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and drew out a handkerchief - the gentleman went on; he was not aware of it; I secured the prisoner, and he dropped the handkerchief from under his coat - a gentleman took it up, and gave it me; I went after the gentleman who had lost it, and informed him of it - he said it was his handkerchief; I told him to come to the Compter - he said he would attend next morning, but I did not see him again - the persons who were with the prisoner were behind him to conceal him, and I had seen them in conversation with him.</p>

               <p>Homer. I bought it - it is a jacket, not a coat. Witness. I had seen them not ten minutes before I took them, and I know they had not time to buy it of any body.</p>
               <p>Welch. I said he told me he had bought it, but I did not see him, Witness. Welch said Homer bought it on the other side of the bridge for 1s. 4d. - it was dirty weather, but the coat was clean.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MORTIMER. This is my coat, and handkerchief that was in the coat pocket - I cannot say when it was taken; I had unloaded in Bishopsgate-street, and just as I got on the bridge I know my coat was safe - I did not miss it till I got home.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHAMBERS. I am an officer.

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. I placed three reams and a half of paper in the shop on the 27th of April. On the morning of the 28th of April, Webb the prisoner, came in, and asked for a sheet of paper - I served him, and while I did that another man, whom I cannot recollect, came in; he produced one of Arnold's stone ink-bottles, and I supplied him with some ink, which I poured into his bottle - I saw such a bottle in the officer's custody; when the two men were gone an officer came in, and produced to me a ream of paper, which had a number and weight marked on it, similar to one of the reams which had been in the shop, and it was the same make; it was not opened - I did not miss a ream from the shop; I called the man up - my name is signed to this deposition.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is Webb the man who came into the shop? A. I am not sure of him, and the other man I do not know at all - I continued in the shop till the officer came; I did not see any thing taken, nor did I miss any property - I do not know, of my own knowledge, whether this paper was safe when they came in; they came about half-past nine o'clock.</p>

I am journeyman to the prosecutor, I laid out three reams and a half of paper in his shop, and when the officer brought in one ream I missed one of them - I have no doubt this is one of those I laid out; it has the same marks, the same date and officer's name, and is the same progressive number within two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where had it been? A.Almost opposite the door inside the shop - I believe the lad was in the shop; I had left him there - here is the stamp on the paper, and the number of the mill; each mill has a different number - the progressive number on this is 2857, and the next we have is 2860; the other two might have been sold perhaps.</p>

            . I am ward-beadle of Queenhithe. -On the morning of the 28th of April I saw the three prisoners at the bottom of Bread-street-hill, about fifty yards from the prosecutor's - one of them had a bag, which appeared at that time empty; they moved off towards the prosecutor's premises; I saw Benson, the ward-beadle, coming up the hill - I called his attention to the circumstance; I remained at the hill, and saw Webb and Davis running up the hill again as fast as they could; I think this was not five minutes after I had seen the three together - I followed them up the hill and brought them back to the Horse and Dossiter - I there found the other officer with Wenman, the bag, and this paper; it was then about half-past nine o'clock - I had seen them looking about in company for nearly a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they not in custody at nine o'clock? A. No; I was not out at nine - I do not know which of them had the bag, but I can swear to their persons; I was about four houses from them, and was watching them.</p>

I saw the three prisoners together; they were pointed out to me by Smith, at the corner of Bread-street-hill; I followed them, and saw the bag transferred from Davis to Wenman, who turned up Five Foot-lane, and bade the others good bye, and they left him - this was about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's; I followed Wenman up Five Foot-lane, and asked where he was going; he said to his master - I asked where he lived; he hesitated; I then asked what was in the bag; he hesitated, and I said, "You must know;" I then took him.</p>

On the 1st of March I left town for the Northern circuit, and took Smith, my upper servant, with me, leaving the prisoner behind - there was no other man servant; Miss Rivers, my sister-in-law, who generally resides with me, remained in London during my absence, till about ten days before the circuit was over; she joined me at Wakefield, in Yorkshire, on the 31st of March, and to supply her place, Mrs. Alexander, another relative, came to town; I returned to town with Miss Rivers and Smith, on the 8th of April - I had left a dressing-case in my house; it originally stood on a chest of drawers in my bed-room - it was formerly my mother's, and came to my wife at her death; I had not opened it since the 10th of November last - it then contained the articles stated in the indictment, as usual; I saw it every day; the value of all the articles would be 45l. or 50l., besides which there was from 40l. to 50l. in money - one of the quarter-guineas was remarkable, it being bent; there were several foreign coins - one of the Emperor of Austria, and another small gold coin among others; here is a forty franc piece of the Emperor Francis, and a quarter-guinea of 
               <persName id="t18320517-112-person980">George</persName>
             the Third; it is crooked.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you certain that quarter-guinea was in the box when you left town? A. I saw it there on the 10th of November, because I went over the whole of the pieces in the box; I locked the box up - the upper part has a Bramah's lock; I then locked up the drawer underneath, and put the keys into this in key-box - there is a lower drawer in the dressing-box, intended for ladies' jewellery; that has a separate lock, with a double tumbler; the box was never used - this key-box was intended for a cash-box; I have for some years kept keys in it, and the key of that was always kept in my possession when in town, and was fastened to the key of my own dressing-case - I always had it about me; the keys of my wine-cellar, and a great many others, are kept in the tin box - on leaving town, I left the key of the key-box with Miss Rivers, to enable her to get wine in my absence; a few days after my return this forty franc and quarter-guinea were shown to me by Miss Rivers; I immediately knew them as part of the contents of the dressing-case, and immediately ordered it to be brought down into the library; I found both the upper and lower part locked - I got the key out of the key-box, opened the upper part, found the trays reversed, and the tooth instruments, which should be below, were above - on lifting up the tray, I saw all the boxes and silver tops were gone, also the gold; it was then late at night, and Smith was the only servant up; but the following morning I went to Bow-street, and on returning assembled my servants; I discovered marks on the outside of the box, as if attempts had been made by some instrument, to force it- here is the mark of a chisel and a very distinct mark further on; the edge of the drawer below is made almost ragged, where a chisel has run along; on opening it I found a piece of glass, broken off a bottle, as if an instrument had been put through and broken it - there were several pieces of loose glass; there are marks of some instrument having cut the velvet lining - I assembled the servants, pointed out to them that the dressing-case had been opened by its own key, for the lock had sustained no injury, that the key-box had been got at by a false key, and none but a domestic servant could have access to the box to make the marks, and not having succeeded it had been opened by a key; I said they need not feel alarmed, for if I could not find cause to suspect any one of them, I should not discharge them all, as was sometimes done; I should not discharge any of them - I had assembled the nurses, cook, and other servants, some of whom have lived with me fifteen years; I put the two pieces of coin into the prisoner's hand, and said, "Where did you find those?" he laid them down on a sheep skin mat at the entrance of the dinning-room, within the door-way - the wall is so thick that the door leaves a space, where the mat goes; he placed them in that space, as showing me where he had found them - it is a thick sheep skin mat, with the wool on it, and it is certain they could not have rolled there; one of them was crooked, and could not have rolled at all - I asked when he found them; he said, between twelve and one's o'clock on the Friday before I came to town (the 6th of April), and the moment he mentioned between twelve and one, a servant who was there said, "I told Joseph at the time that I had shaken the mat that morning, and they were not there then, and it was odd he should find them;" he made no observation at all - finding the gold had been discovered at that hour, I, or somebody, said, "Who had been there that morning?" and it was said by somebody, that the glaziers had been there - I stated to the prisoner the next day or the day after, that I was certain the key-box<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170072"/>had been opened, and the keys taken out - he side he was not aware that I kept keys in that box at all; I took up the box, shook it, and said, "You could not be ignorant of that - it is quite manifest that keys were in it;" it was impossible he should not know it, for I am quite certain he must have seen me frequently send for this box, and particularly if any wine was wanted; he must repeatedly have seen me open the box, and give the key to my son or servant; and I think I must sometimes have sent him to fetch me the key-box to the door of the wine-cellar - the key of the key-box now turns as if something was the matter with one of the wards, and there is a scratching about the key-hole; it generally stood in the library, sometimes in the dining-room - I observed the difficulty in turning the key about Christmas, I think - the top lock of the dressing-case is a Bramah lock, and requires to be pushed in in a particular way before the key is turned -I asked the prisoner to open that dressing-case, in my presence, and he opened it with perfect case, as if acquainted with it - as freely as if I had done it myself; I received a statement from Nunn, who came with his master, and after that went to Bow-street, and had the prisoner appreheaded - I received a brown paper parcel from Ann Saunders, the servant, which I opened in the prisoner's presence, by his permission, and found in it some promissory notes or securities for money, a lease, and a small pocket-book; and he stated that he had obtained that lease by lending a person, named Saunders, 15l., in sovereigns or half-sovereigns, on Saturday, the 10th but that the money was advanced out of part of his wages, which I had paid him before I left town, to the amount of ten guineas - I find that on the 3rd of February I paid him ten guineas - I did not wish to take him up on that, thinking he might have that amount to advance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I believe you received him from the service of Mr. Ferard, of Queen-square, Westminster? A. Yes; Smith acted as butler, and the prisoner attended when Smith was absent; he slept in the pantry - the small quantity of plate used during my absence, was under his care; my bed-room was not locked up - no external appearances on the box attracted my attention till after I had opened it; I was impatient to get it open, to ascertain what was gone - I am not aware that any masters attended my children during my absence but the French master - he is a gentleman of the highest respectability, who I have known for a number of years; the school-room is up two pairs of stairs - when I lived in Bedford-row Nunn's Master did some work for me, that was before Smith came into my employ; this is a lady's dressing-case, and was never used - Bramah's locks are now very common; the key-box has been brought to me over and over again to give the key of the wine-cellar; it was Smith's duty to attend me to the cellar, but I think Joseph has done so - I may have occasionally given Smith the key to open the key-box when in the library, while I sat in the dining-room, but more generally the box was brought to me; I found the key of the dressing-case in the key-box when I discovered the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your house is called Queen-square house? A. Some body has given it that name; Smith has been in the service of my family three or four years, and is still so; perhaps I ought to mention that I was at Blackheath at Christmas, and during that time the prisoner slept in the pantry - and during the conversation, when I asked what he knew of the dressing-case, he said he had carried it down into the pantry, and from the weight of it, and the care the housemaid took of it, he was aware it contained matters of value; that he took it down by desire of the housemaid, that it might be in the same custody as the plate-chest - at that time he had the sole and entire custody of this box for about a fortnight.</p>

            . I am sister-in-law to Mr. Pollock. When he left town I had the care of the family - he gave me the key of the key-box, and during his absence I went to it when wine was wanted, and if not, I usually gave the key to Mr. Pollock's son; I do not recollect that I ever gave it to the prisoner or to any of the servants - it was never my habit to do so; I went to meet Mr. Pollock before he returned, about the latter end of March; my sister, Mrs. Alexander, was then left in charge of the family - within a day or two after my return with Mr. Pollock, I was made acquanited with the discovery of two pieces of coin; I did not inform Mr. Pollock of it, as I took it for granted he had been informed - he came home from the House of Commons late one night, and I produced to him the coins, (a crooked quarter-guinea, and an Austrian coin,) which I received from Mrs. Alexander, with whom I had left the key of the key-box during my absence; when I left, I directed that the glaziers were not to come to clean the windows - I did not give these directions to the prisoner; the French master, and I think some other masters, which Mr. Pollock was not aware of, came to the hose during his absence - they were gentlemen, and attended in the school-room; that had nothing to do with Mr. Pollock's bed-room, which was on the first floor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe the bed-room door was not generally open? A. It was not locked - the windows are occasionally cleaned four times a year, but that rule was broken on occasions; they were generally cleaned during the circuit - I can almost positively swear I never gave the key of the key-box to any of the servants -I would not have given it to a female servant, and I should rather have gone myself than have given it to the man servant.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the tin box familiarly known among the servants as the key-box? A. It was.</p>
               <p>MRS. DOROTRY ALEXANDER. I am Mr. Pollock's sister-in-law, and live at Binfield - I came to town the latter end of March, to take care of his hose, in the absence of Miss Rivers. On the 27th of March she gave me the key of the key-box; Mr. Pollock returned on the 8th of April: I never trusted the key of the key-box to any body but Mr. Pollock's son, except on one occasion, when I believe I sent the key by the prisoner to Mr. Pollock's son, but I will not be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know it was the key of the key-box? A. I think on one occasion he came to ask me for the key of the key-box, for Mr. Pollock's son to get some wine for dinner; it was always called the key-box in the house - the prisoner gave these two coins to me on the Friday before Mr. Pollock returned; he said they had been found on the mat at the entrance of the dining-room door; it is a rough sheep-skin mat with the wool on it - they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170073"/>could not have dropped on any place and rolled on that mat, it was impossible; I do not exactly recollect who he said had found them - he said they had been found; I did not go to look at the place where he said they had been found; I kept them in my possession, and delivered them to Miss Rivers, with other things, on the Tuesday morning, when I left town - I had mentioned the circumstance to her on the Sunday, but said nothing to Mr. Pollock; I mentioned it to several persons, hoping to find an owner - I did not know they had been in Mr. Pollock's possession; when the prisoner brought them to me I said,"Let us try and remember who has been here, and is' likely to have dropped them;" he reminded me that Mr. Pollock's son had brought a young friend home to lunch with him - first one and then another named different persons who had been; nothing was said at that time about the glaziers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever seen the key given to Smith? A. I may, but then the key-box was always in the room - I think I have seen the key-box on the sideboard, and the key given to Smith, who opened it in Mr. Pollock's presence; and I have known Smith fetch the box from the library to Mr. Pollock.</p>
               <p>MR. ADLPHUS. Q. When you have seen the box opened, was the prisoner waiting at table, so that he could see what was in it? A. Most probably.</p>

On Thursday, the 5th of April. the prisoner came into the kitchen, and asked if any body was going out - I said I was; he said," Will you call at the glazir's, and ask him to come to-morrow to clean the windows;" I said I would - I went, and Milford came on Friday, the 6th, to clean the windows with

            . I am in Mr. Pollock's service. On Friday, the 6th of April, I was cleaning the dining-room wainscot - the prisoner was there, laying the things for the nursery dinner; when he first came into the room he brought me two pieces of coin in his hand, and told me he had picked them up - they were the colour of gold; I asked where he picked them up; he said he would show me - I went outside the dining-room door, and he laid them down on the mat - there was a distance between them; he took them up again and went down stairs -Mrs. Alexander was at this time in care of the house; the prisoner told me that evening that he had asked Mrs. Alexander if it was her coin, and then said he had asked Master Robert and George (master's two sons), and it did not belong to them - next morning he said he thought it was odd nobody owned them; I said, "Did you ask the glaziers?" he said No - I said, "You had better ask them, as they might have drawn them out of their pockets with their window-cloths; he said he would - I remember all the servants being questioned afterwards in master's presence; I said I had taken the mat up on the Friday morning on which Joseph showed me the coin - I had taken it up at seven o'clock that morning - I turned it to sweep there; I did not particularly shake it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by turning? A. I took it up, and moved it a good distance from its place; I am not positive whether it was on Thursday or Friday that I did it.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. He made not secret of it? A. No - he said the servants' hall was public, and that at times he was called away in a hurry, and left his drawers unlocked.</p>

On Friday, the 6th of April, I and Milford went to clean Mr. Pollock's windows; I saw the prisoner and Ann Brooker there - Brooker said Miss Rivers had given orders that the windows were not to be cleaned; the prisoner said, as we were come we should clean the principal ones, and mentioned Mr. Pollock's dressing-room or bed-room, I do not know which he called it - we cleaned three dining-room ones, then went to breakfast, and on returning brought the machine, and fixed it in the library window; a person came into the library, and ordered us to the blue room windows - I do not recollect who it was; we went there, and then to Mrs. Pollock's bed or dressing-room, and after that back to the library; after cleaning the hall window, I asked the prisoner if we should clean the fanlight - he said No, he would rub that himself, as it would make a mess; we had occasionally cleaned the fanlight before; we left about half-past twelve o'clock - he never came to me to make inquiry about coins - he knew where to find me.</p>

            . I am a journey man locksmith, in the employ of Mr. Tibbs, of Bedford-street, Bedford-row; he occasionally works for Mr. Pollock. About three months ago master sent me to the house with a job, and I saw the prisoner - he showed me a tin box like this in the pantry; he had it in his hand, to the best of my belief - he said it contained the keys of the cellar, and asked me to make him a key to it, to get a bottle of wine when he thought proper, and gave me a pattern of the key on paper; it was an impression in ink, made two or three different ways - I could have made a key from it; there was a pattern of the side, the top, and end; it was as much like the key of that box as I could possibly tell - it was a double tumbler lock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170074"/>which is difficult to undo; I gave him to understand that I would make it - he called several times at the shop, and asked if I had done the key; I had not began it - I told him at last, plainly, that I did not intend to do it; I heard of Mr. Pollock's robbery on the 19th of April, and went three or four days after with my master to Mr. Pollock's - he had before that told Mr. Pollock what had passed between me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner knew you had been employed by Mr. Pollock? A. Yes; I am still with Mr. Tibbs, and have been so for a year and a half; I thought this proposal a bad thing, but did not tell master till he stated to me that Mr. Pollock had been robbed; I have not got the impressions - I do not know whether I threw then away, or put them into my pocket; I have seen Smith, the butler, at Mr. Tibbs', but never saw him there with any wine - I never intended to make the key; I think I have been at Mr. Pollock's house after the prisoner spoke about the key.</p>

            . I am a locksmith, and occasionally work for Mr. Pollock. I have examined the lock of the tin-box attentively; it appeared to have been opened with a picklock; that is my deliberate opinion - the ward is damaged in the way a picklock would do; I have looked at the dressing-case lock; that has been opened by no other than its own key - it is a Bramah's patent lock; I heard of this robbery from an officer; when I told Nunn I wished him to go with me to Mr. Pollock's, he told me the footman had asked him to make a key to the tin box, and given him a pattern on paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The Bramah lock has been opened by its own key? A. Or by one of the same sort - I have tried it with the key, and found it will go; I never knew a Bramah lock picked without injury - when I heard of the robbery I went with the officer into the shop to Nunn and asked if he had been applied to by the footman to make a key - we did not mention the report of the robbery to him at that time; he had not mentioned the circumstance to me; I never gave Smith any spirits in my life - I went to Mr. Pollock's when business called me, and Smith called on me, when he had orders to bring; the other servants came as often as him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MANNING. I am in the employ of lves and Burbidge, lock-manufacturers, Fleet-street. I have seen this tin-box, and in my opinion it has been opened by a picklock, the wards beings gulled, as we call it - the upper lock of this dressing-case has not been opened, except by a key - Bramah locks have been picked, but they have been very common ones; this is a very good one - the bottom one is common - the least variance prevents a Bramah lock being opened; I have opened the lock.</p>

On the 11th of April, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop alone, and asked to see some lace - I showed her some in a drawer; there was nobody else in the shop - after looking at it sometime I observed her put something under her shawl; there was nothing but lace on the counter - she said there was none to suit her, and left the shop; I then examined the drawer, and missed a piece of lace - I followed, and went up to her four or five yards from the door; I brought her back to the shop, and told her I missed a piece of lace - she immediately took it from under her shawl, laid it on the counter, and said,"I beg your pardon;" I detained her, master came down stairs, and a constable was sent for - the lace cost 11s. 6d.</p>

               <p>THOMAS PROTHERO. I am one of the City Police. I I was sent for, and took the prisoner in charge; Mr. Greenwood came down, and she said, "Mr. Greenwood, I hope you will forgive me?" he refused; I found 1s. 3d. on her, some muslin, a duplicate for a piece of stuff, and the key of a box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she appear very much alarmed? A. Not so much as I should in the same situation; she gave me three different addresses; I was desired by the Alderman to find out where her box was, but I never could.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who brought her home? A.Byrne; they led her home - I was before the Grand Jury - I do not know that they have thrown out the bill; I never heard so till now; I came here, thinking it was found - I was told to attend to-day, and was told it was a true bill by the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how many persons in your house were ill at the time your daughter was taken ill? A. There were two females, and my daughter had been nursing them - Mr. Waller attended them; one who was ill for a week died, the other left the house - they had been ill three days before my daughter was taken ill; Mr. Waller attended my daughter - she did not vomit after she took medicine - I did not hear the Grand Jury had not returned a true bill; Drs. Babington, Messrs. Kiernan, and Hockley saw my daughter after death; my daughter drank nothing but tea before she went out - she had neither porter nor spirits.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHAPMAN. I am an orange and nut-dealer, and live in King-street, Cloth-fair. On the 9th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw Elizabeth Sarah Chalk just by a private door, at the corner of Cloth-fair; the prisoners and her were standing together; when I first went up to them the deceased caught hold of my arm, and asked me to protect her, as they had been knocking her about, and ill-using her most shamefully - I said I had nothing to do with it, they must settle it was they could; Taylor then called her a nasty stinking - and then pushed her up and down the court; she kept saying,"What have I done to deserve this;" I only saw one push, and that was from Taylor - Chalk then caught hold of another young man's arm, and asked him to protect her; Taylor then went up, and looked her in the face, and said, "We will do for you before the night is out, though you have got a friend to protect you; you first began it, and you shall have it" - I then went in, leaving them standing opposite.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the Grand Jury had thrown out the bill? A. Not till this afternoon, not before I came into Court; I heard something about it, but did not believe it - I did not tell Mrs. Starkey of it.</p>
               <p>ELLEN REEVES. I live in Middle-street, Cloth-fair. On the 9th of April, before in struck eight o'clock in the evening, I saw Chalk in Gray's-passage, just by Chapman's - only Taylor was with her then; I saw her set Mrs. Chalk with her back against Gray's-passage, against the wall of the Red Cow; she said, "I have got you now, I will serve you out;" she hit her on the head and neck, first on one side of the head and then the other - I saw nothing else done; I went away - I did not see Chalk do any thing; she never made the least resistance - she seemed quite sober; she was a diminntive little thing, quite small.</p>

            . I live in Bartholomew-close, but am now under-waiter at the Chapter coffee-house. On the 9th of April I was coming by Chapman's, in Cloth-fair, and saw Chalk, and both the prisoners pushing her very much up and down the court; they were all three quarrelling together - they first pushed her on the iron spikes of the railing; her back was on the iron railing - she would have fallen had it not been for the watch-box; they then pushed her again - they pushed her down, and pushed her head against the corner of the Red Cow public-house; she fell with very great violence - this was not two yards from the watch-box; she did not make the least resistance, nor use any ill-language.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her rise? A. I was called away - she was in a very weak state indeed - she could hardly stand by the watch-box; I heard both the prisoners swearing at her, and she certainly answered them; they called one another b - rs and w - s.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the Grand Jury had thrown out the bill? A. Yes, I knew it about half-past two o'clock - the officer came to tell my master so.</p>

               <p>MR. PREXDERGAST declined examining this witness.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you a medical man? A. Yes; I am not related to the prisoners or deceased; I happened to be attending two persons in the house (in which the deceased was,) of the disorder called the cholera, and was present when the medical gentlemen examined the deceased's body; I examined the whole body very carefully, except the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence? A. There was something very slight on the right side; the medical men could not agree whether it was a bruise or not; I think it arose from the external application which I had used - I think that the deceased came by her death from natural disease; I stated so before the Coroner and before the Grand Jury; I have been in practice eleven years, and live in Bartholomew-close; this has been a matter of a good deal of contest in the parish.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170077"/>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. In consequence of the discussion in the parish, I believe you had a number of highly respectable gentleman to view the body? A. Yes, Dr. Babington, Jun., Messrs. Griffiths, Burrows, Tweedy, and others - we all signed a document; they all agreed with me in the main, with the exception of this trifling bruise.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were there no other marks of violence? A. None; what satisfied me this was not a bruise was, she had complained of pain on that side, and was relieved by violent external friction, which convinces me it was a violent spasm; I never had the slightest idea that her death was caused by external violence.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Had you been told of the circumstances which are said to have occurred before you examined the body? A. Yes, but I had no idea she was hurt; she herself said nothing about it, only her mother - there were no bruises on her back or breast; I did not know the bill was thrown out till I came into Court.</p>
               <p>JOHN WHEATLEY. I am nine years old, and live in New-street, Cloth-fair. On the 9th of April I saw Mrs. Chalk by Mr. Chapman's, and saw both the prisoners with her; I saw Taylor striking her, and knocking her about - Mrs. Chalk appeared to be well; she did nothing - I heard Taylor calling her all the names she could lay her tongue to; Chalk was standing up - I saw Taylor knocking her about, and she knocked her down by striking her in the breast with her fist doubled; I left her on the ground - we were at play, and were going to tell Mrs. Starkey to come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Chalk never called her bad names? A. No, I am sure of that; they were not both quarrelling, it was only Taylor - I did not see Byrne there; I only heard Taylor call her bad names - she was knocked down by Chapman's, and fell to the ground, I am sure of that; I do not know where the Red Cow is; there is a public-house at the corner of the posts - I do not know the sign; it is one door from Chapman's.</p>

            . I am ten years old. I saw Chalk a few minutes before eight o'clock, and saw Edwards hit her on the breast, and knock her up against Chapman's private door; when she came to she asked what it was for- Taylor then up with her foot, and hit her on the side; she fell back from the first blow - her head laid towards the passage when she was knocked down; she said to a lady and gentleman, "Please to help me up," and they did, and led her to a chair which was outside a green-grocer's - she could not move herself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She did not call them any names? A. No - neither of them said she had began it herself; the Red Cow is about two yards from Chapman's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were there to protect her? A. I had my shop to attend to - I did not apprehend they were going to kill her.</p>

            . I live in Middle-street. On the 9th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw Chalk in Middle-street, by Mr. Grover's door - she seemed very ill; she could not walk without help - I asked if I should take her home; she said Yes, and I took her to her mother's - she was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She appeared to have drank something, I suppose, but knew what she was about? A.

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Chiswell-street; I have been in practice about two years, and four or five years in the profession. On the evening of the 9th of April, I saw Mrs. Chalk at her mother's, in the presence of Mr. Waller - I agree with him, and consider she died of the prevailing epidemic cholern morbus.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that disease would by more likely to attack a person from violence having pre-disposed the body? A. I think it possible to pre-dispose her to disease, but that pre-disposition would not cause death; I saw a slight bruise on her right side, a very superficial one - I thought it decidedly a bruise; it did not go beyond the integuments - there was no bruise on the back - I was present when the body was opened; there was a little redness on the right lobe of the liver, which I understand from gentlemen who have seen many cases of cholera, is a common symptom - my opinion is the same as that of the other gentlemen; it was a slight blush on the liver, and not opposite the external bruise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you decidedly of opinion that her death was the result of cholera? A. There is no doubt of it; I stated so to the Coroner and Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If cholera had made its appearance on the subject, do you suppose external violence would cause it to have assumed a more serious character? A. The cases I have seen have terminated so suddenly I do not think any thing would affect it; it is impossible to say whether external violence would cause that to end fatally which otherwise would not have done so.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would drinking spirits cause it to become violent? A. That is a pre-disposing cause; I am decidedly of opinion her death was the result of an attack of cholera; ten surgeons agreed in that opinion; there was no bruise on the back - the mother showed me some liquid, which she said had just come from her stomach - it was very thin liquid; I saw no blows nor marks of violence on the breast - turpentine had been rubbed on the breast, which would be more likely to make them appear; she did not complain of any violence; she was perfectly sensible - the symptoms she called out attention to were cramps in the calves of her legs; she was able to speak very well - alarm and weakness is a symptom of cholera.</p>

               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Would fright pre-dispose to the disease? A. I think it might.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, of Leonard-street, Finsbury. I saw the body after death, and observed a superficial bruise on the right side; it appeared extremely slight - it was a matter of dispute whether it was a blow, and I am rather doubtful of it; I saw the appearance on the liver, that did not correspond with the neck - I believe myself it was not caused by external violence; my judgment is, that she died of cholera.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing her to have been attacked with cholera at nine o'clock, and at eight to have been treated with violence, would that pre-dispose to the disease? A. It is very early, but her having nursed two other patients it might be.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If she had attended two cholera patients for two or three days, do you suppose the external violence would give her the disease, or the infection? A. It think it most likely that it was imbibed before.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Would personal violence aggravate the disease? A. It would aggravate any disease, and hasten the death of any body, certainly - it has always been my opinion, that the attack of cholera caused her death.</p>

No, not long; if it had not been for that, I think I should have recollected him - I had no doubt of his person when I saw him again; it was the minister who spoke with some doubt about him - he was not bound over to attend. -(The register was here read).</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, in Warwickshire, on the 2nd of April, on this charge - I told him I wanted him on a charge of bigamy; he said he should not have done it if it had not been for another man; I had seen him two or three months before at Cheltenham, and asked him if his name was Shaw - he said, "No, my name is Thompson," and he went away - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you take him? A. At a place called Mersford; he was keeping a cottage there, and there were two females there.</p>

               <p>"I will give you the money presently;" he got behind the cart, and went away - I sold it to the prisoner, and he sold it to Mr. Collins, in my presence, for 3s. more; I did not intend to let him have it without the money - I expected he would pay me when he got the money; we always have the money on corn as it is unloaded - he was to pay me 33s., and he sold it for 36s.; I told him I did not intend to part with it without the money - the straw was weighed; he slipped away unknown to me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SPICER, JUN. The straw was mine; I sent my father with it - on the 28th of April I found the prisoner in the New-road, and took him into custody - I told him he was the man I wanted to see about the load of straw; he said he would make it up to me, but he had no money then - he went away; I followed him, and said he had better make it up - he then ran off; I called and ran after him - a man stopped him; the officer came and took him - he said he would pay me 3s. or 4s. at a time, as he got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had three loads of straw of the old man; I took the last load to the same person as the first - I asked the old man the price in Oxford-street; he said a guinea and a half - Mr. Collins asked the price, and I said 10 1/2d. a truss; there were 180lbs. short of weight - Mr. Collins said he would not pay, and he had a good mind to lay the fine on him; I said I knew nothing about it, and perhaps the man did not know it; he paid me, stopping 6s. for the short weight.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Bradley. I took the Eliza up to Chelsea on the 9th, which was Saturday, and on the Sunday morning I moored her and left her safe, between eleven and twelve o'clock - I went to her again about the same time on Monday morning; she had then been unmoored, and fifteen quarters of oats had been taken out of her, and thirty sacks which had contained it - I suppose that was seven miles from Horselydown; I saw the prisoner about dinner time on Sunday, and he asked if I had taken my punt up-to Chelsea - I said Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES EDWARDS. I am a lighterman and live in Freeman's-lane. I have known the prisoner for years - on that Sunday, between twelve and one o'clock, he came to Horselydown stairs, and asked if I knew where Bumstead was - I said I had not seen him, but he might find him at home; he went away, and returned with him - he said they were going to hire a barge, and asked if I would go with them; I said No - in the afternoon they asked if I would lend them my boat; I said I did not mind - they took it, and were away all the afternoon; in the evening the prisoner came and told me he had hired a barge - I and the prisoner went on board it, and went below-Bumstead was on it; it then went up on the other side of Chelsea College, and they stopped her at the piles - I found the Eliza there, laden with corn; the prisoner and Bumstead unmoored her, and shoved her down to the barge; they then fastened her, and took out of her fifteen quarters of oats - the prisoner said, "Now I shall pay myself;" I understood he had worked for the prosecutor, who had not paid him - the oats were shot out of the sacks, loose, into the barge; the Eliza was left against the dead wall, by the piles; we then came down the river- the sacks were thrown overboard somewhere off the Red House, and sunk; we went down to Pickle Herring tier - I then took the prisoner on shore, and left Bumstead on board; I do not know what became of them afterwards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you removing a great deal of property? A. No; this box was tied up in this apron, as it is now - I was going to give the articles out of the fly, and the prisoner said he would give them out; I then went in-doors, and he brought them in; but this parcel appears to have been left behind - I had not made him a promise of any thing for it.</p>

I was just off duty, and was sent for to put some of the things in the fly - I do not know who put this bundle in; next morning, the 14th of April, the servant came, and said there had been a robbery - I went to Mrs. Jones', and from what she said I went to the stable to the prisoner; I asked him if he knew any thing about the property; he said he did not, but if it was put into the fly, he was certain it was left at Hammersmith - I then went with him to Mrs. Jones' at Hammersmith; he asked her if she had found the property; she said No - he said he was certain he must have left it there, as he knew unthing about it; I then went outside with the prisoner, to wait for Mr. Jones coming from London - he then asked me to let him go to Mrs. Jones' again; which he did, and told her not to make herself uneasy, and she should have the property again; I said, "Then you know where it is;" he said, "Yes, you have sent the serjeant to search the stable, and if he searches under the manger he will find it covered up in the litter" - just at that time his master arrived on a horse, to say that it had been found under a manger - I then took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in your Police dress at that time? A. No, in plain clothes; but when I told him I should take him into custody. I said I was an officer - he did not tel me he expected to get something for it.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Police. On the 29th of April, at a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Jubilee-place, Stepney -I saw the prisoner and another man, with each a stove; I followed them some distance, and asked where they were going to take them; they said they bought them at a sale, and were going to Brick-lane - they did not go that way, and I said I must take them to the station; they put down the stoves by the London-hospital, and the other man ran away, but I caught the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him to ask the other man to give him an explanation, as I did not know where they were going. Witness. No, he only said it was right, and when I had him he made a desperate effort to escape - I caught the tail of the other man's coat, and he left it with me.</p>

            . The house these stoves were taken from was let to me. I saw them all safe a few days after Lady-day, and I think I had called there on the 28th or 29th of April; they were then fixed, and the house was secure - I went a few days afterwards, and the lock of the street-door had been broken off, and the stoves were gone - I have no doubt these are the stoves; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man in the Commercial-road with these stoves; he asked me to help him with them to Brick-lane; when the officer stopped me he ran off; I ran and called after him, but the officer called me back.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew these things belonged to Mr. Bastier? A. Yes, but my aunt told me they were hers as long as she rented the room - I was taken into custody; my aunt did not support me in December and January - I am married; I did not take part of these things to cover myself in the cold weather - there was a flock pillow found on my bed, but I had pawned a feather pillow belonging to myself - I never had a pair of sheets of the prosecutor's on my bed or in my house, nor a blanket.</p>

I said,"Come out, and I will tell you;" he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out something, and was putting it down; I said, "That won't do for me;" I caught his hand, and found three shillings in it.</p>
               <p>Larkin's Defence. I accused the prosecutor of robbing me of a sovereign; Treadaway said, "It is in his cart" - he was going to get into his cart and Treadaway struck him - I had two sovereigns and two or three shillings in my pocket, and one sovereign was there when I was taken; the prosecutor was intoxicated.</p>

               <p>I have no remembrance of the case; on the first examination Stephen only was in custody - that was on the 2nd of April; there was no statement then made; Mr. Cath said he wanted time, and the parties were remanded till the Friday following, and then that passed which I have read -Mr. Cath made a charge of having lost some agates out of his warehouse; I cannot undertake to state that I took down all that passed - it was not read over to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. May you have omitted something that the prisoners said? A. I cannot say that I wrote down every word but the substance; I might have omitted some things, but these words were used.</p>
               <p>MR. CATH. I was before the Lord Mayor when these men were charged with the felony; I recollect the Lord Mayor asked Stephen where he got the agates which he gave to his brother - he said he had stolen them at different times from my warehouse, (or most likely he said took them,) and given them to his brother; the question was asked of John where he got the agates from, and he replied from his brother Stephen, and he was to have a few shillings commission for selling them - John knew that Stephen was in my employ; I believe John is a wine-porter - he was not likely to be in possession of articles of this description on his own account.</p>

               <p>JOHN DELBRIDGE. I am shopman to Mr. Cording, a pawnbroker, in Aldgate. The prisoner came there on the night of the 18th of April, and brought this watch, on which I lent 7l. 10s.; he gave the name of John Aaron, No. 16, Essex Street - I am sure he is the man; he said it had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170087"/>belonged to his father, who was lately dead; and that he had been unfortunate in life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Look at me; I never saw you till I was at the office? A. I am positive you are the man, you were taken two days after; I gave you seven sovereigns, and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is your shop from where the prosecutor lives? A.About a quarter of a mile; it was pawned between eight and and nine o'clock in the evening - he was in the shop nearly a quarter of an hour, I had several people there; I asked if he was a lodger, and put L. for lodger on the duplicate.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was he in the shop? A. Yes, and close to a gas - he had not the same dress on then; I had not seen him before, but I am certain of him - I described him to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. HECKSHER. I took him myself; there was no officer employed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there any other lodgers in the house? A. No, there is one female servant; it is Miss Benjamin's house - her brother and sister live with her - the female servant attended to my room - the prisoner might have seen I had a watch in my room as he went up stairs; I am a watch-maker, and have a great many watches there - there were four together - I missed one; I took the prisoner four days afterwards; I missed the watch at eleven o'clock at night - it was from Mr. Delbridge's description I took the prisoner; he had gone away that night and we saw no more of him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had not I given notice to go away? A. I believe he had; I missed the watch on the 18th, and can be on my oath I had it in my hand at one o'clock - he left about two in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BENJAMIN. I live with my sister. The prisoner lived there, and left about two o'clock on the 18th of April; he said he would go, and asked for three days wages, which I paid him - he had lived with us seventeen years off and on, and behaved honest; we had some dispute that day about his being gone two or three hours to Billingsgate; he did not return till near two o'clock, and then left; he took some aprons and other things with him - I did not see him go to his room to fetch them, the maid is not here; the prisoner went up and got his clothes; the prosecutor's door is generally closed - he works at home in general.</p>
               <p>MR. HECKSHER. I had been called out in a hurry; I shut the door but did not lock it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is there no one else in the house? A. There is a boy, but he had no business up stairs; he could go up.</p>

On the 14th of April I saw the prisoner leave our house with a large blanket in an apron - I sent one of the waiters after her; the blanket had been hanging in the passage to dry, and I saw it safe when she came in five minutes before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PROTHERO. I am an officer. I took the prisoner on Monday the 16th of April - I have not found the blanket.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROWN. I was called by my mistress to go after the prisoner - I had been in the tap-room, when she came in; she had no blanket then - I gave her a light; I was up stairs, and my mistress called to me that she had gone out with a blanket; I went out, but could not find her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A friend told me to call on them there, between seven and eight o'clock - I went, but could not see them; I then went out, and on the Monday morning the officer came and asked if I had been to the house, and if I had taken a blanket - I said I had been there, but I had taken nothing out; I saw no blanket, and if I had been seen to come out with it they should have stopped me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PROTHERO. I never asked whether she took the blanket, or whether she had been at the house - I took her there, and Mrs. Bird indentified her.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. BIRD. Q. Was the prisoner a customer? A. Yes; she was well known in the place; I called after her, but she turned up a court and got away before the waiter could get after her - she had come in empty handed.</p>

I saw the three prisoners, and pointed them out to Bates; I followed with him about half way towards Billingsgate, where they met the prosecutor, and returned after him -I did not see the attempt made, but I saw he had hold of Brightley; I went up, and the prisoners were secured.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Brightley's Defence. I was waiting at the London-docks - a gentleman asked me to carry a box to the steam-pocket, which I did, and he gave me 6d. for it - as I came back this gentleman took me.</p>

               <p>Jackson's Defence. I was going on an errand, when the prosecutor laid hold of Brightley, and then the other gentleman said I was one of them.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. My father sent me to my aunt's, in the Strand, and told me to call on a man at Billingsgate; I forgot it till I got to the bridge - I turned back; I saw the man, and was then going on, and they took me behind a cart.</p>

               <p>GEORGE KEMP (Police-constable N 82). On Saturday night, the 21st of April, I was in <placeName id="t18320517-160-crimeloc934">Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18320517-160-crimeloc934" type="placeName"

                        targets="t18320517-160-off932 t18320517-160-crimeloc934"/>; I saw the prisoner and prosecutor in conversation together - I saw the prisoner leave him; I crossed the road, and asked if he had been robbed - in consequence of what he said I followed, and took the prisoner - she dropped three sovereigns; I found two at her feet, and one was rolling away; I took her to the prosecutor, and then to the station-house; the prosecutor was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were there any other women about? A. There was one following behind them, on the other side of the way: I had seen the prisoner, but had no conversation with her; I did not tell the Magistrate that I went on a little way, and picked something up; I said I found two sovereigns on the ground, and one was rolling - the prosecutor had been drinking, but knew what he was about, and could walk.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PARKER. I live in Parker-street, Kingsland-road, and am a <rs id="t18320517-160-viclabel935" type="occupation">surveyor</rs>

On the evening of the 21st of April I was in Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road -I had been drinking a little, but was able to walk, and do business; it was between eight and nine o'clock - I saw the prisoner; she followed, and came up to me in York-street; we conversed together for some minutes - the moment she left me I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my money; I saw the Policeman that instant, and whether he spoke to me first or I to him I cannot say - I had had seven sovereigns loose in my right-hand trousers pocket; I had them with my hand in my pocket when she joined me - no other person had been near enough to take it from the time I felt it safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then you think you was very little the worse for liquor? A. Yes; when she met me I had my hand and my money in my pocket - she must have taken it from my pocket; I was aware of it when I had lost it; my hand was not in my pocket all the time -I had counted my sovereigns before she came into my company; I had been at a public-house in the Commercial-road - I was not drunk; I swear no other person had been in my company - I cannot say whether I had buttoned my pocket when I took my hand out; I had made no contract with the prisoner; I first met her in York-street, two streets from Great Cambridge-street, I suppose a quarter of a mile from my house - she had hold of my arm for the purpose of getting my money; I swear I gave her nothing when I took my hand out of my pocket.</p>

I then saw Hutchins come from the rear in front of the colonel; he looked up in his face, and said Mr. Hume (who had just spoken) was a very clever fellow, and he added, "Before Mr. Hume leaves the hustings, let us give him three cheers"- when they were given Hutchins said, "Let us give him one cheer more;" when the fourth cheer was given the colouel took his hat off, and waved it as well as he could in the crowd, raising his right arm; and either Gascoyne or Jones was supporting his arm up; the three prisoners left the crowd immediately the fourth cheer was given - I asked the colonel if he had lost any thing; he felt in his pocket, and said, "I have lost my purse" - I ran through the crowd, and succeeded in stopping the three prisoners, with the assistance of some other persons, just as they were going out of the door - Hutchins had his right hand in his pocket; I examined his pocket, and found in it this purse, with two sovereigns and 13s. 6d. in it - he claimed it; I took them to the station, and asked the colonel to describe his purse - he claimed it, and said there were two sovereigns in it, and some silver, but he could not exactly say what - I found some money on Jones, and on Gascoyne - I found on Hutchins, besides the purse, a half-sovereign, 9s. 6d. in silver, and I think 2d. in copper, and a pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.What did you find on Gascoyne? A.2s. 6d. in silver, and 1 1/2d. - there was a great crowd, and the colonel was in the midst of it; there was no difficulty in distinguishing the prisoners - I did not go to the Reform Meeting as an officer, but if I had seen a breach of the peace I should have interfered; I was not quite certain when the attempt was made, and if I had attempted to take them then I should have had very little chance in the crowd - I was not certain that the colonel was robbed till I saw them leaving the crowd - I did not see Jones or Gascoyne speak to Hutchins; there might be one or two persons between him and the colonel when these attempts were made.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went partly as a reformer yourself? A. You may take it so if you please, but of course I was an officer - I applauded the speeches, but I never lifted my hand; I think the prisoners were more anxious to see others cheer than to cheer themselves - Hutchins claimed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170090"/>purse to the last; I do not know whether it is a common purse, I have seen many like it.</p>

I was at the King's Arms garden, attending the meeting, as I live in the parish, in Brompton-square; Lord Teynham was in the chair - I had a purse of this sort and colour, with two sovereigns and some loose silver in it - I missed it when the officer spoke to me; I believe this is my purse - I recollect the cheers being proposed; I had before that had my hand on my side, but when Mr. Hume was leaving the meeting, I lifted my hand, and took off my hat - by that means my pocket was exposed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was your coat buttoned? A. Yes; I cannot swear to the purse - Hutchins insisted that it was his from the first; there was a great crowd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you observe any communication between the prisoners? A. No- I could not swear to any of them.</p>

            . Q. Did the prisoners go away together? A. They were close together when they quitted, and went at the same time.</p>
               <p>Gascoyne. I was not near the door; I was in the crowd - another person took me. Witness. I took him and Hutchins near the door; there was some crowd there - I called a person to assist me; I called to a special-constable to take Jones - they were all going away together: there were several speeches after Mr. Hume left.</p>
               <p>Hutchins. The purse is mine - I have had it three or four months; I bought in the Strand, where you can buy fifty every day - this officer did not take it from me; another person took it out of my pocket, and gave it to him- I said it was mine, and that it had 2l. 13s. 6d. in it. -Witness. He had his hand in his pocket, grasping the purse, and I took it; I said, "If it is yours, you can tell what is in it - how many sovereigns are there?" he said three; I said, "How much silver?" he said about 14s. - he guessed the silver right within 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure he did not say two sovereigns? A. He said two, after he saw the money counted, but at first he said three.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM RIX. I am a plumber. I was in Upper King-street, and saw the prisoner and another person; I saw the handkerchief taken from the pocket of a gentleman, who, I believe, was the prosecutor, the prisoner was within a yard of the person who took it; and the other person gave it to the prisoner, who put it into his breast pocket - I cried Stop thief! and the prisoner ran into a mews, I took him there; I had lost sight of him, but I know he is the person.</p>

On the morning of the 30th of April, about half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Pancras-road, carrying this copper and pot in a bag - I asked if he had not got a copper; he said Yes, that he had found these articles in a field, and was going to take them to the station-house; I said he had better go to the station with me - he said he had no objection, but when he had got a few steps, he put them down and said I might take them; I took them, but was forced to put them down once or twice to take hold of him, as he was very obstinate; I went to the Adam and Eve, in Pancras-road, and found the wash-house door had been broken open, and this chisel was there, which exactly corresponded with the marks on the door; the copper was missed, but the bricks had been pulled down, and we could not fit it.</p>

             (Police-constable N 217). On the 26th of April I was at my window in Church-street, Hackney - I saw the prisoner coming down the grove with a great coat; two more men were behind him - he was walking very fast, and when he turned into the main road, he ran as fast as he could; I ran after him for about ten minutes, and took him - while he was running he threw the coat down in the dirt; this is it - he said at the station that he bought it of the two men who were with him, for 2s. - the other two had run off; it was a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, and he was coming from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor. On the 1st of May the cart of dung was there, and two trusses of hay and a sack of oats and chaff mixed together, were found in it; I had been in the loft, and counted the trusses of clover hay - I then went to breakfast; the prisoner was loading the dung - when I came back he was still doing the same; I went into the loft and counted the hay again, and missed two trusses - I know he had not hay in his cart when he came to the yard; the two trusses were found on the copse in front of the cart - they were of the same sort as those in the loft, and made up the forty-four which I had at first counted - he first said he found it on the road, and then that he did not know how it got there; we had some mixed oats and chaff in the loft, but we could not miss any of them - that found in his cart corresponds with it exactly, and the sack, in which they were found seemed to be one which he had brought empty.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH STEPHENS. I am single. I have been living with the prisoner nearly seven years; we lodge at Great Saffron-hill; he brought home the time-piece when we lived at Finsbury-court - it was there four or five months; he told me to pawn it, and I did; he brought home a case of instruments when we lived at Saffron-hill, and the neck-chain, which he gave me for my little girl to play with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. When did you first see the time-piece? A. Eight or nine months age - he had made use of his master's money, and he told me to pawn the time-piece - I pawned it in my own name; it had stood on a sideboard, and was not concealed; I was not quarrelling with the prisoner when the officer came - he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>JOHN BATEMAN. I am a pawnbroker. I have the time-piece, pawned by Stephens, on the 24th of March.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What character had the prisoner? A. I considered him trust worthy - I never trusted this time-piece to him; I had no transaction with him in a way of business - the time-piece was for the use of our office, and when it was missed he charged another person with stealing it; I was once in the Court of Exchequer for selling some goods for a man, who afterwards took the benefit of the Act, and I had to pay the fine; I have borrowed 5l. of the prisoner's brother, but I never had any money transaction with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The time-piece was not pawned by my order.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH WALLIS. I am servant to Mr. Roberts, a farmer, at South Mimms. I was coming to town with the bay-cart, and saw the prisoners coming up the Archway-road, about four miles from Finchley; they said, "Will you let us hand our basket behind your cart;" I said,"You may put it on the top, if you like," and they did so- I told the officer; I had seen them before - the basket contained this property.</p>
               <p>Tregonin. I did not ask about putting it up. Witness. Yes, you both did.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH ASSA. This is the tongue; it is my master's, and so was the other property.</p>

               <p>Tregonin's Defence. I went out bird's-nesting, and saw this man, who asked me to carry a basket for him; we overtook this man with the hay-cart, and he asked him to let us put it behind.</p>

               <p>CHARLES KENDALL. I am a Custom-house agent, and live at York-terrace, Stepney. The prisoner was introduced to me about the 27th of April, by Mr. William Hallett, who said he was captain of the Othello, or words to that effect, and that he had some cokernuts to sell; I told him if he had coker-nuts to sell, I would give him the best price for them, and I would go on board the following morning or the morning after, and look at them - I went the next morning but one, and saw the prisoner, who appeared in treaty with another person; I agreed to purchase the coker-nuts at 17s. a hundred - I came round to the baggage-warehouse with him, where I saw my clerk, and I left him to close the transaction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Is Mr. Hallett here? A. Not that I am aware of; he introduced the prisoner as master or captain - we have but one meaning for those words in the merchant service; Mr. Hallett is a Custom-house agent - I saw him some days ago; the prisoner speaks English, but I observed he was a foreigner; I think I saw Mr. Hallett at the Police-office.</p>

             (Police-constable H 133.) In consequence of information I went to a house in Gloucester-row, Chelsea; I found the prisoner in a lodging there - this gown was laying on the bed-post; I asked if it was not Mrs. Cussen's - she said it was; I took her and told her she was accused of stealing six tea-spoons and a pair of trousers - she denied all knowledge of them, but said Mrs. Cussen gave her the gown.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH CUSSEN. I am the prosecutor's wife. This is my gown - I never lent it, sold it, or gave it to the prisoner - I had it in my own bed-room a fortnight before she quitted; and five or six days after St. Patrick's-day I missed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She gave it me when I was going to an Irish club. Witness. No, I never gave it - she never wore it in my presence - I am quite sure I never gave her authority to wear it; our street door was open in the day time - I do not know that another person might not have gone in, and taken the spoons; they have never been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have witnesses to prove that I wore this gown in her house before her and her husband.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CUSSEN. Their furniture is left there, and is, I believe, worth from 25s. to 30s. - she owed me 6l. 5s.; she did not offer to pay two sovereigns, nor did the man; I never saw her wear this gown.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>MARY SULLIVAN. I lodged in the prosecutor's house for ten months, and never saw a silver spoon there - the prisoner lived there at the time; I saw this gown new upon Mrs. Cussen, and I afterwards saw it on the prisoner - upon my soleman oath I saw the prisoner wearing this gown for two months, while she was a lodger there.</p>
               <p>MARGARET DONOHUE. I live at Blackwall. I have been in and out at the prosecutor's for three months in the last winter - I saw the prisoner twice with this gown on, in the presence of the prosecutor and his wife.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CUSSEN. Sullivan left my house on the 17th of December - she had owed me a debt, which I got of her, and she has not been in my house since - Donohue has been there, but very seldom.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Upon your oath have you been into the prosecutor's house since the first day of the year? A. No, but I have seen the prisoner wearing the gown both in and out of the house - I live close by.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE DRISCOLL. I used to go to the prosecutor's house to see their baby - I have seen the prisoner wear this gown; I am sure it is the same - I saw it on Mrs. Cussen's back when it was new.</p>

I was going up to Chalk Farm a little after seven o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of April; I saw a mob - the prisoner was sitting on a grass plot, and the prosecutor standing by, asking him for his money - the prisoner made use of very bad language, and swore he had not got a farthing about him; I took off his shoes, and found in his stockings two half-crowns, which I took through some boles; he made a great deal of resistance - when I found the money he said he was very sorry, and wanted the prosecutor to forgive him; he said he would give him 1l. - he said he knew he should be transported, and it would be a good job for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Do you remember his saying he did not intend to steal it? A. I did not hear that; I recollect his telling the prosecutor they were all friends together - I did not notice any girls there.</p>

On the 23rd of April I was at Chalk Farm, with the prosecutor and the prisoner; I had seen the prosecutor before - I went across the gardens to speak to a friend, and saw the prisoner and him quarrelling - I asked what it was about; the prosecutor said he had lost 7s. out of his pocket, and he could not accuse any one but the prisoner; the prisoner was very much intoxicated, and could not say much to him, but kept walking round and round - we had a good deal to drink; I saw the prosecutor at the Yorkshire Stingo on Sunday week, and on last Sunday; I said I was subpoenaed to come here - he said I had no call to come without I liked, but he did not say why; I had seen him a good many times at Mr. Donald's</p>

On the 7th of May I had been dining with some friends; I had been drinking all day, and was going home at past one o'clock in the morning - I had a little terrier dog with me; I was very heavy with liquor, and rather sleepy - I observed a woman pick the dog up; I consider it was near Charing-cross - she kept walking on; I followed her into a house in <placeName id="t18320517-212-crimeloc1228">Whitcomb-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is this house one that you know? A. I lived so long in the neighbourhood I cannot say I do not know the street, there are several brothels in that street; I had never been in that house, to my knowledge, before; the dog caused me to go there - I know I had my money at twelve o'clock, when I got change for a sovereign - I then took out my watch, and felt the rest of my money there; my sovereigns could not fall out - my fob is very narrow - I swear I had nine sovereigns at twelve o'clock at night; in the morning, when I came from Lambeth to town, I know perfectly well I had twelve sovereigns in my watch fob; I changed no more than three - I had been drinking all day; I can drink a good deal sometimes - I had part of two bottles of wine between three of us before breakfast; I had wine and water at different houses- I think I was in four houses - I drank no beer; I might take ale, or a glass of rum and water - after two o'clock I became very much intoxicated; I took two glasses of rum and water with a friend in Jermyn-street, and do not recollect what took place after that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A.No.</p>
               <p>ANN BARRETT. I am servant at the house, No. 18, Whitcomb-street. The prisoner did not lodge there, but on the 8th of May she came there, about half-past one o'clock in the morning; she had a dog in her arms - the prosecutor followed her, and asked for the dog; she was going up stairs - I told her the prosecutor was in liquor; she said he was not in liquor, but near sighted - they then went up stairs, and were there for an hour or an hour and a half; I then heard a creaking on the stairs - I went out of the parlour, and saw the prisoner coming down the last flight of stairs, with her shoes in her hand; I asked where the gentleman was - she said he was up stairs, that he had but 2s. about him, and she would not stop with him; I told her to go up stairs - I followed her with a candle; when I went into the room I found the prosecutor leaning back on the sofa, with his hat under the stove, and his fobpocket turned inside out, which was not so when he went in; I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"I don't think it is all right;" she said she knew the prosecutor, that he was a horse-dealer, and lived in Tothill-street - I shook the prosecutor, and awoke him; the prisoner was standing by - I told him she had been leaving the house without her shoes, and I had detained her; he put his hand to his fob, and said he had lost his watch - I then came down to call a Policeman, but my husband had called one, and he went up with him; the prisoner had fastened the room door - the Policeman knocked, and she opened the door; there was then a sovereign and two halfpence on the table, which had not been there just before - and the prosecutor was sitting at the foot of the bed, with his watch in his hand; he told us the woman had given him the watch back - the officer then asked him if he had lost any thing; he said he had lost ten or twelve sovereigns - the prisoner declared she had not more than half a crown or two shillings about her, and wished to be searched in the house; the prosecutor and the prisoner were then taken to St. Ann's watch-house - the prosecutor seemed very much in liquor, and more so when I went up to awake him than before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you married? A. Yes, and I live servant there; there was no one in the house but the prosecutor, the prisoner, I, my husband, and my master.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARRETT. I am the husband of this witness. I saw the prisoner come in about half-past one o'clock, with a dog in her arms; she went up stairs, and the prosecutor went up after her - I heard her say to him on the stairs,"Do you mean to stop all night or not?" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I want my dog;" they went up stairs, and I heard no more for some time; I then heard some footsteps coming down stairs very slow and very light - I came out of the room, and saw the prisoner with her shoes in her hand; my wife stopped her; I went for the Policeman, and went up stairs with him - he knocked at the door, and sang out"Police - if you don't open the door I will;" I went in, and saw the prosecutor sitting on the bed, with his watch in his hand, and his fob turned out; there was a sovereign and two halfpence on the table - the prisoner said she had nothing about her whatever, and the Policeman took her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you or your wife go out first when you heard the prisoner? A.We both went out together - she denied that she had any money of the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Give us her words? A. I asked the prosecutor if he had lost any money, and he said, Yes, ten or twelve sovereigns; the prisoner said she had no money belonging to him, and that she had no money at all about her - I and my wife were sitting in the back parlour when she came down - I went for the Policeman; my wife did not go out of the street door.</p>

             - we went up stairs; the room door was fast - I knocked and called out Police! I heard a lock or a bolt move; I then opened the door, which I could not do before, and went in - I saw the prosecutor sitting on the foot of the bed; I said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, old boy?" and tapped him on the shoulder; I saw he was very tipsy - he said,</p>
               <p>"I have lost my watch and my sovereigns;" I said, "You have your watch in your hand" - he said, "She gave it me back;" I said,"How many sovereigns have you lost?" he said ten or twelve - the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I have no money belonging to him;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a sovereign on the table" - she said, "I would not submit to him for a sovereign;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You are very extravagant, I will take this and put it into my pocket - come, turn it up, or I will take you to the station;" she said,</p>
               <p>"Search me here" - I said, "No, I will take you to the station;" we went there - I said to the inspector, "The old gentleman is not quite compos mentis, but he tells his story so straight forward that I wish to search the prisoner;" I took a candle and went into a private cell, where I stripped the prisoner to her shift, stockings, and shoes - two sovereigns fell from her bosom, and she said,</p>
               <p>"They were given me by a gentleman I met in the Haymarket;" she then said I was a very good lady's maid, and asked me to dress her again - I said I would do my best; she said, "You have found nothing," but I told her to sit down, and I took off one of her shoes - she again said, "You have found nothing," but I took off the other, and found these six sovereigns in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you not a woman for the purpose of examining females? A.No; the prisoner made no charge against the prosecutor; she said she had no money belonging to him, and no money at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They did not ask me if I had any money, only if I had robbed the prosecutor; I told them I had not - I had met him that night near Charing-cross; he asked me to take him home, and I said I could not; he then asked me if I knew a house; I took him to Whitcomb-street - he said he was afraid of losing his dog - I said I would take that; he told me to go on, and he would follow me; we went to a back room, for which he paid 1s. - he gave me two sovereigns, which I put into my bosom; he then wanted to take improper liberties with me - I was an hour and a half before I could get away; I was going down, and met the witness on the stairs; she said, "Where is your friend;" I said,</p>
               <p>"He is up stairs;" he had sat down, and pretended to be asleep - the officer was fetched, and I was taken to the station; the next day he did not know what to say; he at first said it was at half-past two o'clock, then at three, and then between eleven and twelve; the officer told him what to say.</p>
               <p>ANN BARRETT re-examined. Q.Had the prosecutor paid 1s. for the room? A. Yes, he certainly had; she forced the 1s. out of his pocket, and he said, "I want my dog, I want to go home."</p>

               <p>Prisoner. This witness said at the office that he did not recognize me in the slightest degree; he was urged by the Police-officer to say that I was the man, and that I was well known - and then he said I was something like the thief. Witness. I said I did not recollect your face exactly; I had not seen the cloak produced before I saw you - I said before I recollected, that it was on Wednesday or Thursday, but I afterwards recollected it was Wednesday, two days before Good Friday. I did not say it was a wet evening, and that the prisoner was muffled up in a cloak; I said he had a cloak on - it was between eight and nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect; it was dark; the shop was not very well lighted; you was not there many minutes; there was no other person present - I missed the Bible in about half an hour - I do not recollect selling you a book about a fortnight before; I cannot recollect your face now, but your voice is similar - the Bible has a mark in it, but some dirt has been rubbed over it.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARRON. I live in Drury-lane, and keep a general sale shop. On Wednesday evening, the 18th of April, the prisoner came in; he had a blue cloth coat and spectacles on; he was very smartly dressed, and his cloak enveloped him completely; the prisoner is the man, I recollect his person perfectly well - he came about ten minutes or a quarter-past nine o'clock; he said, "Is this a pawnbroker's?" I said "No, it is not;" he said, "I have a book I want to raise some money on," and he asked if I would buy it; I said I did not care; he showed me this Bible, said it was valuable, and had the Apocrypha - he wanted 10s. on it - I gave him 8s. for it, and I said if he wanted it again he should have it; he pressed very much upon me to keep it for him; I put it in the window the next day - I particularly noticed his voice, he has rather a foreign accent and I recognized him by that; Mr. Parker came and asked for the book, and knew it by the mark; the prisoner came again on the Tuesday evening following, with a brush; I had received information to detain him; I made sure he was the man, and I called my wife to be sure that he was the person - she said Yes; I have not the slightest doubt by his voice and appearance that he is the man - this is the Bible; it had a private mark in it, which had been rubbed when I had it from the prisoner; I think my shop is three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Do you know that the prisoner's defence is an alibi? A.

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutors. On Tuesday, the 3rd of April, I was behind the counter when this bill was brought - Mr. Venables stood nearly opposite me, with his face towards the door; I am certain the prisoner is the person who presented something to Mr. Venables - it was talked of as a bill; I only saw a paper in his hand, which seemed rather dirty - I heard him ask for change; Mr. Venables said it was not customary to do so; I heard nothing else - Mr. Venables sent him up to the desk, and Olney asked him if he would have notes or sovereigns; I saw the prisoner write something on the opposite counter to where I was, and give the paper he wrote on to Olney, who delivered some sovereigns to him; he was in the shop nearly five minutes - there was a gas-light just over where he stood; I saw the prisoner again at Hatton-garden on the Saturday following, and knew him directly I saw him - I cannot say at what time he came, it was after we had our tea; we generally finish tea about a quarter past five or six o'clock - it appeared to be quite dark out of doors; our shop closes between eight and nine - we have no fixed time; I cannot say when we closed that night - I think the prisoner came after six and before nine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Will you swear it was after six o'clock? A. I cannot be certain, but should think so - I never heard Mr. Venables say at what time it was; I never heard him say it was half-past four or five o'clock - the prisoner's witnesses were examined at the office; Mrs. Courtney and her husband, and others - I cannot say whether they were sworn.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Was there more than one examination? A. Yes, three - Mr. Venables was examined the first time; I cannot say whether the prisoner's witnesses were examined at the second or third.</p>
               <p>DANIEL SUTTON OLNEY. I am cashier to Messrs. Venables. On the 3rd of April, by Mr. Venables' desire, I gave twenty sovereigns for this bill to the prisoner, who wrote his name and address on the back of it, on the counter, in my sight - I did not notice him so as to know him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Perhaps you can give us some notion as to what hour it was? A. I think it was past six o'clock - I had come from tea about half an hour, and generally finish tea about six.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BARFORD. I am a Policeman. On Saturday, the 7th of April. I received the prisoner in charge; Mr. Venables was examined at the first and last examination - there were not three; Mr. Venables was examined on the Saturday, the prisoner was remanded till the Saturday following, but nothing was done on account of Mr. Phillips' absence - he was remanded till Monday; there was no examination then, and he was remanded till Thursday the 19th, and then committed; on the day the prisoner was apprehended, he wrote his name and address in my book, here it is (reads) - "

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was that gentleman? A. A person from Henrietta-street; Mr. Venables fixed the time at the first examination at between five o'clock and eight; I never heard him fix a nearer time - I think five or six witnesses were examined for the prisoner; I cannot say whether they were sworn - I think they were; Mr. Laing ordered the prisoner to be admitted to bail, in 500l. himself, and four sureties of 250l. - he was not bailed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have had no opportunity of explaining the circumstance; the Magistrate behaved very harsh to me, and public reports have gone forth as if I was guilty of the crime; the inconsistency of the nature of the bill must he evident to any gentleman concerned in trade; on the day I was arrested, I was going to Henrietta-street, Brunswick-square, to bring my friend to the Adelphi theatre, for which I had orders, and was going into Brunswick-square, when I felt a touch on my shoulder, and on turning round, I saw a person who was a perfectstranger to me; he requested my name - I asked his object, and when he persevered, I said it was Brennan, and that I lived over the water, thinking he would then perceive his mistake - he says he met me, but he could not, he was behind me; on his stopping me we had a scuffle - I told him to loose my arm; he said he would not - I refused to go with him, not knowing where he would take me; at the examination, as far as I recollect, he named the time to be five o'clock, or thereabouts - I never saw the bill, and my witnesses will prove my occupation during the whole day.</p>

            ; we live at No. 6, North-terrace, Marsh-gate, Lambeth. I have known the prisoner seven years; he is a landscape-painter, and came over here the latter end of January, at my husband's invitation - he boarded at our house, but did not sleep there; his painting-room was in our house - he has held situations of trust. I remember all the transactions of Tuesday, the 3rd of April; he breakfasted with us that morning, about ten o'clock - he was engaged, finishing a landscape; he went to his painting-room after breakfast- we dined about five o'clock; (the prisoner, my husband, and myself, in the back parlour.) and after dinner removed to the front parlour - my husband is a reporter and attends the Houses of Parliament; his hour of attendance that week was seven o'clock - the prisoner was in our company from five o'clock till my husband went to his duty; I have two children - I did not miss the prisoner from the fire for ten minutes from dinner time till half-past ten at night; I did not miss him at all, but he could not be away ten minutes without my knowing it; there was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170111"/>little coolness at that time between my sister-in-law and Mr. Courtney - she came to the house that evening about half-past eight or nine o'clock, and the prisoner saw her part of the way home, at half-past ten o'clock - she lived with us, but was going to a friend of hers, who was in trouble; Needham, a mason, called at our house about seven o'clock that night, and waited about an hour for Mr. Courtney's return - Mr. Courtney went out again between nine and ten o'clock, and did not return till twelve; I am sure the prisoner did not go out.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You have known the prisoner seven years - have you been in Ireland part of that time? A. I have been more than three years in London, but my husband corresponded with him - we are not related. On the 3rd of April the prisoner was very ill - my sister-in-law being out all day, and my servant having left, I was obliged to do every thing myself, and I made soup for him; my servant had left two months before, and my sister-in-law came to stop with me; I have a servant now - she came about three weeks ago; my sister-in-law had been out all that day, and all the night before, which made the day remarkable to me, having so much to do; and I had been ill and was weak then; my husband was learning drawing of the prisoner - I was examined at Hatton-garden at the last examination; my husband and the prisoner drank gin-and-water after dinner, but before dinner they were drawing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was what you said at the office taken down? A. If it was it was done quickly; I think my husband went out when our clock struck seven, and we keep it ten minutes too fast, on purpose, to give him warning; I was out of the room at times for five minutes; the prisoner was lounging on the sofa, and reading something - I have seen the prisoner write, and believe the paper produced to be written by him; I was asked about that at the office, and said I did not think it was his, but it was then in the clerk's desk, and I only saw the J.B., but when I took it in my hand, and looked at it, I said it was his.</p>
               <p>MRS. BYRNE. I am Mr. Courtney's sister. On Monday, the 2nd of April, I went to see a friend, whose husband had been drowned on the Sunday, and staid all night with her; I returned to my brother's about twenty minutes past seven o'clock on Tuesday evening, and on going into the garden in front of the house, and looking in at the window, I saw the prisoner sitting there; I saw nobody else, but he appeared in the act of speaking, and thinking it might be my brother, I was afraid to rap, as there was a coolness between us; I did not go in - I returned in about ten minutes; I still saw the prisoner in the act of talking, and returned up the terrace again; I returned to the house about half-past eight o'clock, and then went into the kitchen - I afterwards heard the door shut, and went into the parlour; my brother had just gone - nobody but the prisoner was there; he was on the sofa, and did not appear in good health; I remained there till half-past ten o'clock, and he then left with me; I went to Mrs. Torren's, New-street, St. James' - he came with me as far as Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you live with Mr. Courtney? A. Yes, since about a week after Christmas; the servant had just gone - I assisted Mrs. Courtney; there are short venetian blinds to the parlour window - they were folded too, but not turned; I swear the prisoner was there.</p>

               <p/>
               <p/>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You had your senses about you? A.Perfectly so - I sang very little; I do not recollect seeing Davis in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.You went to one or two public-houses? A. To the St. Paul's public-house; I am sure I had no spirits - they wanted me to drink some gin; I refused, and they spilt it down my neck - I do not know who that was; I knocked the glass away and none went down my throat - I gave the same evidence before the Magistrate, and did not want Phillips to remind me of any thing; I once thought of leaving this prosecution alone, as I was afraid of losing my situation - I never heard Phillips tell the Policeman he should have 3s. 6d. a day; he never said so in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you so drunk that Swan picked up your watch, and gave it to Phillips to save for you? A. No, she did not - the landlord and landlady saw her take it from her bosom when the Policeman came in; I did not want more drink there, which was refused - when the tap-room door was pushed open I could see by the light from the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you been sparring with Phillips? A.No; there were a great many people in the tap-room - I do not know at what time I lost my purse; I bottoned my breeches pocket up a moment before Phillips came in - that was before the two men pulled me back; when I saw Johnson he stood facing the door - I cannot swear he was in the room when my watch was taken - I did not see him till Phillips brought my purse, and pointed to him; it could not have fallen from my pocket - Peak, the Policeman, did not tell me to say the prisoners were the persons, or they would get off - it was Phillips gave Johnson in charge.</p>
               <p>HENRY PHILLIPS. I am cook at an eating-house in Chiswell-street. I went with Garness to the Boot, and had a pint of ale - I had passed through the St. Paul's public-house when he was there, but I drank nothing; we both went into the Golden Boot between eleven and twelve o'clock, and had a pint of beer between us at the bar, and as there was singing in the tap-room, Garness said, "Let us go in, and hear a song, and drink the rest there" - we went in and sat down ten or eleven minutes; they called on Garness for a song - I saw Swan and Davis in the room at that time; Garness attempted to sing, but they howled, and he left off - I got up and said, "We had better be going;" he said, "Stop a bit" - I did not see him follow me; I was not out half a minute, and when I came in again he had shifted his seaf, and was sitting between two or three men, who called on him to sing again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any thing when you said he had better be going? A. I saw some persons rubbing their hands across his pockets, and thought all was not right - I went out, came in again, and, to get him out, said,"George, your master wants the keys of the stable;" he got up, and attempted to come out - they pulled him down, and said, "Let him finish his song;" that was neither of the prisoners - they began to sing again; I asked if he was coming - he attempted to get up, and was pulled down again by the same persons - I went over to the house opposite, to get somebody to pull him out; I was not gone half a minute - I returned, and saw him sitting quietly in the same company as before; I laid hold of his collar to pull him out, and the gas was immediately put out - I heard somebody in the room say ding; I was struck, and a bad expression used to me - I was separated from him; I ran to the tap-room door, and opened it - that threw a light into the room; I saw Swan round him and Johnson, but did not see Davis - I saw Swan drop the watch; she then kicked it into the bar; I saw Johnson take the purse out of Garness' pocket - I snatched it from his hand; Garness was then on his back on the tap-room floor; I saw Johnson's hand come from the pocket with the purse-Swan and others were making their way out of the room, and the landlady said, "Stop that woman, she has got his watch in her bosom;" I got hold of it, and the Policeman took it out of my hand - Davis came up, and said she was his wife, and should not go to the watch-house - he was in the house; the Policeman took her to the station - there was an attempt to rescue Swan, and by that means they were all secured.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was nearly all over before Davis interfered? A. He was in the room all the time, but I only saw him attempt the rescue - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was the prosecutor sober? A.He was half and half - he knew what he was about; he had no gin at the Boot; I have left my situation because I was not satisfied with my food; I have not talked with the Policeman about how much a day I should get here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You made no charge against Johnson at the station? A. No; I do not know whether he was locked up for an assault - the robbery was committed in the middle of the tap-room, right opposite the door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did you see Swan standing at the bar with Davis' wife? A. A young woman was drinking there with Davis; Swan was in and out that evening - two women and two men were at the bar at the time the light was called for, but whether one was Swan I cannot say; the bar is on the same side as the tap-room; when the gas was out I do not think a person could see what was passing, till I took the candle - a great many people were running in and out; I am sure nobody could see, for I am in the habit of going in when the gas is out - it was as I came out from lighting the gas that somebody said the woman had the watch - I did not see it kicked by anybody, but after they were taken to the station-house I saw the remains of the watch-glass close to where the prosecutor lay; when I heard my wife say"She has got the watch," I saw it open in Swan's hand, not in her bosom - the Policeman ran in at that moment; she was standing in front of the bar, not attempting to go out; Garness was so drunk, that at the station-house he could not give a word of his statement; he sat in a chair there, and shammed a fit - Phillips was not drunk; two strange bad characters had come into my house, and at the time of the robbery they ran out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Are you sure Johnson came out of the tap-room with two women before you heard the noise? A.They were outside at the time the robbery was committed, and I left Johnson standing at the bar when I went, in and found Garness on the floor - I did not see Phillips take the purse from Johnson, nor hear it mentioned either at the house or station - it was about half-past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you keep your house open so late? We are allowed to keep open till twelve o'clock all round the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>- ATKINSON. I am the landlady. The first thing I saw was the prisoners standing at my bar - Garness ran out, put his back to the door, and said, "Oh, I am robbed, I have lost my master's watch;" at that time Johnson and Swan were at the bar - Johnson had just called for a quartern of gin; Swan stood with her right arm at the corner of the bar - I saw her stoop down, and pick up a watch with her right hand; I never saw it in her bosom - she picked it up between the bar and the tap-room door - the prosecutor was so tipsy he could not stand; he reeled from the door, and the Policeman came in; I said,"Here is the woman who has got the watch;" the Policeman took her round to the right-hand side of the bar, and she delivered the watch to him - she had it open in her hand before that - neither Garness nor Phillips said any thing about her taking it at that time; when Garness saw it in her hand he charged her with it - when the Policeman came; he could scarcely stand then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did you tell any body to stop Swan? A. I did not - I said, "Policeman, here is the woman who has the watch;" she was not attempting to go away - she could have no hand in stealing the watch.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was going by the house on my beat, and heard singing - I looked through the window, and saw Phillips go towards Garness; they sat right opposite the tap-room door - he said something, but I could not hear what; after he had been there about a moment the gas was put out or went out - I then put my head in, and told Atkinson to take a light in; he was in the bar at the time - there were men and women standing at the bar, but I cannot say who; in three or four minutes I heard Garness say he was robbed of his watch - he was then in front of the bar, and had come out of the tap-room- he had been drinking, but was not so drunk but what he knew what he was about - as soon as I heard he had lost his watch I entered the house, and Swan was then coming out of the street door - I had not seen her at the bar; Mrs. Atkinson said, "Stop that woman, she has got the watch; she has got it in her bosom" - I went to get hold of her; she put her right hand into her bosom, and took the watch out - it had no chain or seal to it then; she was not standing at the bar - I am quite sure Mrs. Atkinson said she had it in her bosom; and I saw her take it from her bosom - Mrs. Atkinson was in the bar at that time, but I think Mr. Atkinson was in the tap-room; as Swan took the watch from her bosom Phillips held his hand out to get hold of it, but I took it from him - after I got the watch I put Swan into the passage, and sent for assistance, because I had been ill-used before by taking persons out of that house; the landlord sent a boy to the station for assistance, and a man came and kept the people back while I took her out - Davis claimed her as his wife in the public-house - Atkinson and his wife were there; Davis took hold of her gown, and said, "Come away, are not you coming home?" he said she was his wife - he pulled me by the sleeve, but used no violence there; when I had got Swan twenty or thirty yards from the house, Johnson came behind and hit me on the back of the head; I had heard no charge against him then - I called for a Policeman, and Gladwell took him - Garness came to the watch-house; he said the watch did not belong to him, and raved about it, so that as last he went into a fit - before that he was sensible, and knew what he was doing - when Johnson struck me he sprang the rattle for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Have you heard Mrs. Atkinson's evidence? A. I have - on my oath she told me to stop Swan; Garness came to me after the parties were fully committed, and said, "Some of their friends have been to me, what am I to do? "I said, "You are bound over to appear, and may do as you like;" he said something about being afraid that he should lose his place in consequence of the time it would take - the public-houses are open till twelve o'clock; we have no orders to prevent it - Mrs. Atkinson's name was struck from the back of the indictment, by the clerk, at the time we were sworn, as she was gone away ill in a coach; she was present when the bill went before the Grand Jury, but was not called -I did not know what she would state; she contradicted me before the Magistrate, respecting Swan's coming out of the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How long were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170114"/>you in the house? A. I dare say ten minutes altogether; when I got a certificate from the Magistrate, Phillips asked why I had two papers; I said one was a certificate for 3s. 6d. a day - he did not tell me he had seen Johnson's hands come from the prosecutor's pocket, and that he took the purse from him, till next morning.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was in Chiswell-street, and met a boy coming to the station - he sent me to the Boot, where I found Peak, who asked me to keep the people away while he got Swan out; when he a few steps from the door, he called out - I went up, and saw Johnson strike him once or twice on the back of the head - I secured him; Davis was on the spot, and I received several blows from somebody.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK MILES. I am a Policeman. Atkinson's servant fetched me from the station; I found Johnson in Gladwell's custody - Davis said I should not take him away, as he was his brother, and I took him for attempting to rescue Johnson; Atkinson and his brother forfeited their recognizances yesterday against another prisoner.</p>

               <p>Swan's Defence. What the prosecutor has sworn is false - it is not in my nature to do any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence. I came out of the tap-room to go home, and during that time two men whom I knew came in, and we had something to drink at the bar; while it was being poured out the other two prisoners came out to the bar, and partook of what I was drinking - a man named Sadler came out; he had been singing - he stood there talking: a scuffle eusued in the tap-room, but I never moved from the bar - a watch was kicked out of the tap-room; the female prisoner took it up - I never offered to go from the bar till she was taken out; I then went to see where she was going - the Policeman then collared and dragged me away; the prosecutor was very much intoxicated - the Policeman said I was taken for an assault; they said nothing about the purse. In the morning, at the office, the prosecutor said to the Policeman, "Is that the woman?" he touched him with his elbow, and said, "Yes, and these are the two men - you must mind what you say, or they will get off," and then they charged us all with the robbery.</p>
               <p>CHARLES NUTT. I live in Holywell-lane. I went into the Boot at ten o'clock on the night in question, and saw the prosecutor, who I have known for years, sitting between two young men, singing; he told me he had been to sea - he was a little intoxicated: I told him his master wanted to speak to him outside, as he had the key of the stable, thinking if I got him out he might be induced to go home - Phillips was not in the room then; several songs were sang - I saw him drink three glasses of gin, which two young men gave him, and several times he drank out of different pots of porter; I then tried to prevail on him to go home, but he said, "Mind your own business," and that he would cut my head with a quart pot; he called for more gin - one of the men who sat on his right, called for a quartern, and poured out a glass - he was so tipsy he could scarcely take it; the prisoners were not those men when I went in the male prisoners were at the further end of the room, at some distance from him; the young men put the gin to his mouth; he drank some, and some he spilt down his clothes - he then began to sing another song- there was no room for me to sit; I stood at the tap-room door, and had another pint of half-and-half; Swan and Johnson asked a young man who had sung to come and have something to drink at the bar; nothing had been done to the prosecutor at that time, for I stood opposite him; Swan and Johnson left the room, and stood - I stood aside, opened the door, and let them out with two more young men; when they had been out about five minutes, three young men came into the tap-room, and took the seats they had left, by the fire-place, and in a few minutes the gas was put out - I thought it was done accidentally; I opened the door, and told Atkinson they were in the dark - he ran in with a light; I did not go into the room again, but sat on a table opposite the bar; when Atkinson took in the light I saw the prosecutor laying on the ground - Swan was then at the bar, drinking spirits, and Johnson had the measure in his hand, close to her; there was another young man with them - the tap-room was nearly full - as soon as the door was opened people rushed out into the street, and I saw the watch kicked out of the taproom; Swan stooped and took it up as she stood at the bar- it is impossible that she could have interfered in the robbery; she had left the tap-room for a quarter of an hour -Mrs. Atkinson said, "This woman has got the watch;" she was not going away - Atkinson did not say Stop her! the watch was open in her hand - the prosecutor said, "Give me the watch, and I will run away, for I will never give any body in charge;" a Policeman coming in saw her with the watch in her hand, and took her in charge by the bar; she never had the watch in her bosom, on my oath; it was in her hand, and partly in the prosecutor's hand - she was in the act of giving it to him when the Policeman came in; I was holding him at the time, for he could scarcely stand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What are you? A. A house-painter - I believe the prosecutor had his senses so as to know what he was saying - any body could hear what he said; I cannot say whether Mrs. Atkinson heard it - I was close to her, but she was the only person to take care of the bar - she might not have heard it; she said, "That woman has the watch," but that was not to the Policeman - it was before he came in; she said it to the prosecutor - I cannot say she did not say it again when the Policeman was there- I do not think she did.</p>

On the 11th of April, between three and four o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop together, and asked for some bonnet ribbon, and I served them; Lovell took several ribbons out of the drawer and unrolled them - she attempted to take one piece, but lost it the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170115"/>time, and at last she took it; Wild at last bought two yards, which she paid for - they went out; I went after them, brought them back, and Lovell dropped the ribbon in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.Can you recollect how many customers you had in the shop? A. Only one while they were there, to the best of my belief -Lovell took the ribbons out of the drawer, and gave them to the other prisoner, after unfolding them, and she put them into the drawer again, unfolded, so that the drawer was in confusion; Lovell reached over the drawer, covering it with her shawl, and took a ribbon, but caught my eye, and dropped it - she made a second attempt, and took it; I think she put it in her breast - I saw it drop from her when I brought them back.</p>
               <p>JAMES BLEECHMORE. I am an officer. I took them into custody; I took a basket from Lovell, and found in it another piece of ribbon, claimed by Mr. Rotherham.</p>

               <p>Lovell's Defence. I bought both pieces of ribbon in Rosemary-lane, of a young woman with carrotty hair, for 5s. 6d. - she said she would not sell one without the other; as I returned I met Wild, who asked me to go with her to buy some ribbon; I showed her mine, she did not like it -I went with her to a shop in Houndsditch; she bought two yards; I said I did not like it, and put her out of conceit of it, and she asked me to go into this shop to buy another.</p>

The prisoner was in our employ for about eleven months, and left on the 23rd of April - this receipt came into my hands, and was posted in my books as a genuine receipt; the prisoner was entrusted to take orders and receive money - I do not know Mr. Tutt's handwriting; the prisoner was in our employ at the date of the receipt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where did you get that paper? A.From a drawer in our counting-house, which our warehouseman and clerk have access to; it is an open drawer - I have only one customer named Tutt; his Christian name is John - there is no address in the receipt; I will swear the receipt is in the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not sold the goods to Tutt, this would be the readiest way to lead to a discovery? A. Yes, he generally writes his orders in his memorandum book, but this is a receipt; I should think the signature was not the prisoner's writing, but the body of it is.</p>
               <p>ROBERT JOHNSON. I am in partnership with Mr. Bird. Tutt is a customer of ours; part of the goods named in this receipt were delivered to us from Birmingham, on the 17th of February - the prisoner had told me before that he had an order for chisels from Tutt, of Wilstead-street; on the morning of the 18th, when he came, I told him the chisels had come, and he had better take them out with him - I afterwards found they were gone from the shelves; they must have been taken by the prisoner or our warehouseman - on the same evening the prisoner brought me this receipt, which it was his duty to do, if he had delivered the goods; he gave it me as the genuine receipt of Tutt - I put it into the drawer, or gave it to Mr. Bird - something having occurred afterwards respecting the prisoner's conduct, I delivered accounts to our customers - Tutt pointed out these articles as never having been ordered or received; I produced to him different receipts - he said this was forged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When goods were heavy, who took them out? A.Our porter; if more than 120l. worth of town business was done in a month with retail shops, the prisoner was to have a quarter per cent; he had 25s. a week certain; that sum has never been exceeded, and we owed him no commission - we never allowed him to purchase goods with our money - I never knew him take goods to customers, who had not ordered them, when intended for another customer who did not like them.</p>

            . I am overseer of St. Mary, Aldermanbury. I commenced giving the prisoner parochial relief on the 6th of April, 1831, and continued to do so till the 28th of March, when I went out of office - I paid her 3s. a week at first, and increased it on the 30th of November to 4s.; I have paid her altogether 10l. 8s., believing her to be chargeable on our parish - she presented herself as a pauper of that parish at the vestry, weekly - her name was in the book which was handed to me by my predecessor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROWE. Q. How are the entries made in that book? A.Weekly - the casual poor are entered in a different account; she made no representation to me, except coming with the other paupers, and taking the weekly allowance.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was she entered as a weekly pauper before you came into office? A. Yes, and I find, in 1830, an instrument was bought for her to go to work with.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BROWN. I am one of the parish officers of St. Mary, the Virgin, Aldermanbury - I came into office on the 4th of April.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know nothing of her settlement? A. No.</p>

I was in the country; I returned, in consequence of a letter from my wife - I found my house stripped, the children laying on a mattress, and all the furniture gone; it was represented by my wife that it was by a distress warrant; she gave me this paper - I went to the landlord, and have no reason to believe there was any authority for what was done; the prisoner called on the Tuesday morning following, and appointed to meet me at the landlord's house at eleven o'clock, previous to the goods being condemned - he failed in his appointment; there was no address on the inventory which he had left, and the landlord could not tell me where to go to him; I found him on the following morning at the sale-room - I had made an arrangement with the landlord on the Wednesday morning, and procured from him a written order for the delivery of my goods; I tendered it to the prisoner who refused, to give them up and said he should sell them - I attended the sale, and took an account of what each lot sold for - they fetched 5l. 6s.; the goods I charge him with taking, were not included in the inventory he left, but some of them I believe were sold; my rent was 2l. 8s, and was two or three days over due.</p>
               <p>DAVID EDWARDS. I am landlord of the premises. Parker owed me 2l. 8s., for rent, which ought to have been paid on the 1st of April; I authorized the prisoner to put a distress into the premises on the 5th of April, and signed his warrant, which is here.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PARKER. I know the articles I charge the prisoner with taking were in his possession; I saw them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170117"/>at the sale-room; they were lotted - some of them were sold but others were not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q.Were you residing in the house? A.I was in the country; I saw the goods at Mr. Bird's sale-room, in Whitechapel-road; when I presented the order to the prisoner, he refused to deliver them, and said they had been condemned the day before, for 2l. 7s. 6d.; there were all my goods there except a watercock and another article; he offered me the goods back for the 2l. 7s. 6d. on the Wednesday morning - I said Mr. Edwards had agreed with me to compromise the matter and showed him Mr. Edwards' order, but what he offered me were the goods in the inventory only.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did he say to that? A. He said he did not know what I meant by three half-blankets; he said there was an old flannel-gown - I then mentioned the chaise-cushion - he said he had done perfectly right, and it was of no use my bouncing him; he turned his back to me; I mentioned the whole of the articles which are in the indictment, and he gave me no further information -I then asked him for a copy of the condemned inventory; he pulled out a book, from which he ran over some items so quick I could not detect the articles I was in want of; I said I should expect an account of them; he said he should not give it me then, but would in proper time - he passed me in the street two or three days afterwards, and sent a man across the street with an account to me, but the articles I was in want of are not in it; it does not agree with the inventory, as it gives no enumeration of the goods at all - I do not think I could re-place all my property for less than 10l.; it sold for 5l. 6s., among brokers at the sale-room - I took down what the lots sold for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take it down? A. Yes, on this catalogue; I bought one or two lots, as we were in immediate want of them - the prisoner offered me the goods in the inventory if I would bring him 2l. 7s. 6d.; but the others he said he knew nothing about - I afterwards went to the office, and the Magistrate granted me a summons on a charge of taking away goods and not giving me an account, and likewise of not paying me over the surplus.</p>
               <p>LYDIA ELIZABETH PARKER. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner took away besides what are put down in the inventory, two quilts, a blanket, three half-blankets, a flannel dressing-gown, a chaise-cushion, a brass water-cock, and about three yards of carpet.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PARKER. I saw the chaise-cushion at the saleroom; it was not sold; I saw it there a week afterwards - the goods were openly displayed in the auction-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Who sold the goods? A.Mr. Bird; I did not see any money given to the prisoner; I did not apply to the auctioneer for the goods; I saw them at the time of the sale - but they were not in the sale-room this morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As there is no address on the inventory he left at your house, how did you know where to look for your goods? A. He has written on the bottom of it that the goods were impounded at Mr. Bird's - I had known the prisoner by sight before; this inventory does not mention the things stated in the indictment, but I believe they were all at the sale-room - I am not aware that any were omitted though they were not all sold: I believe it is regular for the auctioneer to receive the money, and hand it to the broker, who pays the landlord.</p>

               <p>DAVID EDWARDS re-examined. Q. What sum of money did you receive of the prisoner? A.This is the account he gave me (read) - "Goods condemned, 2l. 7s. 6d.; expences, 17s. 8d. - balance, 1l. 9s. 10d.;" this was before the sale - he gave me to understand that Mr. Wilmot took the goods at the condemned price; he did not render me an accountv of the proceeds of the sale; I was not at the sale - the prosecutor had the offer of the goods at the condemned price; I did not know that any goods were taken which were not in the inventory - I offered that if he brought me a sovereign and left me a few things, he might have the remainder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the inventory? A. Yes, and it was with reference to that that I offered him to restore his goods.</p>
               <p>MR. DONNE to JOSEPH PARKER. Q. Was Mr. Wilmot present when you were offered the goods back? A. I believe he was, but he was not close - the rooms are large; Mr. Wilmot denied that he had purchased the goods, but not in the prisoner's presence - the prisoner had admitted to me that he did not buy them, and at the sale he offered me part of the things back for what money I had in my pocket, at a price he chose to put upon them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he assumed to sell to you? A. Yes, my Lord, and he said that he had sold some of them, but I was at the sale to prove he had not sold them.</p>
               <p>MRS. PARKER re-examined. Q. How long before the prisoner came and made this inventory had you seen your things all safe? A. On the same day - I am sure I saw all the things named in the indictment; I told the prisoner my husband was out of town, and begged him to wait - he came in on the Thursday morning, and took the goods about tea time on Saturday; I went to the landlord - he said he could have nothing to do with it; it was in his broker's hand - I could not look at the inventory when he left, as my children were screaming - he left nothing but a mattress and a blanket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There might be an article or two which were omitted to be put down, but every article was placed at Mr. Bird's - I never went near them, nor touched them, till I went with Mr. Wilmot, and he condemned them- if you look at the inventory the prosecutor produces, you will see every article inserted - the cushion he speaks of, is regularly lotted as sundries, and sold with some other articles; I never received a single farthing, but the 2l. 7s. 6d. of Mr. Wilmot, from which I deducted the expences - I was taken to Lambeth-street, and the Magistrate dismissed the case; I then heard that there was a bill found against me, and I gave myself up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DUFFIELD. I am a broker's porter, and live in North-street, Whitechapel-road. I was employed by the prisoner to remove the goods from Mr. Parker's, about the 6th or 7th of April - I took them in a cart to Mr. Bird's sale-room; Anderson and I took the articles, which the prisoner told us to take - I did not see the prisoner take any thing himself; I had been in possession of the goods.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you or the other man move any thing, but what the prisoner told you? A. No; we left behind a mattress, a blanket, and several small articles of sundries<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170118"/>- I received a chaise-cushion from Anderson, and gave it to a man named Pole, who was loading the cart.</p>

I received the goods from these witnesses - I kept them till the day of condemnation; I was present when they were condemned by Mr. Wilmot, a broker - I saw an inventory in their hands; there were several people present, but I cannot say who - it took place in the second room; I looked out the lots, and Mr. Wilmot went round and put his price upon them; they then said they would go and look for Mr. Parker - I think this was on a Monday or Tuesday early in April; I saw Parker at the room the next day, with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Upon your oath, on whose account were the goods sold? A. That I cannot tell - I attended the sale, but did not look at the book; I do not know who had the money - I swear I never heard from the prisoner; there was a constable, but he did not come into the room - Mr. Wilmot's goods have been sold, and I believe he is gone to America.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no other appraiser but Mr. Wilmot - we went to some constable in Mile-end; I do not know his name.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. I am a labourer, and live at Enfield. I have known the prisoner from an infant; about half-past eleven o'clock that night, I was coming along the road, and heard somebody stepping in the road, or in Mr. Sander's premises; I stopped at the side of the road, and saw a man come out there, with a pot of some kind - he brought it across the road, and took the lid off; he held it up, and poured something out of it, which made a rattle - I made up to him - he put on the lid, jumped over the bedge, and away he run; I saw some potatoes in the road.</p>
               <p>SARAH SANDERS re-examined. Q.Were there any potatoes in the pot? A. My husband had been boiling potatoes in it, and put it outside with the potatoes in it.</p>

I was on duty at Fulham, on Thursday, the 12th of April, about ten o'clock at night; I know the house in question; it had been inhabited by Pearce's brother - I heard a noise of persons talking aloud; I went into the stable, and saw the prisoners there - Pearce was standing up, and the other three laying down: the lead I now produce was in a bag, under some straw - they did not appear to be asleep; I asked what they wanted there - Pearce said what did I want to know for, and that the premises were his; I said,"They don't belong to you now, but they did to your brother, and you must go along with me;" Clark, (who was with me), and I, took them into custody - I found this knife on Davis and another on Griffith.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you leave either of them behind? A. Yes, we left Davis, because he bid himself; the other three used violent language, and said they would have my life, but they afterwards went willingly, when my brother officer came in - I swear it was in the stable I saw them, it is not far from the shop- it does belong to the house; I know Pearce's brother had lived there a few days before - I found no lead on the prisoners - they were laying on it; we did not take the lead the first time - one of them threw a brick at me.</p>

            . (Police-constable V 138). I went in, and found this officer and three if not four of the prisoners were round him, making use of violent language to him - I cannot say there were four; I am certain there were three - the officer said he had a charge against them; I took two of them into custody - I afterwards went, and found Davis in the brick work of the forge; he made a noise sufficient to prove he was asleep - the place was narrow, and we had to drag him out by the heels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What interval elapsed before your return? A. I should think from half to three-quarters of an hour - Davis had that opportunity of absconding.</p>
               <p>DANIEL ALLSOP. I am a plumber, and live at Fulham. I fitted this lead to the middle gutter in the roof of Mr. Powell's house, at Fulham; it appeared to me to correspond with the place, and what was left, in all respects - it had been lately cut - there is about 1 1/2 cwt. or 1 1/2 cwt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could not say how long it had been cut? A. No, certainly - I think I had seen it on the building a month or six weeks before - one of these knives would cut lead, but not the other.</p>

             - I am nearly ten years of age. I was playing with Harriet Sulman, in Crown-street; the prisoner came and turned her round, unsnaped the beads from her neck, and gave them to a bigger boy, who was with him, and the prisoner ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? A. No, I was next door; I could see what he did - I am quite sure he gave them to another boy when he got to the top of the street; I saw a gentleman ran after him; I did not make any noise - I told the gentleman, and he came out when he heard the child cry; my father came home from chapel, and I went in with him, but I saw the prisoner give the heads to the other boy before I went in.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SIMPSON. I live in Crown-street. This witness called my attention to the prisoner; I pursued, and caught him running through Hoxton-square - I took him, and asked what he had done with the beads which he took from the child's neck - he said he knew nothing about them; I brought him back; he was identified by both the witnesses, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far do you live from the spot? A. Not above seven yards - I ran out as soon as I heard the child scream; it was about eight o'clock in the evening; there were a few boys in the square, but not running - there is a short turn from the street which I live in to the square; the beads were taken about thirty yards from the square - I saw the prisoner when he was about twenty yards from me; I did not lose sight of him.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM STEPHENSON. I live at Old Brentford. I attended a meeting of the Political Union at Brentford, on the 15th of May; we went to the One Tun - I had a large red silk handkerchief, spotted with white - we went from there to the Red Lion; I did not see the prisoners till I returned to the One Tun.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DUNKLEY. I live at <placeName id="t18320517-271-crimeloc1551">Old Brentford</placeName>

I was at the One Tun, and saw the prosecutor; I saw Bennett take a handkerchief from his pocket, and give it to Pawns, who put it into his flap - I told the prosecutor; he said,"I have not lost it," and just at that moment he was called out to take tea, and in going along he felt for his handkerchief, and found, as he says, a book instead - I could not see what sort of handkerchief it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROWE. Q. What time was the handkerchief taken? A. About half-past five o'clock; it was a public room; there might be sixty or seventy persons there- I took it to be a Belcher handkerchief, but I only saw the corner of it; the prosecutor did not put his hand into his pocket when I told him of it - he came back in about half an hour, and said he had lost it; I never said it would be more profitable for me to attend the Old Bailey, and get 5s. a day, than to follow my trade.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWE to WILLIAM STEPHENSON. Q. Where did you see Dunkley? A. At the One Tun - I knew him before the gave me notice that I had lost my handkerchief -I felt outside my pocket, and felt a book; I said I had not lost it - I afterwards found it had been stolen; it was a full sized silk handkerchief - I missed it about half an hour after I was told of it.</p>
               <p>Bennett's Defence. I went to the One Tun; I sat there till some person said that those who did not belong to the meeting, were to leave, and I got up and went away.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TAYLOR. I live with my father, who keeps a broker's shop at Old Brentford. I have known Bennett from his infancy; I have heard Dunkley say several times, that he should like to get a good job at the Old Bailey, to get his crown a day; and it would be a d-d sight better for him than to set upon his seat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is Dunkley? A. He is a kind of a translator of old shoes into new ones; he had made new shoes; I heard him say this two or three months back.</p>

             (Police-constable C 84). On the 3rd or 4th of May I went to where the prisoner lodged, in Oxford-buildings; I saw her daughter, who said her mother was out, and she had been out drunk all night - I sent her daughter to tell her I wanted to speak to her; she then absconded - I saw her in the street, but she ran from me; I afterwards took her from a brother-officer, and asked if she knew any thing of this robbery; she said No, but she had been out on the spree.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house on the last Friday in April, in Oxford-buildings: I slept there four nights - I came home on the 1st of May; I did not lodge with her that night, but I saw her that night when she was going to bed - the next morning, before she was up, I gave her 2s. to get her children something to eat- I do not know the prosecutrix; the prisoner's husband is a pavior, and gone to work at Liverpool; they had no quarrel.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When was it you fell in with the prisoner, on the 30th of April or the 1st of May? A. On the 30th of April I met her in Oxford-street; I have had no quarrel with her - I had seen her once or twice in public-houses, and it being a disagreeable night, I took her in, and said I would give her part of my bed; when we got home, she said she disputed whether I was married to my husband, and I took the box in which my silver tooth-pick was in and showed her my certificate, and then she was satisfied - no one had access to my room, and I saw the articles safe when I went to bed; there are lodgers in the house, but they could not get into the room unless the bolt had been undone; I have never found any of the articles - I fell asleep about one o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170124"/>and did not awake till near six; I then missed the prisoner and the property - the door was closed; I do not know how she came to bring up the question about my being married.</p>

The prisoner lodged at my house; I remember the prosecutor coming - he went with her to the front room; they were there some time; the prisoner then went out for pork-chops; I saw some sovereigns in her hand, and said I hoped they did not belong to the man she brought into my place - Crouch, a man who had lived with the prisoner, came in - he knocked the prosecutor down, and I picked him up; he then knocked me down, and almost put my shoulder out - the prosecutor asked the prisoner for his money; she said if he wanted his money he might go elsewhere - he said he did not want to hurt her, he would be contented if she gave him one sovereign.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You saw him give me two sovereigns out of his pocket, when I went to get the chops? A. No, I did not; the usage he had from your young man was shameful; every thing I had in my room was broken to pieces.</p>

             (Police-constable K 61.) The prosecutor fetched me to the house - I found the prisoner there; he charged her with robbing him, and said the man had knocked him down; the prisoner came to the table, took up a knife, and said, "If you charge me with such a sort of thing, I will stick you, or rip you open;" she said the prosecutor gave her the money, and he denied it - I found no money on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor; we went to another house, and I slept with him - the next morning he asked me to go with him and get some money.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I slept with her the night before, but I paid her half a sovereign - she tore the pocket off my new jacket.</p>

I am robbed of all my money" - next day they went to a fortune-teller, then got the Bible, and turned it on me- as to the certificate, she knew I had got it, for I picked it up with some papers which the prosecutor tore; she told me to take care of it - the woman who slept in the room is not bed-ridden.</p>

On the evening of the 17th of May, between eight and nine o'clock, in consequence of what Farris said, I went over to No. 38 with a person who was then in my shop; I found the door ajar; I stood on one side, and the other person on the other, and in a few minutes we saw the prisoner coming out of the shop, with some tools under his arm, and some before him; I said,"My friend, what do you do here? who are you? do you work for Mr. Sawyer?" he said, "Yes, I am Mr. Sawyer's man;" I sent for Mr. Sawyer and the Policeman - the prisoner managed to lay the tools down on the bench, close inside the door - the officer came, and took him.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARRACK. I went to the door with Ferris, and what he has stated is correct; when the prisoner came to the door, and we asked what he was going to do with the tools, he shifted them before him - I said, "Where are you going?" he said, "I am going out;" I said,"Not out of here till somebody comes" - the officer took the same tools which the prisoner had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you take two head planes to the station-house, and then say they were not them? A. I took none; the officer took two small planes at first, and then I said there were two larger planes, which he had in his hand - I went back, and pointed them out to the officer.</p>

On the 30th of April I returned home, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening; I had gone out at half-past nine in the morning, leaving all my property safe - when I returned I missed the property stated - the value of all I lost was 120l. - have seen nothing since but the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How was your property secured? A. My pocket-book was in my trunk, which was locked - the trunk was broken open, and the pocket-book was gone; my Christain names are Francois Ambrose, but I always sign Francois Rameau - I am not certain how it is on my passport.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you known by the name of Francois, or have you used in this country the name of Ambrose? A. On particular occasions I call my name Ambrose.</p>
               <p>MARY BENSON. I am landlady of the house in which the prosecutor has lodged for upwards of five years. I remember his going out on the morning of the 30th of April - I was in his room that day, about five o'clock in the afternoon - it appeared all secure, but I am not in the habit of looking over his wardrobe - the door was shut and locked; I sent a person up to his room about a quarter-past nine o'clock, to light the fire - she came down immediately, and I went up to the room; I found the door unlocked, but shut - I had the key myself; the person who got in must have opened the door with another key - I missed the property; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who went into the room at a quarter-past nine o'clock? A. A person I had to assist me; I had given her my key, and she called me up - she only just went up stairs and came down again.</p>

I was going away from her; a crush of five or six men and women then came from across the street, and crushed me into a passage; I did not see Bayley then - I was struck three or four times, and was crushed on through a narrow passage into a yard full of carts and waggons; when I got there Hyde struck me through the hat, over the head, I think with his fist; it was a heavy blow; I called out Murder! and got into a corner of the yard; I said, I would blow the first man's brains out who came near handy, but I had no pistol - the Policeman came to my assistance, and Hyde was taken to the station; Bayley was brought in in about two hours, and two or three other women - I had remained at the station, and I recognized her as the person who met me in the street; I had two glasses of gin and water, one at eight o'clock, and the other at half-past eleven, in Mile-end-road; I had been with Mr. Harris, of Morgan-street, and left the public-house at half-past eleven - I had then two sovereigns, a half-crown, a sixpence, and four shillings, in my right hand pocket - I paid one shilling then for two glasses of gin and water, and counted my money - this was half an hour before I went to Wentworth-street; I missed my money in the yard where the carts and waggons were; and I had a memorandum-book cut out of my pocket - I missed my money about three minutes after Hyde struck me; I did not miss my book till ten o'clock the next day, and my right hand coat pocket was cut - I had not been with any other person after I left the station-house; I observed my right hand coat pocket was cut, and the book was gone - I staid at the station-house two hours, and then went home; I was not conscious at the time of losing my money; I was defending myself; I had not spoken to any one from the time I counted my money till I lost it - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Hyde. I was coming down the street and heard a cry of Murder! I went into the yard with a light, and asked what was the matter with you. Witness. He did not come till after the officer came.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOLTON (Police-constable H 87). I was on duty in Wentworth-street, and heard a noise in the yard -I went to the gates; they were fastened - they are rail gates; you can see through them; there is an access to the yard through Mr. Sheen's house; I went through Wass' shop, and found the prosecutor and Hyde there - the prosecutor said, "Take this man into custody for robbing me;" I went into the yard; they were talking, but I cannot say what about - Hyde seemed much exaxperated and endeavoured to strike the prosecutor, which I preveuted - the prosecutor had been drinking, but he walked on before us, and seemed to know what he was doing; there are two houses in the yard - Hyde lives in one of them; the prosecutor could have gone through the passage of Sheen's house, which is open, and they take in lodgers - I found only 1s. 5d. on Hyde - I got a key, and searched his house, but found nothing; I saw some dust or dry dirt on the prosecutor's side.</p>
               <p>JOHN WHITE (Police-constable H 180). I received information from Bolton, and took Bayley at the end of Rose-lane, with two other females, an hour and a half after this happened - the prosecutor said she was the woman - nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>MARY WASS. I am the wife of Leonard Wass - we keep a shop in Wentworth-street. About half-past twelve o'clock I heard a cry of Murder! I went to the door, and Hyde came to me; he went to Mrs. Sheen, who desired him to get a light, and see what was amiss in the yard; he came to me, and I gave him a light; there is a passage through Sheen's house, for the convenience of persons living in the yard - Hyde lives in one; that is the passage which the prosecutor describes as being forced through; my house is a part of Sheen's; I could not hear any one pass through that passage, as there is a tenement between - I went to the yard with another candle, after Hyde; I saw the prosecutor there, holding a bridle, which was tied to the van - his dress was disorded; the Policeman was with him - before I left my house I heard a voice my"Murder! Murder! I will shoot, I will, by G-D."</p>

               <p>COURT to GUY PICKERING. Q. What light was there at the time you were struck? A.There are large gates, with rails on the top - I had my back towards the light from the street; as Hyde came towards me from the inner part of the yard, I could see his face -I am positive it was him; when I cried Murder! he went off directly; he was a minutes or two in my presence before he struck me - I saw him coming to strike me, and I struck to keep him off - I am not mistaken in his person.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOLTON re-examined. Q. Does it appear to you that in the spot in which the prosecutor was he could discover, by the light of the street, the person and features of a man? A. Yes; they are rail gates - there is a gas-light opposite, and with his back to the gates the light would he shown on the face of a person opposite -Hyde had a light.</p>

I left the public-house with the prosecutrix, and was on my way home - I did not perceive that the prisoner was following us, till she struck the prosecutrix; there were two women with her - I saw her strike the prosecutrix, and she fell from the blow; the prisoner snatched her shawl from her shoulders, and threw it to the two women, who ran up one of the turnings towards St. Giles' - I believe it is George-street; one of the women caught the shawl; it did not fall I have not said before that it did; I said I believed it was Plumtree-street, but it was not; the prisoner ran off - I called Police! and she was stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not get half a yard away; we both fell together. Witness. No; the prisoner did not fall - I said I should know one of the women who was with her.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, and live in Rose-street, Long-acre; I was two or three yards behind the prosecutrix - I saw the prisoner make a rush at her; she knocked her down, snatched her shawl, and ran off with it; I pursued, and she threw it to two girls on the pavement - she was running in the road, and did not stop for a moment - I caught her about two hundred yards off - she said, "Sir, what have I done?" I said,"Knocked a woman down, and stolen her shawl" - she begged of me to let her go; I said I would not till the persons came up, which they did in about two minutes - a Policeman came up, we stated the affair to him and he took her; I had been at the public-house with the prosecutrix and her husband; there was a dance there - I do not remember seeing the prisoner there; there was some disturbance, but I do not know what; there had been no insult to the prisoner by any of our party; I did not see any one strike her at all, or call her an improper name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not all quarrel together in the public-house, and strike me and use me very shamefully? A. I do not recollect seeing you at all - there was a little disturbance about dancing, and the prosecutrix said it was not a fit place for us to be in, and we went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These people and I were at the public-house; we had some words, and they all struck me as I was coming down the passage - I then came down the street, and saw the prosecutrix and her friends - she said,"Here is the street-walker, whom we had words with in the public-house;" I said I was no such thing - she then struck me; I defended myself as well as I could - all her friends were about her; I had my cap and handkerchief and all torn off - as to the shawl I am innocent; I had no person with me.</p>
