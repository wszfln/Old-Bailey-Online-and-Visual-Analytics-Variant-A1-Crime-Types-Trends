               <p>Q. Had you pull'd your cloaths off when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Richards. I had, my Lord. I had my watch and money in my pocket after I had put my cloaths on again. There was another girl in the house, I told her I would give her sixpence if she would go up stairs along with me, so we went to bed together in the same bed, and I locked the door, and put my breeches quite under the middle of the bed. When I awaked in the morning I found my breeches lying on the bed, I search'd them and found that my watch and money were gone. I search'd about the bed and found two shillings in it, I miss'd half a guinea in gold; then I saw there was a door stood a-jarr, there was a little table stood before it which was shov'd back into the room; this door open'd into the room where the prisoner lay, out of which there was a way down stairs, which I did not know of when I went to bed. I call'd to the man of the house, he came to me, I told him the case, so he sent for a constable, and would not let the girls go out of the house till he came; the constable took six of them to the Round-house; there was another girl but she was ill, besides the man's wife, these two were left behind. The six girls were all search'd but nothing found upon them; they were taken before Justice Fielding, and all denied knowing of the watch or money; the Justice wrote a mittimus to send them all to Bridewell, and as they were going along the prisoner said, she knew were the watch was, and would tell if I would release her. We took her back to the Justice, I there heard her say, it was put into a hole in the feather bed where she lay, in the next room to where I lay. The Justice ask'd her, whether any body was with her when she took the watch; she said, no body at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had the watch, and half guinea, when you went to bed with the other girl?</p>
               <p>Richards. I am certain I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner was when you went to bed the second time?</p>
               <p>Richards. No, my Lord, I don't. She could come into her own room without coming into the room where I lay.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she lay in that room?</p>
               <p>Richards. She said she laid there. Then she said, she gave the watch to another girl that lay with her, and she hid it. The Justice order'd the constable to go and search that place; when he was gone the other girl said, the prisoner had put it into a hole in the bolster; then the Justice sent another person to bid the constable search the bolster.</p>

Then he pull'd out a sixpence, and drank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230005"/> to another man. I went out at the door and he followed me; he ask'd me to go to an inn, and said, he would have some wine, and pay for a bed for us; then he wanted to know where I lodged, so he went with me; we drank some rum, then he went up stairs, paid a shilling for his bed, and gave me a shilling to go to bed with him. I went into bed but left him directly, so he had another young woman, and he gave her sixpence. I saw a green string, and thought it would make me a topknot, so I gave it to another woman; the next morning we were taken before a Justice, she told me the watch was in the bolster of a bed, I told the Justice as soon as she told me so.</p>

I went with the person, the prisoner was coming with the pail on his head in a bag with some dock leaves, his sister had two sauce-pans in her apron; I stop'd the prisoner, and catch'd him in several stories about the things, so I carried him before the sitting alderman, he order'd me to carry him to the Compter, and advertise the things, which I did; the man came and described the pail and swore to it, and the woman to one of the sauce-pans.</p>

               <p>My brother is foreman to a nightman, we were together in Hounsditch ; a soldier was coming along, he said, do you want a jobb ; said I, cockey, I shall be glad of a jobb. Said he, will you carry this bundle (what was in the bag I did not know ) I was to carry it into the Minories; when I came into the middle of Hounsditch I saw him talk to a Jew woman, I cross'd the turning he was to turn up; when I came into Shoemaker-row he bid me set them down, I laid them on a stall; he staid a pretty while, so I went to him, and said, come cockey, don't hinder me in another jobb, I cannot spend the whole day with you; he and the woman was as near together as I am to your worship. The mob gather'd round me, and which way he and the woman went I don't know.</p>

Although he had bad them so long he did not advertise them. I found a handkerchief at a pawn-broker's by the prisoner's direction pawn'd for 1 s. 6 l. at the Angel in Shoreditch.</p>

               <p>Colston. I don't know that: As the person struck me, he said, D - n you, I'll teach you to go to the watch-house. I had been there and enquired what it was o'clock, and I was apprehensive of these people; at that time the watchmen were out calling the hour. I was down some minutes, and lost some money, but had none forcibly taken out of my pocket, they took my watch and hat. I went to a house where there was a light, it was a night-house, and described the prisoner; they said, they had seen such persons about; I staid there, the next morning about eight or nine o'clock the prisoner came, I took hold on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he was one of them?</p>
               <p>Colslon. I am, my Lord?</p>

               <p>Colslon. There was no light but what the lamps afforded, which was enough to discern a person's face. The prisoner went with me and told me where my hat was sold, and I redeemed it, it was in Field lane at a brokers. The hat was produced in court and depos'd to. Then I came back with him, and made a sad piece of work about my watch; he said, he knew nothing of it, but he believed the other people did: I said, I would immediately send for a constable : a woman that seem'd to be a woman of the town came and send, sir, does this belong to you, which was my watch, I gave her a graturity for it; the prisoner said, he was very glad I had got it again, so I gave him a dram, and sixpence or a shilling, and let him go about his business; he has since been retaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the watch?</p>
               <p>Colston. It is in the country, I left it at Epsora races: I was sent for to Justice Fielding's when he was there, and knew him to be the man.</p>

            . When the prisoner was taken before Justice Fielding, about the 4th or 5th of May, he confessed that he, a chimney-sweeper, and an other person did this robbery. He wanted to be admitted an evidence. Mr. Fielding ask'd him in what manner it was done? He said he had the hat and hat-band, but did not know any thing of the watch; the others slung him of that; that it was done in Fleet-market; that he knock'd the gentleman down, being one of the three. The gentleman said there, he was the man that knock'd him down.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these glasses, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>S. May. They are my husband's property. I lived at the Lebeck's head in Catharine's-street, going from thence I deposited them in a lumber room in <placeName id="t17510523-13-crimeloc73">Denmark court</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you certain they were carried to Mr. Love's?</p>
               <p>S. May. I am certain they were, and Mrs. Jones the prisoner used to lie in the room where they were put. Mrs. Kelso came to me one day to ask me her character, then I had missed the glasses, and told her, I had lost them and other things. She said, if I would go along with her, she would help me to the sight of the glasses.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house do you keep?</p>
               <p>S. May. I keep a private house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Evans ?</p>
               <p>S. May. I never saw him till one time Mrs. Jones told me he was her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember there was a trial against Kelso for these very glasses?</p>
               <p>S. May. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you here at that time?</p>
               <p>S. May. I was, and gave my oath they were my husband's property. If Mr. May had been here he would have had them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you took your oath?</p>
               <p>S. May. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you frequently with this woman after you miss'd these glasses?</p>
               <p>S. May. No, sir, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep your goods at Mr. Love's?</p>
               <p>S. May. I kept them there seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lock to the door where you kept them?</p>
               <p>S. May. No, sir, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray tell us the reason you left that house call'd the Lebeck's head ?</p>
               <p>S. May. Because we had money enough to live upon, and it was too much business for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Come tell me, was it, or was it not, for your safety, at the time the bawdy houses were attempted to be pull'd down?</p>
               <p>S. May. No, sir, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there again since?</p>
               <p>S. May. Because the house is our own, I don't sell any thing now.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not there an action brought against Kelso at the court of Common pleas by your husband for these very glasses?</p>
               <p>S. May. I believe there is.</p>

Her husband asked me, if ever I lived in a bawdy house; said I, I never did; then, said he, if you go with her you must, for she never kept any thing else; then, said I, I hope you'll excuse me, for I don't choose to go in such a way of life; she insisted upon my going and would not discharge me, and said, if I would not, she would swear any thing against me. She always said the prisoner was an extreme good servant, and she would recommend her to any thing in her power. I have seen her in Mrs. May's company early and late; she has sometimes been brought home by the porter so drunk that she could not stand.

[He looked upon them in court, and said, they were the same, or like them.] I saw him pay the money for them. This was in March was twelve months.</p>

I gave my wife the child and went up to them; they had each of them hold of it. I took and shook it in again. The prisoner swore, d - n his eyes, he'd knock my brains out. I bid my wife go before me; when I had gone 20 or 30 yards, on a sudden I received a blow on the back part of my head, which knocked me down. I got up and missed my hat; I went into a distiller's shop at the corner of Drury-lane, and desired I might leave my wig there, it being dirty. My wife was crying out, murder! thieves! the rogue in a white coat has knocked my husband down. I followed the prisoner down Drury-lane ; a person met and stop'd him; there came a watchman, he would not assist us, he got away. The day after I found him at the King's head, the corner of Monmouth-street.</p>

            . I was with my husband going home that night between 10 and 11 o'clock; the youngest apprentice was lighting us. My husband was knock'd down at the corner of the brandy shop by the prisoner. I saw him as he was going to strike the blow, it was with his fist. When my husband was down the prisoner took his hat from the ground, then he came and snatched the handkerchief from my child's neck, as it was in my arms, and struck me up against a bulk, and swore he would knock my eyes out; he wrap'd it up and put it into his right hand pocket and run away down Drury-lane; he was stop'd near a window.

            . I am fourteen years old. I was coming lighting master and mistress along, the prisoner came and said something to me, I can't tell what, I think it was, what, are you going to run the flambeaux in my face. I said to him, I cannot as I hold it; I had got it underhanded with the light downwards; he immediately blew it out and took hold of it; my master came and took it and shook it in; then we went on about twenty or thirty yards I believe; the prisoner came up and struck my master over the top of his head and knock'd him down with his fist, and fell upon him; my master's hat fell from his head, the prisoner got up, took it, and ran down Drury-lane; my mistress cry'd out, stop thief, the man in the white coat has knock'd my husband down and robb'd him. I did not see him take any thing from my mistress. A man coming along stop'd the prisoner, their heels slip'd and they broke two panes of glass at a window, I knew him to be the man; we call'd a watchman, he would not lay hold of him, so he got off, but was taken the next day.</p>

            . I keep a distiller's shop, and live at the corner of Drury-lane. I remember the prosecutor's coming to my house that evening, the 6th of May, he laid a wig down on the compter. I said, pray friend take your wig away, I'll suffer no disturbance in my shop. He said, I'll return and give you all the satisfaction you can desire. There was a prodigious noise abroad. He went out; I look'd out, and saw him and another man had hold of the prisoner at the bar. They charged him with a robbery. After this the prosecutor's wife came into my shop, and beg'd I'd take hold of her child, for her husband would be murder'd. She laid her child down, went out again, and immediately return'd with her husband and apprentices, and several other people. She said to him, have you lost your watch? He said he had lost nothing but his hat, which was knock'd off his head. At the same time he brought a dirty hat and wig, and laid them on the compter, saying, if that hat and wig were enquir'd for, he would then find out the man who had robb'd him. Then his wife seem'd to be in a great fright, saying, she had lost her bundle. I said, it is here. She open'd it and said nothing was lost. Said I, have you lost any thing else? She said, no. The child was wrap'd up in a petticoat, and a cloak round it; it had nothing about it's neck, neither did it appear by the bundle as though it had had a handkerchief about it. She desir'd I'd take notice that she had lost nothing.</p>

We sold the watch to Dowdell, the chain belonging to it was a metal one, he gave that to Talbot.

The prosecutors watch produced in court and deposed to. We asked Dowdell where the gold watch was; he said he had robbed a gentleman in the morning, in company with Quinn, Cullin and Talbot, and gave us directions were to find them; we took Cullin at the French-horn on the Sunday night; the next day we took Quinn at a lodging house in Newtoner's-lane ; upon our shewing him the silver watch, he desired to be carried to a justice to be admitted an evidence; he acknowledged the fact and several others, he committed in company with the prisoners and the evidence: he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230012"/> gave some of my acquaintance an account of Talbot, and he was taken by one Field.

            . I live at captain Collet's facing this hosier's shop, the 8th of May I saw the prisoner at the bar an hour and a half at an Apothecary's shop door which joins the hosier's shop. I wondered what made him stand there so long. I went out about business, the prisoner looked every way, he looked full in my face as I went out, and as I came back, my old lady said to me, do you know that man; no, said I, but I shall know him again, for I thought he would have stared his eyes out. I saw the prisoner go by the hosier's shop and look in, the little boy was there; the prisoner went back again and set his foot upon the Apothecary's scraper at the door, put his hand over the grating and took a parcel of stockings of light greys and other colours, a pretty big bundle with a pair of stockings tied round them, he put them under his arm: I said that man has robbed the stocking shop; he ran away.</p>

I and another went and took him, Hall was along with him; we went by Hall's direction to an empty house in Rag-fair and found some of the goods. The evidence said the prisoner put them there, but he denied it.</p>
               <p>George Hall. The prisoner and I agreed to go out a house breaking, we went out the 23d of April to break open this china shop in Whitechapel, we had things on purpose for such work, we went betwixt twelve and one at night, we first try'd to break the window shutter in halves, we could not take it out at that time, the watchmen were going about; we left it, and came at past one o'clock and broke it and took it out, I put it in the middle of the kennel; the prisoner broke a pane of glass, he first took out three tea pots, I had a bag in my hand to put the things in; then he took out five fish strainers, six tumblers made of glass, and a quantity of china, I cannot say how much, because we broke a good many; there was a china tea-pot, two little china plates, and a square plate; I stood in the path when the watchman was coming by, I carried the bag cross the way and the prisoner followed me so we carried them to our lodgings; we got up about four o'clock next morning, and gave two women sixpence a piece to carry them to a place in Duke's-place where we used to sell our things; they were sold to Minous, a Jew, the prisoner grumbled at the price and would not take the money. After that I heard we were likely to be taken, I had a mind to leave this sort of life off, and hearing he was going to hang me I then thought to hang him, so I came voluntarily and made a discovery. As he would not let the Jew have the things he took and put them into an empty house in Ragfair, then I sent for the people directly; this prisoner has hang'd two men here before. Brebrook carried us before the Justice, the prosecutor came there. I was admitted an evidence against

               <p>Rogers. Yes, my lord, there was another woman that sat at a distance. The people without were breaking open the door at that time, to let her out. A man got in and said, do you come here to breed a riot with my wife; he got hold of a glass bottle, with which he struck me, cut a hole in my hat, wounded my head, and knock'd me down; other people put up the window, and threw stones at me. I have that man in the Compter now who abused me. One person brought an iron poker; then they called out for knives, &amp;c.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Going my round about a quarter after ten this night, the prosecutor call'd to me, saying he had been abus'd and robb'd in such a place. He was all over blood. I went directly to the house, and could find no person in it but the fellow that is in the Compter now. The prosecutor gave me charge of the man, I carried him to the watch-house, and delivered him to the constable; then I went to the house again to secure any body I should find there. I brought up the man's wife next. Then I took assistance and went again, and met the prisoner in the court, much in liquor. I had seen her before at that house, so I took her to the constable. The man and she were sent to the Compter, and the prosecutor also.</p>

            . My husband is a labouring-man. I had been to get him some radishes, and stop'd to see the prosecutor struggling with two women, upon which I turn'd to see who the women were, but they were gone. I ask'd the prosecutor if he knew them. He said no; I might be the woman that took his watch for what he knew.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did you say so to any body?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, my lord; I said before my lord mayor, I should know the woman again if I saw her.</p>

            . I live in the next court to that where this was done. About nine o'clock that night, passing by, I heard a great hubbub, and some women who stood by say a man had been robb'd, which is usual in that court; upon which I stop'd, and saw the prosecutor come out with a stick in his hand; it look'd like a rocker of a cradle; he was very fuddled, and wav'd it about his head, saying he was robb'd, and swore in a vulgar manner, he would kill every woman he met till he found the woman that robb'd him. His head was not broke then, it was broke some time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230016"/> after that. A neighbour said to him, you should go to the place where you have been robb'd, and see for the woman. He answered, he did not know the woman if he met her, but he would have his watch.</p>

               <p>Watchman. What this woman speaks of was before I came; when I came he was very outrageous, and all on a gore blood.</p>

               <p>Weacher. No, my Lord, he was not: He told me his quarters was a long way from the Parade, so he gave me ninepence per week for his lodgings; he staid till he ow'd me six shillings and threepence; I had let this house to another person; I ask'd him for the money the 26th of Feb. he got up Thursday the 27th, saying, he was going to get the money for me, and would be back by ten o'clock but he did not return: I had occasion to go up into the room where I lie to my chest of drawers and found them broke open, I miss'd my wife's gold watch, a silver snuff-box, a silver stock-buckle, and a guinea in gold: I left the house on Saturday morning and went to my lodgings I had taken in Long-Acre: After this I took all the opportunities I could to find the prisoner, about a month after I saw him upon duty at St. James's Gate; I ask'd him when he intended to pay me the money; he said he had been seeking after me, saying, his father had sent him 27 l. and he had received it at Deptford, and that he would come the Saturday after, but did not come: He told me where he lodged, so on the Monday I went there, he was not at home, I told the landlady I had been a great sufferer by him: He deserted, and was taken up as a deserter and sent to the Savoy about three weeks after: I went to him and ask'd him for the things, he told me, if I would pay the money that was taken upon the watch I might have it again, and that it was at the Blue-anchor at Deptford, the man's name

               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came by the watch?</p>
               <p>Weacher. He told me my wife had made him a present of it, but I told him it was out of her power so to do, as I had the key of the drawers in my pocket, and she had been gone to the lodgings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife absent herself from you?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never suspect her going away to live with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Weacher. No, I never did: I have no other reason than to think her a virtuous woman. I liv'd there with her till I took another publick house in Soho, Warder-street, which I enter'd upon about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your wife now?</p>
               <p>Weacher. She is still in the lodgings. She was well bred and a publick house is not agreeable to her.</p>

I went with Cockborne's wife, for she pawn'd it, and found there was 4 l. 16 s. upon it with the interest: The man said it had been there five or six weeks: Said I, was it ever advertised? he said, no; the woman desir'd I would pay the money and take the watch out to get it sold to the best advantage; I never saw the prisoner before now to my knowledge. I took it out and carried it to a watchmaker in Deptford, and ask'd him to value it; he said it was very much out of repair, and valued it at 9 l. I gave 10 l. 1 s. for it, and it cost 10 s. 6 d. mending.</p>

            . I came into the house the prosecutor went out of, the prisoner had a room of me, he had lodged with me about three weeks when this thing happened. After the prosecutor had been to ask for him after the thing was done, I heard the prisoner say, he never had any thing of the prosecutor's wife in his life; the prisoner had let me look at the snuff-box, and my little boy had once fetch'd a halfpenny worth of snuff in it; the prisoner left the lodgings upon this, and I did not see him after till I saw him in the Gatehouse : I heard him own to the things, and said the prosecutor should have them again. He sent word the chain was buried under ground.</p>

               <p>I came a little after Christmas to lodge in the prosecutor's house, the man himself having several times invited me to it; it was my fate to have the landlady to take a regard for me, telling me at different times, that her husband was a very barbarous man, used her ill, and that she could not live in a civil way with him: She made offers to me, and said, it I would go and take private lodgings she would accompany me: I might have agreed to that, but finding her inclinations to drink I took a disgust at her; but on the Sunday in the afternoon before she went away she call'd me up to her own room, and said, I am going away, and shall take one child with me, for I cannot live agreeable with my husband: She said, take you this, and gave me the gold watch and silver snuff box, and said, if I would accept of her invitation her life would be more agreeable to her: After I was in the Savoy the prosecutor sent me word, if I would restore the things he would make it up with me: I told him, I did not think proper to make him restitution for things that were given me as innocent presents: I told him also, the watch was at the Blue-anchor at Deptford, put there by a friend of mine; I gave it to a person as I was upon duty, who gave it to Mrs. Cockborne to sell or pledge it upon my own account, thus it came to the Blue-anchor at Deptford.</p>

I stood still directly. He searched my pocket, and took out my iron snuff-box, a linen handkerchief, penknife, and a half-penny. I had no more money about me; at that time there was a coach coming by; he made off backwards towards Lincoln's-inn fields. The coach rais'd my spirits a little ; I went after him, and catch'd him by the coat behind; then he put his arm over his shoulder, and snap'd the thing he had got in his hand : then I gave him a cant with my heel, got him down, and clap'd my knee on his right arm, and held the other with my right hand, and kept my left hand on his collar to hold him down, and call'd watch! A watchman came presently, who desired me to hold him while he called another watchman, which he soon did. I bid them take care of him, saying, I feared he had something about him that would do mischief. We carried him to the watch-house, the watchmen searched him, and found my things upon him. Produced in court and deposed to. And we likewise found the thing I took to be a pistol, (it was a tobacco-pipe case for the pipe to shove in at the end, the bowl shut in with a hinge in halves, and a small wire spring; so that at shutting it down hastily it would snap like a steel tobacco-box. It was about nine or ten inches long, not much unlike a pistol.)</p>

            : On the 11th of this month, about a quarter after twelve at night, I saw the prisoner on the top of the house, we caled to him and desir'd him to come down, but he would not answer us: I told him I would shoot at him if he would not : I said to Lownes, do you go on the other side the house that he may not escape; I suppose the prisoner thought we were both gone; he came nearer me, I said, if he did not speak I would shoot at him, but he would not. I shot and hit him on the leg with small shot, then he would not come down, so I was obliged to get a ladder and go up, he sat between a tree and a window; when we got him down it was after two o'clock, we found no lead upon him, there was a sack, and we took a knife out of his pocket, the sack lay in a gutter, that he denied.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing?</p>
               <p>James. He did, that he had been there four or five times, and carried lead away, and sold it one time for four shillings, but he did not confess what quantity he took away each time.</p>

The prisoner at the bar was one on horseback; he ordered me to stop, and pull'd a pistol out of his right hand pocket; the man that was on foot jump'd up to my horse, and seiz'd upon my pistols before me. I offer'd to lay my hands on one of them, which the prisoner at the bar seeing, said, if you offer to do so I'll blow your brains out. He ordered me to dismount, and demanded my money: when I dismounted, the other man on horseback dismounted likewise, I gave him 10 s. 6 d. he demanded my watch, but I told him I never carried one, (I had one at that time, but he fought no farther for it;) they took two brace of pistol, the horse I led having a brace on him. I beg'd hard for them again, but the prisoner refus'd me with a damn: the man on foot took my other horse, and made him go over a hedge into a large, open field, then took his bridle off, turn'd him up, and flung the bridle down in the road; then he who was on foot when they first met me, mounted the horse which I rode, and they all went away together.

            . I am high constable, and live at Kingston : On the 14th of this instant there was an ostler came from Godalming in pursuit of these three men, he told me there were three highwaymen had rob'd a gentleman of ninety pounds, and another of six pounds and a watch, and he came by them a little on this side Ditton-marsh in order to get assistance and take them; accordingly I went into the town and took my gun loaded, and threw it over my shoulder; I went to one Dr. Ward and ask'd him for a horse, he lent us three, so I got assistance, and sent one man to the ferry; one of the men soon set them, saying, he saw them turn up a green lane near Kingston ; they quitted their horses, we search'd about and beat the hedges as people do for hares, so found the prisoner hid in a ditch, in a place call'd Woodstock-lane ; we brought him to Kingston to Justice Rhodes who committed him; I told him now was his time, if he would impeach it might be a means to save his life; he said, he knew nothing of it; they threw their pistols all away going up the green lane, and the people found them. Mr. Wilson's four pistols, and two of their own pocket pistols, were produced in court. The prisoner told us, he had flung the pistols away, or he would not have been taken.</p>
               <p>Q. to Head. Are these four pistols the same that were taken from you?</p>

               <p>Q. to Busby. Was he admitted an evidence by the Justice?</p>
               <p>Busby. He said there he knew nothing of it. I said to him, it is not too late now, but he would not confess any thing. After his mittimus was made he desired to be heard, but he was not admitted an evidence.</p>

On the 14th of May, my wife and I went to Clare-market to see my brother and sister; before I went out I had taken four guineas and put them along with some more in a bag, in my drawer in the kitchen, I told the whole, which was twelve moidores, three 36 s. pieces, and seven guineas. We came home at about eleven o'clock at night. I was taken ill coming home, so went to bed directly. I got up next morning to go to market, I went to the drawer and it was open, the money and bag were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer lock'd when you left it before?</p>
               <p>Wittingham. I cannot say whether it was or not: The prisoner being missing I went to his wife that morning and ask'd where he was, but she did not know. I found him in St. James's-market on a horse he had bought that morning; I took him off the horse, he fell down and lay some time, but would not speak; I search'd him there and found ten moidores, one 36 s. piece, five guineas, seven shillings, and a penny; I took him home, then before Justice Lediard, he confess'd there he took the money out of a drawer of mine.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230023"/>Peter Taylor. On Monday last about four o'clock in the afternoon I was at home, the prisoner, Reed, came to me with a note from a gentleman that was then in the house of commons, desiring me to come to him immediately; I went, he came out of the house and told me, there was a matter of consequence in hand and he could not depart the house; that his servant had been with him, telling him, there had been a bill of exchange brought to his house for 85 l. 5 s. He desired I would send my servant to Knight and Jackson, bankers, in Lombard-street, and take up the bill of exchange drawn upon him, it was brought from France and was in their hands, left it should be noted being near five o'clock: He gave me a bank bill of fifty pounds, and said, he would give me the remainder when he saw me: Upon this I ask'd the door-keeper, if he knew an honest porter who I could trust with fifty pounds, so he recommended Reed to me as such. I went into an office just by the door of the house of commons, and ask'd the clerk to lend me some paper, pen and ink, which he did, the porter was behind me. I inclosed the fifty pound bill in a letter to my servant, he saw me inclose it, I also told him what it was. I sealed it up and desired he would make haste with it and leave it at my shop, and that the door keeper would satisfy him. My business kept me out till about eleven o'clock, when I came home I found the account 85 l. 5 s. paid by my servant for the bill of exchange I had wrote to him.</p>
               <p>Make up the inclosed the sum mentioned in the paper, and send immediately and take up the draft.</p>
               <p>Inclosed in it was a paper, wrote</p>
               <p>Mess. Knight and Jackson, Lombard-street, 85 l.</p>
               <p>When I ask'd my servant about the 50 l. note, he said, he received none; that the paper he received was open, with only the bit of paper in it wrote.</p>
               <p>Knight and Jackson, Lombard-street. 85 l.</p>
               <p>I found out where the porter lodged, which was in Thieving-lane, and found he was out; then I went to the house of commons, knowing he was imploy'd there, and found him; I told him, I thought he had made a mistake; he bounced much, and said, he was an honest man; said I, tell me the truth if you have done an imprudent thing. Where did you lie last night? Said he, I lodge at the Shoulder of Mutton in Thieving-lane. Said I, I have been there, and find you do not; then he said, he lay in St. Martin's-lane. Said I, are you married? he said, no, but he kept a whore there. I went there to her, she was alone, told her the affair, and that I would give her five guineas if she wanted any money in her unfortunate circumstances, if she would tell me what was done with it, &amp;c. she declar'd her innocency. I took the prisoner to my house in order to confront my servant about the letter being open; he declared the letter was deliver'd at my house in the same condition it was to him by my hand. I had before sent my servant to stop payment, and the time he was at the Bank the bill came in, which he came and related before the prisoner; then the prisoner trembled, and said, he believ'd it might drop from the letter, and some other persons might take it up. Upon this I went to the Bank in order to see who brought the note there, and found it to be Mr. Pewterer, who is here to give evidence; he described to me two people who had been with him the night before, which was Monday, between seven and eight o'clock, the one in a white apron like a porter, the other said he was chimney sweeper; that they had bought three pair of buckles and a gold ring; I took Mr. Pewterer's servant to see if he knew the person who brought the note; he said, that was none of the man. I took the prisoner, Reed, before Justice Fielding, he was of the opinion he ought to be committed to Newgate. Coming down Southampton-street, I met a man who said, the note was found, and he could help me to the sight of the man who found it, one Limbery in Westminster, who had been all night very drunk, showing a great deal of money, and had been over the water and bought some silver buckles, and things for his wife. I took a hackney-coach to enquire where he lived, for the man could not tell the place. I first saw his wife, she was drunk at the door, and two or three chimney sweepers boys. I ask'd where her husband was, she said, he was not at home. I ran up stairs and found him a bed, his wife awaked him, and said, here is a gentleman wants to speak with you. He gave her a kick, and said, he was not afraid of any gentleman in England, he had committed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230024"/> no robbery, that his character was very good, and that the Duke of Newcastle, and the Duke of Bedford would bail him. I told him, I did not come to charge him with any robbery, but that an innocent man might suffer by what he could explain. He said, he knew

            , and that he was an honest man. We took him and his man Monk to Justice Fielding, and examined them a-part. I ask'd Limbery what money he had in his pocket; he answer'd, a meer trifle, about ten or twelve guineas. I took out of his pocket 39 l. 11 s. 6 d. and from his coat pocket two pair of silver buckles. They were produced in court, and very large ones. He then said, he would tell the truth; and said, on Monday about four o'clock in the afternoon, he and his apprentice were going down to purchase some mackreil, his boy kick'd a paper about in the passage leading to New-palace-yard; they went and came back again, then the boy took it up fiauing it still there, and said, I believe I have found a tobacco paper here ; then he gave it to him, and he said, it was a ten pound bank note; then he went home and call'd one Hughs, who went with him into the city and exchang'd the bank note; I can't find that Hughs out; they went to Grace-church street to one Mr. Pewterer's and laid out 5 l. 3 s. in three pair of buckles and a gold ring. This, he said, was on Monday night about two hours after it was found, and that the money taken out of his pocket was the identical money he received of Mr. Pewterer's. I ask'd him what was become of the remainder of the money, to which he gave several answers; sometimes he said, it was all he received; and at other times, he did not know what was become of it.</p>

             brought me a letter about five o'clock in the afternoon on Monday last, it was open. Said I, how came this letter open? he said, he did not know, it was as he had it. There was in it a slip of paper, wrote Mess. Knight and Jackson, Lombard-street, 85 l. which I imagined to be what my master mean'd. I went directly to Lombard-street and took up the bill of exchange, and here is a copy of that very day's transactions now in court. I was gone to bed when my master came home, he, in looking over it, found I had made him debtor 85 l. odd money; he ask'd me the reason, I told him as before, the letter came open to me with only that slip of paper in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a waser in the letter?</p>
               <p>Sirwood. There had been a waser in the letter, part of which stuck to it, but it was quite open. I was before the Justice with Reed, there he did not deny my asking him, how the letter came open when I received it of him.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wax upon the letter?</p>
               <p>Sirwood. No, Sir, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the waser appear to be moist?</p>
               <p>Sirwood. I did not examine that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he bring it to you?</p>
               <p>Sirwood. As nigh as I can recollect, it was about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you say any thing to Reed, when you ordered him to carry this letter about a bank note?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I said, take care, there is a bank note in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come back again to the house of commons?</p>

            . I am a goldsmith, and live at the corner of Nag's-head-court, Grace church-street. Last Monday between seven and eight o'clock at night, the prisoner, Limbery, and another man, came to my shop and bought three pair of buckles and a gold ring, for payment he tenderd a bank note of 50 l. I ask'd the other person how he came by it; he said, he had taken it of a person that was with him ; saying, you need not question it, for he is the king's chimney sweeper. I changed it, and gave him forty seven guineas and a half, and half a crown. These are two pair of the buckles ( looking on them produced before) I sent my man to the Bank next morning with this note, the teller was busy and said, he could not change it then. After that one of the tellers sent to me to tell me, that the note was stop'd, and he would be answerable for it, so I delivered it to him.</p>

            . I happen'd to go to Justice Fielding's about other business, the time the prisoners, Limbery and Monk, were there ; the Justice order'd Limbery to be searched, I saw about twenty guineas and some silver, and two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230025"/> large pair of silver buckles taken out of his pockets; then he order'd Limbery to be taken away, and his man Monk to be brought before him.

He ask'd me to carry up his boxes, and when he had shut up his stall, and all his things carried up, he lock'd the chamber door; then he unbutton'd my breeches and threw m e down on the bed on my face, he unbutton'd his breeches and put his c - k into my backside.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue so?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Taylor. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hurt you?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He did, sir, and I perceived something wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you perceive that?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It fell on my backside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, sir, he did not; this was the only time I was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discover this?</p>
               <p>Taylor. About a week ago.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom?</p>
               <p>Taylor. To one of our play fellows, whose name was Roberts; he told his father, and his father told another boy's father, and he told my father; then he enquir'd about it of me, and I told him the same I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he put something into your body?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I felt him put it into my body.</p>

               <p>Taylor. Yes, sir, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It was about dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before people shut up their houses?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It was long before that: he does not keep open stall by candle-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body lodge in that room but himself?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there no other houses very near this room ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. There is only this public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there not been a quarrel between you and the prisoner before you mentioned this?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he charg'd you with something?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He had charg'd me with having taken a penny from him; I bid him search me, he did, and did not find a halfpenny about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told this thing at that time?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, sir, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it you did not tell this before?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It was not me that told it first, it was one of the other boys told first.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell it before?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I was ashamed to tell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you imagine at this time what he was doing was wrong?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did, sir.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you when you got up?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, he did not, I went down stairs and ran away. Once after as I went by he bid me not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you used to go to his stall after this?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I never did, I never lik'd to go near him after that.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to the knowledge of this affair first ?</p>
               <p>J. Taylor. It was talk'd of amongst the boys, and the father of one of them came and acquainted me with it; then I ask'd my son about it: he told me, he help'd the prisoner carry his things out of his stall into his room, which was backwards, and after that he lock'd the door, forcibly threw him on the bed, unbutton'd his breeches, and enter'd his body with his c - k into his backside. I said, don't be afraid or asham'd to tell the truth; and I apprehend he told me the very words.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear of it?</p>
               <p>J. Taylor. I first heard of it this day se'nnight from Mr. Lambord, father to one of the other boys.</p>

               <p>Mr. Tidmarsh. I live in the neighbourhood, and have heard young Taylor before tell the same he does now: this affair broke out either on Tuesday or Wednesday last among the boys that play together. I believe he has practised this upon my son Samuel above this twelve month. He was thirteen years old the 13th of Nov. last.</p>

            . I live in Wich-street; I lost this quilt in April last was twelve month, and never heard of it till some of the prisoner's own lodgers told me that it was upon the bed he lay on. I got a warrant, and went and found it there. How he came by it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>R. Coates. He lives in Drury-lane, the corner of Russel-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was found upon his own bed?</p>
               <p>R. Coates. His house-keeper, and a lodger, told me so. It was produced in court and deposed to. There were some velvet round the sides of it, seven yards, which are now cut off, I might have had eight guineas for it before it was stolen. It used to lie on a bed in my house, but it was taken away one night when I was asleep. Before the justice the prisoner said, he bought it of a pawnbroker at the bottom of Holborn; the justice gave him two hours to go to see for the pawn-broker, in which time he brought in two men for his bail, but the justice would, not take their bail, but the next day he was bailed out. The quilt is a curiosity, and was made in a nunnery.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you frequently declare you had reason to suspect some other people of taking it?</p>
               <p>R. Coates. I could not tell who to suspect, I did not suspect any particular person, I have seen the prisoner in my room several times come to a lodger of mine.</p>

I never troubled myself with it, nor saw it from that time till this moment. My first husband's wife's first husband, who was a taylor, made it; when the duke of Marlborough died, he made these two figures in the middle for the duke and dutchess of Marlborough; and when the duke was buried, he had five guineas of a gentleman for it to lie over a balcony.

               <p>Abrahams. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you then, if you had no cause of suspicion, to know him the second time?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. I knew him very well. The second or third time of his coming he sh ook and trembled in his shoes as it were.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body charg'd him then?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. No, but then I thought it was a bad thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you was to come into a place and be charg'd with a thing you was innocent of, would it not make you shake?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. I believe not, sir.</p>

            . I live at the Scepter and Crown in East-Smithfield, and have been there about ten or eleven months. I had been in Portsmouth from the 15th or 16th of January, 1749, and staid there till the 10th or 11th of March following, then I came to London again. The time I was at Portsmouth, the prisoner at the bar lodged at Mrs. Comings's house in Gosport-point, I lodged there also. I saw him every day there till I came away, and then I left him there, he was the last man I took my leave of. He used then to wear a dark brown coat, and a short brown wig, now I see he wears his own hair.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I am a seaman. I was on board the Winchester, commanded by Captain Chapman; also on board the Severn, a West-Indiaman.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she return?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I cannot justly tell. The captain left me on shoar in the East-Indies, so I came passenger to Lisbon in a Portugal Indiaman.</p>
               <p>Q. How are you imployed now?</p>
               <p>Peterson. Sometimes I work on board a ship to load, or rig, or haul a ship out of the dock, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Comings living?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I cannot tell.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230030"/>Q. What did you imploy yourself about at Portsmouth ?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I spent my money as fast as I could. I did not work there at all. When I spent my money I came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. How have you lived since?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I work for one shilling and sixpence per day, victuals and drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Peterson. He is a cabinet maker, he used to wear an apron. I think he work'd at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him at work ?</p>
               <p>Peterson. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman do you take him to be?</p>
               <p>Peterson. He is an Irishman, so am I.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be sure of the day you went to Portsmouth and your return?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I had a memorandum to Mrs. Comings's house in my pocket-book, and what I was to pay her per week.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is that book?</p>

            . I live in Castle-street, St. Martin's-lane, I rent a room there. January was twelvemonth I lived with my master at Lambeth, in the latter end of that month, the 27th or 28th, I went down to Portsmouth to work, and continued there till the beginning of April, and since that lodged at one Mr. Wood's a boatman, he lets out boats. I ply'd on the water from Gosport to Portsmouth, I knew the prisoner at that time. The first time I saw him was about the 16th or 17th of Feb. I was at work on the point and he came down to the water side, I had a fare over, then I said to him, how do you do Mr. Bride? I had seen him in London some time before, and carried him by water here. I saw him every day till the 25th of February, and that day I saw him on the point. That day I had an accident happened in carrying a man over to portsmouth, by oversetting my boat, between four and five in the afternoon, by which I was like to lose my life: the next day I saw the prisoner there, and told him what had happen'd to me. He said he lodg'd at one Mrs. Comings's, who keeps a brandy-shop, I have drank with him there, saw him I believe every day, and sometimes two or three times a day.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he live when you first knew him?</p>
               <p>Richardson. At London, but in what part I cannot tell. I have carried him by water here several times.</p>

I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock, he would not go to bed. We used to go to bed by one candle; he lies in the next room to me. The 15th he went out, and did not come nigh me till evening; then he pulled out guineas and silver, and said one Forset a life-guard-man had let him have it. I examined my box, and all my money was gone; I got a warrant for him, and had him before Justice Fielding; the life-guard-man denied he gave him any money. I had a particular mark on one of the guineas, being the first I ever was master of, which I brought from Ireland with me, and had made a scratch cross the nose on it; it was amongst the rest of my money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you bring any other with you at that time?</p>

            . At Michaelmas was 12 months the prosecutor and prisoner came to lodge at my house, the prisoner had 2 guineas of Commins for what they call a colt, that is, to a share the first year. The prisoner owed me some money some time; I used to teize him for it. He gave me a note of hand for 2 l. 14 s. 6 d. he had paid 15 s. of it. The fifteenth of May, he said to me, I'll lay you a pot of beer, I pay you the remainder within an hour; accordingly he came into the tap room with some money in his hand within the hour, one Forset a life-guard-man was with him; said the prisoner you shall not dun me, where is the note? he pulled out a good many guineas, saying, this Mr. Forset would lend him money enough. The life-guard-man passed it on, for my part, I thought he had sold the figure of his chair to him. The prisoner paid me two guineas, out of which I gave him 1 s. 6 d. here they be both, Justice Fielding seald them up; they happened not to be put amongst any other money, one of them is this marked one: the jury examine that.</p>
               <p>Jer. Rapley. I am constable, I carried the prisoner before Justice Fielding. Upon examination he said a gentleman lent him this money (there being 16 guineas and half found upon him before the Justice) the life-guard man denied it; then the prisoner could make no defence. The prisoner said after this, he had lent him some money; the life-guard-man answered he had lent him a shilling or two. The next morning there was a receipt trumped up, as though he received it of his brother.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner at the bar, last Wednesday was sen'night just by Clare-Market ; I was walking with Mr. Battey; we called to drink at the hole in the wall, just by Clare-Market, about the middle of the day. We sat down upon the right hand ; there was a little middle sized man and the prisoner at the bar came in, and asked the man of the house for the money that was due ; the man said I have not the money for you at present. This man looked back to the other, and said, come along, I have been here three or four times, I'll come no more, I'll arrest him. The prisoner said to the red faced man, so do; I want the money to set myself in a way of business. Then he and the other went out at the door. The man of the house went to the door, and said, come back you scoundrel, I have the money in the house, I'll pay you. I saw him bring the money in gold, and put it down on the table by them; when it was paid, he demanded a note for 20 pounds or 20 guineas, I don't know which.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner three or four years; I am a soldier in the life-guards; I was with him the week before last at Mr. Powel's house; he came to me on the 15th instant about 4 o'clock, and desired me to come there that night. I went there, and one Mac. Daniels along with me; the prisoner came in after I was there; he told me he wanted me about taking up a note of hand, which Mr. Powel had of his of 2 l. 14 s. of which he said he had paid, 17 s. 6 d. saying, he only wanted me, as he could not write or read. He gave me 2 guineas; I held them in my hand; Mr. Powel would not receive it; then I put them into my right-hand pocket, in which I had two guineas and half in gold at that time. Mr. Powel said the prisoner had paid him, but 15 s. At last he took the money and discounted it at 15 s. paid before, giving him 1 s. 6 d. The prisoner said he did not want me to lend him the money, he had money enough.</p>

The first time the prisoner became known to me was on the 9th of September, 1749, when I usually saw him in some mix'd company in a tavern : about a week after that he told me he had been arrested in the borough court by one of his mariners, the prosecutor, for a debt of 25 l. for wages, tho' he owed him nothing, and that he was determined to try the suit; that one

I search'd to find where the suit was commenc'd, and found it was in the Marshal's court: soon after there was a Habeas Corpus brought to remove the suit to the King's bench; before bail could be put in, he was arrested for 400 l. upon bond, which he had given to Gayton as a security and a mortgage at the suit of Gayton on the 6th of October, before the term. He sent for me to advise with me what should be done, and disclos'd to me, that the ship had been forcibly taken from out of his custody by the mortgagee: a few days after, a commission of bankruptcy was taken out against him by Gayton. I petitioned for him to my lord chancellor, and it was superseded. There was a neglect to put in bail in the Martial's court, and a procedendo was issued upon that occasion; so he deliver'd to me Guy's receipt, as evidence of the payment of it, upon which I was obliged to have recourse to a bill of equity, &amp;c.</p>

            . I prepared a bill, sued out the subpoenas, and served them; he takes no notice of any receipt in full of all demands, but observes that Badesta had arrested him for 25 l. for expenses laid out for the ship; to which, says he, I never gave him orders; nor he never did, I declare, but has perjur'd himself by his affidavit. When I had drawn the bill from these instructions, I went to him, and said, if there is no other demand from this man, how came you to take this particular receipt of wages due from such a day to such a day; and likewise told him, if he should swear any other demand, then the bill in chancery would be of no use to him. He said, that that receipt was at his own desire; but, said he, I have a receipt in full besides. Then I told him, it was necessary he should bring me that, for I would not file the bill without it. He was then in prison, it being Hillary term, and the suits on the bail bond, I was forced to bring four writs of error, to prevent the ship and things being taken in execution. I believed the ship to be his own at that time, she being re-delivered by my lord chancellor's order. He was delivered out of prison by me, I think, about the latter end of Feb. and being vacation time I desired he would get me this receipt. (I had great compassion upon him at that time, believing him to be highly injured, and sent him to my house in the country for relief.) I think in the May following he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230035"/> brought me this receipt in question to my house in the country, for my instruction, that discharged him of all demands Marisca had upon him. There was a witness's name to it then: I made this observation to him, how came this to be dated in full the 30th of May, 1749, when this receipt from Guy the officer was dated the 4th of Sept. if you had paid him in full of all demands the 30th of August before? He looked much confounded, and could give no reason. Said I, I observe every word is your own hand writing, as I had seen him write twenty times, i.e. the date and body of it, and I also observed the date to be in different ink, but as to the hand of

I desired him to bring him to me, but he told me he was at sea, and he could not tell where. Said I, this is another misfortune, for if this case is tried, you must prove him dead or produce him; and while I was looking at some other papers, he took this note from off my escrutore, and cut off that person's name, saying now here is no witness, here is part of the letter T lost. I reproached him much for it, and told him I never could make use of it, not being in the condition it was when I first saw it; then I had a suspicion of him, and made inquiry, as the other evidences have related.</p>

As she did not care to see him, I went to him instead of her, and he told me there, he never should have done this thing, had it not been for Mr. Long: he said also, if Capt.

I don't remember I saw this woman there; I saw two women there who said something to me, but I did not answer, neither did I say any thing about 50 l. to the Greek.</p>

On the 19th of April about 9 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was in our yard; I asked him what he wanted there; he said to see a Ammab we had there, called a Racoon, I turned him out; the next morning, which was Saturday, we missed a silver candlestick; on the Monday morning following, I carried the fellow candlestic to get one made by it. The second time going to the silversmith, he told me his brother had read an Advertisement of a candlestic, which had a crest, which answered to that I lost. I went and read the paper myself, and found it the same; seeing the man described at the bottom, and where the candlestic was lodg'd, I carried the other there; it answered exactly; it was at the sign of the Wallnut-tree, in Wallnut-tree Court, without Bishopsgate; the man's name that keeps it is Watson. The prisoner was sent to the Compter. We took him before the alderman.</p>

He challeng'd me (I was at the corner of Walnut-tree-yard, Bishop's gate) I got down seeing him lame and desired him to go along about his business; then he swore he would fight a woman there for a pint, or half a pint of gin. As he was going over a kennel I saw this silver candlestick fall from under his left arm, I took hold on it, then he swore, he would swear a robbery against me for taking it away. I thought he could not come by such a thing honestly, so I led him into Mr. Watson's house, sent for a constable and charged him with the prisoner. I was charged to aid and assist.

About 9 o'clock I saw an old basket woman by the church, she ask'd me to buy the candlestick; said I, what do you ask for it? said she, sixpence; I bid her a groat; she said, you are a poor man, take it for a groat, so I took it and paid her. Coming on my way I fell down in Bishop's-gate-street, said the witness, what have you got in your hand? Said I, it is a pewter candlestick; he threw me down and took it out of my hand, so I was sent to the Compter.</p>

I am an apprentice to Mr. Oram: On Saturday the 4th of this instant, my master desir'd I would go down below and see for some clean tea lead, and under the lead I found this parcel of tea concealed; I went up stairs, and fetch'd down the journeyman to let him see it; we both agreed to let it lie and see who would take it away, which we did after supper ; he and I watched, I saw the prisoner go down with a c andle, by which light I saw him go to the place; he came up again, and after he had shut up the shop he went down again with a candle; we look'd through the cellar window and saw him take the tea from thence; we let him come up stairs, and as he was going out of the house we stop'd him, he had it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing concerning this?</p>
               <p>Blechynden. I heard him acknowledge to Mr. Oram, he would make him satisfaction, but I was sent to fetch a constable, and was not there all the time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Oram. He pointed to a tea canister, and said, he had it there.</p>
