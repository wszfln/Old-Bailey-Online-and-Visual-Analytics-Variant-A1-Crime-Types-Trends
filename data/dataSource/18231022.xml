            . On the 15th of September, I had been to Clerkenwell; the prisoner (who is my husband) had been discharged that day from Clerkenwell, upon his own recognizance, to keep the peace towards me. I lived in High-street, Portland-town, St. Mary-le-bone - I had not lived with him for three years, but he knew where I lived. I was going home, and at the top of <placeName id="t18231022-1-crimeloc4">Park-street, Regent's-park</placeName>

               <p>"Scott, don't come near me, nor trouble me, I don't wish to bring you into any more trouble, go along" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I can follow you as long as I like," and called me a wh - e. I asked the young man for protection, and if he could get me a constable; upon which he pushed Scott by the shoulder, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go along Scott." I then left him, and crossed the top of Park-street, to an apple-stall, where a man, woman, and boy stood, and asked if the watch was set - the boy said it was not set till eight o'clock; (it was then about seven) I said I would stop there till the watch was set, and get a watchman to see me home. The prisoner came to me, put his left arm round my neck, and said something which I could not distinctly hear - he then said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got a knife you know, but I will murder you on the spot;" I thought he was going to cut my throat from the position he was in, and put up my hand, and he began stabbing towards my throat - I received the stab in my hands; he had then got me off the pavement into the road. I screamed out Murder! as loud as I could, and when I got from him, I saw several people about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut your hands - A. Yes, and my left shoulder and arm. I screamed out Murder, and saw several men and women collected. I ran towards a man who stood with his face towards me, stood behind him, and put my arms round his waist, in order to keep him between me and Scott, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! save me, he has stabbed me, and I am a dead woman." The man separated my hands, and pushed me away - I staggered along. Scott caught me again, put his arm round my neck, and again began to stab me over the left side of the temple. I put up my left hand, and caught hold of something in his hand, which felt like the ring part of a key; I held his hand for a minute - he got it away, and stabbed me behind the ear, on the right side, and then I received several stabs on my right hand, and one over my right breast - I got from him and attempted to run, but could not, and said to somebody,</p>
               <p>"Pray take me to Mr. Lucas, the surgeon." I heard a voice say,</p>
               <p>"Oh! stop him, he has stabbed me on the thumb." I was taken to the surgeon's; some of my wounds were slight - I had eight on my left hand, two on the left temple, one on the forehead, one at my right ear, two or three small ones at my right hand, and one over my right breast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How long have you been married to him - A. Nineteen years; I lived sixteen years with him, but not on good terms. I know Sinclair - we never quarrelled on his account. I separated from the prisoner three years ago the middle of next winter, and never lived with him after. I had a child two years ago last September; it is now dead - the hospital books will prove when it was born. I should think the wounds were made with scissars; he is a <rs id="t18231022-1-deflabel5" type="occupation">tailor</rs>

               <p>Q. How long had you been alone when you met him - A. The last person I spoke to was Mr. Hart Davis, coachman; that was in Greek-street, Soho. Nobody was with me when the prisoner came in sight, nobody ran away. I live in a house which belongs to Sinclair; he is my cousin, and does not reside there, but took it in his name for me to live in.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he said,</p>

               <p>"I have not got a knife," did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220004"/>he not say,</p>
               <p>"I have not got a knife, or I would murder you" - A. No, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got a knife you know, but I will murder you on the spot." I felt no pain at first, but felt the blood running down - I did not scuffle with him, except to get away. I put my hand to my throat, and thought I felt the ring part of a key in his hand - it might be scissars.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Sinclair is your cousin - A. Yes; he put me in the house to let it, for his profit, in order that Scott should not turn me out, and take the goods - they are there in his name, that Scott should not seize them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he been in custody upon your charge - A. From the 24th of July; he was discharged on the 15th of September, a little after one o'clock. I had not been home before he attacked me. I am a laundress, and had been collecting my linen. I never said a word to him after he left the Court, till he came and attacked me - I had not seen him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Carlton-place, Regent's-park. The prosecutrix was brought to my house, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 15th of September - she was wounded in the forehead in several places, and had one wound on her temple, one on her left arm, and wounds on her left hand and fingers, and on her other hand. I perceived next day some trifling pricks of an instrument on her breast. I forgot to mention a wound on the side of the lower part of the right ear; it was an incised wound, and appeared to be inflicted by a narrow sharp pointed instrument - the wound on her forehead extended to the scull; that on the temple had divided the artery - one on the left arm had torn part of the muscle, and the others had divided the skin of several of the fingers, nothing more. None of the wounds except that on the temple were at all likely to produce death.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they likely to do any considerable harm - A. One of those on the finger has injured the nerves, so that at this time she is not able to move them. Her wounds are now all healed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The cut on the ear appeared to be inflicted with a narrow sharp instrument, was it such a wound as might be increased by her turning away, supposing a puncture was intended - A. Certainly, it might be; the extension of the wound was a greater injury than the puncture would have been. I think it was done with the violence of the man striking her, and tearing the instrument out, her moving away might extend it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say an artery was divided, you mean it was larcerated - A. I consider it so much divided that she might have bled to death if neglected; it was cut across; I did not examine the exact state of it, for I healed it by pressing it. The wound that penetrated to the scull was a very slight depth. I have ceased to attend her for the last fortnight or three weeks - I very soon healed them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. One of the wounds might have produced death if it had not been stopped - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>

            . I keep livery-stables near Regent's-park. On the 15th of September, about seven o'clock I was in my yard, and heard screams, went out, and in the road saw a man and woman struggling in the foot-path; the woman extricated herself from him, and ran into the middle of the road - I thought her face appeared bloody; he attempted to follow her; I pushed forward, and prevented him, and as I put my hands upon him I received the point of something at the end of my thumb, and received a trifling wound. I collared him, and requested my man (Argust) who was behind, to take a knife from him, as I thought he had one - he took a pair of scissars from him, which were bloody.</p>

My hat was then taken off, and he ran off.

I counted my money before them, when I awoke; there was then three half-crowns, and 2 s. 6 d. in silver. They went away when they robbed me, leaving me crying Murder.

            'S Defence. I knew the prosecutor by working with him - we agreed to come to town, and in the road he fell down and fainted. I fell in with him a few days after, and we were drinking all day; he was locked out, and was going home with us, and fell down at different times, and pressed me to take his money, to take care of; we were both drunk. The last time he fell down, I put my hand to his pocket, which hung by two or three threads, and it came off. The watchman came up - I said I had not the money, not wishing to give it to him, and at the watch-house I said I took it, but not with intent to rob.</p>

A single man lodges on my second floor, and one in the attic - there is a private door; both the lodgers and myself have the key of it. On the 17th of September, I went out at the private door three times within an hour before the robbery; my lodger was at home, and might have left the door open. About eleven o'clock, I was going to the first floor, and met the prisoner on the stairs, between the first and ground floors - I said nothing to him, thinking he might have come down from the lodger; his looks excited my suspicion. I ran up, saw my first floor door open, looked in, and saw my bookcase broken open, and cash gone - I ran down, out at the passage door, and saw him running seven or eight doors down the street; I followed, and on recovering my surprise called Stop thief - he was stopped in Belton-street; I only lost sight of him for an instant, as he turned the corner; I was ten or twelve yards from him - I did not see anything thrown away. I collared him when I came up, and said he must go with me - a crowd collected, who were disposed to rescue him, but I held him fast. A man stepped up, and offered his assistance - he helped me to take him to Bow-street, and in the way I saw him throwing the money about the street; he also threw a silver watch down, which I knew to be mine; a man in the crowd picked it up; it was delivered to Cousins, at Bow-street. At the office ten sovereigns, three crowns, and other silver, amounting to 16 l. 19 s. in all, a gold ring, and two silver watches were produced, all of which are mine, and were safe half an hour before I met him on the stairs.</p>

I sleep in this house whenever it is empty, and slept there on Sunday, the 7th of September. About a quarter to eleven o'clock, I left the house to go to church - I locked the area gate, and the housekeeper's room window was fastened down and the door locked - I doubled locked the street door; both doors were fastened. I returned a little before one o'clock, and found the street door open, also the housekeeper's room window, and the area gate open. I went up stairs, and missed a bed, bolster, pillow, three blankets, and a piece of calico from the drawing-room floor, and from the second floor front room two large pillows in white cases, and two blankets, and out of the drawers four clean counterpanes, and a blue and white curtain, and from the back room two blankets, and a piece of calico, and from the dining-room a piece of baize, seventeen wine glasses, five rummers, a pepper and mustard glass, and four cut salts, My own boxes, and another servant's were broken open and stripped. I had left nobody in the house. An old woman who lived there with me went to church before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When would that woman return from church - A. She dined out, and did not return that day. Nobody but me had the key; she could not get in without my letting her in.</p>

            . I know Farmer. On the 7th of September, near half-past ten o'clock, I saw him in Wellbeck-street, passing the end of Bentick-street, towards Cavendish-square - he was then alone. I saw him again, standing with Leddington, at the corner of Queen Ann-street, Wellbeck-street, by a shoemaker's shop; this was a few minutes after; they stood opposite the prosecutrix's house - I am sure of them both. I spoke to Farmer, and asked if he had got a situation or not. About the 16th of September, I saw them go into a public-house together, and gave information to Westcoat, but they were gone. I was with the officers next day, when they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. A servant out of place. I did not know Leddington before, but knew Farmer very well; they were both together when I spoke to him, but while I was talking, Leddington walked too and fro. I was five or ten minutes talking with Farmer, but did not speak to him. Leddington had corded breeches, dirty stockings, and a short jacket on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner FARMER. Q. Where did you see me first - A. Crossing the end of Bentick-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You get your living by swindling and playing bagatelle - A. No. I lived last with the Reverend Mr. Jeffries, of Barnes, and left him last January.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner Leddington with another man, in Mary-le-bone-lane, at the corner of Bentick-mews, which leads into James-street, about twelve o'clock in the morning of the 7th of September; they had two very large bundles, tied in blankets. I thought he was a servant, moving bedding from one stable to another - I saw them go down the mews, and in the afternoon heard of this robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the face of the man - A. No, I could not see his face. I observed his small clothes, shoes, and stockings - he has the same coloured clothes on to day.</p>

            . I live at No. 25, James-street; Farmer lodged in the same house. On the 7th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, he came to his lodging - Bentick-mews has steps leading up to James-street. Another man came with him. I did not see either of their faces when they came, but Leddington is the man who came down stairs from the room about an hour after - he had knee breeches on; I did not see Farmer afterwards. When they came in they brought two large parcels, wrapped in blankets; they were large enough to contain beds, and went up stairs. Farmer's room is on the second floor - his wife lives there with him. The bundles were so large they concealed their faces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Leddington anything on his head when he came down - A. He had a bundle on his shoulder, not so large as those which went up; I only saw him as I entered my room door, for a second or two. I saw that he wore breeches, but I had seen him come backwards and forwards to the house before, and knew his face, and saw his face when he came down; he is pock-marked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there any other lodgers up stairs - A. A man and his wife have the front attic, and a gentleman has the back attic.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You cannot say Leddington did not come from the attic - A. He always came to visit Farmer. I have seen them in company before.</p>

The pillow and blanket found at Leddington's are fellows to those found at Farmer's, and here is another pillow. The fifteen wine glasses I also believe to be mine; I lost exactly seventeen.

On the 3d of October, I went out about half-past eight o'clock, leaving my wife at home, and the watch on the mantleshelf. The prisoner was often at my house. About half-past four o'clock, in consequence of what my wife said, I went home, and looked for the prisoner, but did not find him for ten days; then found him at Woolwich, and asked him what he had done with what he took away from my house - I did not mention what; he said he would tell me when I was alone. We went into another room, and he said voluntarily that he had pawned the watch for 10 s., in Ratcliff-highway, and sold the chain in Tooley-street, and one seal in Oxford-street, and another seal and a key at another place. I went to different shops with him, and found the watch and chain - the other things were sold.</p>

            . I live with my father, in Castle-street, Poplar, and am in the service of Mr. Hutchinson, a cooper - the prisoner's husband was his clerk. On the 15th of September, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, his wife, were at words, and my master sent me to see what it was about; they had just come from Lambeth-street. When I got to the door, the prisoner was looking out of window, and would not let her husband in, and was laughing at him; he sent me to fetch an officer - I could not find one, came back, and knocked at the door; Mrs. Smith opened it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Thorn within" - he called out,</p>
               <p>"Yes, Peter, come in;" I went in; Smith shut the door, and I got about half way along the passage, and the prisoner rushed out of the kitchen, and struck me on the head with a knife; it cut my head - she turned me out, and shut the door. I had my cap on. I put my hand up to my head, and found butter on it, and some blood, and went to the surgeon.</p>

            , a pawnbroker, of Tottenham Court-road. On Thursday, the 25th of September, about half-past one o'clock, the prisoner pawned this watch - she said it was for Mrs. Harrison, No. 49, Upper Thornaugh-street; she formerly lived servant with her. She asked 4 l. on it, which I gave her, and would have advanced 8 l., for it is worth 10 l. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

I found this a house of ill-fame, and told her I would have her severly punished for hiring me - she and three women came down and ill-treated me. I was obliged to lock myself up in my room all night, and left them next morning, called afterwards for my clothes, and on Wednesday called for 3 s. they owed me, and was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>A letter was here read, which the prisoner had addressed to the prosecutrix - it contained the most revolting expressions, and desired her to produce four women upon the trial, who were in the house at the time the prisoner left.</p>

             re-examined. I have lived in the house eleven years, and pay 55 l. a year, rent - it is not a bad house. I am above fifty years old, and live with my husband. The prisoner's account is very false - I do not keep a bad house. Nobody lives there but a gentleman and lady, who I believe to be married; they are quite respectable people. I received a letter like the one read, about a week ago; I owed her nothing - I paid her on Monday. The persons named in the letter formerly lived with me; they are all quite respectable, and had nothing to do with this matter.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and live next door to Mrs. Iliff - she fetched me about eleven o'clock, and I fetched the constable, and saw him search the prisoner in the parlour, and find 23 s. 6 d. in his trowsers pocket, and 2 s. in an inside waistcoat pocket, near his breast; one of them was marked; Mrs. Iliff claimed it; he said nothing to the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say it was a false charge - A. He did not; he had a flannel jacket, and a waistcoat with a breast inside pocket. I do not recollect whether both shillings were marked.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched, and found the prisoner in the parlour, and told him he was charged with robbing the till; he made no answer. I found 2 s. 3 1/4 d. in his inside waistcoat pocket - Mrs. Iliff claimed them immediately, and said how they were marked - they were then in her sight. I searched a pair of his trowsers up stairs, and found a sovereign and three shillings; she claimed two of the shillings - he said nothing to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She told you how she marked the money - A. She said she could swear to the mark.</p>
               <p>MRS. ILIFF. I can swear to two of the shillings found in his pocket - they are what I put into the till; two of those found in his trowsers are also marked, and mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. One has a scratch across the head, is that your mark - A. Yes; another has a punch mark. I had marked them overnight.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had he an opportunity to go up and change his trowsers - A. He did not change them; he was at home an hour and a half, and could go up stairs; the men have a room to themselves. The till was locked, but the key left in it; the servant said he pulled her from the corner to get to it.</p>

I had forty-two pair of Angola worsted and cotton stockings, worth 5 l., tied in a handkerchief, with eight night caps - they were all new. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was ill in bed at Mr. Gardner's - this parcel laid on a table in the hall. The prisoner was quite a stranger to me. I had not seen them some time, being confined to my bed - I was told they were gone, I saw them afterwards at Guildhall, and knew them all.</p>

            . I saw these stockings a quarter of an hour before they were stolen - they were tied in a handkerchief, and put into a bag, and laid in the hall, up one pair of stairs; the prisoner was a stranger. I was in the warehouse on the ground floor, and saw a man pass through the passage, with a bundle - he went into the street; there is a door at the bottom of the stairs, leading from the warehouse; it was kept locked, and the key hung up by the latch; any one could take it down. I went to the door, which should have been locked, and found it wide open. I went into the street, and saw the prisoner about seven houses off, and another man with him - the prisoner had the bundle; I ran after him; they separated before I came up to him - they walked very fast. The prisoner went towards St. Paul's-church-yard; I never lost sight of him, and came up with him in Cannon-alley, and laid hold of him with the bundle, and asked where he was going with the parcel; he said he was going into the country; he had a riding whip in his hand. I said it was not his, and he must come back with me - he then said he had found it. I brought him back, went for a constable, and gave him in charge. I knew it to be the prosecutor's parcel.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Suttaby and Co., Stationers'-court, and live in Boy-court, Ludgate-hill. On the 3d of October, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me with the bundle, six or seven doors from Mr. Gardner's - there was another man with him. Thomas ran by me; I asked what was the matter; he said nothing. The two separated - the prisoner kept the bundle. I saw Thomas lay hold of him, and assisted in bringing him back. When we got him to the house, he said it was impossible he could have taken it, for that he had a horse waiting for him at the Saraceu's Head, Snow-hill - he was given in charge.</p>

            . I live at Ball's-pond, and am a wholesale jeweller - I live with my father. I do not know the prisoner, but I was passing along Paternoster-row, with my sister, about a fortnight ago, to go to the coach with my sister - the prisoner was walking before me, and turning round the corner of the court into St. Paul's-church-yard, I saw a large bundle; this gentleman stepped into the road and picked it up, and had not got many yards before a gentleman laid hold of him - he said</p>
               <p>"Is it yours?" and he said,</p>
               <p>"I think it belongs to Mr. Gardner." The man who took hold of the prisoner said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that - A. In Paternoster-row, by the corner of the court leading into St. Paul's-church-yard. My sister is at home, very poorly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the young man who laid hold of him - A. I do not know, some working man it appeared to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the witness, Thomas - A. I do not recollect, indeed. I think he had a lighter jacket on; he was about the size of Eason; I cannot swear to him. The man took hold of him round the waist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask what it was for - A. No. I was passing with my sister, and heard him say,</p>
               <p>"That is not yours," and I thought they might both be quibbling for the prize. The prisoner was about as far from me as I am from your Lordship, when the person laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in Paternoster-row - A. If I recollect he was turning into the court; I did not take particular notice. He was turning round, going into the alley; I cannot say whether he was in the alley. The bundle was similar to the one produced - it is very large.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you stopped to know how this happened did not you - A. No, your Lordship: the young man came up; the prisoner said he would go back and see who the bundle belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what you say is taken down, and I caution you, will you swear that the prisoner said he would go back and see to whom it belonged - A. He said he would go back with him. The man said it belonged to Mr. Gardner; he said</p>
               <p>"I will go back with you, and see if it does."</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that - A. Yes. My sister was with me at the time, laying hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed then - A. Why, the young man went back. He was laid hold of by one on each arm I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you enquired how this happened - A. Why, I did not think proper to leave my sister unprotected. I asked a person how it was, and he said the parcel was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. He said the parcel was stolen; of course then you told him, No, this man has not stolen it, for I saw him pick it up - A. I believe I did. I said I saw him pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you say you saw him pick it up - A. Yes, I did my Lord. I did not speak to the persons who laid hold of him. I spoke to a few persons who collected afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him pick it up, then he could not have stolen it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the men who laid hold of him so - A. No; he was gone away. A few people came up, and some conversation ensued.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them take him away as the thief, why not tell them that you saw him pick it up - A. I thought they might be quibbling for the prize. A few people came up, and it was to one of them that I said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to the man, what business have you with it - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say he was not the thief, for you saw him pick it up - A. It did not occur to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to tell them you knew he was not the thief, because you saw him pick it up - A. I cannot account for it. The two men came up, and they went off immediately. My sister lives in the same house as myself, at Ball's-pond, Glebe-terrace. I never saw the man before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the house to see where they took him to - A. I asked afterwards, and understood he was sent for trial - I did not go into the house; I asked some porter at the door. I was passing down Paternoster-row last week, and the circumstance came to my recollection - I asked a man (who stood at a bookseller's door, near the passage) what became of that matter - he said the person was sent for trial. I did not go into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go into the house, and state what you knew - A. I thought if I could be of service to the unfortunate man, I would come here and speak, and this morning I called at Giltspur-street Compter, and was told he was going to be tried.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, till about a week ago, you did not know there was any charge of felony - A. Not till I called in Pater-noster-row.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not suppose there was anything of theft in the case - A. No. I asked the porter at the bookseller's door, how the matter rested - I did not know the porter, and cannot tell the number of the shop; it did not concern me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220011"/>Q. Will you swear upon your oath, that you were near that man at the time he was stopped, and your sister with you - A. Yes, certainly. I was going to the coach with my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two men in this transaction - A. Only one came up; the prisoner was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone when you saw him pick it up - A. Yes; nobody was with him. Nobody separated from him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the time you first saw him he had no companion - A. No. I first learnt that he was going to be tried last week; the man told me he was sent to gaol. I have not been subpoenaed here. I called at the Compter this morning, and they said he was gone to Newgate, and I went to Mr. Wontner, who gave me an order to see if he was the same person. I looked through a window, and saw that he was the same person. I swear positively that I never saw any person near the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the two following him - A. One of them ran past me; they laid hold of him almost immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. If there had been a young man, and a young lady with him, must you have seen him - A. I think I must. There was no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say he would go back and see whom it belonged to - A. Mr. Gardner's porter said,</p>
               <p>"You must come back, for it does not belong to you;" I believe he said,</p>
               <p>"I will go." There was no young man or woman near the spot. It took place in Cannon-alley, about half way down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time he was stopped was he just turning out of Paternoter-row into the alley - A. He had got about half way down.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it possible for you to pass a gentleman and lady, close to the prisoner in Cannon-alley, without pushing them aside to take hold of the prisoner - A. There was nobody in the alley but Mr. Gardener's porter, me, and the prisoner; if there had been a lady and gentleman there, I think I could have passed them without pushing against them, but I could not help observing them - there were no such persons. He had got close to the public-house door.</p>

On the 18th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prosecutors came to my shop - I sold them some things; one of them had a bundle; they were about half an hour in the shop. The prisoner came in, and looked at some calico, which he said would not suit him. I was attending to some customers, and saw the prisoner take the prosecutors' bundle off the counter, and run off with it - he was followed immediately. I lost sight of him, and saw him again ten minutes after with the bundle.</p>

I was gone about two hours, as I stopped out of the rain - when I returned, the shop door was fastened; I went in at the side door, and he was gone. I missed this property, which was in a brown silk purse, in a small box, in the first floor room, in which I had left the key, but I locked the room door, and put the key into the kitchen closet. He heard me tell my son that morning, that I had not paid my rent, as my landlord was out of town, and that I had the money in the house ready for him. He never returned for his few days' wages, nor for a neck handkerchief and waistcoat, which he has left there. I never saw him again until he was in custody. I went to his lodgings, but could not find him.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser. I saw the prisoner at the Red Cap, public-house, at Holloway, on Wednesday, 16th July, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. I had known him for two years; he gave a boy a penny to fetch me to drink with them; he changed a half crown to give the boy the penny, and then another to pay for drink; he was tossing with the hostler, and lost a pint of gin, which came to 1 s. 6 d. and changed a sovereign to pay for that and for some bread and cheese and for his bed, as he had slept there the night before. I saw more sovereigns in his hand - a few words occured, and he threw down a sovereign, and wanted to fight me for it - I refused. I heard of this robbery a day or two after, and apprehended him in Chandos-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any previous quarrel with him - A. About fourteen months ago, about his robbing my mother-in-law. I did not see him after that till he sent for me to the Red Cap. I told him he must have robbed somebody of that money; he said his master was dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my place, it being a very low neighbourhood. I did not like to work there, on account of my character. I never saw the money, I always had money of my own; the prosecutrix was always pressing me to drink gin - she drinks four or five glasses a day. I never saw twenty shillings in the house.</p>

My sister and I occupy the first floor and kitchen - we are both single, and work at tambour work. I have known the prisoner about twelve months - he visited at our lodgings. The last time he was there was on the 5th of September. I was alone in the room - he was with me about an hour. The property stated in the indictment laid on the table in a box. I took them out of the box to shew him, and afterwards went out of the room, leaving him there. I was absent about half an hour; the servant saw him going out and called me up - he said he would call again and see me on the next day or on Monday. About ten minutes after I looked into the box, and found the property gone. I went into the City next day with my sister, and met him in Cheapside, and walked with him as far as Tyburn-turnpike; he went into a house in St. George's-terrace (as he said) to dinner, and said he would be out in an hour, and if we would wait, he would come to us. We waited some time - he did not come out, and we sent two officers in, who apprehended him. I have understood since, that he only took them in a joke. I have visited him twice since he has been in custody - I saw him in Newgate three days ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At the time he left the house, he spoke to you - A. Yes; we met him next day, and talked with him. I am not sure whether the hour had elapsed when I sent the officers into the house - it was a private house - we were on very friendly terms. I know one Marisco, a Polish gentleman, my sister was once on the point of marrying him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you in the prisoner's company before he went into this house - A. We walked from Cheapside, and talked about the trinkets - he said he had not taken them - he allowed us to see where he went.</p>

            . I am an officer. I did not see the prisoner till after he was taken into custody, which was on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220013"/>Saturday, the 6th of September. I told him I was sorry to see a young man of his appearance charged with such an offence, and I must search him. He said it was a conspiracy to extort money from him - he was charged with stealing jewels from the prosecutrix. I searched him, and found nothing on him; he was remanded in consequence of the evidence of the two witnesses, and another who has not since appeared, and at his re-examination, I said</p>
               <p>"One of those ladies has told me you gave her a duplicate of part of the property;" he said it was not part of the property the ladies complained of. I said it was very foolish of him, if he had done so; he then said,</p>
               <p>"You will find the rest at my lodgings." I asked what he meant by the rest; he said</p>
               <p>"You will find an eye-glass and buckle between the mattress and bed." I went, but found nothing of the sort, returned, and said</p>
               <p>"I must search you again; you had better not deceive me any longer," and while searching him, I said the women would not prosecute him if they got the property back; he said,</p>
               <p>"Well, I will deceive you no longer," and produced the eye-glass, and said he really did not know where the rest was.</p>

            . I live with my sister. I have seen the prisoner before, where we lived before, but not in Princes-street - we have been there five months. I have known him about twelve months. I missed these trinkets about a quarter of an hour after he left the house, and saw him next day in Fleet-street, and walked with him to St. George's-terrace - we told him he had taken the trinkets. The eye-glass produced is mine, and was in my box on the day it was missed - it had a steel chain to it then, there is now a ribbon - I am sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not been married - A. No. I have seen one Mr. Maresco - he is now abroad. I never married him. When we met the prisoner, he did not attempt to leave us - he visited my sister on a friendly footing.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mrs. Rochford, Jermyn-street, St. James's. I have known the prisoner about two years. On the 14th of July, he pawned a mourning ring, in the name of Doherty, for 12 s. - he had often pawned for that person. On the 3d of August, he pawned another mourning ring, for 12 s. On the 15th of September, he pawned another, for 5 s.; on the 2d of September, a sugar-bason; on the 27th, a table-spoon for 8 s., and a milk-pot for 1 l. 13 s., and on the 9th, another spoon, all in one name. Mr. Annadale attended my family, and on the 27th, I went to his house, and thought I saw the prisoner there. On the 29th he came again; I asked if I had not seen him in a doctor's shop in Westminster; he said, No. On the following Wednesday, I gave information to the prosecutor. He came on the 30th to pawn four rings, and I detained him, and asked where he brought them from; he said from Mr. Doherty. I said they were stolen from Mr. Annadale, whom he denied knowing. I took him there in a coach, and in the coach he threw away the duplicates I had given him for the goods, and two keys, which I have since delivered to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. ANNADALE. One of these keys opens my sideboard drawer. I have been in the habit of seeing the property for years past, and know it to be Mrs. Sutherland's. The prisoner came to my service from Mr. Doberty.</p>

I was disturbed about two o'clock by the watchman. I got up, and went into the wash-house, and found the window-sash thrown up. I am sure I had left it shut - it is a glazed window - the shutters are inside. I had closed them, but not barred them, and the sash was quite closed. I found nothing broken - I missed three silver salt spoons.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutrix's house is on my beat. I went round at two o'clock, and found every house safe. I returned to my box in twenty minutes, hung up my lanthorn, looked up Easton-street, and saw two men opposite the prosecutrixes house - they crossed over to the iron railing of the house. I walked up the street, they went away, and turned round Wood-street, within one door of the house. I looked, and saw the wash-house window open. I called a watchman from Easton-street, and left him to watch while I knocked at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220014"/>door four or five times, and sprung my rattle. Hurley came out on the balcony undressed; five or six watchmen came up, two of them went in at the window. Hurley let me in, and we found a quantity of house-breaking implements in the front parlour, and a pair of shoes, matches. tinder-box, and dark lanthorn; and as I was going to call five o'clock, I saw a young man who said I was called for by somebody in Exmouth-street. I ran there, and Bellamy said the robbers were in his cellar. We found the prisoner in the coal cellar, which is three doors from the prosecutrix's house - he was sitting down in a corner, without any shoes on. I took him to the watch-house, and tried the left foot shoe on him - it fitted him exactly; he said he did not know how he came there. He could have got into this cellar by getting out of the back door of Thomas's house, and getting over two walls. I have found none of the property - his hands were black with coal dirt.</p>

            . I live two doors from Thomas's. I was alarmed about three o'clock, and was present afterwards, when the prisoner was found in the cellar of a house belonging to me, which I let to another person; he had no shoes. I saw a pair of right and left shoes tried on him at the watch-house; they fitted him. There is a wall in Thomas's yard, not four feet high on her side - he could get over there on to a water but, and into my yard. At day-light I found under that wall a crow-bar and a glove, which corresponds with one found in the prisoner's hat.</p>

On the 20th of September, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner take a book off my stall-board; it was Boyer's French and English Dictionary. I went after him - he began to run, and when he got about fifty yards he dropped it. I called out Stop thief! and picked it up. He was gone some distance - several pursued. I lost sight of him, but am certain of him - he was brought back, and said,</p>

               <p>"I do know you, and am sorry you should have come back again." He had been sent to the Penitentiary, about May, 1819.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Might he not have said,</p>
               <p>"I am not likely to have done this, when I have been transported before" - A. No. I did not notice his face - it was done in broad day-light. I stood at the door at the time, and he at the other end of the window. There were three persons looking at books.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is true, I have been sentenced to transportation by the same prosecutor - I was sent to the Penitentiary, and after four years restored to society; since which I have been employed as writer, to Messrs. Marshall and Co., of Carey-street, and had on this day got into the service of Mr. Russell, of Long-acre, and was about his business at the time. Is it likely I should again go to the shop, when I had been imprisoned so long for a former transaction? Without giving himself time to think whether I was the person, he concluded that I was. Any one dressed the same as me might be taken.</p>

             re-examined. He said Wilton had transported him before, and he supposed he wished to do so again. I asked Wilton what he had done, as I only took him because he was the first who was running - he said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you mean to transport me again." I did not hear him say he had done it out of revenge; he might have said so. I was present all the time, close to him, but took very little notice of the conversation.</p>
               <p>MR. WILTON. I cannot say that he took the book, only from his own words. I believe he was discharged from the Penitentiary three weeks before this transaction.</p>

            . I live in the Borough. On the afternoon of the 18th of September, about three o'clock, I saw the prisoner at <placeName id="t18231022-22-crimeloc121">Cock-hill, Ratcliff</placeName>

I saw the prisoner go into the shop, and take a pair of shoes out of the window. I followed him; he ran off, and threw them down - I took him - one Rogers picked them up, and gave them to the officer - he laid down, and refused to go back - I carried him some distance, he then said he would walk.</p>

I took him towards there, and he said,</p>
               <p>"I may as well tell you the truth, my master is Hawkes, of Drury-lane," and he dropped another piece going along. I went to his lodging, and found more brass in his box.</p>

I found the sheets tied in a handkerchief at the foot of the bed; and in a hole which was made in the hay loft, I found a pair of boots and a great coat of mine; he had left a pair of shoes and his own hat behind there.

In consequence of information, about four minutes after three o'clock, I went over, and found the prisoner in the bedroom, adjoining the hay loft - he had a red night cap on; I watched him some time, and saw him pulling the sheets off the bed. I then went in and brought him out, and took him into the loft - he had neither shoes nor hat on; he asked leave to get them from among the hay, and did so. I looked into the hole in the middle of the hay, where they were, and found a great coat and boots. There was a hole broken through the lath and plaister wall, from the loft into the bed-room, so that the door could be unbolted. Davis's daughter and a person were in the house. The room is part of the dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I found the prisoner in Kemp's custody in the loft, and found a great coat concealed amongst some trusses of hay, and on looking further I found a large hole broken through the wall, which is about five inches thick; a hand could then reach the bolt. I went to the other bed-room, and found the pannels of that door split to pieces, the beading cut down, and the pannels pushed in, so that a hand could undo that door also - it must have been done with a knife. The prosecutor's house is in the City.</p>
               <p>RICE DAVIS. The property is all mine, and was safe when I went out - the handkerchief they are tied in is not mine. The boots were in a bag, which does not belong to me. They are worth 3 l. 1 s.</p>

He said he had brought a letter from the captain of an India ship; but had lost it, and could not return to the captain without a memorandum from me, that he had called; expecting something from a captain, I went into my room to write a note, but upon looking out of window, saw him going out with my coat; I pursued, and took him with it.</p>

I had lost a key of my desk two years ago. I fetched an officer; she was asked to produce her money, which she did after some time, and among it was two shillings, a sixpence, four penny pieces, and a halfpenny, marked.

            . I am a broker. I marked this money on Saturday night, by Fenn's desire, locked it in the desk, and took the key home with me - there was other money there not marked. I returned at half-past seven o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was sent up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220019"/>stairs; I then opened the desk, and missed two shillings, two sixpences, four penny pieces, and three halfpence, of the marked money, and 1 s. 5 d. of the unmarked money - she was charged with it, and declared she had none but her own. I asked her to produce what she had; she hesitated, but at last produced two shillings, a sixpence, four penny pieces, and five half-pence, marked, and a sixpence unmarked. I asked how she got that money; she said her mistress paid it to her, at seven o'clock on Saturday night - I had not marked it at that time. I said she must have a key of the desk, which she denied. I saw her putting something under her stays, and found it was a key, which opened the desk.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 15th of September, I was in Long's-court, St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoner go into the shop of a dealer in marine stores, followed him, and asked what was under his jacket; he said it was nothing to me. I said I was an officer, and insisted on knowing - he then said it was a bottle of white brandy, which he bought of a man in the street for 3 s. I took him to his master, and asked Sayce if he allowed him to carry away spirits - he said No, and that he had suspected him for two years. I went to his lodgings, and found six more bottles, and 6 lbs. of candles, which he said he had bought at different times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He told you at once, who his master was - A. Yes. The bottles found at his house contained spirits.</p>

            . The prisoner was two years in their service - he was brought to me by Yates, with a bottle of white brandy - we had some of that description in use; only two or three bottles had been drawn as samples three or four hours before. He was employed in that part of the warehouse where the cask lay. I believe it to be my master's - the candles found at his lodgings are such as we use in the cellar - they are made for that purpose - he was never allowed to take spirits.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not always at home, I sup pose - A. No. I have no mark on the bottle - my master took him into his service in consequence of his distress - it is common brandy - he might have bought the candles.</p>

I looked to see that she did not hand it to the other; the watchman came up, and I gave her in charge - she was then on the ground; he insisted on her getting up - she refused - he made her stand up, and the watch was found under her clothes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I came up, and found the prisoner on the ground, holding her gown rather up - her hand was under her clothes. Gibbs said she had his watch I lifted her up - did not see it fall from her, but picked it off the pavement, exactly on the spot where she had laid; she said it was her husband's, and desired me not to give it him.</p>

I had been drinking with two women; this gentleman came up, spoke to one of them, and turned up a passage with her, stopped there some time, came back, and said he had lost his watch, and they were going to take me - I fell down and resisted, but never had it.</p>

About the 17th or 18th of August, the prosecutor gave me information, and described the person, and last Friday, I found the prisoner in custody, and accosted him by his name - he answered to it. I charged him with robbing a young man who he lived with in Queen-street, Golden-square - he denied it, and said he did not know where Queen-street was. I said</p>
               <p>"Queen-street, Golden-square, where you lodged after you left the public-house;" he said he did not know where it was - he had not lodged there. I asked where he went when he left the Coach and Horses, public-house, Dover-street - he mentioned somewhere near Smithfield. I said, I must fetch the young man whom he had robbed, and see if he knew him. I did so, and asked if he still denied living in Queen-street - he did; the prosecutor said instantly, that he was the man who had robbed him; he said he never saw the prosecutor, but afterwards admitted knowing the prosecutor, and having lodged in Queen-street. I searched him, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lodged with him for a week, being out of place. On the morning in question, I took what things I could, and left the others to pay the rent. I told the officer, I did not know Queen-street - that I lodged near Golden-square, but did not know the name of the street. I met a man going up stairs as I came out.</p>

On Monday, the 29th of September, I was in Kingsland-road, and met Mrs. Freeman, who I had known many years - the prisoner was with her. I gave them 6 d. to get drink; Freeman asked me home to tea with her - I went, and after tea gave them more liquor. I got up about half-past four o'clock to go; Freeman said she wanted more gin; I said I had no money - they asked me to pawn my watch; I refused; Freeman pushed me on the bed, and said I should not go. I fell on the bed, and the prisoner snatched my watch, and ran off with it; I followed, but could not find her. Freeman went with me, and described her, and the officer took her. I believe Freeman was as much implicated as her. I was sober. She was taken on the Friday.</p>

About three o'clock in the afternoon - I spent 3 s. 6 d. myself; we had oysters, and four pots of beer among six of us. I was quite sober - my wife was not perfectly sober. We came out of the King's Arms, about six o'clock - I went after her, but did not see which way she went; we found her in an hour and a half, very much intoxicated - I then went to the Duke of York, by desire of the officer, to write my address; and hearing she had been drinking at several houses, I looked about there; I never accused Oglesby of it. Cluiff had left us five minutes before I saw her take the money - she was off directly.</p>

I gave him 6 l. - he owed me 20 s. - I gave him five sovereigns, and kept the bill in my possession about three weeks, and the prisoner told me he had a friend who would discount it. I gave the bill to him for that purpose. He made the proposition himself. I told him, if he could get it done at five per cent. I would give him a glass of grog for his trouble. No particular time was fixed for him to bring the cash. This was about the 18th or 25th of August - I asked him for the money a day or two after; he said his friend was out of town, and he could not get it done; he returned it to me afterwards, and in three or four days said his friend was in town, and asked for it I gave it him. I asked him for the money next day; he said his friend was not at home - I saw him every day till he was taken up, but he never gave me the money.</p>

               <p>"There is a drunken sailor, you had better follow him" - she walked with me, and shewed me the way towards my lodging. she took me to a room - I sat down. Davis came in; I asked if she was mistress of the house; she said Yes - she went out again. I took my watch, and put it into my hat, which was on the table. Smith sat by my side; then jumped off my knee, and left me directly. I took up my hat, and my watch was gone. I could see no number on the door; so I made a scratch on the door-post with my knife. I informed Avery; he took the two prisoners - I saw them in custody two days after, and am certain of them. I was with no other woman.</p>

On Sunday night, about eleven o'clock, I met the prosecutor coming out of Cable-court, Cable-street - he said he had been robbed of his watch, and took me to the house where he had made a notch on the door-post. I searched the room, and found nobody. A person could easily reach to the table by coming to the door. From his description of the women, I apprehended the prisoners on Monday night, two doors off, in bed together. They declared their innocence - I secured them. Marlow saw them next day. Another female was at the bar with them; he pointed them out directly.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 17th of October, I was in Seven-dials, about half-past eight o'clock at night, and saw six or eight young men on the opposite side; the prisoner was with them; he crossed over to the same side as I was, and had a sugar loaf in his apron - I asked him what he had there; he said what was that to me; he made some resistance, I called for the watchman. I insisted on knowing where he was going; he said to No. 9, Greek-street, Soho. We said we would take him there - we went about six yards; he then turned round, and said,</p>
               <p>"No, I'll go to the watch-house." The prosecutor afterward claimed the loaf.</p>

            . I heard an alarm, and saw Mee running, with something under his arm. I stopped him - he had dropped it by that time. I saw Foster join him in the Church-yard, about ten yards from Monk's shop - he ran with him - they kept close together. I then saw Foster throw the time-piece down - I had not seen Mee give it to him - he got out of my sight, but Mee never was. I am positive Foster threw it down.</p>

               <p>"Do you belong to this butter?" they both denied knowing anything of it. I had the flats opened in their presence, and there were two notes in them, with Cooper's name on them, and the quanty contained in each flat.</p>

On the 9th of October, about a quarter to six o'clock in the morning, I saw Shaw turning the corner of Hope-passage, leading from the market into Ivy-lane, in a direction to Stevens's, with two flats of butter on his shoulder; a man whom I do not know came up to him, and took the top flat from his shoulder; he walked half way down the passage with it, then turned round to Shaw, and said</p>
               <p>"Come on nobby," Shaw said</p>
               <p>"No, d - n my eyes, it won't do this morning;" the other man said</p>
               <p>"Never mind, come on," and they went off together in the same direction, and went into Stevens's.</p>

A few days previous to this circumstance I had leave to go out of town, and got the prisoner to do my business in the office, having known him some years - it would be his business to carry the parcels from the office to the coach, which sets off from the Bricklayers' Arms. I returned on the 27th of September, but not being very well, he continued in my situation. I gave him 10 s. 6 d.; and on Tuesday evening, the 30th of September, he came to me.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you sure I did not give it to you - A. Not to my knowledge. I believe he gave me three.</p>

I counted them after him, but one Mr. Potter, a passenger, had several parcels, which were entered as parcels, and some as baggage - I might have counted one of his. I locked the boot up immediately.

            . I am in the service of Mr. Walker, cloth-worker, who lives opposite this house. On the 1st of October, about a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning, I was looking out of window, and saw the three prisoners come out of No. 34. I went after them as far as Cripplegate-buildings - I was close to them. Matthews had a load on his head, in a wrapper - they made a stand there, and then went on to the corner of the buildings. Matthews went on - the other two stopped at the corner. I went into a gin-shop for assistance, came out, the two men went round the corner, and Matthews threw the lead off his head on the pavement, put his hat down by the side of it, and was going after the others, leaving it behind, and got about fifty yards, when I collared him; the others were not taken till Wednesday last - I am certain of them all, for when they stopped, I stared them in the face, to notice them. I picked them out from others when they were taken. I found Matthews's wrapper contained lead pipe, and brass cocks, with a ball, among it - he had a knot as if he was a porter - the lead weighed 1 1/4 cwt. I went into the house, found all the pipe cut away, and the cocks; we matched the pipe to the place, it tallied with what remained.</p>

On the 13th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I went to bed, and saw that the doors and windows were fastened. Between three and four o'clock, my husband got up to go to work - I got up, and fastened the door after him, went to bed again, and got up rather before six o'clock; it was then light. I did not go to the washhouse when I let my husband out, but at six o'clock, I found the wash-house window broken, and the door open - somebody must have got over the gate to get to it; it is a sash window; a person could put his arm through, and unbolt the door; there are no shutters to it - I missed a pair of breeches out of a washing tub, a shirt, a pair of stockings, four odd ones, and a pocket handkerchief. I had them to wash, and had left them in water the night before.</p>

On the 14th of October, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming from Edmonton, towards town, with with a bundle under his right arm, and asked what was in it; he said a shirt and a pair of breeches of his own; that he brought them from Harford. I examined them; the breeches were clean and wet - I took him to the watch-house, found another shirt in his hat, and a white bag, and some stockings in his pocket.</p>

On Sunday night last, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to me in Russell-street, called to me by name, and said he wanted to give himself up to me, for the officers were after him, and he did not want to be pulled and hauled about - that he had robbed Mr. Lacy, of Tottenham-place, where he lodged, of between 2 l. and 3 l., and a watch - and had nothing to eat since eight o'clock the day before. I gave him refreshment, and went next day to Lacy; he said he had sold the watch for 10 s., and spent the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Before my late mistress died - she said my present master and mistress were to pay my doctor's bill, as no nurse had been employed, and I had injured my health by attending to her. After her death, a renewal of my complaint increased the bill - it amounted to 3 l. 9 s., my present mistress said my wages should be stopped to finish payment of the bill - I objected to it, and they were going to part with me on the Saturday, as this occurred on Wednesday. I should have had 15 s. to take, deducting the doctor's bill. I was in great distress.</p>
               <p>MISS BRIERS. My mother is lately dead; she attended on her, but I had another woman. She might have said this in my absence. The prisoner was not paid extra for her labour. The things were locked up in a box; it was not broken open. All that was due to her was not paid; she had applied for it, but it was inconvenient - her health<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220028"/>has been impaired, but I cannot say whether it was in consequence of attending my mother.</p>

I enquired for the prisoner, but could not find him at his house till the 22d - I have known him five years. I found him at his mother's, put him in the watch-house, and asked what he had done with the coat; he said he knew nothing of it. I brought the witnesses to him; they said he was the man. Lumsden said,</p>
               <p>"How came you to steal my coat?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Because I was in distress; I do not know who has got it; I sold it to a Jew in the street, for 5 s."</p>

I was in bed - Fargnes alarmed me; I ran out, and took the prisoner about three hundred yards off; he stopped, and asked what I wanted, saying he was an honest tradesman, and did not take them; he wanted to give his address, and go away. I found the chickens half a field off, in the way he had run. The others were close to the house with the hen.</p>

On the 15th of September, the prisoner called, and asked if I had room for a phaeton to stand, which belonged to a dancing master in Frith-street; he said he himself lived with Smith, a stable-keeper, in Clipstone-street, and wanted to borrow harness to bring the phaeton, and then to take away a chaise. I asked if he knew Smith's brother, who kept a public-house in Oxford-street; he said, Yes, he was a stout man. I saw my man deliver the harness to him, and saw no more of him nor the phaeton - he was apprehended on the Friday following, and denied ever seeing me before.

            . I am a harness-maker, and live in Marlborough-place, Great Peter-street. On the 12th of September, the prisoner sold me a horse collar for 1 s., and said he had an old chaise harness, which he had bought of Mr. Richardson, the lottery-office keeper's coachman, and would bring it next day, and on the 15th he brought it, and asked 25 s. for it - I agreed to give him 18 s., paid him 2 s. 6 d. in part, and on Wednesday paid him the rest.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of Bethnal-green. On the 12th of October, I saw the prisoner with another man, who had a hide under his right arm; they were walking one after the other, close together. I went up to the other man, and asked what he had got; I thought it was a bundle of linen - he made no answer; but the prisoner came behind him, and pushed him on - the man then ran to the corner, by the public-house. Jones took him, and took him in there to know what he had got; then the prisoner came behind,

             the hide from under his arm, and ran away. I followed the prisoner; he fell down - I secured him with it under his arm. Gibbs came and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How far from the prosecutor's did you see him - A. In James-street, opposite the warehouse, about a hundred yards from the warehouse. I do not know whether he heard what I said to the other man.</p>

            . I live at Bethnal-green, and have a warehouse in James-street. On Sunday, the 12th of October, this hide was brought to my house - I know it to be mine, by a mark on it; it was wrapped in one of my men's aprons, marked T. F. - he has absconded. I have known the prisoner some years; he used to be drinking with my men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any mark of your own on it - A. It is the dresser's mark. I bought all the man had at the fair. I have missed property to a great amount. The key will unlock the door when single locked, but will not turn it a second time - but they can easily pull the bolt aside then. I have often found it on the single lock when I had double locked it. I have been robbed almost every Sunday for the last three years, to the amount of 300 l. in all.</p>

I asked what it all meant; she said she could not stop there, and went away. The bundle remained till my sister came home - it contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

On the 3d of October, 1822, the prisoner came to me as the house-keeper of Lady Erskine - I was on the second-floor, this shawl was laying in the room when I opened the door to her - she pretended to faint, and said she had given a coachman a sovereign and a shilling instead of two shillings, and he had abused her, and made her ill - I asked her to sit down - I did not know her before. I gave her some brandy, and when she recovered, she said she came from Dr. Tweedy, of Ely-place, that she was housekeeper to Lady Erskine, and wanted me to make mourning for six female servants. I got her a pen, and she wrote down what was wanted, and I was to go to Thompson's, No. 125, Leadenhall-street, for the materials for the dress, and to go next morning to No. 20, Jermyn-street, St. James's, to see her ladyship, and receive further orders - she was about an hour with me. I let her down stairs, and the moment I returned, I missed my shawl, which I had pulled off not twenty minutes before she came in. It was about half-past eight o'clock when I let her out - she ran up Holborn, which arose my suspicions. I did not see her again for a twelvemonth, but am quite certain of her person. I have not found the shawl, nobody but her had been in the room, except a man, who brought a bedstead - I never suspected him. I have the order she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220032"/>wrote. I did not go to Lady Erskine, but went to Leadenhall-street - there was no No. 125, nor any Mr. Thompson.</p>

On the 22d of October, 1822, the prisoner came to me to make some mourning for Lady Erskine's twelve servants, and said her ladyship lived at No. 20, Jermyn-street. I had a silk dress in a drawer, with some muslin - my servant was in the room. The prisoner was about two hours there, and wished for paper to write a letter to Mr. Hart, linen-draper, Holborn, for me to get the materials for the mourning; she said the linen-draper was waiting with the things, but was obliged to return, as the footman who had been sent could not find me. I sent my servant to buy paper for her to write the order, and while she was gone, she asked me if that was a servant, I said Yes - she desired I would ask her to step out, as she did not wish to be in the company of servants, and when she brought the paper, I sent her away. She wished for something to eat, and I went out to get her something - I was absent about five minutes, leaving her alone in the room - she staid an hour after that. I had put this dress in the drawer just before she came in. She asked me to lend her a shawl, to go home in, and 3 s. to pay a coach, which I did, and directly I let her out, she went off hastily, without wishing me good night, which excited my suspicions. I immediately looked into the drawer, and missed these things - they are worth 2 l. 15 s. I shewed Mr. Hart the letter next morning - he declined supplying the goods. I did not go to Lady Erskine - she said Mr. Cheesborough, of Racquet-court, recommended her to me. I enquired of him, and found it was false. I saw her again on the 12th of September, and can swear to her positively.</p>

On Saturday, the 3d of May, the bills and property stated in the indictment were safe in my cash-box, which I kept locked in my bureau. Mrs. Parry and myself went to church, on Sunday, leaving him and two other servants at home; the bureau was in the dining-room, on the first floor - the servants would not be on that floor. We returned from church about half-past twelve o'clock, and the maid servant immediately asked her mistress if she had locked the dining-room door - she said No; we found it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220033"/>locked, and the key gone. The lodgers on the second floor had gone to chapel - we waited till they came home, to see if they had locked it. I got into the room by a ladder, found the bureau forced open, also the inner cupboard of the bureau, and the cash-box gone, with its contents - the prisoner was absent. I did not see him again till he was apprehended, about a fortnight ago - he had received his wages on the Saturday night. He said when he first saw me,</p>

            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's consin, and lived in the house. I and the prisoner were left at home on Sunday. I went out, leaving him and the maidservant in the house - they were the only persons there. I do not know whether the lodgers were gone to church or not. I returned about half an hour before my cousin - the prisoner had then left the house, and the room door was locked. I thought he might have locked it because I was out; when my cousin returned, I got in through the window, found the bureau forced open, and the cash-box gone, and in about an hour, I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings - he and his wife were gone; we found the cash-box in the room, with the bills in it, but the money gone; some of the clothes he wore that morning were in the room.</p>

I said I would have nothing to do with it, and the best thing he could do would be to return it to his father, and have it returned to the committee; he said he wanted money, and wished to dispose of it. I thought I had better consult my father, and went to the synagogue to him - he came home. I told him of it, and he went away. The prisoner took the pointer out of his bosom at a public-house. where I saw him, and shewed it to me for a moment - it was round his neck; he opened his waistcoat, and took it out, and put it in again.

I saw him next day in the lock-up room of the Mansion-house; he said he secreted himself in a cupboard under the staircase, at the further end of the synagogue, and staid there an hour after service, then went to the ark with a key, which was left in some other place, and opened the door with it, and took the pointer out - that the bells and other ornaments made such a noise, he was afraid to take any more, and he got out when they opened the ladies' gallery.</p>

I returned to my master's shop, and told Buckridge, the beadle, shewed him the house, went up stairs soon after him, and saw the desk - he had them in custody, and at the watch-house, Buckridge found a key which opened it, and we found the prosecutor out.</p>

I was walking with Mr. Fuller, and noticed several persons lurking about, and about two doors from St. Paul's, I saw Mr. Fuller's handkerchief go from his pocket - the prisoner was close by. I turned round, and saw him drop it in the road, and seized him; he said he had not had it in his possession, but had just come from his master's - the persons who were lurking about were gone then.</p>

            . On the day in question, I went to the prosecutor's shop, and bought goods, amounting to 2 l. 3 s. The prisoner served me - I paid him a sovereign in part - he said he did not wish me to pay it unless it suited me. He went to the till with the sovereign; I cannot say whether he put it in. I told him to take care of it; he said he had put it into the till.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Has he not set up a tally shop himself - A. Yes, in Goswell-street; I called there on Michaelmas-day, and said I was going to settle with Mr. Dimmock; he said very well. I said nothing to him about it after I heard of the sovereign not being entered. I ordered goods amounting to 2 l. 3 s., and paid him 1 l. on account - he was attending to no other customer.</p>
               <p>MR. DIMMOCK. He never accounted to me for this sovereign - there is no entry of his having received any money all that week - he should have entered the money as received, in the waste book, but had no business to make any entry in the day-book. The rule is, for the person selling goods to call them over to another, who enters them, and puts the name of the person receiving the money against it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What is the amount of goods sold according to the entry - A. 1 l. 3 s. If the clerk was absent any other young man might make the entry, but not the one who sells the goods. He left me in August or September, and I understand has set up in business for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not this money have been put into the till - A. No. Each shopman has a separate till with a look to it; all ready money should be entered in the book; they give their money up to me every night; I compare it with their account; his being in business could not injure me. Mine is a tally shop; there was no difference on or about the 3d of May between the cash and the entries. He should give credit for 1 l., and enter 1 l. 3 s. as due. The whole goods should be entered, and if he forgot to enter 1 l. as paid, still the money should have been in the till.</p>

            . I am a drawer in the Assay-office. On the 8th of October, I received three watch cases from Richards. I have two of the same cases here; they are for hunting watches - the other was a double case. The top part of the hunting cases we call the cover, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220036"/>lower part, the bottom; in double cases, the outside is called a bottom, and the inner one the middle bottom. The stamp on a hunting case is a variable letter, denoting the year, and the figures 18, denoting that the gold is 18 carats pure, which is the standard - the mark impressed on the bottom is a crown, above the figure 18 on the center - a leopard's head on the left, and a variable letter on the right. The stamp on the bottom of a hunter would never be impressed on the middle bottom of a double case - that would be only a crown and 18. We call the flat surface only the bottom, and all the rest wires - we only stamp the bottom. A small bottom being introduced into large wires, would denote that all the case was of the same quality; it would appear as if all had been assayed. When I received these cases, I put the mark on them, and a private mark of my own on the bottoms and wires; then gave them to Richards to deliver.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th of the same month did you receive any more cases from Richards - A. Yes, two hunting cases, and found they were the same as had been assayed on the 8th, except that new bottoms had been substituted - my private mark was upon all the wires, and in consequence of this the prisoner was apprehended. I searched his shop with two officers, and found a quantity of gold cases partly made, and not marked, and one loose bottom, with the mark on it, it had been cut out of a case, which had been assayed. We never stamp cases without the wires being attached to them. I found the prisoner's day book on his premises - here is an entry of two gold cases having been sent home on the 10th, to Mr. Tyrer; there is no other entry of gold work, having been sent out after the 9th, when these cases left the hall. The weight and prices of the cases are not entered - we went to Tyrer, who lives in Northampton-street, and found Bellows there; he gave me two double bottomed gold cases - upon examination, I found my private mark on the bottoms; they were bottoms of the cases assayed on the 8th - the wires were different, and had never been assayed; the bottoms had been transposed into new wires - the middle bottoms had the letter, and 18, instead of the crown, and my private mark was on them; they had been transposed from the covers of hunters; the new wires contained more metal than the original ones. I produce the hunting cases sent on the 14th, and the cases found at Tyrer's. The prisoner's shop is in his yard - there is a little boarding to separate where the gold is manufactured, from the silver work. Bellows gave me a bill of parcels, which corresponds with the entry in the book. There is a bruise on one of the cases found at Tyrer's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I believe you have been a watch case maker yourself - A. Yes. The bottoms and wires are manufactured separately, and afterwards joined. I believe the wires of large cases are stamped, as well as the bottoms, if they will admit of it, but with a different stamp; the business of a silver case maker, is distinct from gold case makers.</p>
               <p>Q. When a bottom or cover is stamped, it can only be extended by a hammer - A. Hammering, or going through a flatting-mill, that would flatten the mark, but not obliterate it; it would spoil the beauty of it The marks are perfect on these cases - I should think they had not been flatted. Cases are often spoiled in finishing after they are marked; they should be sent back to be remarked, we should then keep them a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not very common to put on another rim to save that day - A. Never, the case is always sent back.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the trouble and expence in making a new cover if the wire is spoiled, might not the workman put a new one without the master's knowledge - A. In a small shop, like the prisoner's, I think not. Whoever superintends must know it, as it requires gold to do it. There is no duty upon watch cases; the mark is to denote the quality.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. If a case is spoiled do the Company charge anything for re-stamping - A. No; the damaged part comes back with it. I only found two boys in the prisoner's shop; no journeyman. If the damaged part was not delivered to the master, he would find a deficiency. The cases produced do not appear to have been flattened - it is not necessary to extend it to put on a larger wire.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the value of a carat of pure gold - A. I believe about 3 s. 6 d. This stamp denotes that there are 24 carats, 18 pure, and 6 alloy; every additional carat of alloy would be 3 s. 6 d. in the manufacturer's pocket. One of the cases sold to Tyrer weighs 1 oz. 12 dwts., and more than half of that is the weight of the wires; they would be about 12 dwts. A carat is the 24th of an oz.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY, declined entering into the question whether the new wires were adulterated or not, the statute not requiring that proof.</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's employ, and took the cases to the hall to be stamped - he kept no journeyman, while I lived with him, which was four or five months; he had two apprentices, who generally worked upon silver - he and his brother worked on gold; his brother had left him about a week before; I took the cases to the hall the last time - I took three on the 8th, with a memorandum, which I gave Richards, and next day I got them back, and delivered them to my master; and two or three days before the house was searched he sent me with two gold cases to Tyrer's - I had seen them on my master's workbench before. He told me in the kitchen that there were two gold cases on the board, and to go and get them, and take them to Mr. Tyrer's; I took them off his board, and as I was going along one of them jolted out of my pocket, and when I got there I found a brass edge and pillow plate had fallen out. I took a bill with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner superintended the silver business - A. Yes, and his brother the gold. I worked in the shop myself drawing wires; there is a partition between the gold and silver departments. My master always worked on the silver bench; till lately he worked on the gold. I believe his brother was canvassing for a situation; he did not leave the house entirely till my master was taken. I have not seen him since - I cannot say he has fled. My master attended to the gold work for a fortnight or three weeks before he was apprehended - he had vary little to do with it till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his brother the person who melted alloy and manufactured gold - A. Yes. His brother came back after looking for the situation, but did no work then. Before that my master principally attended to the silver; he had a great deal of silver work. I have heard high words<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220037"/>between them, about his brother making a mistake in the gold work. I have not been to the house since my master was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have not been to the house since - A. I went next morning; they opened the door a little way. I was not let in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the brother at work on the day you took the cases to Tyrer - A. No. I saw the prisoner at work on gold cases that morning, washing them out - they were like the cases I took; I saw no others in the shop. I do not know how the brother was paid, or whether he was a partner.</p>

On Friday evening, the 10th of October, about six or seven o'clock, Smith brought two gold cases and this bill, and about half an hour after, I found a brass edge and pillow plate missing, and found a bruise on one case.

I was cleaning the bar window, between eight and nine o'clock, and saw her in the act of throwing a knife at me, and lowered my head to escape it - it went through the window, and fell into the court. I went on with my work, and in about a quarter of an hour breakfast was ready. I went into the tap-room, and she was cutting bread and butter; she had a knife in her hand, and said, if I said that again she would stick the knife into me.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you said - A. We had had a few words about a female servant, and I said I did not care a d - n about any woman; she said, if I repeated that she would stick me. I made her no answer - my fellow-servant came and caught hold of her, when he heard her say this, as she was making a stab at me - he held her for a moment, and thinking her temper was cooled - he let her go, and she immediately came and made a stab at me as I was in the box. I saw her coming - I rose up, and she stabbed me in the left arm; and using a bad expression, said,</p>
               <p>"I'll do for you." I think the blow was aimed at my body, but I received it in my arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who is Ann - A. The female servant; my wife had accused me of improper conduct with her; she came to me for 5 s., which I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220038"/>allowed her. I desired Yates to go to the back door, and call Ann - she asked what I wanted with Ann.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say I want her to use her, to be sure - A. I never said</p>
               <p>"use;" my wife asked for 5 s. I allowed her - I said she should have it in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say Ann was going away for a week, and you wished to accompany her - A. No; she was bothering me about Ann - I said I did not care a d - n about any woman - she might have struck me in the moment of irritation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after she was cutting the bread and butter did she cut at you - A. She had not put the knife out of her hand. I will not swear there was not more irritating language passed.</p>

I left a small pug dog tied in the kitchen, but no person in the house. I was passing the house about half-past seven o'clock, and heard the dog barking - I stood opposite the house some time - a man looked me in the face as I crossed over - another came up and asked me what it was o'clock - I took out my watch, and told him a quarter to eight, but it was too fast. In about five minutes two men opened the door and came out - I immediately ran across and secured the last one, who was the prisoner. An officer came up and took him, and asked what business he had in the house - he made no answer. I went into Charter-house-street soon after, to pursue the other man, and there found a quantity of halfpence - a small housewife, a few needles, and an empty box, which were in the house when I left, were found on the prisoner. I had let the servant have the key, and did not go in for some time.</p>

            . I am twelve years old, and am errand boy to Mr. Edgerley, who lives in this building. On the 6th of October, I was at work on the first floor; not over the prisoner's room, but on the right hand side of the staircase - I heard a cracker go off about half-past eight o'clock; the men went down stairs; I knocked at the prisoner's door, got no answer, went up again, and about a quarter past nine o'clock I went down and saw the fire burning the partition, about three or four inches from the prisoner's door, and half a yard from the staircase; lighted coals were dropping through the partition. I alarmed the men, who came down, broke into the room, and found about two shovels full of coals, alight, piled up against the partition, and the room full of smoke: - we put the fire out - the grate had no coals in it, the bars were quite warm; the coals were across the room, quite away from the stove. I went to look after the prisoner - I was present with Downes, and met him by Mr. Medburst's, on the other side of Fleet-street, nearly opposite the passage, and went with him to the watch-house; he said he saw the place alight, and put the key in his pocket and went away - he said so to Cousins, at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he saw the wainscoat alight - A. He said he saw the place on fire; there were eight boys about the premises, some of them used to plague him. I know nothing of squibs or papers of gunpowder being put under his door, nor about the handle of his door being daubed with filth - Mr. Drury's pressman had let the cracker off - I have heard the boys talk of playing him tricks, but do not know what the tricks were. I know nothing of the key of his door being stolen, or holes being bored in his door.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Bingham, printer, whose office is over the prisoner's room; there is a room between them. On the 6th of October we were printing, and had paper and books there belonging to Mr. Wooller. I heard a noise soon after nine o'clock, went down, and saw the prisoner's door burst open. Philp and Twopenny were there; the coals were scattered round the room by the door; the partition was red hot, but not in flames; the coals were in flames, and the room full of smoke - water was thrown on them - the grate felt quite warm, and a few ashes remained at the bottom - the coals could not have got on the floor by accident. I had seen the prisoner go out of his room about half-past seven o'clock that evening, with a female - I saw him shut the door, but am not sure that be locked it - and heard him say that the premises had been burnt down twice before; that they considered it was by accident, but he considered it was done on purpose. I saw him afterwards in custody of the watchman, and one of the boys. I heard him say, with an oath, that he saw the place on fire when he came away - that he did not care about the house, and would leave it burning - he seemed intoxicated, and stamped about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was present when this was said - A. Philp, Twopenny, and Downes, who are printers' boys, and Gogan, a journeyman, and Plumber, a printer, were present - Moore, the constable, I think was present, and must have heard it. I never played tricks with him.</p>

               <p>Q. You said</p>
               <p>"Old woman, which way is blackey gone" - A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mention before the magistrate, about his saying he saw the place on fire, and did not care a d - n about it - A. No. I was not asked the question. I stated it to the Grand Jury. I did not remember it at the time.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Dean, who has an office in Crown-court. On the 6th of October, I was on these premises - the errand-boy gave an alarm. I went down on the first floor, and saw the boards all on fire - we burst open the door, and found lighted coals placed against the wainscot, and the partition burnt through. I helped to put the fire out. I got Moore, and found Rogeson on the opposite side of the way, and went to the watch-house with him, and remained there till Cousins came - he did not appear to me to be in liquor; he said</p>
               <p>"D - n fire, I see fire light burn, come out, lock door."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mention this before the magistrate - A. I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Q. You were told to state all you knew - A. Yes. I did not think of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating the charge to be founded in conspiracy, to oblige him to quit the premises; that he had received every possible insult from the printer's boys, who had put fire-works under his door, and find a pistol through a hole into his room; he had not insured the premises, and therefore could have no interest in destroying them.</p>

            . I know all the printers' boys, who have been examined. On the 6th of October, I was at the prisoner's academy, looking up his linen, several fire-works were let off - he said he had been annoyed by them all the evening - three squibs came under the door while I sat there, and a pistol was let off - I was alarmed, and wished to leave - I left in about ten minutes, and as I went through the court, three of these boys said</p>
               <p>"D - n him, we will do for him to night," and while I was buying a pennyworth of pears at the bottom of the court, one of the boys came and said to the woman,</p>
               <p>"Do you know where blackey is gone?" she said she did not; he said</p>
               <p>"Do you know if he is going to return to night, for if he will not, we are going to have a d - d lark with him." I went home</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What led you to his room - A. I cleaned his apartment - he does not live at the academy. I left the room between seven and eight o'clock - he came down the court while I stood there, and said he was going to his washerwoman, to take the linen away - there was a middling fire in the grate when I left - I threw a few coals on.</p>

            . On the 6th of October, I was at my stall. Downes came to me and said</p>
               <p>"Old woman, which way is blackey gone?" and asked if I thought he would return that night, and said</p>
               <p>"if he does not, we mean to have a d - d good lark with him" - I am sure he said we. One evening, about a month ago, I was in the prisoner's room, lighting the fire, and he complained that he had lost his key, and while I was there, it was thrown under the door, and a person ran up stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you - A. I used to light his fire and sweep his room in the morning, as the other woman could not do it in the morning. Wilson was present when Downes said this</p>

            . I was on Snow-hill, on the 15th of October, and saw the prisoner - he asked me if I wanted a situation - I said Yes I did not know him; he said a gentleman had spoken to him for a servant. I went with him to a public-house; he wrote me a note to the gentleman, and after that, said he would go with me himself, for the gentleman would be in town in about half an hour. I went with him to the Exchange; he told me to wait on the steps until he came back, which he did in a few minutes, and pulled out one or two sovereigns, and asked me for change. I gave him 18 s. and two sixpences - he turned away without giving me the sovereign, and said he would be back in a minute or two, and would give it to me again - he never came at all.</p>

I tried to cry out, but his hand was over my mouth. I asked him the way to Stratford, as I was never in the lane before. I met three men, who took me down the lane into the road. When I asked the prisoner the way, he took me up, and threw me down violently, and said that was the way. He ran one way and I the other. I did not mention what had happened till next day, except to the men who shewed me the way home. I got home about twelve or one o'clock, and told my brother. I have recovered my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Neither of your brothers are here - A. No; they live at Stratford. It was Stepney-fair time. I have been living with Rolfe since, and not with Ellis, the officer. My brother went to Whitechapel office next day, and Ellis came to our house in the evening. I did not tell the prisoner's attorney that the examination would be at Bow-street. The prisoner's father-in-law returned me my watch last Sunday week, and I received 2 l. before that. I was as sensible as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the watch was taken from you because you was so beastly drunk you could not take care of it; did not your brother tell you so - A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. About the 1st of October, I heard of this robbery, and apprehended the prisoner at the Three Tuns, public-house, at Bow, last Thursday night, and said I wanted him for robbing Baxter. He said he was very sorry for what he had done, and blamed his wife for urging him to do it. He said he had pawned the watch. The prosecutor had recovered it before I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your business lays at Bow-street office - A. No; not particularly. My station is principally in Whitechapel. I take my charges to Lambeth-street, generally.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We were all in liquor. This lad's brother-in-law took him on his back, then asked me to carry him, which I did, and we both fell down.

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 20th of October, about half-past seven o'clock at night, I was in Vine-street, Chandos-street, with another man, and saw Cowley behind the counter of an iron shop - there was a woman in the shop; she gave Cowley a cloth; he shook this metal out of it, and put it under the counter. I was looking through the window. I went in, and asked what he had got from that woman - he said, Nothing. I said I was sure he had, for I saw it, and shewed him my staff - he then handed two or three gas-pipes from under the counter. I said they were not all, I was sure; he then gave me seven cocks and a tube from under the counter, where I had seen him put them - I asked if they were all - he said Yes, they were all he had received; that it weighed 3 lbs., and he had given 1 s. 6 d. for it. I cannot say whether he had paid the woman any money, as I turned my head to call Godfrey. I took the things into my possession, and gave the woman in charge of Gray, and went with her to the White Horse, public-house, St. Martin's-lane - I saw Winstanley there; Gray shewed him one of the cocks, and asked if he had sent his wife to sell anything; he said he had; that he worked for the Gaslight Company, and had picked them up by a little at a time. They weigh 3 lbs., and are worth 1 s. 6 d.</p>

            . I am store-keeper to the Company. Winstanley was employed as a labourer. About the 19th of October, I ordered him to clear out a room at the Horseferry-road station; I had put three dozen old cocks into a drawer there, the week before; he had access to them. Upon hearing this charge, I missed ten - here are seven of the same description. I have no doubt of their being the Company's property, and here is a burner I know well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are men they call fitters-up - A. Yes; they work for anybody, and take away old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220043"/>materials. It is not unusual to find such things in old iron shops. I only know the cocks by their general appearance, but this burner I am sure was in the room a week before.</p>

I said I should go and see who Vaughan was; he took me to a house in Moorfields; I was not satisfied and detained him - I found the house belonged to Mr. Wilkinson, and was under repair - it weighs 127 lbs.</p>

I did not stay at home.

I was in a neighbour's house, with the officers, when they passed, and they were taken before they got to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your name - A. I go by the name of Johnson, my married name is Stevens - my name was Lloyd before I married.

On the 17th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I missed this stew-pan from my shop; it was safe three hours before. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I found it in Gee's-court. The prisoner was in the shop. I told her it had been stolen from me. She said she bought it of a particular friend, of whom she had bought things before: that she knew where she lived, and would fetch her in a few minutes. I said,</p>
               <p>"Fetch the thief, and I will prosecute her." She then said the person told her she had been working at a gentleman's house, who was not able to pay her, and gave her this to sell. She went to fetch the person as I thought. I took the pan to the office, then went into Barrett's-court, where I had seen her go, and met her coming out of No. 8, with two men. They all declared the thief was not there, and had not been there all night. She afterwards said the woman was called Blind Mary, being blind of one eye. I went to the officer, and told him to look for the man who lived in the prisoner's house, and about three o'clock that afternoon she came to me with the daughter of the woman she accused as the thief, and said she was come to beg I would not prosecute the thief or her; and both said, if the mother and her were convicted, one would have seven years and the other fourteen. I said I would prosecute unless she produced her, as I was certain she could if she liked, but if she did she might look for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time in the morning did you first go to the shop - A. About ten o'clock. The pan stood outside the door, exposed for sale, with my mark chalked inside it. She came voluntarily to me. Afterwards a man came to me, who calls himself her husband; she was taken next morning. She said at another time, that the woman she bought it of was drunk on the bed when she went up. I asked why she did not bring her down. She said she promised to follow. She brought a young woman to the office herself.</p>

            . I am a cooper, and live in Gee's-court, opposite the prisoner's - she is married. On the evening in question, about seven o'clock, I stood at my door with Mawn, the broker - the prisoner came over to me with this stew-pan, and said,</p>
               <p>"What may I give for this, a woman has brought it;" I weighed it in my hand, and said if she gave 7 s. she could not hurt, taking it as old copper. I did not examine it. Her husband not being at home, she did not know the value. Blind Mary was at the door looking after her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You advised her to buy it as old copper - - A. Not as old copper; I considered it as old copper. It was dark; I have now a better sight of it. Mawn, the broker, lives in Henrietta-street - I will be bound to say it is not worth above 7 s. Blind Mary used to lead her husband about begging. I went after her, and found she lived at No. 8, Barrett's-court; I went there with the prisoner, but could not find her - she was not laying drunk on the bed. I was about with the prisoner three or four hours, to get a warrant to apprehend the woman. She did not abscond.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke's. On the 25th of October, at ten minutes past eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at the corner of Castle-street, City-road, with a bag containing lead - two others were with him. I secured him, and asked what he had got - he said he did not know. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

I insisted on his leaving the room; he went out in half an hour, and in about ten minutes, I missed a paper of penny pieces, told an officer, who took him in a quarter of an hour, and found three penny pieces, and 2 s. 6 d. in silver on him - he had a clean shirt and handkerchief on, and before that, he had no shirt on - nobody but him could have taken them.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Waghall, brickmaker, at Ewell. On the 30th of May I brought a mare to Smithfield to sell. I saw the prisoner and another person at the corner of a street by Smithfield Bars. The prisoner crossed the road; his companion followed him. The prisoner asked the price of the mare. I said 5 l. He offered 3 l. I refused it. He then asked if I would take 3 l. 10 s. I refused. He left me, and in about twenty minutes I saw him down on the pavement, near Charterhouse-lane. His companion left him, and came and asked me to move the mare down there, which I did. The prisoner asked me to move her up and down, which I did. He then offered four sovereigns, which I refused. The prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Come, young man I will treat you with a pint of porter for showing us the mare." We went to the Red Cow, public-house, in the lane. I had a pot of porter, which the prisoner paid for, and while we were drinking it, his companion said, if I would take 5 s. out of the five sovereigns, they would take the mare. I consented. The prisoner said we must have the bridle, cloth and saddle into the bargain, which I refused, but said I would buy him a new halter, or give him 1 s. to buy one. I went into the market, leaving them in conversation. I returned with a halter; the prisoner took it out of my hand, and put it on the mare: His companion gave me five sovereigns. I gave him 5 s. He told his companion to take her to the Ram and give her a feed; he asked for my master's address, which I gave him; he asked how far I had to go. I said fourteen miles; he said I had better go by the coach immediately, as I could go for 1 s. I then suspected the money was not good; I rung it, and told him I thought it was bad. He assured me it was good. I came down into the market, and went into a shop and shewed it to a gentleman, who said it was counterfeit. I never lost sight of it. I came out, and got Hull's assistance; he went with me to Stainton. I shewed them the five sovereigns. We went and found the prisoner in the market. Stainton told him he was concerned in passing bad sovereigns; he said he had nothing to do with it. Two more were found on him at the Compter, with my master's address in his pocket-book.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Russell and Co. of the Bell Inn, Friday-street, and have been so thirteen years. In Michaelmas, 1822, I began to deliver parcels. The Excise Office was in my district, I had a delivery-book and tickets to correspond. The book was to be signed by the person who received the parcels; the amount of carriage and the address was entered - the amount included the carriage and cartage, and is entered in a column in the book. I have a ticket also mentioning the name and the amount of carriage. About March, 1822. I was in the habit of going to the Excise-Office with parcels; the three defendants were employed in the warehouse-keeper's office as porters - when I went to deliver parcels I saw all three of them; on one occasion Wright and Butler asked what I was going to stand? Daffin was present; it was soon after I began to deliver parcels. I told them I got nothing by the parcels, and could not afford to give anything. This conversation passed a dozen times before I consented to do it. They always spoke to me in this way, and generally all three were present. After this conversation I made out a fresh ticket, and destroyed the original one. The tickets I brought to the porters were backed by one of them, with the name of the place it came from. I then took it to Mr. Smart's office, and got the money. The signature in the book was close to the sum charged, and was signed by the porter. I made no alteration in the delivery-book, but I made out a fresh ticket several times, for the purpose of charging more than the original, and more than was stated in the delivery-book; the delivery-book was not altered. Smart paid me the sum on the new ticket. I believe it was in July, 1822, that I first consented to this plan. I continued to do so until the 14th of October last; on that day I took four parcels to the Office, and delivered them to Butler, and told him that from that time I would have nothing more to do with overcharging. He said I need not be afraid of having 1 s. on three which came to 9 s. I went there after that day, and Butler told me, in the presence of the others, that it was found out. He said it was blown, and desired me to take no notice of his knowing anything about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Smart paid you, what was done with the overplus money - A. I gave them money to drink, or went over the way and ordered drink for them; we divided the rest of the money between us; sometimes I would give them 6 d. out of the overcharge, and at other times a pot of beer; I did not give them exact proportions of the overcharge. The next time I saw Butler was before the end of October; he came to me at the Bell, and wished me not to tell that he knew anything of it; I would not satisfy him - I told him I should do the best for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to the delivery-book of the 18th of July, 1822. Do you recollect delivering on that day any parcel at the Excise-Office - A. Yes, a parcel is charged here 18 s. 8 d. including cartage; I saw the entry signed by Butler; he signed it when I delivered the parcel. The ticket I took with me that day I destroyed, and made a fresh one. Butler knew I had destroyed it and made a fresh one at the time he signed the book. I believe this to be the ticket (looking at one) it is my writing, but is not dated. I have overcharged 8 d.; I charged it 19 s. 4 d. On the 20th July, 1822, there is an entry signed</p>

            ;" I saw him sign it. The charge in the book is 10 s.; I charged 11 s. 3 d. on the fresh ticket. I accounted to my master for 10 s On the 22d of July I find an entry signed by Butler, charged 16 s. I destroyed that ticket, and charged 16 s. 6 d. on the new one, which money I received from Smart. On the 25th of July there is another entry signed by Butler, charged in the book 2 s.; I made out another ticket for 2 s. 6 d. This was a small parcel, and in these cases the porters do not indorse the back of the tickets. I received 2 s. 6 d. from Smart for it. On the 12th of August there is an entry signed by Butler charged 3 s. 6 d.; I destroyed the ticket, and charged one 4 s.; Smart paid me this sum. On the 17th of August there is an entry signed by Butler, for 2 s.; and another on the same day, signed by him for 1 s. 8 d. I have charged on the new tickets 2 s. 6 d. and 2 s. 9 d. On the 22d of August there is an entry of 2 s.; I charged 2 s. 6 d. On the 23d of September a charge of 11 s. 8 d.; I made out a fresh ticket for 12 s. 2 d.; Butler endorsed it. On the 26th of September there is a parcel charged 19 s. 3 d.; I charged 19 s. 9 d.; Butler endorsed the ticket. On the 3d of October here is an entry signed W. Daffin, charged 2 s.; I have charged 2 s. 6 d. Here is an entry on the same day of 14 s. 3 d. signed by Daffin; I destroyed the original ticket, and charged on the new one 14 s. 9 d. I made out these new tickets in the office, in the presence of the porters; sometimes they were all there, and sometimes not. Butler wished me, on the 14th of October, to make a greater charge than I did; I was going to put the 6 d. on; all the defendants were in the office; Butler said I might as well add 2 s. as 6 d. I said I did not like to go to such an extent. He said I need not be afraid, for if anything happened he would let me know of it. Here is five parcels, signed for by Daffin on the 10th, charged 7 s. 3 d. - 16 s. 9 d.; two for 6 s.; 4 s. 1 d. I charged more for them all; 9 s. for the 6 s. - 17 s. 3 d. for the 16 s. 9 d. I have no ticket for the others. Butler looked over me while I made out these tickets, and Daffin was opening the parcels. Butler indorsed these two tickets. Butler said there should be two tickets made for the two parcels, and I might as well add 2 s. as 6 d. On the 30th of September here is a parcel charged 14 s., signed by Wright; I destroyed the ticket, and charged 14 s. 6 d. on a new one, with his knowledge. I gave the surplus money on the 10th to Daffin, in the presence of all the defendants.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Can you recollect the day when this wicked system commenced - A. It was in July. I never did such a thing before. I did it by their permission. I always carried blank tickets with me, as I sometimes lost my tickets, or had none for porterage or empty boxes, and was obliged to make them out. I never got any printed. Chace, the clerk, knew that I carried blank tickets, and my master also knew it. I got them out of the drawer, which is always open. Chace<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220048"/>never knew of my making an overcharge. He knew I had blank tickets to use, if necessary.</p>

               <p>MR. BERNARD. Q. Was it before the last Sessions that you were sent to Bow-street - A. Yes; and after this charge was made, it has not been proceeded in.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did he know for what purpose you took them - A. He knew I filled one up when I lost one, or one was wanted for porterage. He has seen me take them, and never told me not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you discharged from Bow-street, or held to bail - A. Discharged; my master became bail for my appearance on the following Thursday, which I did, and was discharged.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Russell and Co. Jones was out of the employ nine months, except for that time he has been there as long as me, which is eight years. Jones was delivering porter when I first went there - the Excise-office is in his district. I make the entries in the delivery-book; he was furnished with a book of the charges. I have seen the several tickets produced - they are not made out by me, but by him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He left you for about nine months - A. Yes; it was not for any dishonesty that I know of. I never knew of his having a blank ticket; if I had I certainly should have prevented it. I never suffered one to be taken away, and never saw him take one, or I should have hindered him. March, 1822, was the time he came back - he was delivering porter before he left.</p>

On the 14th of October, two weights were stolen from my shop, after seven o'clock in the evening. I found them next morning, in Worms' back premises - they keep a marine store shop, in Fox's-court; about a hundred yards from my house. I called on them, and asked if they had lately bought two weights - the prisoner Henry said, we have not; the son said,</p>
               <p>"We have, father," and fetched them out - the boy who took them received 3 1/2 d. a piece for them; they are worth 2 s. 3 d. each. The boy who took the weights is named Ballard. I told the prisoners they ought to know better than to purchase such things of a boy. The father said to the son,</p>
               <p>"If you have bought them, fetch them;" the son said,</p>
               <p>"You gave me 2 d. to help pay for the last weight I bought" - he did not deny it at the time, but he did at Hatton-garden. Ballard said he received 2 d. from the elder prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did Ballard go with you to Worms's shop - A. Yes; he said he took one at a time, and another afterwards, that the younger prisoner gave him 3 1/2 d. each for them, and that the son got 2 d. from the father, in part payment for one. I do not know whether the weights are standard - I have not had them tried since they were stolen. The younger prisoner said his father was not at home at the time.</p>

               <p>"Go and fetch it." When I brought the second weight, he said he had only 1 1/2 d., and went to his father for 2 d. to make up the sum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the father present - A. Yes, he was in the shop when the son asked for the halfpence to pay for the second weight; he was not there when I took the first. It is a large shop, and he was attending to his business: it was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. Old Worms took the 2 d. out of his pocket.</p>

            . I am a constable of Marlborough-street. In July last I passed by the prisoner's shop, in Barrett's-court, Oxford-street; he keeps an old book-shop. I asked for Blackstone's Commentaries - he appeared to suspect my intentions. I bought an old dictionary. After some hesitation, he said, he had an odd volume of Blackstone. I wished to see it; and he produced this book (produced.) He said, he had just torn the cover off it. I asked what he wanted for it - he replied 6 d. I said he might as well let me have the cover; and he did so. I then said the book had been stolen from Marlborough-street office, because it contained the office mark, in gilt letters - he said perhaps it might. I went to the office, and found such a book had been lost.</p>

I shewed the skin to Mr. Bird. I took the prisoner into the back premises, and unbuttoned his clothes. I found another skin round his body; while taking it from him, he put something in his mouth, and swallowed it; I supposed it to be a duplicate.

I do not know whether they were women of the town. I had some beer with them, on my way from Chelsea.

Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening I met the girls Mills and Williams in Brydges-street, near Drury-lane. They asked me to treat them with something. I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, my girls, what will you take?" They said they would have some apples. I treated them with some at a stall. I asked them if they would have any gin, and I went with them to have it at the corner of White Hart-yard.

               <p>"Why do you act in that way? Do you suppose that I have no more money?" and pulled out my purse at the time. I was rather fresh. She did not return the crown-piece. Williams snatched the purse from me. I then remonstrated with her, and while I was making a piece of work about it, the servant (Collins) came up stairs, and demanded 2 s. for the room. I told her what had happened, the girls then run down stairs. I attempted to follow them, but was prevented by Collins' laying hold of the collar of my coat; she stopped me on the landing of the stairs. I got from her in about a minute. When I got to the door, the two girls were out of sight. I called out, Stop the two girls! When I got to the bottom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220051"/>of the stairs, Haynes threw me on the stairs. He got his hand in my neckcloth, and attempted to throttle me. I struggled with him for a quarter of an hour. Some boys, seeing us struggling, gave information to the Police, and the officers came to my assistance, and Haynes was taken into custody. They searched the house, and found the two girls hid in the cellar. Collins was not taken at that time. I have not seen the purse since, but I hear it is found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you rent a house - A. Yes. I have a lodger, and a wife and child. This happened between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. I went for the purpose of prostitution, no doubt. I made the excuse for not paying, because the other girls had robbed me. I was going after them when Collins stopped me. She was not in the room when the purse and crown was produced. It was my intention to give

They pulled each other down stairs. They were up five or six steps when I first saw them - the door was then shut. I stopped in the court until the constables came. I am quite sure the prosecutor said he was robbed of a 10 l. note. I did not tell the Justice so, because I was not asked the question.</p>

            . I am beadle. I went to this house a little after nine o'clock, in consequence of information. I found the prosecutor sitting in a chair in the parlour. Haynes was sitting near the fireplace. The prosecutor was in liquor, but was aware of what was going on at the time. He said he had been robbed of a purse and eight or nine sovereigns, and that he had been ill-treated by Haynes, and shewed me marks on his neck as if of knuckles and nails; blood also appeared. He said Haynes did it, which he did not deny. Haynes is not the keeper of the house. Abel described the two girls; I had seen them before. During the time I was there, two officers came to my assistance. I saw the two girls brought up out of the cellar. Collins was afterwards brought up. Abel did not make an accusation against Collins until he got to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. In consequence of information I went to this house. Abel said he had been robbed of eight or nine sovereigns and a purse. I asked him if he should know the girls? - he replied that he should. The women quite corresponded with his representation. He charged Haynes with using him very ill, but did not say in what way. I did not look at his neck; his clothes were dirty, and his neckcloth turned round. I went into the cellar and found the two girls. We brought Mills and Williams up stairs, and the prosecutor said they were the girls that had robbed him. - Saunders found a dollar on Mills. They both denied it; Mills did not say how she came by the dollar. Collins was afterwards found by Saunders in the dust-hole. Abel made no charge against her at that time. He said she had very ill used him, and she ought to be taken up. I afterwards went and took her into custody.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. Haynes sat by the fire with a child on his knee, when I went into the house; Abel stood by the fire. He said he had lost a purse containing eight or nine sovereigns - it was made of chocolate print, in the shape of a bag - that the prisoner Haynes had stopped him from running after the girls. Haynes said he would not tell us why he treated him so; he said they had been scuffling together, and asked him if he belonged to the house? he said</p>
               <p>"No." Another person came in and said he belonged to it. I found Williams first in the cellar; they were part of the way up stairs. The two girls answered Mr. Abel's description. I found Collins afterwards. I asked her what she did there? she said she was frightened. I searched the cellar, but did not find the property, and only found a dollar on Mills, which she said Abel had given her. Abel said that she took out his purse, and held it up to let them know that he had more money, and would not act dishonourable. I found about 7 s. on Mr. Abel, and a cheque for 10 l. or 12 l. in his pocket-book.</p>

            , a smith; we live at Little White Lion-street, Seven-dials. Avis, an officer of Bow-street, introduced me to a person of the name of Fidler. I went with her to No. 1, William-street, Spa-fields - twice on the 10th of October with her, and again on the 11th, by myself. Avis gave me two shillings and a sixpence - I had no more money about me - it was all marked before it was given to me. He put the mark on one of the letters, I think it was I. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220052"/>about eleven o'clock on the 11th, and tapped at the window, because Fidler told me to do so - I did not tap the day before. Mr. Nash came to the door; when I went in I saw Mrs. Nash, as I then understood her to be - they were both in one room - she was sitting rubbing some half-crowns with some stuff; she had some white stuff on her right hand, and some liquid on her left, and was using both; she asked how many half-crowns I wanted; she put her hand under a cloth and pulled out four; the white stuff was thick, like paste. Mr. Nash followed me into the parlour and remained. I saw a candle by her, and she held the half-crowns over it, in the flame, and then put each into a separate paper. I paid her 2 s. 6 d. for three, and put them into a little bag. The officers stood at the door, and took the bag when I went out; they rushed by me just as I came out; one of them asked me of whom I got the half-crowns, I said from the lady, pointing to the female prisoner.</p>

            . I have heard the evidence of the last witness as to the transaction; what she mentioned with respect to myself is true. I had her in sight the whole of the way. Taunton took the bag with the three half-crowns from her, as she came out of the house. When I went into the room the prisoners were standing by the table - I took them, and handcuffed them together. I told the woman to keep away from the table; the right hand was not confined, and she cooked the cup off the table, which contained some white liquor - I found some white powder. There were thirty-three half-crowns and twenty shillings uncoloured. I searched the table drawer, and found five shillings and two sixpences, base money, in a finished state. I saw Taunton search

            , I went to the house of the prisoner, on the 10th of October, in company with Fidler - she went in first. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"How many there are, who get a living in this way;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." The prisoner said she had gone to Croydon-fair, and passed fifteen; I understood her to mean half-crowns; she asked how many I should want - I said three. She went to a table drawer, and brought out a great many half-crowns in a bag. When she gave me the half-crowns, I was about to put them into my pocket, and she said,</p>
               <p>"No, they will rub;" she took them from me, and wrapped them in separate papers, to prevent their rubbing. She asked if I wanted any more; I said</p>
               <p>"To-morrow will be the best buying day, (Saturday)" - she said she always thought that was the best day herself. She asked if I should want larger or smaller. I had received 2 s. 6 d. to purchase them, from Avis; but the silver had not been marked - I had no more money of my own, and gave her the same money I had of Avis. He accompanied me to the spot, and I gave him the money when I came out. I did not see the man (Nash) in this transaction. I had three half-crowns for one good one.</p>

            . I live at No. 21, Nelson-street, City-road, and am a single woman. On the 20th of September I was going home, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening - I had been into Beech-street on business; I had a basket in my hand, which contained a purse, in which were seventeen sixpenny pieces, two half-crowns, and four shillings. I was walking arm-in-arm with Mrs. Marquis; we were going up <placeName id="t18231022-135-crimeloc729">Golden-lane</placeName>

The prisoner snatched the basket out of my hand and ran up the court; we both cried out Stop thief! and ran up the court after him; he suddenly made a stop and let down his apron. I never lost sight of him; he ran sixty yards before he stopped, and was laid hold of. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you done with my money and basket?" He said he was not the person - the person who took it had gone through into Whitecross-street. The watchman came up and laid hold of him - the basket was afterwards found in the alley; the watchman picked it up and brought it to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it a light night - A. It was, both from the moon and gas. I never saw him before - I did not see him drop the basket - I heard it fall, and heard the money rattle; it was thrown on a dunghill. There was no person in the court except a woman, who we ran by. There was nothing in the basket besides the purse of money, a key, and two thimbles. I did not ask the prisoner whether he was the person who took it.</p>

            . I was in company with the prosecutrix on the 20th of September - we were returning home; at the corner of an alley we saw a tall young man, who appeared stooping forward as if looking for some person. He snatched the basket from my friend's hand and ran up the court - I ran up with her, and called</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" He ran to the bottom of the court before he stopped. There was no other man running; I caught him, and laid hold of his apron - It was round him when he snatched the basket, but he let it down afterwards. I am sure the prisoner is the person; I perceived him throw something away, but what it was I could not tell; I did not see it picked up; I saw the basket afterwards; I was before my friend in seizing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He stopped himself. - A. He made a stop as if to cause us to overrun him. When I saw him throw something away, I did not stop to tell Miss Jordan, because I was so confused.</p>

            . This alley is near White's-yard, and in the county of Middlesex. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and ran up the court toward White's-yard. The prisoner stopped when I first saw him. The young women charged him with robbing them of a basket. I found the basket in Basket-alley, and took them to the watch-house. They told me what it contained. I found it afterwards, but not the lid, nor the contents. The prisoner denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he searched - A. The officer searched him. I believe 8 s. 6 d. was found on him, but I do not know in what coin. The young lady said there was seventeen sixpences in the purse. I did not find the key and thimble on him.</p>

I went up to Mrs. Baker's. She said she missed a gown. I then went after the cart, and overtook it near Hollis, the pawnbroker's. The prisoners and the woman were in the cart. A boy came out of the shop, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mother, they won't let me have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220054"/>it, you must come yourself." I told them all to come out of the cart, I went into Hollis's, and found a gown corresponding with the pattern which the prosecutrix gave me. I then took them to the watch-house. The woman asked me what I wanted. The prisoners said nothing.</p>

Owen was on the step of the street-door. Thomas, and the boy, were in the house. I came back into the house, and found them all there. The boy said he would go and buy some corn for the horse. The prisoners went with him. I went to my drawer, and missed a gown, which was safe when they came into the house, as I had had it in my hand. They came back in a quarter of an hour; I charged them with it. The prisoners said they were innocent. The boy said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make a bother, mistress, if your gown is gone, you shall have it again." Owen said he would not have such a thing happen for 5 l. as to be in their company if any thing was stolen. The boy said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make a bother, and I'll go and fetch it, but I have not got the money." The prisoners said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want of money." One gave him 1 s. and the other 6 d. They went out altogether to see where he went for it. The officer came, and I gave him the pattern of it.</p>

The prisoner came and asked me for some beer - I gave her some; she sat down by my hat. I saw her take the handkerchiefs out of it; I endeavonred to get them from her - she struggled, and said she would take care of them, and I should have them, so I went on drinking, and thought no more of them. I went to another house, and she followed me - Davis was in my company; I went up into his room, in Jew's-row, and she followed. I sent for half a gallon of beer, which we drank; they wanted me to send for more beer - I refused. I engaged a bed for myself, and paid 1 s. for it; she offered to stop with me, and put my breeches under the pillow. She got into bed in her clothes. I had a 5 s. piece, and 2 s. 6 d. in my purse. I fell asleep the moment I got into bed, and awoke at eleven o'clock, found her gone, and I missed my purse from my pocket. I found her that night, near Jew's-row, with one handkerchief tied round her head, and the other round her neck. She denied robbing me. I gave charge of her - she then said she had had the money, and would give it up if she was allowed. The watchman found 1 s. 1 d. on her.</p>

               <p>SMITH'S Defence. This man followed us into the public-house - we said we wanted nothing of him, but he would pay for our gin. We left him, and next morning I bought a pair of boots in Newgate-street. Vann asked if I was not in Cherry Tree-court last night; I said, No - I did not know he meant the public-house. The prosecutor offered to make it up for 5 l.</p>

On the 20th of September, our apprentice brought me a letter containing an order for these goods, which I ordered him to get ready for him. While he was looking them out, I questioned the prisoner (who brought the letter;) he said he was servant to a relation of Mrs. Douglas's, and had just come from Mrs. Douglas, of Montague-square, and was going to Highgate. I suspected him, and placed myself opposite the house, to take him as he came out - he turned to the right. I took him, and said he must go to Mrs. Douglas with me first.

I watched the prisoners into the prosecutrix's shop - one of them stepped out a little, while I looked round, to see if any one was looking after him - Beauchamp came to the door, and looked out. I crossed over, and saw the prosecutrix in a tussle with Griffiths, and called Colton; they walked out, and ran into Tottenham Court-road. I secured Griffiths.</p>

I then went home, sent for an officer, and informed him. I looked out all my dram-glasses, and laid them straight, so that I could tell if any were removed; and about half-past seven o'clock I went out, telling Sullivan, to lock up the warehouse as usual, and then go home. I went out before him, and told the officer to watch him. I returned in a few minutes, and found some of the dram glasses gone.

               <p>"If you will get me a cruet of the size of this, I will take them;" he said I might depend on having them. I went home, counted my cruets of the size and pattern I had ordered, and found the drawer contained one hundred and twenty-eight - they were in the upper warehouse - I took care that nobody should go up there that afternoon but Sullivan. I did not go out until seven o'clock, and desired Sullivan not to leave till half-past eight. I happened to return about ten minutes past eight, he had then left. I went up stairs and counted the drawer, and missed six cruets.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday did you and the officers search Glover's house - A. Yes, and found these six cruets there, and all the property stated in the indictments. He was present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who went up stairs after you went out you cannot say - A. No. I marked four or five of the cruets, but they were not taken - they are made to my pattern. I never saw any of this size elsewhere - there are patterns very like it, but not exactly. Sullivan was an industrious boy - I never heard of my children putting things into his basket in a frolic.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What quantity does the cruet contain - A. I never measured it. The one hundred and twenty-eight were all one size - I swear to this by the size, pattern, and quality of the glass, and the cutting.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 9th of October I watched Sullivan from the prosecutor's house. He came out about eight o'clock. I followed him down to the door of Glover's house; he stopped there; turned round quick to look at me. I turned round not to be noticed, and on turning back missed him all in an instant, and went away. I watched him into a public-house in Type-street next night, and on Monday evening went with the prosecutor to Glover's.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you a private mark on it - A. No. Here are thirteen castors; I missed six that night. I should know them find them wherever I would, by the size, quality, glass, and pattern. They were made for me by Johnson and Co., of Birmingham, who are in a large way. It is customary not to make goods of one pattern for two houses; if they did my custom would leave them immediately. I have sold none of them. They came in about six weeks ago. I received one hundred and forty-four. I do not know what became of the rest.</p>
               <p>SULLIVAN'S Defence. I took eighteen of them to Wolf, a glass dealer, by the London Hospital, a week before I was taken.</p>
               <p>GLOVER put in a written Defence, denying all knowledge of Sullivan; that he had shewn the goods to the prosecutor publicly, and every thing was exposed openly for sale; that it was strange any house should manufacture for the prosecutor exclusively; that he sometimes bought at a wholesale house, and sometimes of hawkers, and when goods are put together could not tell one from another.</p>
               <p>JURY to SOLOMAN. Q. Had Sullivan an opportunity of seeing Glover after you gave him an order for the cruets - Yes; he went to dinner, and went out after that into Glover's neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>QUESTION to SHIRLEY. Is there any passage near Glover's where the boy might have gone down - There is a turning six or eight yards from the house, but he had passed it and got close to the door when I missed him.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 19th of May I went out with a sofa on speculation. It was towards the evening of the day; I called at Mr. Lawrence's, No. 258, Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner carried the sofa and I walked by his side; he said he would carry it no further; I begged permission of Mrs. Lawrence to let it remain in her warehouse till the following week, which she granted. When I called for it they told me it was gone. The prisoner had no permission to call for it.</p>

            . My daughter lives at No. 258, Tottenham Court-road. I remember Mrs. Farrell leaving a sofa at the house on Saturday evening. It was fetched away on the next Monday by the prisoner, who brought it there. I was present when he took it away.

               <p>"Yes, it has a honeysuckle back;" I pointed it out. My daughter keeps an upholsterer's shop. I sent the boy up stairs to see if my daughter would give any more; she said she would not, and he took it away. I saw Mrs. Farrell on the following Wednesday.</p>

The prisoner slept in a room adjoining - there were six of us slept in the same room. I missed the sovereign on the next morning. I hung the trowsers over my head. I went to bed about ten o'clock, and got up at eight next morning; the prisoner had got new clothes on next morning; he came to my bed, and said he would pull the blanket round me, to keep me warm, and then went to his room; he did not take it at that time - he was taken up on the same day.

I was passing by the prosecutor's shop on the 15th of October, and saw a woman standing at the door looking at some handkerchiefs. I passed the shop ten or twelve yards; then turned round, and saw the prisoner put her hand in between the handkerchiefs and the door, and draw out a piece of dark cotton; she then came up to me, and I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got in your apron?" She paused a bit, and then said it was some of her children's clothes. I then took her back to the shop. The prosecutor turned the cotton out of her apron.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody; he had then got thirty yards from where the man lay - he was behind the dray when I laid hold of him. Both the drays had stopped; he said the second dray was his. I went and measured the ground - it was thirteen feet wide - the width of the dray was about seven feet. If the driver had been there the accident would not have happened.</p>

            . I live in Catherine-street, Limehouse, and am a cheesemonger. In consequence of something I had heard, I was watching the prisoners, who were with two other boys. Long went into the shop and stood about two minutes; he then came out and spoke to the other three boys outside; he then went in again, and Oliver followed him - Oliver turned round and took the copper kettle off the book, and came out, and Long followed him. The instant Oliver came out I seized him with it, and afterwards took Long. The other two ran away.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, White-hart-row, Battle-bridge: I am a constable. On Sunday, September 28, about nine o'clock in the evening, I observed the prisoner come, with two more, and run from the corner of <placeName id="t18231022-160-crimeloc859">Dean-street, Oxford-street</placeName>

I spoke to the gentleman, and they crossed over to another person. I watched them carefully down Oxford-street, towards St. Giles's. I saw the prisoner stoop forward, and whip the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, and put his hand under his coat. They were all three together, and all ran away. I pointed out the prisoner to Reardon. I went over to the gentleman and stopped him, and told him what had happened. He said he would come forward, but the lady with him would not allow him. I do not know his name. I pressed him hard for it. I afterwards saw a parcel of people running, and went up and found the prisoner struggling with Reardon, near Soho-square. The handkerchief has not been found.</p>

            . I live in Grenville-street, Somers-town, and am a mason. Sometimes I work for Mr. Smith, and sometimes for myself. I am acquainted with Colton. I was with him on the 28th of September, in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner there with two other men, in company together. I watched them half an hour. I saw Ash go up to a gentleman with two others, and the prisoner took a handkerchief from his pocket. They were going down the street, towards St. Giles's. I saw the prisoner rush down the street, and attempt to strike a gentleman. I saw him and the two others cross the way. I crossed near Dean-street. When Ash flew up to the gentleman, (who had a lady with him,) the other two were behind him. Directly I saw him take the handkerchief out, I crossed the street. There is a short street near Grafton-street. The prisoner ran round the coach-stand, and I after him. One of the coachmen struck me with the whip; the other two ran away. I thought Colton would pursue them. There was a gentleman who was present when we stopped, but he is not here. The prisoner was so violent I was forced to get him into a door-way to hold him; he kicked his shoes off in the struggle. I saw him fling the handkerchief between the wheels of a coach. I went afterwards to the stand, and the coaches were gone. There were only the watermen left. I do not know the other two men that were with the prisoner. I have worked very lately at my business as a plasterer; I worked at the Foreman's house about a month ago; I have sometimes jobs every day in Somers'-town. I have not been in constant work, but do jobs when I get them.</p>
