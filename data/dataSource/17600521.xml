               <p>Q. What is your imployment?</p>
               <p>Brown. I keep a public house, I had company, there were 3 Ladies which drank tea; I gave the prisoner 3 tea spoons and tongs for their use, about 6 in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you?</p>
               <p>Brown. About 7 or 8 days; after they had drank tea, I look'd in her face, and thought she look'd a little stupid in liquor, I order'd her to wash the spoons up, and put them into their proper place where they always are; this was near 8 o'clock; in about half an hour she took her bundles, and slipp'd off with the spoons in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Brown. There was a painter there that told me. as soon as we miss'd her, that he saw her put the spoons in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here?</p>
               <p>Brown. No; he was a stranger to me. About 5 weeks afterwards, as I was going through St. Giles's, I saw her come out of a house; she seeing me, ran away, and through a house, and into another; I pursued and took her, and carried her before justice Fielding. She begg'd I would not take her there; and said, she would tell me where my things were: she own'd she had pawn'd them at the corner of Russel court, Drury Lane, at the house of one Rochford. I lost 3 spoons, but she own'd but to 2, and the tongs. Mr. Fielding sent for the pawnbroker, and his servant that took them in came; and she own'd she pawn'd them to him. (produced in court, and deposed too.) They have the same marks which they had when I bought them.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not; I thought her to be a little in liquor then, for the time she was there I owe her about 15 d. it cannot be above that, but I will give her half a crown (which he did) telling her he was sorry for her; recommending her to the court for mercy.</p>

I said, now the watch has gone 2, they will soon come if they come at all again. I saw a weight against the door, and the lock lay on the ground, the staple had been forced. Presently I heard my brother's voice; we both went up; and I heard my brother say, you smell strong of tobacco; then I said hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210006"/> Anderson; they came with us very quietly as far as the warehouses. I said to Groves and Simpson, do you stay and watch here, we will go to the warehouse. When we came to the corner of White Lion street, Holmes made a resistance; I had a sword in my hand, and Cordwell another; we swore we would cut him down if he would not go quietly; he held my sword in his hand, I was afraid of mischief, and drew it threw his hand, and cut it; he was put in the cage, after that I was told he was a milkman, and lived in Church yard Alley. We went to his door, there I found some tobacco, and in his cellar we found the tobacco laid in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you judge it had lately been brought in, or had it lain there some time?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. I judg'd it had been just brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you distinguish that?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. When a hogshead of tobacco is just broke open, it is warm in the inside, and smells a great deal fresher (and so did this)</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. At the latter end of his examination he own'd to the fact; he own'd they were all concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. What was laid to their charge?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. Breaking the Warehouse open, and stealing the tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. Who charg'd them?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. My Brother and I; Holmes was examin'd first, he told us in what manner it was done; then Anderson said it was done with a pick-ax; that there were four of them, some shoved, and some pull'd the folding doors apart, and that he crept in between them, and the use of the pick-ax was to wrench the lock off, I think he own'd he broke the lock off, and let the other 3 in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no lock at all on the door, if I was to die this moment.</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. The prisoner own'd, that Holmes stood at the door with a cutlass in his hand, and that he did carry some of the tobacco off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I disown it, I did not carry a morsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say where he dispos'd of it?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. I believe he was not ask'd that (as we had been and found it in the cellar)</p>

            . I am servant to Messrs. Sambrook. About 1 in the morning I heard a Disturbance.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you?</p>
               <p>Simpson. I was in my room in the warehouse, where I lie.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose have you a room there?</p>
               <p>Simpson. To take care and see that nothing of this kind happens.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see or hear?</p>
               <p>Simpson. I heard a noise, I got up, and found the door put to, and a half hundred weight put against it. I went and told my master; he sent me for other assistance: we met my master and his brother, and the watchmen came with their lanthorns; we went in, and found a whole hogshead broke to pieces, and the tobacco gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the Justice of the peace?</p>
               <p>Simpson. I was; there I heard the prisoner at the bar say, the others held the folding doors open and he went in between, and with a pick-ax wrench'd the lock off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You do not say right, there was no lock there.</p>
               <p>Simpson. There was a lock there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the tobacco is bought?</p>
               <p>Simpson. The buyer goes first to the merchant, and if he likes the sample then he buys it there, and after that, they compare them with the hogshead when it is weighed.</p>

             and Anderson said, they wanted me to go with them to get some tobacco there; we went to a pair of doors like barn doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do they belong to?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I did not know then, but I do now, it is the warehouse that belongs to the prosecutors, as they say; one shov'd one door, and others pull'd the other at the bottom, and the prisoner got in between, he had a pick-ax in his hand, and when he was within the inside he open'd the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he open it?</p>
               <p>Holmes. He made a noise, but I being on the outside could not see how he did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a light?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No, none at all; we all went in and opened a hogshead of tobacco, and took it all out, and part of another.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turns did you make?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I cannot justly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry it all at 2 or 3 turns?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210007"/>Holmes. We did not carry it all at 2 or 3 either.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you begin to carry it away?</p>
               <p>Holmes. As near as I can guess between 12 and one, or about 12, but I did not go with them till the last turn, then I did, and carry'd 2 or 3 leaves in my hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He carried about 4 pounds, he went along with them as a guard, and carry'd none till the last, then he carry'd some.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry it to?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We carry'd it into my cellar in Church-yard Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, what became of you all?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We all separated, Anderson and I kept together, we went back to Chamber-street, with a design to put the doors together, that it should not be soon discover'd by the watch; and as we were going towards the place, I saw 2 or 3 men on the outside. I said, who is there? they came up to me. One of them laid hold of the prisoner, and I walk'd on; they did not lay hold of me till we got to where the other 2 men staid to watch. The prisoner ask'd what they wanted with him? they said, you smell of tobacco, and they wou'd tell him by and by; then they took us to the watchhouse, and after that before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the warehouse declare what you have now, and to whom?</p>
               <p>Holmes. When I was carry'd before the justice, I was charg'd with being an accomplice in taking this tobacco; and then I declar'd what I have now said, and what I know'd, and

               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was there any lock upon the door, or not?</p>
               <p>Holmes. How could I tell that, as I was in the street.</p>

               <p>Graham. I can't tell the day of the week, nor month neither. The prosecutor came, and he claimed more boards than were his own; and that ladder that I shaved, I had it from about a week or fortnight after Easter.</p>

               <p>Graham. I compute it at about 11 shillings, he brought them all at one time, and I made no scruple but they were his own property; he ask'd me if I wou'd buy such things, saying, they were his own, he had been in business for himself, but was reduc'd.</p>

               <p>E. Gardner. In the dining-room, I was sick at the time I lost them, is the reason I did not miss them sooner. I miss'd them as soon as I got up again; I had been ill about 3 weeks.</p>

When I miss'd the things, I ask'd Elizabeth Hall for them; she made me for answer they were not at home: I ask'd where they were? she told me, she would go and see to get them. I ask'd her if she had pawn'd them; as I was informed she owed some money, and if she had I would go and get them out again. She said she had not, but had given them to the other prisoner for her use, with this intention, that she should bring them back again, she being to receive 10 l. in about a fortnight. When Grant came again to my house, I ask'd her what she had done with the things. She said, she had pawn'd them, and would soon bring them again, to one Mr. Hull, where I went and found the sack, petticoat, a napkin, a shirt, and handkerchief (produced in court, and depos'd too) I found also another napkin, my property, at one Mr. Hudson's.

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Have you a husband?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No; I was a widow then, but the coat and waistcoat are my son's, which I bought for him; he was an apprentice, and I found him all his cloaths.</p>

               <p>A. Thompson. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never desire her to swear against the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never a quarrel with the prisoner about cutting out a pocket?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. No; I never had any quarrel with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason, that at this great distance of time, from the 6th of march was twelvemonths, to the 9th of this instant, that you never went to acquaint Mrs. Thornhill with what you knew?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. I dare not, there is such a gang of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to do it now?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. Because she wanted to bring me into a robbery, and I would not do it; she wanted to bring me into a worse than this.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took her up?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not present when she was taken up?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never consult any body, or acquaint any body with this affair, before you told Mrs. Thornhill of it?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. Yes, I told one Buckling, at the Queen's-head in Harrow alley, White Chappel.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to it?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. He said, go and tell the truth to the poor woman that has lost her things.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that?</p>

               <p>Q. How came you in goal?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. I was committed by Mr. Fielding as an evidence in this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Buckling say to you there would be a reward?</p>
               <p>A. Thompson. No, he did not; he gave me the best advice he cou'd to go to the poor woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this that you told Mr. Buckling that you told Mrs. Thornhill?</p>

I am a Surveyor, I know nothing of the robbery, nor ever saw that creature (meaning the last evidence) in all the world to my knowledge: Mrs. Thornhill told me of the robbery, and show'd me the place where her house was broke; it was a sash that slides by another, they had broke the glass to put a hand in, so as to unscrew it, that it might slide back.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. How was your house broke?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The kitchen window a glass was broke, as Mr. Stevens has mentioned, and the cross bar was taken quite away, and room for any body to get in.</p>
               <p>Stevens. I lived next door but one to Mrs. Thornhill for 17 years; I was going that way some time after, and she was crying and telling me how she had been robb'd; she show'd me also how her trunks were broke open, by cutting the leather which was over the hasps, and wrenching the hasps off. I know that neighbourhood to be a notorious bad place; I was robb'd there once just by my own door, and afterwards some of them threatned to shoot me *; and I was forc'd to remove out of the neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>Mr Miller. I live within a few doors of Mrs. Thornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the evidence Thompson?</p>
               <p>Miller. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her character?</p>
               <p>Miller. She has but a very indifferent character, she is a disorderly girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe she is to be credited upon her oath?</p>
               <p>Miller. I think she is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any dealings with her?</p>
               <p>Miller. I have dealt with both the prisoner and she.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Miller. I am a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Miller. I live in Mansell-street, Goodman's Fields, next door to the Fleece.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Miller. She lives with a young man a butcher; she has been a customer to me 6 or 7 years; I never heard of any robberies by her before this, I have heard of some little trifling things.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did the prisoner ever pledge any of these goods mention'd in the indictment with you?</p>
               <p>Miller. No; neither she, nor any body else that she sent.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a warrant granted upon Thompson's information to search your house for these goods?</p>
               <p>Miller. Yes; and the constable examin'd my book.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the things taken from?</p>
               <p>S. Ingham. They were taken from a 2 pair of stairs fore-room.</p>

               <p>S. Ingham. She was taken in the street, after having been stealing in another house, and she had one of my gowns and my cardinal on her back, at the time she was taken before justice Fielding, and I went there, and told his worship I had lost 3 more gowns; he ask'd her where we lodged. She told him, he sent a constable, and I went with him to search, and there I found my other 3 gowns in a drawer, (produced in court, and deposed too) she takes up a silk and stuff gown, this she had on her back when taken and this cardinal, producing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how they were taken away?</p>

As I was setting in my watch-box, I heard an uncommon noise of thrusting through a passage, it was my business to examine what it was; I went out, he saw me with my lanthorn, he makes a double, and went down the street with the bundle on his back, opposite to my lord Hyde's door, duke-street; I had the advantage with my lanthorn, and 2 lights that were there, which gave me a full sight of him; I saw him plain, and described him plain to the men after the prisoner got away; for he throw'd down the bundle, and run away, and I went and took him in his master's yard, and deliver'd up the bundle in Mr. Stubbs's yard; we carried him into the taphouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you take him?</p>

               <p>Hall. If any body goes out of my house, they can't get in without somebody within let them in; when you go out the door follows you, and shuts and locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any going out that night?</p>
               <p>Hall. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suspect the prisoner was out of your house that night?</p>
               <p>Hall. No; I have not the least in the world; sometimes he drives a jobb, and comes home late, and I get out of my bed to let him in, if after 11 o'clock, at that time I always shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. What character does the prisoner bare?</p>
               <p>Hall. No body bears a better character; he knows where I put my money as well as I do myself, if he had been minded to take from me, I might have lost a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cottis. What is the prisoner's general character?</p>
               <p>Cottis. He bares a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Whitehouse. What character does the prisoner bare?</p>
               <p>Whitehouse. A very good one, he is an honest industrious man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howel. I have known the prisoner about 2 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>How. He is a very sober, careful, industrious man, and a very honest man as far as ever I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Howel. I live in Rider's-street, St. James's.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I have known him between 5 and 6 years, I had of him some securities deposited with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he them?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I do not know that, the prisoner was an indorser, but I do not know which way Mr. Higgs had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the last indorser?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I do not know whether he was or not, there were 3 bills, they were for 453 l. 1 s. 2 of them were upon Mr. Tittley, and I think one upon Mr. Lawson.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I sign'd them over to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the drawers of these bills?</p>
               <p>Fogg. Upon my oath I do not know who the drawer of any was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any application made you by the prisoner at the bar, concerning any sum of money?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210018"/>Fogg. On the 28th of November, 1758, the prisoner call'd upon me, and made application to take these bills out of my hands, me giving him some more money, and signing him over a policy of assurance on a Ship call'd the Snow Venus; he wanted more money than I was willing to give, I believe he wanted 200 l. more than what I did agree for at last; the last agreement was this, we met on the 29th in the morning, and I agreed with him to give him 104 l. 19 s. in cash, and I to stop 42 l. to make a reinsurance for 2 of the bills that were stopp'd payment, Mr. Tittley's was one, so I stopp'd 42 l. out of the 600, in order to get the policy fill'd up, that makes the 600 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose money was this that you was so to negotiate?</p>
               <p>Fogg. It was for Mr. Higgs; I gave Mr. Higgs a memorandum for 600 l. for an accountable acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was this 600 l. to be secured?</p>
               <p>Fogg. By a policy of Insurance, and a joint bond between him and Mr. Lawson for 600 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you would have advanced this money on the account of Mr. Higgs, unless you had the joint bond of Willson and Lawson?</p>
               <p>Fogg. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this agreement made?</p>
               <p>Fogg. On the 29th of November, 1758, about 9 in the morning, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the prisoner to any notary or scrivner?</p>

               <p>Fogg. Yes, to Mr. Hewit, in Birchin-lane, a notary public.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those things shown to him?</p>
               <p>Fogg. They were, Mr. Hewit prepared the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner go to Mr. Hewit?</p>
               <p>Fogg. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the directions given to fill up the bond?</p>
               <p>Fogg. It was to fill up the joint bond by Willson and Lawson to me for 600 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave directions for that?</p>
               <p>Fogg. We were both together, the prisoner and I; whether he or I ordered it I cannot tell, but I dare say we were both there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bond prepared?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I did, Mr. Wilson took it out and said, he could see Mr. Lawson, but we could not so conveniently see him, or to that purpose; he went away with it, and in about 3 quarters of an hour return'd (it could not be an hour) he brought it with the name Lawson sign'd to it.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then you did not go with him to see it sign'd by Lawson?</p>
               <p>Fogg. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this bond. (He takes it in his hand)</p>
               <p>Fogg. This is it; I think he brought it back sign'd with both names.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Betham in the room at Mr. Hewit's when the bond was drawn?</p>
               <p>Fogg. No, I never saw him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner return with this bond in the form it now appears, that is, executed and witnessed?</p>
               <p>Fogg. He did, to Mr. Hewit's office, it was witnessed by

               <p>Q. Who did he deliver it to?</p>
               <p>Fogg. He deliver'd it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand writing is on the back of it?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when he delivered it to you?</p>
               <p>Fogg. Mr. Higgs was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this?</p>
               <p>Fogg. Upon this I gave up the bills of exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the money ever been paid upon this bond?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I have received the money, but not of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you receive the money of?</p>
               <p>Fogg. Of Mr. Staples and Mr. Winterbottom, assignees to Lawson's estate.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have advanced this sum of 104 l. 19 s. without the security of this bond?</p>
               <p>Fogg. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were those bills deposited with you by?</p>
               <p>Fogg. They were deposited with me by Mr. Higgs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any property in the bills?</p>
               <p>Fogg. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasions were they deposited with you?</p>
               <p>Fogg. He desired me to do it for him, to apply to Mr. Willson to get what security upon them I could, as they were a little dubious; Mr. Willson had applyed to me before Mr. Higgs did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210019"/>Q. Are you sure they were indorsed by the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I am sure they were.</p>
               <p>Q. What interest had Mr. Lawson in those bills; by what you say it appears he was acceptor of one of them, but which I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Fogg. I think I saw his name on the back of one or both of the other, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the jury how Mr. Lawson was concerned in the fate of the 3 bills.</p>
               <p>Fogg. Any bills that come in the course of business I copy, but those I never did copy, those were put into my hand by Mr. Higgs on the 28th, but I never thought them worth putting into my book, it being so soon done.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that the name of Lawson was upon any of the bills?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I really think it was connected with 2 of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any application made to you on the 28th by the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I think there was that same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Be particular as to that.</p>
               <p>Fogg. He came and offered me the policy of insurance, and the things belonging to the ship, for the consideration of more money than what we did agree to at last.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Mr. Willson did not apply to you, and tell you, that the persons that were liable to pay these bills could not pay them, and the efore made some farther application to you?</p>
               <p>Fogg. He offered me the policy of assurance, and wanted more money.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he did not tell you he was afraid the bills would not be duly honoured?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I believe he might, he made me some proposal.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that proposal?</p>
               <p>Fogg. It was to have about 300 l. in cash, and to have those bills taken out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. We are now upon the 28th of November I have nothing to say on the 29th now; what proposal from Mr. Willson on the 28th?</p>
               <p>Fogg. We agreed. our first meeting was on the 27th at night, or the 28th at the Baptist head tavern, Milk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he and you along at the first meeting?</p>
               <p>Fogg. At the first meeting I think there were some people along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first proposal to you the first time you met?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I can't recollect the first proposal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any thing to you of a ship, the policy of Insurance?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I believe he did, the policy of Insurance, a bill of sale, and charter party.</p>
               <p>Q Who was present at the first proposal?</p>
               <p>Fogg. To the best of my knowledge there were 3 or 4, but not when we talk'd about business, for I look upon it that they were in another box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Lawson there?</p>
               <p>Fogg. There was a gentleman, that some gentlemen call'd Mr. Lawson.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sum mentioned?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I cannot say the sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for a thousand pounds?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I don't think it was more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it more than 600 l.</p>
               <p>Fogg. I know it was more by several hundreds than what I agreed for.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the security?</p>
               <p>Fogg. It was upon the assignment of the policy.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Mr. Higgs before the 28th.</p>
               <p>Fogg. I think I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the principle party?</p>
               <p>Fogg. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this matter had been transacted on that night, should you, or should you not, have been satisfied with the policy?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I should have been satisfied with it, but we had not agreed upon this bond, till we went to Mr. Hewit's office; Mr. Higgs and I met again the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Lawson besides that time you mention?</p>
               <p>Fogg. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the value of this ship?</p>
               <p>Fogg. Indeed I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she insured for?</p>
               <p>Fogg. She was insured for 13 hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Willson on the 28th?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I dare say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I do not recollect where I saw him in the morning, it was before we went to Mr. Hewit's office, we were at a coffee house in Swithin's alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the matter had been transacted the next morning, should you have had any difficulty about it?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I don't know that I should.</p>
               <p>Q You say a person that met on this occasion was name Lawson, and you don't know Mr. Lawson.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210020"/>Fogg. No; I did not know whether he was a good or a bad man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon him to be concerned in that ship?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I did, but I am a very little judge in the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that Mr. Lawson made an assignment to Mr. Willson of this ship?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that assignment?</p>
               <p>Fogg. That was an assignment by Willson to me.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you rely upon a bond given to you by a stranger?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I did not much rely upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether before you went to Mr. Hewit's you in your mind formed any security, by a stranger giving a bond to you?</p>
               <p>Fogg. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What first induc'd you to take this bond?</p>
               <p>Fogg. It was by Hewit's advice; he said, he thought the assignment was not sufficient without the rest, and at the same time he advised me to take a joint bond of the men, by way of collateral security; this was on the 29th.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing mentioned by Mr. Hewit, that there was a receipt in the body of it?</p>
               <p>Fogg. He told me he believed it was not safe without it; he said, without the receipt on the outside it was not good.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Mr. Lawson's having been absent upon the 28th?</p>
               <p>Fogg. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire what Mr. Lawson was?</p>
               <p>Fogg. No, I did not; I gave myself little trouble, but kept the securities I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to think Mr. Willson came to you upon any unfair principle?</p>
               <p>Fogg. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon whom did you pin your faith?</p>
               <p>Fogg. Mr. Hewit advised me, and told me it would be much best to have the two; then I would not do it without.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this fact had happened, that no bond had been entered into at all, should you, or should you not, have thought this was a good security for 600 l.</p>
               <p>Fogg. I might have thought it good.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you at that time, if the bond had never been mentioned?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I should.</p>
               <p>Q. He is indicted for a forgery with intent to defraud; do you think, considering the nature of the security put into your hands, he did it with intent to defraud you?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I would be as tender as possible; I have had various opinions upon that.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then there I'll leave it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. Then on the 27th of November at the Babtist head, it was agreed upon to advance a larger sum?</p>
               <p>Fogg. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you intend to transact this on your own judgement, or to take the assistance of Mr. Hewit?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I should not have transacted it on my own opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. If Willson had not produced the bond, should you have advanced 104 l. 19 s.</p>
               <p>Fogg. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you apprehended Mr. Willson intended to deceive you in the nature of your security?</p>
               <p>Fogg. Then I thought it to be good.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what is your opinion, would you have advanced the money if you had known the name

               <p>Fogg. He was my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not recommend it at Hamlin's coffee house to go to some notary, but mentioned none in particular?</p>
               <p>Fogg. I think I mentioned Mr. Hewit.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this name (meaning the name of the witness) do you think it to have been done with any disguise?</p>
               <p>Fogg. This is the name of Betham.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the ship?</p>
               <p>Fogg. The ship was taken by the French, and ransomed.</p>

He said, you have got some bills in your possession, and if you can muster up 800 or a thousand pounds, I'll take them bills out of your hands; he did mention Tittley's being bad at that time, I believe, he left it with me to show to my friend; I was very intimate with Mr.

            , and I apply'd to him, he was not in the way; he look'd at the under-writers, he did not know many of them; and afterwards I apply'd to some more friends; then I had heard more of Mr. Willson than before; I thought it wou'd be a little troublesome, so I thought to put it out of my hands, and Mr. Fogg being an acquaintance I told him the case, that I had such bills in my hands, which I was afraid would be attended with some trouble, so I made free with him, as he had more time upon his hands than I had, and put them into his hands to get it done as cheap as he could, not to give him so much as he wanted, 800 or 1000 l. and take the bills out of my hands; we said, we thought 4 or 500 was enough, and at last we agreed for 600 l.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that agreement?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I believe the thing was brought to me 2 or 3 days before christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present?</p>
               <p>Higgs. Mr. Fogg, and I believe Mr. Betham were; the security proposed to us were those things; we apply'd to Mr. Hewit about it, and he looking over the papers, he had made some of the writings to that ship, and he put it in our heads to have a bond betwixt Lawson and him, besides the policy, with all the writings belonging to the ship; I had made over the bills to Mr. Fogg, and had Mr. Fogg's memorandum for them; I gave him 2 draughts, 1 for 76 l. the other made it amount to 140 l. 19 s. then I deliverd up the 3 bills; Mr. Willson, Mr. Fogg and I were in Mr. Hewit's office on the 29th of November, 1758, at the time Mr. Hewit was filling of it up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Higgs. It was I believe about 9 or 10 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with that bond?</p>
               <p>Higgs. Mr. Willson took it out of Mr. Hewit's office, and said he would get it sign'd by Lawson; he brought it back in about 3 quarters of an hour, sign'd by Lawson, and witnessed by Betham's; when he brought it back he said, he had got it done, and there was 104 l. 19 s. paid in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part with your money upon that security?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you first apply to Mr. Willson?</p>
               <p>H iggs. No, Sir, Mr. Willson first apply'd to me, I gave him an account, the 2 notes upon Tittley were doubtful notes, one was due before the other; then we heard Tittley was stopp'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Willson tell you 2 notes of the 3 were doubtful?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I believe he might say the 2 on Tittley were.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose was the other note?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210023"/>Higgs. One was draw upon Lawson, and accepted by Lawson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lawson's name on either of Tittley's notes?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I really cannot recollect that it was?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come and take them up for himself, or for Lawson?</p>
               <p>Higgs. For himself; I never saw Lawson, nor spoke to him,</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of them indorsed by Lawson?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I cannot say that any of them were?</p>
               <p>Q. Should not you have look'd upon this ship as a sufficient security for your money?</p>
               <p>Higgs. He said, go and ask any body about it; I went to a neighbour, and he told me he would not give 50 l. for it; after that I went to Mr. Touchit; the under-writers said they thought it was good.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you the papers in your custody to make inquiry about them?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I believe about 3 days.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the first person that mentioned the bond?</p>
               <p>Higgs. Mr. Hewit was; Mr. Fogg was recommended to Mr. Hewit by one Mr. Steward, in Paternoster-row; Mr. Willson went with us to Mr. Hewit's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Betham with you before that?</p>
               <p>Higgs. He was with us once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I am told he was Mr. Lawson's clerk; I met Betham and Willson at the warehouse in Lad-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was not Mr. Willson's own proposal, that 42 l. to make good the assurance of the policy?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I believe Mr. Hewit mentioned it, to have it kept in Mr. Fogg's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether if Mr. Hewit had not started that of the bond, you should not have thought the assignment a sufficient security?</p>
               <p>Higgs. As Mr. Tittley's notes were deemed dubious, we were willing to make it as safe as we could.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mr. Lawson had been there, whether you would have taken his bond as any security at all?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I believe I should, because he was then deemed a good man; I had inquired after him, and found he lived in good reputation; I believe we should have taken his bond, but I should have made a little more inquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known Mr. Willson before this?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I had known him about 6 or 9 months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you think Mr. Willson had any intention to defraud you when he brought you his assignment first?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I really can't take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon your oath, whether, when he brought you his assignment you had any notion he had an intention to defraud you, or whether you do now think he had such intention?</p>
               <p>Higgs. Now I do, but I did not then.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you think he had any intention to defraud you before the bond was started?</p>
               <p>Higgs. No, I do not think he intended to defraud me then.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hewit. I have known him 5 or 6 years,</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Lawson?</p>
               <p>Hewit. I have known him several years, I have known them both in good credit.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this bond, whose writing is the body of it (he takes it in his hand)</p>
               <p>Hewit. I fill'd it up.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Hewit. On the 29th of November 1758, in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Hewit. In my own office.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present?</p>
               <p>Hewit. Mr. Willson the prisoner, Mr. Higgs, and Mr. Fogg.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose order did you fill it up?</p>

               <p>Hewit. I mentioned it as a necessary security, and that the money could not be lent without that as a collateral security.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lawson there?</p>
               <p>Hewit. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen Lawson before the 28th of November.</p>
               <p>Hewit. I believe I saw him about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to be a man of good credit at the time of your filling up this bond?</p>
               <p>Hewit. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lawson join'd with Willson to make the bond go down the better?</p>
               <p>Hewit. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210024"/>Q. What became of the bond after you had filled it up on the 29th.</p>
               <p>Hewit. Willson took it away; he said, he would take it to Mr. Lawson and get it sign'd by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body offer to go with Willson, or were there any talk about who was to be the subscribing witness.</p>
               <p>Hewit. No; he went along, and returned in about 3 quarters of an hour or less, and brought it back with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring it back in the condition in which it now appears?</p>
               <p>Hewit. Yes, he did; it appear'd to have been executed by Lawson and Willson, attested by Betham.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Lawson's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Hewit. I do not know it so well as to sware to it, I took it to be his hand writing at that time, but I cannot say whose hand writing it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when Lawson went out of Town?</p>
               <p>Hewit. No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any thing of Mr. Lawson within a day or a before this bond was proposed?</p>
               <p>Hewit. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any notes of his?</p>
               <p>Hewit. I have drawn charter parties for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he write such a hand as this?</p>
               <p>Hewit. I can't swear particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this Betham?</p>
               <p>Hewit. He was Mr. Lawson's clerk; I have seen him several times at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had carried a bill to Mr. Lawson's for acceptance, if Mr. Betham had accepted it, should you have had any objection to that?</p>
               <p>Hewit. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you understood that Mr. Betham had that general power of signing for Lawson's name?</p>
               <p>Hewit. I know nothing of that; but I never heard that it was a custom in the city of London, for a merchant's clerk to sign a bond for his master, no, never.</p>

            . In the year 1758, I was clerk to Mr. Lawson.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been clerk to him before he was a bankrupt?</p>
               <p>Betham. About 15 months.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the commission taken out against him?</p>
               <p>Betham. It was taken out about the 11th or 12th of December, 1758.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Willson?</p>
               <p>Betham. I do very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Betham. About 3 quarters of a year before Mr. Lawson was a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this Bond; do you remember at any time any transaction of setting a name to it, and how it happen'd?</p>
               <p>Betham. Mr. Lawson having frequent occasion to raise money upon bills, he had a greater demand than he could raise himself, he apply'd to the prisoner to get him a great many bills discounted, which he did to a considerable value; the holders of bills and drawers both becoming insolvent, they apply'd to Mr. Willson to make good those bills, as being an indorser on them; Mr. Lawson told him his affairs were become bad, and he could not possibly raise money to take up those bills, but he would make him assignments, that he should not be hurt, if he would raise him money upon bills; accordingly he made him an assignment, which I think was executed on the 20th of November 1758, of several debts, amongst which was a policy of assignment and charter party of a ship which Mr. Lawson had at sea; this Mr. Willson proposed to sign over to Mr. Fogg and Mr. Higgs, for what they had against him in bills; I was by at the time, it was at a coffee-house in Milk-street on the 27th of November; I don't know whether they came to a revolution or not; the day after they came to an agreement to raise 200 l. to make up the 600 l. but before it was executed, they insisted upon having a joint bond from Willson and Lawson to strengthen the security.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know what was done, was you there at that time?</p>
               <p>Betham. Mr. Willson told me this, I was not present; this was the 29th of November; he told me he had agreed to give them a joint bond; he brought it in the forenoon to me fill'd up to Mr. Lawson's Compting-house (I think) and said, he must have it executed by Mr. Lawson and himself, or else he could not pacify those people, they would not take the security, that was the policy of insurance and charter party, without the bond: he proposed to me, for me to sign the name Lawson upon it; I objected to it, and said, I fear'd it might be attended with bad consequences to myself; and not being acquainted with the nature<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210025"/> of those things, I did not chuse to do it; he said, he had no intent to injure any body by it, and what he meant was to lodge it with other security as a collateral security to pacify those gentlemen, that they should not arrest him for the money; that he in a little time should be able to raise money, and take up the security out of their hands; and I might depend upon it, I should come to no harm by it; by which means he persuaded me to sign the name

             to it; I did it in the presence of the prisoner, at his desire and request, but to the best of my knowledge I did not so much as read the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a seal on it?</p>
               <p>Betham. I cannot tell whether there was or not, I put my own name to it as a witness, but that was at Willson's request.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hewit. Did you put the seals to it?</p>
               <p>Hewit. I did before I delivered it.</p>
               <p>Betham. Mr. Willson took it from me, and I never saw it afterwards, till at Guild-hall in the hands of the prosecutor; Mr. Willson sign'd his name in my presence, after I had sign'd the name Lawson.</p>

               <p>Betham. I believe he was at Harwich then, he was gone out of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it executed on the day it bears date?</p>
               <p>Betham. To the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Lawson go out of Town?</p>
               <p>Betham. It was either the 27th or 28th of November that I went either to the Bull or Boar inn White Chapel, when he went out of Town, I carried his trunk there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he going?</p>
               <p>Betham. He told me he intended to go to Holland; he spoke for a post-chaise to be ready for him at such an hour, he went in secrecy in the dusk of the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he return?</p>
               <p>Betham. I was in the country when he return'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he did go to Holland?</p>
               <p>Betham. After he was there I receiv'd letters from him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this bond was executed did he return?</p>
               <p>Betham. He did not return for many months after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time of Mr. Willson's bringing the bond to you and his taking it away on the 29th?</p>
               <p>Betham, It was not 5 minutes, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. About what hour of the day?</p>
               <p>Betham. It might be about 9 o'clock in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Willson do any business with Mr. Lawson?</p>
               <p>Betham. No; but sometimes discounted him some bills, no other business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with Mr. Willson when Mr. Lawson took his leave of him?</p>
               <p>Betham. I was; his affairs were so bad he was going abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not leave Mr. Willson a power to transact business for him, and leave orders with you to sign his name to things that Mr. Willson should think necessary?</p>
               <p>Betham. No; after this assignment was made to Mr. Willson it was agreed upon, that I, as clerk to Mr. Lawson, was to have a power of attorney to transact business between Mr. Lawson and him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lawson say, whatever he signs I'll stand to?</p>
               <p>Betham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you signed various things for Mr. Lawson?</p>
               <p>Betham. I have while he was in being, several times, that is, as acceptor for him on bills; accepted for him, but then put my own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you drawn bills for him?</p>
               <p>Betham. I don't know that this is a fair question; I have done nothing but with his consent, I have accepted bills, and wrote his name on them for him, and then I have wrote my own name afterwards, for Mr. Lawson.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210026"/>Betham. No; never that it might be taken for his hand writing.</p>

               <p>Betham. I might, and it may be other things, but not to make an ill use of it.</p>

               <p>Betham. I know several maids he had, but not by name.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live?</p>
               <p>Betham. He lived in St. Thomas Apostles in lodgings; there he had but one room, I have done it when he has been along with me, for no use nor no intent.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to sign this bond as a witness, after you had objected to the writing the other name.</p>
               <p>Betham. Because Willson told me he was not going to make any ill use of them, and I should come into no trouble about it, I imagin'd he would not make an ill use of it.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mr. Lawson had returned, or could have returned to this kingdom again, whether he should not have thought himself bound to stand by that writing of yours?</p>
               <p>Betham. I cannot tell what another man's sentiments may be in such a case, I do not know whether he would have done it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this assignment for Mr. Willson to take up Mr. Lawson's bills?</p>
               <p>Betham. Yes; I look'd upon it to be to his benefit; if I had look'd upon it to be prejudicial to him, I would not have done it upon no consideration; that was one thing encourag'd me to do what I did.</p>

               <p>About 4 years ago, Lawson had a great number of bills, and desired I would discount them for him; from the latter end of the year 1757, to November 1758, I discounted to the value of 8000 l. and upwards; I found drawers and indorsors were failed or failing: I apply'd to Mr. Lawson, and told him the situation things were in, and that it would be cruel to let those bills come upon me, as I had done all in my power to serve him; he said, he would make me a sufficient security, and sent Mr.

             an attorney to make an assignment to me of a ship call'd the Venus, and several other effects and debts, which were executed on the 20th of November; then I went to Mr. Higgs, and told him in whose hands there were 626 l. 11 s. and told him those bills were become bad, for most of them were broke or breaking; I told him, I had taken care to get a sufficiency from Mr. Lawson, and I would assign over to him this policy of insurance, and the ship's book, and bill of sale belonging to it, on condition he would advance me a farther sum of money; I told him the policy was wrote for 1350 l. and that in case the ship came home it would be of greater value, it would make 1600 l. I left that security with him, and said I must have the money made up 1000 l. I left them in his hands for a day or two; and if upon inquiry he found the secur ity was good, he would do according to my desire; I call'd upon him again, and ask'd him if he had made inquiry; he said, he had, and he had found my security good for 1000 l. but it was not quite convenient for him to advance so much money, but he would recommend me to a friend of his, he appointed me to meet him on the friday following at Mr. Fogg's warehouse, that was the 27th of November, I went there and saw Mr. Fogg; after we had been there a little while, Mr. Higgs sent for this gentleman, who had proposed to advance 1000 l. he show'd him this security, and Mr. Higgs had a policy broker along with him: he told me it was an undeniable security for 1000 l. as it was a very common thing to assign over policies for insurances; he said, he was very well satisfied, but that he had parted with a considerable sum of money a few days before, and it was not convenient for him to do it; so Mr. Higgs and I came away together; and as we walk'd together, Mr. Higgs said, as I had acted so honestly by him, in coming to him before the bills were due, he would serve me as far as in his power; he said, there was one bill among them, which he look'd upon to be a good bill, but there were 2 upon Tittley. and one upon Lawson, which he look'd upon to be bad, and those I must take up. I told him I was ready to take them all up, those amounted to 453 l. 1 s. this money he said he would make up 600 l. I told him that would be doing but very little, for the property he had sign'd over to him, and that money would not be sufficient to secure every body; he said he could go no farther, but perhaps in some future time he might advance some more money; he never mentioned a word to me to put 2 men on the policy in the room of 2 that fail'd; I said, if the ship comes home it will be several hundreds more; he said, I might do as I would about putting more upon it, as we agreed upon this; he said, Mr. Lawson might meet him; he says he never saw Lawson in his life, but that will be prov'd, he desired Lawson would meet him at the Baptist-head coffee house that evening: I sent for Mr. Lawson, and I, Mr. Lawson, Mr. Jackson, and Betham went all there on Monday the 27th in the afternoon: Mr. Higgs and Mr. Fogg talk'd to Mr. Lawson, and ask'd him about the security; he said, it was to inable me to take up bills that I had from him; Mr. Lawson, even then, had given directions for an assignment to be made to Mr. Higgs, with a blank left in it to be fill'd in; Mr. Higgs was very well satisfied with this; Mr. Fogg says my treaty was with him; my treaty was with Mr. Higgs; he appointed me to meet him at Hamlin's coffee-house, and said he should be ready; Mr. Higgs said, he should chuse to have this assignment made to Mr. Fogg; I told him, it would be very odd to make it to a person that I never had any concern with; then I said he should be engaged along with Mr. Fogg in a deseasance given to me, for I should not trust so considerable a sum in the hand of Mr. Fogg; for there would be at least 700 l coming to me from this assignment; accordingly Mr. Higgs and Mr. Fogg mentioned to go to some proper person to assign over this ship's policy and insurance to Mr. Fogg; I ask'd, if they approved of Mr. Hewit; they said yes, very well; Mr. Fogg went along with me there; I laid down all the papers, and gave directions to prepare an assignment to sign<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210028"/> over to Mr. Fogg for 600 l. he was present and heard it; there was no mention of a bond in all the transactions; there was never mention made of a bond if it had not been for the proposal made by Mr. Hewit; I have been since told, it is customary with notaries to sign a bond with every thing; he said it would be ready in about an hour; we came again, when he had very near finished the assignment; he said he thought a joint bond should accompany it, and a receipt; I said, now you come to want a joint bond, now you have 1360 l. for 600. Mr. Hewit fill'd it up, and wrote a receipt at the bottom of the assignment, and I took it to Betham; he said he would go and find out Lawson, and get it sign'd, he know'd where he was. I desired him to be as speedy as possible, and in about half an hour he came and brings them sign'd to me as they are now, and I suppose by Lawson, for I see no reason to think the contrary. I carried it, and delivered it to Mr. Hewit, and he gave it to Mr. Higgs, and Mr. Higgs paid me. Immediately after receiving this 104 l. 19 s. I went to a person on Tower-hill, and paid him, and took up a bill of Lawson's; it will appear evident from hence I could have no intent whatever to defraud; I could have raised more money upon that security; I could have let Mr. Higgs have done what he would with his rotten and bad bills; I think this will show the highest mark of honesty in me, that I stuck to the assignment to take up the bills of the bankrupt.</p>

               <p>A day or two after this I went to Mr. Higgs in Cheapside, with whom I discounted a Bill of Lawson's for upwards of one hundred pounds; to another man I discounted another of his bills for 125 l. the drawers and acceptors had so far failed, there was no probability of being paid; I told the creditors, I had made an assignment over to Mr. Higgs for 1300 l. to secure no more than 600; and I must leave other people unsecur'd, if I left so much in his hands; I told them, I would assign over to Mr. Higgs, for them to be paid after he was paid: Mr. Higgs told them it was a good security for 1000 l. and that they might very safely take 225 l. for at last it would be worth 1000 l. and recommended them to do so.</p>
               <p>When I met Mr. Hodson and Mr. Maccauley, I ask'd them, if they had been with Mr. Higgs; they said, he told them the security in his hands was an undeniable security for 1000 l. I did not chuse to encumber-that security any farther, if I could help it. I went and told them I had two bonds, on which were due 303 l. and I would assign over those bonds to them: they said, they would do whatever I pleased, either take an assignment under Mr. Higgs for 125 l. more, or as I thought proper; and in a very little time after they receiv'd the money and paid themselves. I believe here will be another mark of my honestly, I could have receiv'd the money on those bonds in a very little time, and have put it in my own pocket, had I been so minded.</p>
               <p>I contracted all this affair with as much uprightness as possible. In a little time after this, some other affairs of Mr. Lawson's came into my hands; I apply'd to Mr. Smith and attorney to get me some more money into my hands; Mr. Smith sent for Mr. Higgs, and ask'd for his security; he told him he might, that it was a very good security for more than 1000 l. this was 3 or 4 months after it was assign'd over to Mr. Higgs.</p>
               <p>About 3 months after, a commission of bankruptcy was taken out against Lawson; Mr. Staples and Mr. Dingley were made assignees; they petition'd for me to deliver up all in my hands belonging to him, my debt was very near 2000 l. I prov'd it to be 1800 and odd; they petition'd to have all his effects out of my hands, but their petition was dismiss'd; after that they filed a bill against me; I put in a full answer to that; they never proceeded farther against me; they never mended nor paid cost. Some time after this, they brought another petition against me, praying I might deliver up all my effects upon the bankruptcy; my Lord Keeper directed I should deliver up nothing but what was assign'd; I had nothing to deliver. Some little time after this, upon looking over the state of Lawson's books, I found the assignees had proved much larger debts than were due to them. Mr. Dingley had proved a debt of 90 l. 15 s. and his debt was only 50 l. 15 s. Mr. Staples swore a debt of 39 l. 15 s. and he at the same time was debtor 58 l. and upwards. This I acquainted the rest of the creditors with; they readily join'd in a petition to have me remov'd. My Lord Keeper, upon hearing this petition, directed it back to the commissioners, to examine and report the matter, as it should appear to them.</p>
               <p>Upon which, they had several meetings to settle what was really due to Dingley and Staples. Those assignees apprehending I was at the bottom of this discovery, they strove to harrass and perplex me; they then immediately apply'd to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210029"/> Higgs, to get these securities out of his hands; they found there was a bond, and that they pretend is a forg'd bond of Lawson's, tho' unknown to me to be such; perhaps Mr. Betham might think he had a right to do it, for he wou'd have sign'd 20 bonds at any time upon requesting it; for even at the time we met at the coffee-house, he was ready to sign any thing for my security that I desir'd.</p>
               <p>They very judiciously obtain'd those securities, my property, by paying 600 l. they possess themselves of 1360 l. they have two ends to serve in this.</p>
               <p>First, by getting my property out of my hands, and then to answer their malicious, envious purposes, to commence a criminal prosecution against me.</p>
               <p>I think to defraud Mr. Fogg is impossible, he had no property in it; and to defraud Mr. Higgs, that cannot be, for he had more than a double security, that could not fail, it was good at that time, and good ever since, good this moment, it wou'd have been receiv'd many months ago, if the assignees had not hindred the payment of it.</p>
               <p>And Lawson is past a possibility of being defrauded, for that was to pay Lawson's bills.</p>
               <p>To put it upon the worst footing possible, suppose there had been no security at all, and those bills came back to Lawson to pay, because he was paying no more than a debt he really owed; he was paying for taking up his own bills; for the very debt in Mr. Higg's hands was his own debt, I did not get one six-penny piece, or farthing by it; I am as innocent of any defraud as any man can be; I could have raised money upon them, had it been my inclination. I have spent out of my own pocket more than 300 l. occasioned by the litigious suits that the assignees have been setting up against me, in order that the owners of the bills may not be sufferers. I have taken the utmost pains and assiduity to see justice done; and am so far from being benefited, that I am extremely injur'd; it has taken up all my time for almost 12 months together, to look after those litigious suits.</p>
               <p>I have obtain'd my Lord Keeper's opinion, his Lordship looks upon it I have acted right. Notwithstanding the assignees have gone and got my money out of my hands, on purpose to get a prosecution against me, I hope, upon the whole, from the nature of this case, and the circumstances attending it, that the security I gave Mr. Fogg and Mr. Higgs was more than a double security, that the whole of this transaction has been fair and upright on my part; I have not converted one single shilling to my own use; I think I have put it out of my power to commit a fraud; and if so, I hope nothing of that sort can be imputed to me; I solemnly declare, I had no such intention, I am as innocent of such a design as any man can; and therefore most humbly submit my case to the great justice of your Lordships, and this honourable Court.</p>

            . I remember, on the 19th of November, 1758, I was sent for to come to the Feathers tavern, Cheapside, there was Mr. Lawson and Mr. Betham; Mr. Lawson himself propos'd to me, and desir'd me to draw up an assignment; he said, Mr. Willson had indorsed and discounted a great many bills for him, and he wanted first of all to secure him. I was apprehensive, whether there was not some bankruptcy in view or intended; but upon the strictest examination I could make, I could not find it; it did not appear to me that there was any danger; he said, the whole amounted to about 2000 l. and I was to make an assignment of such and such things to him, the ship Venus, and some part of other ships, some bonds, and some other deeds, to the amount of 3000 l. he said, it was to indemnify him against those bills which he had indorsed, and the remainder of it was to go to Lawson.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you produce this assignment?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, I cannot, they would have the assignment executed that night, but I had not a schedule of the particular effects to be assign'd, it was appointed to be executed on the friday morning. I drew part of the draught, and got prepar'd the stamps for it; the next day Mr. Willson's maid desir'd I would call upon him in the afternoon; I went, it was approv'd and executed on the friday morning about 9 o'clock; to me nothing appear'd fairer.</p>

I think he came and sat down where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210030"/> we were, Lawson had given me instructions to prepare a re-assignment, and leave a blank for the name.</p>

            . I am a midwife; I was sent for to Mrs. Dudman's; she told me she was afraid that Nanny was brought to bed, and the child was killed; I took a candle and look'd down the vault, and saw a child's feet; I went directly up stairs to the prisoner, and said Nanny, why could you put the child down the vault; she said she did not; this was between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning; I told her she did, and told her I saw a plain proof that she had been delivered, and had put the child down the vault; then she attempted to make me believe it dropp'd from her body in the vault; I had found she had been delivered on the boards in the vault; at last she told me she did; I went to Mrs. Dudman, and desir'd she would let me take the child out of the soil; she said, she was afraid she should come into trouble; I said, the jury could not sit till it was taken out; I went and took it out; the minute I got it up at the he ad of the vault the blood appear'd: I said here is murder committed, the head is almost off; I laid it down on the boards, and it bled prodigiously.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it lain in the vault, as near as you can guess?</p>
               <p>S. Dorwood. I believe it might have been born between 3 and 4 in that morning; it stuck in the soil, and the soil kept the place together, so that the blood had no vent; I went up stairs directly; I said Nanny, how could you lay violent hands on it to draw innocent blood, said I, do you consider you soul? she made no answer; I said, where is your pocket? she said it was down stairs; I put my hand under her bed, and found her pocket, but there was no knife in it; then I asked her where the knife was, with which she committed the murder; she said in the knife-box; I ask'd what knife; she said one of her mistress's case knives; I look'd in the box, but looking on the other dresser I found the knife, that I suppose to be the knife with blood upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the child appear to you to have come to the birth?</p>

               <p>Q. Is you maid here?</p>
               <p>J. Dudman.

I had seen the child before, but afterwards I saw the child's throat was cut. I said to her, how could you do this, there is an hospital ready, and if you had spoke to me but half an hour before I could have got it in.

She told me, she was afraid her lodger's servant had been deliver'd of a child in the little house, and that she had made away with it, the child was taken out of the soil, and I saw it with the head almost cut off. I went in, and ask'd where the girl was; I went to her and said, was the child born alive. She said yes. I said, did it cry? she said yes. I said, what could be the reason of your murdering of it? she said, she did not know what to do with it. I said, have you any cloaths for it? she said, no. Said I, you will be hang'd. She said, O Lord, I hope not. Said I, is it your child? she said yes. I said, how did you murder it? with a case knife, said she. I ask'd her where the knife was? she said, in the kitchen. I talk'd to her a good deal, and ask'd her if she was in her senses; she said she was very well for the time, and that she was able to get up and do her business. I went down stairs and ask'd for the knife, and there I was show'd it. The next morning I apply'd to justice Fielding, and ask'd what I should do with her? he said, by all means fetch her, if she is able to be removed, there is one subject lost. don't let another be lost without punishment. I went and fetch'd her, and she confess'd the same before the justice; in the coach between there and justice Fielding's she never denied the fact; but said, she always intended to put it in the necessary. It was a female child (a case knife produc'd with blood upon it)</p>

            . I have held a correspondence with Mr. Nocks of Bristol for some time, and have dealings with him. I understand since, but not before that the prisoner at the bar was clerk to him (he produced a bill of exchange, dated January 21, 1760) this I took to have been drawn by Mr. Nocks; this was brought to me, and I taking it to be a good bill, accepted it; and when it became due I gave the person a draught upon my banker, and the money was paid; but upon my oath, I cannot sware that the prisoner is the person that brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing that will effect the prisoner as to the forging of it?</p>
               <p>Briscoe. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>John Eustace. About Christmas, as I was going to bed, I dropp'd my watch and broke the glass; I gave it to my wife to put by; about the 14th of Dec. the prisoner came to work with me, he is a <rs id="t17600521-28-deflabel143" type="occupation">journeyman carpenter</rs>

Hunt's at Mile-end; about a fortnight after he was gone, I ask'd my wife for the watch; we then miss'd that; I went and took up the prisoner, and charg'd him with taking it; he said, master hold your tongue and I'll tell you how I got it; he said, you know I was doing a bit of wainscotting, and I dropp'd my hammer, and stooping for that, I saw a watch hanging up the chimney as I look'd up, when stooping I took it away; I took him to Aldgate watch-house, there he own'd he took it before the constable; the next morning we went to take him before my Lord Mayor, a gentleman going by, ask'd what was the matter, and looking on the prisoner, said, he had brought him a watch to sell; he is here, and will give a farther account.</p>

            . About 6 weeks ago, one night about 9 o'clock, a young man knock'd at my door, and ask'd for me; he ask'd me if I was a constable, I said yes; he said there is a young man offers a watch to sell for 27 s. to a Jew, which is worth 4 l. and he believ'd it was not honestly come by; I went with him to the 3 pigeons alehouse in Hounsditch, he shew'd me the person, which was the prisoner at the bar; I took the watch, and said to the prisoner, is this the watch you offer to sell; he said it is, what right have you to examine me; then I said I would keep the watch, and take you to the compter, except you give me a satisfactory account; he said, if I would go with him to his lodgings he'd make it appear to be his own property. He said he lodg'd with Mrs. Smith that keeps a school, one that I kne w very well; I went with him, I ask'd her if she knew that man; she said yes, he was a lodger of her's, and had been for about six months; I shew'd her the watch, and said, do you know this watch; she said yes; she thought it to be the prisoner's property; then I said take your watch again, and gave it to him, and I went away. After<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210036"/> that I went back again, and desired to look at it again; Mrs. Smith had it, I look'd at it; I saw the name Gardner on it; I was foolish enough to deliver it again: about 3 weeks after this I seeing a mob of people, ask'd what was the matter, was told a man had stole a watch; I said I would look at him, it was the prisoner; I said friend, do you not remember me; he said yes, you are the man that stopp'd me with a watch, now he says he has lost it, I was with him before my Lord Mayor, there he said he took it from the prosecutor's chimney-piece, and was sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Eustace. When my husband had let his watch fall and broke the glass, he gave it me to take care of it, I put it into a drawer and cover'd it over, after which we miss'd it, the drawer was lock'd; afterwards I had seen it several times there; and one time I remember I found the lock shot up and the key out, and the drawer a little out.</p>

            . I am a Gun-lock maker; last Saturday I was at Mr. Jos. Buckmaster's, a gunsmith in the minories; there I saw 4 gun-locks in his kitchen, 2 of them I knew to be the property of Mess. Vernon and Haskins; and the other 2 to be the property of the King; (2 musket-locks, and two pistol-locks produc'd) these are they; the King's mark is on the inside the plates on the 2 pistol-locks, the others I made for Mess. Vernon and Haskins, I mark'd them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the common mark you put upon all you make?</p>
               <p>Stamp. No, this is the mark I put upon all I make for them, and I make no locks of this sort but for them: I ask'd Mr. Buckmaster how he came by those locks; he said, they were brought to his house for sale by the prisoner Hewson. Here is also a parcel of locks, which I was at the finding in the house of Melvin (producing 6 more) they are of several peoples making, some in Birmingham, some in town: here are two flat pistollocks, the property of

            , they have the letters T. J. which they always strike on the inside of the lock. I heard Melvin confess after he was taken into custoday, that he had followed robbing the Tower of locks about 12 months, and that he carried them to the other prisoner, and he us'd to buy them.</p>
               <p>J. Buckmaster (he takes 2 musket and 2 pistol-locks in his hand) to the best of my knowledge these are the locks brought to me for sale by Hewson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he charge a piece for them?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. He said the musket locks were a crown each, and the pistol locks 3 s. for the pair; I said the price wou'd not do for me.</p>
               <p>Counsel. What would you sell one of them for if I wanted one?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. I have some that I give but half a crown a pair for, and these are not a great deal better.</p>
               <p>Stamp. One of these locks is worth 6 of them that you talk of, which you know very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had these locks been at your house?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. They were at my house about 7 or eight days, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How often might Hewson have brought locks to you?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. Never before he brought these; he said he was to have 5 s. a piece, and to have nothing for his trouble in selling them but a pot of beer; he has work'd for me 20 years in the gunstocking way; I have bought many 100 of gun locks and barrels too of him; I did not mistrust him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them, do you see the King's mark upon them?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. Now I do; but I did not know the King's mark then.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Hewson?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. I have known him 7 or 8 and 30 years, he has been a house-keeper 35 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has he bore in the neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. He has bore a good one, or I should not have imploy'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any locks that are returned?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. When they do not like them, they do not pass, they are returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you met with a great number of such locks?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. No; I am not in that branch; such locks are sold in the common way to the shops where they have a mind to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these appear to you as returned locks?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. I took little notice of them, the price ask'd for them all were too much.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. Are they mark'd with the government's mark when they are returned?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. Yes, they are mark'd by the viewers, I think.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. Do you know the difference between a viewed lock and a lock not viewed?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. I am not so good a judge.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210039"/> Counsel for Crown. Is there a broad arrow put upon them before they are hardened?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. Yes, I do not know of any marks after they are hardened.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. Did you ever hear of a lock that had the King's mark on it, that has been returned?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. They are viewed after they are hardened, and if they do not like them they are returned, if there is some defect in them.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. When the King's mark is upon them, is the lock perfect?</p>
               <p>Buckmaster. Yes.</p>

            . I am under the surveyer general in the small gun office.</p>
               <p>Q. What time is it that they put the government's mark upon the locks?</p>
               <p>Hartwell. These sort of locks are sent in by the contractors in this state (holding a soft lock in his hand) with the contractor's mark on them (he takes up a hard one) this is mark'd with all his Majesty's proper marks.</p>
               <p>Stamp. This is found at Mr. Buckmaster's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is done before you put the King's mark upon them?</p>
               <p>Hartwell. They are narrowly inspected by a proper officer, to see whether they are according to the pattern agreed for; if they are approv'd of, he immediately strikes a proper mark on the inside, which we all know, and all the trade knows; if we meet with a lock in the East Indies we know who it was viewed by; there is not a boy in the trade but what knows it; he strikes his mark first, and immediately after that strikes the broad arrow on the outside; after which, they are never return'd back to the maker again; then they go to the engravers, then to the hardeners; they go through another inspection after that, and if needful they are return'd to be made good, but never sold after the King's mark is upon them (that is not new locks) these 2 musket locks, and 2 pistol-locks, are the property of his Majesty, with the proper marks upon them; here has been some are used with the pistol-locks, part of the marks have been taken out on the outside; the cannon lock is the property of his majesty, I can plainly discover where the mark on the brass plate has been filed out; this was made for firing a piece of ordnance, they could be used by nobody else, they are for firing 3 pounders on the quarter-deck of 24 gun ships.</p>
               <p>Stamp. That cannon lock was found in the lodgings of Melvin.</p>
               <p>Hartwell. The price for these locks is 14 s. and 6 d. each; for all sorts of cannon locks these are the lowest of all, but then they are put upon an average.</p>

            . Here are some locks mine and my partner's property. We imploy Mr. Stamp to get us up locks, and then we mark them with out names; he marks them in the country by our order; when we came to Mr. Buckmaster's he was backwards; we ask'd him for the locks that Mr. Stamp had seen there; he gave them us; and said he had them of Hewson, I sent for Mr. Hewson, and he came; my partner and I ask'd him how he came by these 4 locks; he said, the man he had them on was gone to Birmingham, and was there by now, that was on the Monday; we told him we were great suffers, and would prosecute him, or know the bottom of it; when he found we insisted upon a satisfactory account, he desired us to give him time till the next day; we told him we could not, we did give him time till the next day, then he desired time till one o'clock, at which time we went to his house again, his servant told us he was at the Red Cross in the Minories; we went there, and there we saw Hewson and Melvin; there Hewson said he had the 2 pistol locks and 2 musket locks of Melvin, they are the property of his Majesty; we never sold any to Melvin, or any body else; we serve the government with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Buckmaster say what they were brought to him for?</p>

               <p>Q. Might not Buckmaster suppose Melvin was gone to Birmingham?</p>
               <p>Haskins. I can't say what he might suppose; then we charg'd a constable with them both.</p>
