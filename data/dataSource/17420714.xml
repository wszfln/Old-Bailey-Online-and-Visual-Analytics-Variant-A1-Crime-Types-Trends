            . I live at the Bird-Cage the corner of Wood street. On the 21st of June I missed some Money out of a Drawer, I cannot justly say how much. I can take upon me to say 2 Guineas positively. - I had counted the Money the Night before, and there were near 50 Guineas. The Drawer was not broke open. I found the Prisoner had Money, and that he had bespoke a new Suit of Cloaths, and a Wigg; I went to the Master he lived with before, to inquire if he knew of his having any Money, he told me he believed he had none, for that he had borrowed half a Crown to buy a pair of Shoes. On Monday I took him into a Room with two or three Neighbours, and put it close to him, and he immediately confessed he had robbed me, desired his Box to be brought down, took his Key and opened it, took the Money out, and said, This is the Money I took from you last Sunday Morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had not all the Money he mentions, for I had Half a Guinea and three Sixpences of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any promises of Indulgence before he confessed; for the Jury will consider that.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been any Time acquainted with me?</p>

               <p>Washington. I cannot say which, he came upon me all on a sudden.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the Purse down your Stays?</p>
               <p>Washington. It was but a little way down, for I am pretty loose, and cannot go strait-laced, he laid hold of me on the Shoulder before he took the Money, then he run his Hand down and took it out, and then gave it to the other Man. - I think he laid hold on my Shoulder first, I cannot say he hurt my Flesh.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you under any Surprize when he took hold of your Shoulder?</p>
               <p>Washington. I was under some Surprize to have some Body lay hold of my Shoulder, and see a Man behind me and know nothing of it. -</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always put your Money in your Bosom?</p>
               <p>Washington. I generally do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you declare before Col. De Veil, that the People met you, and did not come behind you, but before you?</p>
               <p>Washington. No. For I cannot be certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you offer before Col. De Veil to make this Matter up, and give him a general Release?</p>
               <p>Washington. No, I never did, I will abide by that, I will till the Day I die. It was about 10 o'clock at Night.</p>

            . I went to Col. De Veil's Clerk to get a Warrant against the Prosecutor, for obstructing the Prisoner in the Execution of his Office as a Bailiff, and had a Warrant against her.

When I heard of this Misfortune on the 7th Day of June, I carried the Child to Mr. Edmonds the Surgeon, to know whether he had done her any Damage. - I did not know of it till a Week after it was done. - I asked her before I went to Mr. Edmonds how it happened, and what she did there? She said nothing to me about it. - Mr. Edmonds and his Servant both examined the Child: Mr. Edmond's shook his Head, and said it is very proper the Fellow should be secured: - He said the Child had received Damage enough, for he had made a very great Attempt upon her.

            . I was in Mr Setcole's Shop the 8th of June, and saw the Prisoner at the Bar, bargaining with Mr Setcole's Servant for some cloth; as soon as she went out of the Shop, Mr Setcole said he was afraid she had taken some Cloth; he talked of sending a Servant to follow her, and I said I would follow her myself, which I did, and at the End of a Court, there was a Door, at which she went in and shut the Door; I immediately opened the Door, and saw her Petticoats up, and the cloth then coming from under them. I took hold of her, and told her, Madam, - I called her Madam, because she was dressed in a fine damask Gown, and fine Cloaths. - Madam, said I, you must go with me to Mr Setcole's the Draper, from whence you came; she immediately took the Cloth and put it under her Arm, and came along with me; coming thro' the Cloysters, she fell down upon one Knee and dropped the Cloth, I suppose with Design of leaving it, but she took it up and brought it with her, then I saw her go into Mr Setcole's Shop, she gave a little sort of a run, slipp'd into the Chair, threw the Cloth down, and threw another Piece of Cloth which was upon the Counter, upon the Piece which she brought in with her, and had thrown down before; immediately I took up that Piece of Cloth which she had under her Arm, and brought in and threw upon the Ground, and asked Mr Setcole, is that your Cloth? for that was the Cloth which that Woman took from under her Petticoats and brought under her Arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make a Mark upon it?</p>

            . On the 8th of June, the Prisoner at the Bar came to Mr Setcole's Shop, under pretence of buying some Holland. I shewed her several Pieces, whereof we agreed for one: at the Time we were agreeing, I observed that she had something under her Coat, sometimes shuffling, as if she had something she was afraid should drop, by which I immediately imagined she had robbed us of a Piece of Cloth; after we had agreed for the Holland, she desired me to cut off three Ells, which I did, and put it into a Paper for her, and she gave me a Shilling Earnest; as soon as she was gone, we all agreed that she had taken something, and intended to send a Servant after her, but Mr Walker being in the Shop, he offered to go, and in ten Minutes Time she came back with the Piece under her Arm; she sat down in a Chair in the Shop, and flung the Piece of Cloth down upon the Ground, and endeavoured to pull another Piece of Cloth off the Counter to smother it, that I should not know which it was: In the Time that she was gone, I missed a Piece of Cloth, and found that Piece which I took up to be the same Piece which I before had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207140007"/> missed. - She desired my Master to forgive her, and offered to go down upon her Knees if he would let her go, but we are so much troubled with these Customers, he thought proper to do her Justice.</p>

            , Constable, Mr Setcole came to my House and told me he had lost a Piece of Cloth, and that he had detected the Woman in the Fact, and desired me to come and take Charge of her; she begged I would endeavour to make the Affair up, and she would send for Friends and make Satisfaction, that she had 5 Children and desired me to make it easy.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner, in her Defence, said she went into the Court to make Water.</p>
               <p>Walker. I saw no Water. - I saw her pull this Piece of Cloth from under her Coats. - She very willingly came along with me; she was dressed in a very fine Manner. - I did not lead her along, for I was not afraid of her getting away.</p>

Which they did; that they met a Man, and the Prisoner and the Man went up Stairs into her (the Prisoner's) Lodgings, that she desired her to stay, and she would come again presently. That she went into a House on Tower-hill to drink a Pint of Beer, till she came down: She thought she staid a good while, so went up Stairs, and heard a great many Words pass, as if they had differed; that some time after that, she looked into the Room, and saw a Man bleeding very plentifully at the Mouth and Nose. I advised her to go before a Justice and make a Discovery, but she did not go for some Days.</p>

            , Deputy to Mr King the Coroner. On the 3d of July, I went with my Inquisition to view this Body, in a House by Tower-Ditch; up two Pair of Stairs in a Back-room, there was a Body lying with the Head almost cut off, a Hat full of conjealed Blood, and a Razor all bloody. - There was not one Spot of Blood on the Floor, which makes me conclude the Murder was not committed there. I got a Candle to examine the Floor though it was light enough; but I was willing to be thoroughly satisfied: The Head lay upon a Heap of Rubbish, I turned the Head aside, to see if there was any Blood under it, and moved the Rubbish with my Foot, but there was none, which must have been if he had been murder'd there; they likewise viewed every Room in the House, and could find no Blood in any of them. - I do not think that the Man was murdered in that House, for there must be more Blood come out of a Body than the Quantity that was in the Hat; and the Room did not appear to have been washed lately.</p>

She said, for the Dropsy; she was pass'd from St. George's Workhouse, to Marybone; I said, I did not think it was a Dropsy, and took her to Dr Ross, he offer'd to take her as an Out-patient, I said, that would be of no Service to the Girl, because she had no Friends: I told him she had confessed what had happened, and he stripp'd her stark naked, and examined her, and then he was of Opinion that she was with Child: This Woman at the Bar fetched her from Greenwich, and carried her to a Cellar in Grosvenor's Mews, the Child told me, Thomas the Carpenter was at the Head of the Bed with the Prisoner at the Bar, and she was at the Feet. She said, she stood over her with a Case-knife, while Thomas the Carpenter had to do with her, and that the Prisoner should say, if you do not let him lie with you, or tell your Father, or any Body else, she would cut her Throat from Ear to Ear; and said, that Thomas the Carpenter did lie with her. The Prisoner came to me in Tyburn-Road, the Saturday Night before she was taken up, and said, if I could get the Girl out of the Workhouse, she could make her confess who the Father of the Child is, and she knew the Father to be worth Money.</p>
               <p>[The Jury desired the Matron of the Workhouse might be called, to know if the Child had over varied in her Account of this Matter ]</p>

I am Matron of the Workhouse; I found this out first, and asked her, whether she had had any Dealings with Man or Boy, for I did not take her Disorder to be a Dropsy; this was about 2 Months after she came into the Workhouse, she said, no; she had not: Hussey, said I, you must have had to do with some Body, for it is not a Dropsy, and you must confess it to me, or the Overseers will send you to Bridewell; then she confess'd it, and that it was by her Mother-in-law's Son, that he lay with her several Times, and once in Bed with her Mother-in-law; she would not confess any thing to me, concerning Thomas the Carpenter, but only the Boy Webly Cox; she did not confess this till April. She always gave the same Account, and did not vary in it.</p>

The Prisoner at the Bar, and W. Bryers passed him, and when I saw him, I turned back from him, and walked before him; then they turned round and seized his Arms, and kept him that he could not go any farther, then I turn'd round and came up to his Face, and took his Watch out of his Pocket, the Watch which is now produced, is the same Watch I took from him, we run down Gracechurch-street immediately; we sold the Watch jointly, to one Jack the Sailor, who is now in Newgate, and he sold it to the Person I got it of; we sold it for two Guineas, and divided the Money.</p>

            . Last Monday was Seven-Night, I was going along Holbourn with a Bundle, between one and two in the Day. I was directed to carry this Bundle of Linnen, to one Mrs Savage's, over against the Watch-house in Holbourn, to be made. I met with a Gentleman in Holbourn, whom I enquired of, and he said, he did not know any such Person, unless it was over the Way. I went up Shoe-lane, and enquired if any such Person lived there, I enquired of this Woman, she stood at a Door, and said, she lodged there up one Pair of Stairs; so I went into the House; as soon as I got into the House with the Bundle, she shut the Door, and took the Bundle from me, in the Entry, and carried it up Stairs; I went up Stairs after her, to see the Bundle safe delivered to the Person who was to have it; as soon as I got into the Room, where she told me the Gentlewoman lodged, she threw me down upon the Red, and then searched my Pockets, and took out two Silver Knee-Buckles, one Silver Stock-Buckle, and 14 d. in Money, and then she went to tearing the Paper the Linnen was wrapp'd in; I strove as long as I could to get the Linnen from her, which when I had done, I ran down Stairs and got away, and carried the Linnen to the Place where I had it from, Mr Peter Keysterman's, a Hambro Merchant, in Lawrence Pountney-lane ; he was at my Mother's the Day before, and desir'd she would let me go with it. - He sent it by me, because he has no Servant of his own. - As soon as I got back again with the Linnen, I complained to him, and he got a Constable, and we went and took her up, in the same House where I was misused. - I believe it was a Fore-room, and no Shutters to the Windows. - I did not cry out, because I thought I could manage her. - There was no Woman in the Room but herself. There were two more below Stairs.</p>
               <p>Nath White, Constable. On Monday, the 5th of this Instant, I was coming up Holbourn, and my Brother Constable, of the same Parish, called to me, out of the White-Swan in Shoe-lane, and told me, that the Prosecutor had been robb'd at the Prisoner's House, and that he could not get in; said I, lend me your Staff, and I will endeavour to get in. I went to the Fore-Door, and the Door was shut, I went to the Back-Door, (it is the Corner of a Court in Shoe -lane) the Prisoner at the Bar asked, who was there? I told her, if she would, I would make the Thing up as easy as I could, it was some time before she gave me any Answer; at last she told me, I should not come in; but at length, sometimes by giving her good Words and sometimes bad, she let me in, on my Promise that no Body should come up Stairs but my self; so I went up Stairs with her, I told her the Prosecutor was below, that he had been robb'd of the Things mentioned in the Indictment; she said, no Body had been robb'd that Day in her House; then she bid two Women, who were in the House, look in the Back-room below Stairs, and when they mov'd a Chair or two, one of the Knee-buckles, and the Stock buckle lay under the Chair, upon the Ground. I am not positive whether I took them up, or not, or who did; they are ready to be produc'd in Court, and Smith will prove them to be his.</p>
               <p>Smith. These are mine, this Knee-buckle, and the Stock-buckle.</p>
               <p>White. I called in the Prosecutor, and asked him, which was the Person that robb'd him? And he pointed immediately to the Prisoner at the Bar, and said, that was the Woman that robb'd him; and then he charged the Prisoner at the Bar, and two others, and sent them to the Compter.</p>
               <p>2. Why did he send them to the Compter?</p>
               <p>White. Because he did not know but they might be aiding, or assisting, or have the other Buckle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was me and two more Women in Company, I did not touch them. This is a persidious Case, when you know [to the Constable] what pasied between you and I in the Back-room; the Boy came to the Door, and asked for a Dram, I thought such Boys had no occasion for Drams; I said to him, prithee, Boy, go about your Business; says one of the Women, let the Boy have a Dram, and so I did, and he gave me 2 d. for it, and the Boy went into the Back room with them about 11 o'Clock.</p>

            . This was by Mr Rudge's Brew-House in Hackney-Parish. On the 15th of April, I was coming along Mourning-Lane, I had a Load of Soot upon my Back. The Prisoners came riding along very hard, - they rode a full Gallop; my Fellow-Apprentice was before me, and bid me get out of the Way; and if I had not I should have been rode over. So I threw myself against the Bank. Mr Clark's Horse came pretty near the Bank, then Cooke said, you ought to be knocked off your Horses for riding so hard: Whereupon Clark, he, the tall one, lifted up his Whip against Cooke. I was about thirty Yards off, and saw Cooke lift, up his Spade, so, which was up first, the Whip or the Spade, I cannot say: I saw no Blows pass, nor any thing after this, for I was in the Shed, shooting my Soot out of my Sack.</p>

            . I saw the Prisoners at the Bar in Mourning-Lane, the 15th of April last. I was going Home after my Boys, this and another; these two Gentlemen were riding at a great Rate, and passed by me: I could not see quite up the Lane, for there is a winding in the Lane, and then they were out of my Sight till I came up to the turn of the Lane, then I saw Mr Clarke and Mr Cooke have hold of each other by the Collar, - it was between two and three o'Clock in the Afternoon, Clark dismounted, and held up his Whip with the butt End upwards against Cooke. - I do not know whether he held the Whip up against Cooke with a Design to strike him. - I stepped up, and said, do not be afraid of the Man that has got hold of you, for the other shall not meddle with you. Mr Price came and laid hold of me by the Collar, I asked him what he laid hold of me for: he said, because you should not hurt my Friend, I said I am not going to hurt you, nor your Friend neither; let me go or I will give you a knock on the Face, then they soon mounted their Horses and away they went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them afterwards on that Day?</p>
               <p>Flatman. Yes. I saw them about four Hours afterwards in Mourning-Lane. I live just by the Place where this happened. People had done Work. They passed by, came back and rode into my Yard, I was smoaking a Pipe over the Pales; they asked me for a Pot of Beer, I answered them I sold none; is there no Publick House near, says they, let us drink together; thinks I, if I do not go, they will think I am afraid of them, and so I went with them to the Plough Alehouse at Hammerton ; when I came to the Alehouse, Mr Clark, I think it was, called for a Pot of Beer, and there was a full Pot of Beer brought, then, while<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207140015"/> the Beer was fetching, Mr Price would have quarrelled with me, I told him I did not care for fighting. Mr Clark brought the Beer to me, and I drank out of the Pot. Mr Clark asked me which was the House Cooke lived at; one Man pointed at the House, and said, that is the House. Mr Clark said he would go and see for him, and he did go, I did not go with Mr Clark. - Cooke lives about sixty Yards from the Plough; he was not at Home, and Clarke said, if he had been within, and would not have come along with him, he would have whipped him before him. - A little after, - as soon as the Words were well out of his Mouth, he saw Cooke coming towards his own House. Says one, there is Cooke coming along. Clark hailed him, and Cooke made a short stand, then he beckoned him, and Cooke came up to the Plough Door. Says Clark, Now if you are a Man fight me. Cooke said, I will not fight, I am not obliged to fight every Fellow, or Words to that Effect, and he would not fight: Then both the Prisoners said, if he would not fight they would Horse-whip him. Said Cooke, you may use your Pleasure, but you had better let it alone than horse-whip me. Then Mr Price went and talked to him, what the Words were, I cannot tell, but they were spoke in an angry Way. Mr Price laid hold of his Arm in order to get him into the House to fight. Cooke had pitched his Load, and sat down at the Door with a Pipe in his Mouth. Price took the butt End of his Whip, and broke the Pipe in Cooke's Mouth, and the Piece which Cooke had in his Hand, which was the Bowl End, he took and irted at Price, but I do not know whether it hit him. Price then fell upon Cooke, and flung him over or cross the Rail, with the blows that he gave him, and fell upon him and beat him; there were several Blows about the Face, for his Face was as bloody as a Slaughter-House. - You could not see his Face for Blood. - Clark was by, but Clark did not meddle with him. -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Clark lay hold of the deceased?</p>
               <p>Flatman. I did not. Then Cooke went away and went Home. - I saw Cooke come by my Door three or four Times afterwards. - I saw him two or three Days after this Quarrel, and he was in a miserable black Condition. -</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any Complaints?</p>
               <p>Flatman. He said he had got some inward and never should be his own Man again, and he said he believed the Man that beat him was the occasion of it - I believe he did not know his Name then. - I never spoke to him after that Time, but every Time I saw him, I thought he grew worse and worse. He could walk as upright as any Man before, but could not do so afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that he complained of his Lungs.</p>
               <p>Flatman. No. He was pretty healthy, but he had not a ruddy Complexion.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this, why did not you take him off.</p>
               <p>Flatman. I have had too much of that already, but if I had done it, this Person, Mr Clark, would have fell upon me, and then we should have been all in a bad Condition.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this Transaction appear to you as any thing more than a common Quarrel?</p>
               <p>Flatman. It did not appear as a common Quarrel to me, for Men to come three or four Hours afterwards, and kill another Man, I do not think that can be called a common Quarrel.</p>

            . I knew Cooke very well, I saw him the Thursday before Easter, I cannot remember the Day of the Month, (on looking into an Almanack, it appeared to be the 15th of April). I saw Mr Clarke at the Plough at Hammerton, either on Horse-back or Mare-back, I cannot tell which, I saw him go from the Plough to Cooke's House, with his Whip in his Hand, and I saw him return again, and heard him say, he was not at Home; and I believe in a Minute, or two Minutes afterwards, as Cooke was coming by the Marsh-Gate, in his Way Home, I saw Mr Clark beckon with his Hand to call him to come up, and then Mr Clark offered him five Shillings to box him, then there were Words arose between all three of them, then I saw Mr Price take the butt End of his Whip, and as Cooke was rising, upon the half Bend, knocked the Pipe out of Cooke's Mouth, then he laid hold of him, overpowered him, and threw him upon the top of the Rail, - then he lay upon him, and beat him over the Face with his Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with his Hand or Fist, for there is some Difference between them.</p>
               <p>Rollo. With his Fist to be sure, for Men do not go to fight like Women with their Hands open. - Clark did not do any thing. - Cooke was afterwards in a drooping, wasting Condition. I do not know that he did any Work after this; it was a dismal Aspect to see him afterwards, for he grew worse and worse Day after Day, and Time after Time. - He was very well before, I do not know that in two Years that I have known him, he has had a Day's Illness.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to part them, when you saw him so abused?</p>
               <p>Rollo. It cost me once, at Hick's-Hall 10 l. for parting a Man and his Wife, and I did not care to part two Men.</p>

I saw him and the Prisoners at the Bar, the Thursday before Easter, at the Plough Door, they were enquiring (I can't tell which of them it was) where Cook lived, Mr Clark went and enquired if he was at home, and they said he was not; then Clark said, if he had been at home, and would not have come, he would have whipp'd him all the way up to the House. In a very little while afterwards, Cooke was going homeward, and Clark called to him, and he came; and I believe Clark said, was you not a Rogue to serve me as you did, to threaten to knock me me off my Horse, and then to go to strike me with your Shovel? said Cooke, My Partner said, if he had been in my Place he would have knock'd you off the Horse. I believe Cooke sat down, and Price insisted on his going into a Room to fight him; I believe he took him by the Collar, and said, he would either swear the Peace against him, or he should fight him; Cooke said, he might do as he pleased, for he would not fight: The little Gentleman, Price, up with his Whip, and made an offer to hit

Then, presently, he broke Cooke's Pipe, which was in his Mouth, with his Whip, Cooke tossed the other Piece at him; with that Price fell a beating him. - He was very much beat, and very bloody. The next Morning he looked very bad, and said, he was sadly hurt; but he could not tell who it was that beat him. - I saw him about three Weeks before he died; then he was very bad. - He was very well before that beating.</p>

Sirrah, says he, I will give you a Crown, or half a Crown, or a Crown Bowl of Punch to fight me; but he would not: With that, this Mr Price walked up and down, and now and then took the Man by the Collar, and shook him, as he was smoaking; that he came up to him and said, you old Rogue will you fight, and then with a sort of a slanting Stroke, he hit the Pipe out of his Mouth, with his Whip; and Cooke tossed the Bit of the Pipe that was left in his Hand at him, with that Price closed in upon him, and after a short Scuffle, threw him down cross the Plate of the Sign-post, and there he held him, that the Man could not turn his Body one way or another; he gave him several Blows about his Breast and Arms, and held him by the Handkerchief, which he had about his Neck. - I saw a little Blood come out of his Mouth, but that might be caused by the Pipe; then they mounted their Horses and went away, Cooke walked away as well as he could; but he walk'd but sadly. He went to get an Officer to take them up. When I saw him afterwards, he always looked sadly. He said, he was very bad, and should never be his right Man again. - Before that he appear'd to be in good Health. - He was always a Pale looking Man. - I believe he never did a Day's Work afterwards. - I said, it is a sad Thing that so many People should be standing by, and not take him off, but let the Man be murdered. Sirrah, says Clark, if you do any thing, I will give you as much; let them have it out. The Man at the Plough, I think, parted them.</p>

            , he went there, and that Clark said, Damn you, you old Rogue, you shall fight me. The other Person, who to the Deponent is unknown, broke his Pipe and beat and bruised him in a very dangerous Manner; that he is now in a low and weak Condition, and verily believes, that this beating and bruising was the Occasion of his Death.</p>
               <p>Mr Fisher, Apothecary. Cooke came to my Shop, I do not remember the Time, it was in April, or May. I saw him pretty near his Death, he opened his Waistcoat, and I could not see any Marks of Violence upon his Breast or Back. I saw him about 10 Days before he died, he spit soetid, corrupted Matter, and was in an emaciated Condition; - I choose to leave it to the Surgeons to account for his Disorder.</p>
               <p>Mr Girle, Surgeon. Upon opening the Body there was an Adhesion of the Lungs on the Right-side, and there was corrupted Matter on the Lungs. I cannot tell what was the Occasion of his Death. - A Man may live a great while under such Habit of Body; but such an Accident may hasten his Death. They have Pains, and Coughs in the Beginning of all Adhesions. A violent Blow may affect the Lungs. I cannot say how long this Adhesion may be coming in a natural way, it may come suddenly upon a violent Inflammation; and supposing this Adhesion to be an old Disorder, this Usage might hasten his Death.</p>
               <p>Mr Nourse, Surgeon. I was desired to be at the opening of the Body, I saw no Marks of Violence on the Outside, in the Inside I found a Quantity of Matter in the Thorax, and the Lungs had contracted a Quantity of Matter, and there was a general Adhesion of the Lungs, which in diseased Bodies are very common. This Adhesion was, I believe, before this Scuffle, for if this Inflammation had been so great, as to occasion this Adhesion, his Complaint would have been much worse when the Inflammation was so violent, than afterwards; and his Complaint was not so great at first as afterwards; I believe that this Violence might hasten his Death. On the Right-side there was a Quantity of Matter, of a reddish Hue, I took more particular Notice of the Colour of the Matter, because I designed to make an Experiment. When I asked the Apothecary, whether he thought he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207140018"/> had ever spit Blood? he said, He believed he had. I asked him, Whether he was so curious, as to examine into the Matter, he called Blood? he said, He had not made Enquiry enough to satisfy himself. I do not think he spit any Blood at all; this Matter which is of a reddish Hue, is so much like Blood, that a Person may be deceived, and take it for Blood. I made an Inspection into all the other Bowels, and found them as they usually are, except the Liver, which had some Appearance of a Decay; which must have been coming some Time before. - Such a Blow as would have occasioned an Inflammation, must have been visible at first.</p>
               <p>Mr Polock, Surgeon. I examined this Body, I saw him about three or four Days before his Death, he complained of a Purging, there was no Appearance of any Violence, but there was an Inflammation in his Bowels.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that a Distemper that People have naturally without any external Blow?</p>
               <p>Polock. Yes, undoubtedly. If it was occasioned by a Blow, it must make a visible Appearance. - I was sent thither by Mr Clark; he said he did not know that he was hit in any other Place but the Face. He complained of being thrown over a Rail. He said he was not struck on the Breast, but only complained of a Soreness in his Back. - He did not say to me, that it was the Occasion of his Death, or that he should not be his own Man again.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard how this Man was used. Might not this occasion his Death?</p>
               <p>Polock. I cannot say that it would.</p>
               <p>Q. But might not this hasten his Death?</p>
               <p>Polock. I cannot say but it might.</p>

            , Master of the Plough Alehouse. I saw Mr Clark and this Gentleman come into the Town, and ask where they could get a Pot of Beer, they called for a Pot of Beer, and my Servant got it for them; they were sometimes in the House and sometimes at the Door. - The Gentlemen were talking about a Quarrel they had before; I saw no Blows at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who parted them?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I parted them. This Gentleman, Mr Price, and Cooke, had hold of each other by the Collar, when I parted them. - I did not see any Motion of the Hand to strike. - He was upon the Rail, but not the Rail of the Sign-Post.</p>
               <p>Couns. You look upon this only as a common Quarrel, don't you?</p>
               <p>Herbert. It was only a Quarrel: They were a little drunkish. - It looked to me as if they had been quarrelling. Price was uppermost, he was bloody, and must have had a Blow.</p>
