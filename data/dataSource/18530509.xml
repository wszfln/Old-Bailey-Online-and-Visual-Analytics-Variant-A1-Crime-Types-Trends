                  </hi>, Esq. I am a member of the Bar; I occupied chambers in King's Bench-walk in 1851. I had known the prisoner previously to that—I had known him down at Cambridge many years—I practise more there than I do in London—in April, 1851, I was induced to employ him as my clerk—I met him in Hungerford-market, and he told me he had received a fee for me—he was not at that time my clerk, he was Mr. Metcalfe's clerk alone—I had made no arrangement with him—I thanked him, and I forget whether I asked him, or he asked me, to continue to receive fees for me; but 1 told him if he would continue to receive the fees for me, he should have the clerk's fees as a remuneration for his services—that was about 16th April—it was a fee he had received from Trindall and Eyre—I told him in Hungerford-market that if he received fees for me, he was to make an entry of them on a piece of paper, and put it on my mantelshelf, so that I might know he had received it if I were not there—it was the fee in Trindall and Eyre's case that he had received, and I said, "Let this be the beginning of the matter, and make an entry when you get home on a paper, and put it on my mantelpiece, and when I come I will put my initials on it—I gave him the clerk's fee in Hungerford-market—I told him he was to account for what fees he received directly he received them—he was to give them to me directly he saw me, and if he did not see me, he was to write it down on the paper—I was professionally instructed in the case of the Queen and Whittaker and another, by Mr. Wontner, in the March Assizes in 1851; there was a fee due to me of three guineas fur a refresher and a consultation—I have never received the three guineas which Mr. Crawford says he paid to Scott on 28th April, 1851—I missed the prisoner from the chambers about that time, and I never saw him till about a month or six weeks before he was apprehended—I then saw him in a court of justice—I made inquiries for him, and I understood from his wife that he had gone abroad—my inquiries were not successful; I could not find the prisoner—I apprehended him I believe on 1st March—I had seen him two days before, that was in a railway carriage coming to London—I had made an effort to apprehend him on the Friday preceding, but I could not find a policeman—I apprehended him as soon as I possibly could.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090011"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you had chambers with Mr. Metcalfe before this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For several years—I found Scott there when I came back to chambers at the beginning of Easter Term—I used at that time to be up in town for a week, or nearly so—I should think I was up in town in Hilary Term; if Scott was there then I saw him—I never before engaged a clerk in Hungerford-market—I have no recollection of Mr. Metcalfe telling me that Scott was his clerk, and he would not allow him to be clerk to any one else—I will not swear he did not—I cannot recollect it; but when the arrange-ment took place between me and the prisoner, I stipulated that he was not in any way to neglect Mr. Metcalfe's business for me—the prisoner is not a Cambridge man, that I know of—I never took a meal with him—when I was taking wine, I very likely may have asked him to have a glass—I have given him food—he was acting as a clerk—I have two clerks at Cambridge, and one in London, Mr. Attersly—he is Mr. Charnock's clerk—I have chambers with him now—Mr. Metcalfe engaged Scott's son, and I paid part of his expenses—the first fee the prisoner received for me was Trindall and Eyre's—Scott's wife told me be had gone abroad, and she told me he had received the fee, and he would come down to settle it—I should think I saw his wife every day; she was the laundress—the prisoner has not dined with me over and over again—it is a hard thing to say that he has never breakfasted, or taken meals with me—if he were hungry, I would have given him a meal—to the best of my belief he has never taken meals with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you have not over and over again employed him in election matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has been employed by a committee of gentlemen, of whom I was one—I never employed him in any way but as a clerk for the registration of the borough—he was employed in the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> office in this way—he was very badly off, and I solicited employment for him, and he was employed to report the police cases—he never delivered me any brief as clerk to an attorney—on one occasion he delivered a copy of the depositions, but he was not acting as my clerk then—I always take an active part in elections—I did at the last election—I had to second one of the candidates—I saw the prisoner about a month or six weeks before I gave him in custody—I saw him in the county court at Cambridge—I was in a case there—a gentleman said, "There is Scott," but I was in my robes, and was engaged, and could not have him taken then—I did not say to the inspector that I had never been able to see him till I gave him in custody—I have not sent any one to him within this month—Thomas Pearce has been my clerk for many years at Cambridge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not Scott employed by you during the elections of 1843 and 1847? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not by me—I think he was probably employed by the com-mittee, of which I was one, as a check clerk—he has certainly not complained to me over and over again that he could not get his remuneration—I never gave any instructions to the police at Cambridge to take him—I do not know that he has been in Cambridge since September last—I came to town partly on account of the last election, and partly to apprehend him, because I saw him coming from Cambridge in a railway carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not sent your clerk, Pearce, to him several times to beg of him not to appear before the election committee in London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly and distinctly not, nor nothing of the kind—I know a person of the name of Sherman—I know one or two named Chapman—Sherman was a voter, and Mr. William Chapman was a voter there—I know a person named Brooks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell Brooks to convey this message to Scott, that if Sherman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090012"/>
               <p>and Chapman appeared before the election committee you would give him in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most assuredly not—I did not give him in custody about this election business, most assuredly not—it was over; I heard the decision come to on this election business—I did not go immediately and take Scott: about a couple of hours afterwards—I thought very likely it might be thought it was done from political motives, and I waited till it was over—I bad not a warrant to appear as a witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In reference to Sherman and Chapman, was not your name mixed up with them, and was it not alleged that you had been a party to bribing them to the amount of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Sherman came to me after the election, and said something about some money that somebody had promised him, and I told him to leave the house—I know Pratt—I was not charged with inducing him to vote by getting him a license from the Vice-Chancellor—he got a license a good while before—my belief is, it was a considerable time before—I told him I would apply to the Vice-Chancellor for a license—I believe he did vote—he was a publican—I know Pratt, and he is in Court here—I did not promise him a license, certainly not; he had two landlords—I did not canvass them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell Pratt that if he got a license the house would be worth 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think very likely the value of the house would be enhanced, but I do not know whether I did say so—I said that I would apply to the Vice-Chancellor, but on consideration I would not—he has got the license, but not by my interference—I am not aware that Pratt's was one of the houses that were opened for the election—I ordered him to open his house for three or four persons whom I employ, not about political purposes, but perfectly legal purposes—the amount of it was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received a notice to produce a letter written by Mr. Metcalfe; but I looked through several hundred letters, and could not find it—I had some conversation with Mr. Metcalfe—I do not recollect that I told him I should hold him responsible—I wrote to him—I thought he had done wrong in employing Scott at all in the chambers without consulting me—if I had introduced a clerk that had robbed Mr. Metcalfe I should have held myself responsible for it—I did not see Scott in the Committee of the House of Commons, or up in the gallery—I swear I did not—I know Thomas Butcher and William Baker—they have never been my guests, and they have not applied to me for money, certainly not; I had but a few hours to seek for the letter that Mr. Metcalfe sent me, and I could not find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that letter in answer to a letter that you wrote to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—the prisoner has never dined or breakfasted with me, or been received as a guest—there has never existed any intimacy but that between a master and a servant, certainly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you send any message to Scott by his son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think I may have told his son and his wife, probably, that I should send for a policeman if he did not come.</p>

I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was not the whole of the money I owed him then; I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 4th March, which settled up to 26th Feb.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his receipt, which I took for those two sums; I saw him write it—I paid all these sums into his hands, and saw him write the receipts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Aldenham-terrace, St. Pancras, and No. 39, Goswell-road. The prisoner managed my business in Goswell-road, for which I paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, besides his lodging and coals—it was my practice each week to send a quantity of flour for him to convert into bread, and on the Friday in each week it was his duty to account to me, on which occasions he sometimes produced a book, and sometimes a memorandum; and I, in his presence, copied the statements which he made to me into my book—his signature is to the accounts for the weeks ending 18th Feb. and 25th Feb., but not to that of 4th March, because he was given into custody on that night—he saw me make the entries from his memorandums—in his account on 18th Feb. I find 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. owing from a customer named Harriss, for bread—the account is made out in this way: he gives me credit for twenty-six sacks of flour, making 2,392 loaves, which come to 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which sum he accounts for as follows, "39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. expenses, and customers 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is owing from the customers who are mentioned on the other half-sheet, among whom here is "Harriss, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that means that bread to that amount had been sold to Harriss during that week on credit—I find that sum included in the total, which is afterwards brought over to the other side, and a balance struck as credit—this statement is confined to one week's account—the prisoner did not account to me for any sum received from Harriss—this account for the week ending 25th Feb. is made out in the same way, and Harriss is credited with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received no cash as paid from Harriss that week; the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is included</p>

                  </hi>. In Jan. last, I was cook in the service of Mr. Hart, of Gloucester-place, Hyde-park. The prisoner was housemaid there—she had been two months in the service to the very day—Mr. Hart has left England—we had a nursery maid, named Frances M'Clowry, and a ladies' maid, named Harriet Mitchell—Mr. Hart is a widower, but his mother lived with him—the nursery maid and ladies' maid have left England for Australia—on Thursday, 27th Jan., the prisoner did not come down to dinner; I was not in the house at the time, but I was told so—after dinner, I went of to her room, about half past 2 or a quarter to 3 o'clock—Dr. Galindo went up with me—he had been sent for; I met him at the door when I came home—I found the prisoner lying on the bed—Harriet Mitchell, the ladies' maid, was in the room at the time, sitting on a stool by the fire—she had a child in her lap; it was alive—she showed me the child, and showed me a wound in the child's throat—it was bleeding—I do not think I spoke to the prisoner then; she was very much excited, and in a great deal of pain—I went down and got her some gruel or a cup of tea about an hour afterwards—I took it up to her—I did not then take the child in my arms; I took it in my arms in the evening—I asked the prisoner why she deceived us, meaning why she had not told us that she was in the family way (she had not told me)—she said, "Oh, Bruford! I knew not what I was doing; I meant to hare thrown the child into the Serpentine, and myself too"—she was very much excited at the time—nothing more passed then—I remained with her about an hour—I went up to her afterwards when the monthly nurse came, but I had no other conversation with her that evening—the next day, Friday, the nursery maid showed me a pair of scissors; I observed that they were stained with blood—I had undressed the prisoner on the Thursday as she lay on the bed; she had all her things on—Dr. Galindo was present at the time—her clothes were very much stained with blood, and there was blood about the room—she was removed to the workhouse on the following Monday evening with the child—the monthly nurse attended her during the time she remained at Mr. Hart's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon; I formerly lived in Conduit-street, Westbourne-terrace. On 27th Jan., I was called to Mr. Hart's, and saw the prisoner there lying on the bed in her room—she was not undressed, to the best of my recollection—I ascertained by examining her that she had recently been delivered of a child—I took the after-birth from her—the umbilical cord seemed as if it had been cut; about four inches of it was left</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090028"/>
               <p>attached to the child—I found the child in the room; it was a newly born child—I observed a wound in the front of the neck, about three inches long—it was not a clean cut wound, but jagged, serrated—I think it could have been done by a pair of scissors, in the usual mode of applying scissors when you want to cut anything—I do not think it would have made a clean cut, not on cartilaginous matter like that—the windpipe was cut transversely; the fore part of it only was cut—it appeared to be a full grown child; it was a boy—the prisoner was in a fainting state—I continued to attend her and the child until the following Monday—I saw her two <hi rend="italic">or</hi> three times a day—I dressed the child's wound, and did what was necessary with respect to that—she was removed to the workhouse on the Monday, and the child with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you say the child was a full grown child, I suppose you do not mean it had gone the entire nine months: it might be a fortnight or three weeks, more or less? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be, because some children are larger and some smaller—I took it to be a nine months' child; it might be eight months and a half—I have not a very extensive practice in midwifery—I know that labour constantly comes on suddenly, very often in sleep—a fall down stairs would be likely to accelerate the birth—I should say, from the appearance of the wound, it must have been produced by cutting—there is no doubt that a woman suddenly taken with the pains of labour would be very much embarrassed, and would have great difficulty in delivering herself—in a natural delivery, the head is usually first presented—the disease called milk fever does not come on at the time of the birth, generally two or three days afterwards—it may be preceded by a great deal of nervous irritation—I found no appearance of any injury about the prisoner's person—it occasionally happens in deliveries, that the umbilical cord crosses the neck; the applica tion of the finger would relieve it—that is what I should do; a woman, to relieve herself, might have recourse to an instrument—it is not impossible that in doing so the throat might be cut, although the cord was cut four inches from the navel; the child might have been bent on itself.</p>

               <p>and tie the red one up in it—after the two Bucklands had received the hand-kerchief, they went out, taking it with them, saying to Wilder they should see him to-morrow night; it was Aaron said that, and Wilder said, "Come about the same time"—I saw some oats drop out of the handkerchief on the table and on the ground.</p>

               <p>pany with Emmott—in a few minutes Bradley came from the bar of the little shop, and was going towards the door—I stopped him—the meat was then in the basket in the bar—Emmott was in the bar, and the basket was down by his side as he was serving in the bar, and Bradley came out of the bar and was going towards the door—when I entered the coffee-shop I called for a cup of coffee—it was perhaps four or five minutes after my going in till I stopped Bradley—(there were two other officers with me, in plain clothes)—I told Bradley we belonged to the police, and I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing some meat from the shop of Mr. Calcutt—his reply was, "I have not stolen any meat, I bought some pieces of meat"—I asked him how much—he said 2 lbs. and a quarter, at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb.—Emmott was close by, and I addressed myself to him, and said, "You must consider yourself in custody for receiving this meat, knowing it to be stolen"—Emmott's reply was, "I know nothing of it; this young man has been a lodger of mine for about three weeks, and he having no employ, I gave him a sovereign to go to market to buy some meat; I am not to know where he buys it; I thought he went to Newgate-market"—Emmott's house is between 200 and 300 yards from Mr. Calcutt's—Bradley was in Mr. Calcutt's shop about three minutes—when Emmott told me what he did, I said, "There is some pork here"—that was a guess of mine—he said, "No, there is not; here is all there was, and you can take it"—I took possession of the basket, and afterwards weighed the meat; it contained 4 1/2 lbs. of beef, a small piece of mutton, and a marrow-bone, cut in two—I then told Emmott that I should search his place—he became very violent, and rushed towards the door of the staircase—I there secured him, and conveyed him and Bradley to the station-house—Bradley went quietly—the stairs were at the farther end of the shop—they lead to a cellar, and also up stairs—another officer found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Bradley, and I found eight sovereigns and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Emmott—I then went to Mr. Calcutt's, and on seeing Smith there, I said to him, "I am a sergeant of police; I shall take you into custody on a charge of stealing some meat, the property of your employer, this morning"—he said, "I have not stolen any meat, I have sold some pieces"—I asked him how much; he said 4lbs. and a quarter, at 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb.—at that moment Mr. Calcutt came in the shop, and I related the cir cumstance that had taken place to Mr. Calcutt—Smith said to Mr. Calcutt he had not stolen any meat; he bad sold 4 lbs. and a quarter to a young man, at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb., and a marrow-bone—I did not hear him say what be received for the marrow-bone—I then took Smith into custody, and returned with another officer to Emmott's house—on searching the cellar, Emmott's wife was stand-ing in a certain position—I requested her to move, and on her doing so, I opened a little door of a dust-hole under the staircase, and in the dust I found four legs of mutton and two shoulders, and one shoulder was hanging up in the cellar—I showed the whole of them to Mr. Calcutt—there was one with a little bit of wool on the shank of it—I produce the shank here to-day—I searched Smith, and found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and a key, on his person—I then went to his box up stairs, at his master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 2, Little Queen-street, Westminister; I am a butcher. Smith was in my service, if he sold meat he was to take the money for it—he had no authority to sell meat on credit, without my permission—when he received money for meat, it was his duty to place the money in a bowl on the ledge in the shop—on the afternoon of 4th April, I left my shop about half past 4 o'clock—before I left I counted the number of legs and shoulders of mutton in the shop—I had thirty-seven shoulders and fifty-four legs—before I left, I made a communication to my wife—I came home about 10 minutes before 10 o'clock; counted the legs and shoulders of mutton, and missed one leg and one shoulder—Smith was then gone home—I have seen this shank with wool on it—Quinnear showed me at Bow-street a shoulder of mutton with this on it—I think I have no hesitation in identifying it as one I left amongst the shoulders when I went out—I left one with the shank about half jointed off and the black wool on it, and I missed that particularly—I compared that which was shown to me with what I had left, and it corresponded—I have no hesitation in saying, that that enables me to swear it was my meat—we sell them at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—Smith certainly would have no authority to sell them at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know Emmott at all as a customer—I have seen the beef that was in the basket, the lowest price of that would be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I had given information at the station before I went out—I went to market on the morning of 5th April, about a quarter before 6 o'clock, and returned 10 minutes before 8 o'clock, and found Smith in custody of Quinnear—Quinnear said, "I have taken your servant in custody on a charge of robbing you of some meat;" some beef, "I think it was"—Smith said, "I have not robbed you, I sold it at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—it weighed four pounds and a quarter, and I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—the value of it would be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the marrow bone 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of No. 15, Ecclestone-place, Pimlico. On Sunday, 2nd May, I was returning home about half-past 12 o'clock at night—I passed Ecclestone-mews, and John Campbell came across to me, and said, "You b—r, I have been waiting for you"—I had never spoken to him before, and said, "My good fellow, what are you waiting for me for?"—he made a strike at me, and hit me, and I made a strike at him, and hit him again—no more blows passed between us; he ran to his brother's door, almost opposite, I do not know the number—he did not go into the house; he called his brother Bernard, and the other prisoner came out of the house, and called out to his brother, "Your knife!" and I saw John pull a knife out of his right hand trowsers pocket, and open it—I was then about twelve yards from them, and Thomas Wadlow was with me; he is a fellow lodger of mine, who came running down stairs—I made to the door of my own house, but it was fastened; I opened it with the string, and as I was going in received a stab in my arm—it was John Campbell who gave it to me—I did not see him do it, but he was close to me—I did not see the other prisoner at that time—John followed me into the passage, <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> the knife into my left cheek, and left it there—Wadlow had run into the house before me, and got on to the stairs—I ran up the stairs, and saw Ann Highams in the passage—I bled very much, fainted, and was taken into my own room; a surgeon was sent for—I did not see Bernard Campbell while I was in the passage; I did not see him after I heard him use the words, but I am certain that he is the man that came out of the house with the other prisoner.</p>

I never saw the prisoners until this night, when I was in my room, and about twenty minutes past 12 o'clock heard a scuffle, went to the window, and saw John Campbell in the attitude of fighting Croxford in the road right opposite—I saw John Campbell strike Croxford one blow, and Croxford returned him a heavier one, which caused him to reel two yards or two yards and a half—while he was reeling I heard a voice at the lamp-post say, "Your knife!"—I do not know who it was said that, but I believe it was not Bernard Campbell; it was a bigger and stouter man—John then put his hand into his right band trowsers pocket, drew his knife, and opened it—I then called out, "Croxford, run! he has got a knife;" and he ran to the door of our house—John ran after him, and the person at the lamp post, who had called out, "Your knife!" also ran towards the door, after Croxford—I could not see whether John got into the house—I called loudly, and a person came across the road—I went to my room door, opened it, and saw Croxford on the first floor landing, with a knife in his face; the handle was bent apparently by the stab—he did not bleed till be drew the knife out, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it on the floor, and said, "I am stabbed;" he then bled a great deal—I got him to bed, and afterwards saw a wound in his arm.</p>

It was No. 15, but the numbers have been altered—on this Sunday night, about half-past 12 o'clock, I was in my bedroom, which is in front of the house; I looked out of the window, and saw Croxford coming along Ecclestone-place, and John Campbell coming from Ecclestone-street; he was about a dozen yards from Croxford when I first saw him; I saw them conversing together, but could not hear what they said—I went down stairs, went into the street, and saw them about four yards from No. 50—John Campbell struck Croxford, who returned the blow—there was nobody else in the street then—after the second blow, John Campbell said, "Stop a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>;" and Croxford said, "I shan't run away, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> will be as good as his master"—John Campbell then went over to his own house, and called out, "<hi rend="italic">Barney!</hi>"—(I had known him by sight for about a week, and knew where he lived, and the other prisoner also; they live about twenty yards from where Croxford and I live)—I saw a man come to the door, who I believe to be Bernard; he came out of the house, and called out, "Your knife! use your knife!"—he ran across the road, and followed John, who then had a knife in his hand, which I had not seen before I heard these words—I saw him take it from his right hand pocket, and open it—they went up to the door of the house where I live, and I and Croxford rushed into the passage together—I got into the passage first; John was outside; I did not see him or Bernard come into the passage; I ran up stairs—before I got up, Croxford overtook me; and when he got to the top of the stairs, he was bleeding very much from a wound in the cheek—I did not see the knife in his cheek—I went for a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I was on duty in Chester-square, and heard a disturbance towards Ecclestone-place—I went there, to No. 36, which is sixty or seventy yards from the door of No. 50—another constable was with me—I found the outer door fastened; after knocking twice, and getting no answer, we broke the door open, got into the passage, and saw a light in the back parlour, the door of which was then open, but it was shut immediately—I knocked, and the first thing I heard was some one saying, "Poker and tongs!"—I had not said who I was then—I knocked again, and some one said, "Who is there?" I said it was the police; we eventually broke in, and found the two prisoners, John with his trowsers on and the tongs in his hand, and Bernard in his drawers and stockings, with a poker in his hand—Bernard struck me on my hat—I was in my uniform; I got the poker from him, and told them that there had been a man stabbed outside, in Ecclestone-place, and that the two men were seen to go into that house—they both said they knew nothing about it, and that it must be a man named Lucas, who had made his escape at the staircase window at the rear of the house—I found several spots of blood on the right hand side of John's trowsers, the marks were wet, I have no doubt that it was blood—I said he must be the man; he said he knew nothing about it, and I took him into custody.</p>

I was sent for to No. 50, Ecclestone-place, and found Croxford sitting on a bed, with a wound on his left cheek in front of the ear, it was bleeding—he seemed faint from loss of blood—the wound was about an inch long, and about three quarters of an inch deep; the edge was smooth, but it was of irregular depth, I suppose it was caused by a thrust—a knife of this kind would be likely to make such a wound—I examined his arm, and found a wound by the elbow—neither of the wounds were of a dangerous nature—(<hi rend="italic">John Campbell's statement was here read, as follows</hi>: "I was coming along Ecclestone-place by myself, about 20 minutes past 12 o'clock, and met Croxford, we spoke together, and this man and Wadlow and an old man all came running to me together—I called my brother Bernard, and he did not come; after that I used the knife, and the policeman came and took me—the officer <hi rend="italic">bursted</hi> open the door without speaking, and we did not know who was there when he came to the parlour door.

On the morning of Friday, 15th April, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I received a communication from Mr. Newell, and in consequence of a request contained in that communication, I went to the house of Jackson, in Old-street, having first called at Mr. Pask's—his boy accompanied me to Jackson's, and introduced me with words similar to these: "If you please Mr. Jackson, this is the gentleman master thinks will buy your paper—Jackson replied, "It is disposed of"—I said I was sorry for it, and could he tell me the name of the party who had bought it, as I thought it would suit me at the price, and I thought I could afford to advance on the price—he said he could not, as there had been some demur about the price last evening; the party had been there that morning and had it away, and he had left the shop a few minutes before I entered it—I also asked him if he had any more goods of the same kind to offer—he said he had not at the present time; if I left him my address he would let me know—I gave him one of my business cards—I asked him who it was that offered it—he said it was a party that was accustomed to call there—I asked the name of the person who offered it—he did not readily reply to that—he hesitated, and I asked him again, and he said his name was Davis—I asked him if he could give me the address of the party—he said he could not; it was somewhere in the Black friars-road—I then left the shop, and communicated with Mr. Newell and the police, who were outside—I related what had transpired.</p>

On Friday, 15th April, from information, I proceeded, about 12 o'clock at noon, to Jackson's premises, at No. 34, Old-street, for the purpose of watching the premises—about a quarter before 1 o'clock I saw a pony and cart stop opposite Jackson's shop—there was a man of the name of Field with it—when it stopped opposite Jackson's, Field got out of the cart, let the tail-board down, and he went into Jackson's shop—he came out again with a canvas bag with something in it, which he placed in the cart—he then, with the assistance of Jackson, placed a quantity of paper in the cart—the paper came out of Jackson's shop—after they had done that Jackson got up in the cart with Field, and they went away—after they had gone a short distance I lost sight of the cart for a few moments, and when I got sight of it again a man named Archer was in the cart—Field and Archer were afterwards taken into custody, and discharged—Field's name and address were on the cart—the cart went on from Old-street, down Bunhill-row, into Chiswell-street—I followed it, and got further assistance—I called to the driver to stop, which he did, and pulled up—I said, "What have you got in here?"—one of them said, "Oh, you can see"—Field was driving it—Jackson then got out of the cart—I examined it, and found it contained twenty reams of paper, all in blue wrappers—this is a part of it—when I found the paper, I told the three persons I should take them into custody for having this paper in their possession, believing it to be stolen—Jackson said, "Oh, very well"—he was taken by a metropolitan policeman, and I took the other two in the cart—there was an examination the following day before the Lord</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Marsh, and live at No. 9, Wellington street, Blackfriars-road. The prisoner Izard lodged in my house in the first-floor back room—I was at home on Wednesday, 13th April—I was looking out at the window, and saw a box come in a truck—Izard and another man were with it—they brought a box out of the truck, and put it on my mat against the parlour door—it appeared very heavy—Izard worked it round on the side, and the two carried it up stairs—I afterwards saw a box produced at the Mansion House very similar to that one—on the following Friday Izard paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent, which he would have owed me on the Saturday—I said to him on the Friday, "If you please, I want my room to put my boys there"—(I did not go into the room, I went to the door)—he said, "When do you want the room?—I said, "As quickly as you can possibly let me have it"—he said, "Make up the rent-book, and send it me up"—I made it up, and, instead of sending it up, I carried it up, and I saw in the room a box like the one brought in from the truck on the 13th—in the latter part of that same day I heard a noise in Izard's room—that was after the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid—it was a noise something like breaking-up wood—I did not see the box after that—I do not think I saw Izard and anybody else go out after I heard the noise; but on the Friday morning, before he gave me the money, I saw some parcels go out—Izard and one that he called his brother took them out—that was before the breaking of the wood—my daughter went in the yard in the morning, and she brought me two nails—I thought they were very funny nails—I put them in my pocket, and gave them to the officer—these are the very nails (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—on the morning after the removal of the box from the truck, I was looking at my window, and saw a gentleman go along; he looked hard at my window—I opened the door, and he said, "Is Mr. Izard at home?"—I said "Yes," and he went up stairs—he had whiskers round his chin, and dark hair and dark eyes—the prisoner Jackson has the appearance of him, but the whiskers are off now—he had a kind of black and white coat on—I called it snail-back—it was not a very rough coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a banker, residing in Leadenhall-street. I know the prisoner, I recollect his calling on me about the 20th or 22nd Dec.—he called to inquire whether we could discount some foreign bills of first class, drawn on bankers—I told him the first requirement was to inquire about the parties, and after a knowledge of the bills being on respectable persons we would not object—he left this bill with me to make inquiries about it—he called again in perhaps three or four days afterwards, but in the mean time we had not got sufficient knowledge of the parties; he came two or three times between his first call, and 1st Jan., during which time we had made inquiries—he said he was very much pressed for money; that all his money was run oat, and he wanted at least 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his private use on account of the bill——he drew a check on my bank, and I paid him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns, in part payment of the bill—we had reason to believe the bill was not in order, and on 5th Jan. I wrote him this note, "Sir, your bill has been returned from Paris; please to call at our bank."—the prisoner spoke broken English—before he came to me I sent to him again, about the 14th or 15th Jan., but I had heard from him—he sent two or three messengers for the balance of the bill—I told them that he must come himself; and on the 15th Jan. I sent a clerk of mine to desire him to call, and I received from him this answer, written in French, which, has no date to it—I can swear I received it about the 15th Jan.—"Sir, I have only received this instant, your card; I regret that indisposition retains me from coming to you; I shall be glad if you will inform me whether you are satisfied with the inquiriesyouhave made, and whether you will be satisfied with a friend calling on my account, that I may authorise somebody to receive for me to avoid myself going out; should, however, my presence be indispensable, I will do my possible to come to you"—I wrote to him again on the 17th—"Sir, the inquiries about Mr. Lamache are satisfactory, but the bill of exchange is not yet negotiated;" the object of my writing was to get him to come—I meant that the bill was not gone out of my possession; Mr. Lamache is a man in good circumstances, and it would have been satisfactory if the bill was not a forgery—the prisoner did not reply to this letter; after the 17th the first that I heard about him afterwards was on the 18th Feb., when he was arrested by Monteaux, the bankers, in Cornhill.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No; 13, Bevis-marks. The prisoner was in my service—there was another servant named Margaret Floyd—I had missed money from the cash box since November last—in consequence of that I changed my lock, and bad a Chubb's patent and two keys—one key I kept myself, and one I gave to my wife—on April 3rd I deposited some notes, half-checks, and four half-sovereigns, which I marked, in the cash box, and locked it—I put it into the parlour cupboard, where it was usually kept—on Monday morning, 4th April, I went to the box—I missed the whole four half-sovereigns—I did not miss anything besides—on the 7th, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning, I was called up by Margaret Floyd—she showed me a dirty rag—on the receipt of that, I felt in one corner, and found a small key; it was the old key that I had lost—there were four sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in the dirty rag—one of those half-sovereigns was the one I had marked—this is the piece of rag, and this is the half-sovereign—the mark is on the head—I crossed it—this is the very half-sovereign I marked, and this is the old key—when the constable came to my house, he called me to go with him into the prisoner's room, and opened her box; and there we found several things—I had before missed out of the cash box sovereigns and Bank-notes—I found an umbrella at the bottom of the box—it was my own—I found a crochet collar—Mrs. Green can speak to that—one pair of gloves is mine—I can speak to the earrings—they are silver—I found two handkerchiefs marked with Mrs. Green's signature, and two knives—I would not swear to the knives, but they were taken from the warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker; I reside and carry on business at No. 25, Westmoreland-place, City-road. In the month of November last I was favoured by a visit from the prisoner for the purpose of taking apartments in my house—he said he came from Dorking—he said, "You may perceive my vision is bad; I have come to remain in London for four or five months under Mr. Alexander"—he said he had property at Dorking and Leatherhead, and elsewhere over the water; Ireland, in fact—he took my apartments—it was about three weeks before any conversation took place between us about money matters—that would be in December—there was a letter came to the house, and he told a daughter of mine to open it—there was a promissory note in it—he showed me the letter and the promissory note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the promissory note—he said it was all right, it came from one of his tenants at Leatherhead—he said he should be short of money till the turn of Christmas, till he received his rents—he asked me whether I could let him have the money for the promissory note—he had before that shown me some papers or documents; I think it was two or three days after he came to my house—the next day after he came to my house he asked me to write a letter to his agent, Mr. Rickerby, of Stamford-street—I wrote the letter, and the next day a person came, representing himself to be the clerk to his agent, and the prisoner said, "What is the reason Mr. Rickerby did not come?"—that was addressing the young man, who made answer, "He is very unwell, sir, but he will wait upon you in a day or two"—the prisoner then said, "Tell him to let me have all my title deeds; send my title deeds"—nothing else passed between the prisoner and this person in my presence at that moment—I saw that person again the next day—he brought the title deeds—I was present—he handed them to the prisoner—they were sealed parchments, with the name of "C. N. Rattan, Esq." upon them—he represented that those were the title deeds of his property, and he had sent for them for my satisfaction—I did not think really a blind man capable of acting so—I did not take the trouble to look at the contents; I merely looked at the outside, and said, "I have no reason to doubt"—it was after this that he presented the bill—this was the introduction to the bill transaction—the bill was drawn on the 4th, and it came on the 6th—he asked me for the money, and I told him I had not sufficient money in the house, but that I was going out, and I would see what I could do—I parted with the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upon the faith of his representation of being a man of property, that those title deeds represented property, and that the bill was drawn by one of his tenants—if it had not been for that representation I</p>

               <p>should not have advanced him money on the bill alone—soon after this occurrence a dinner was ordered by the prisoner—he said the 27th was his birthday, and it was proposed there should be a party—the dinner was not to his tenants—he said he had a nephew, whom he had articled to a solicitor, and that he was coming to dine with him—the dinner was prepared, greatly at my expense—the guests were principally my own friends—he made friends with them, and invited them—my friends came, but his did not—after dinner he made some excuse to go out—he was very much annoyed at his friends not coming—he asked my wife how the wine was, whether it was not almost out—she said, quite, but there was no necessity for any more, we had plenty—he said, "Oh, leave that to me," and almost instantly made his way out of the room, called a little boy of mine to go out with him, and went out—he never came back—he left me and my friends enjoying wine at my own expense.</p>

I had tin's bill to get discounted—I did not have the bill in my possession two hours—you certainly asked me for the money—I gave you the money on the 22nd—the gentleman who discounted it was a friend of mine—I asked him to oblige me with the money for it—it was not on your account; he would not have done it for you—I took it out of the house to serve you—I have paid the bill—when I returned with the money to hand over to you, Emma was in the kitchen—nothing to my recollection transpired on that occasion respecting the day on which my elder son's birthday came—you asked me to purchase a dozen stamped envelopes for you—I also deducted two half-crowns for getting the bill <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, for discount—I gave you the rest of the money—I received two guineas from you for two split rings to a chain, and a set of studs—I was present when my wife came into the kitchen, and received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the Christmas eve following, on Friday, I did not take a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note out of your pocket—I will swear I never had it—I had not been out to market the following day, Christmas day—I was at my business—I did not go to Mr. Blower's to purchase a piece of meat—I did not whisper in your ear, and tell you J had no money to pay Mr. Blower, and you did not give me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—f did not pay Mr. Blower with a 5J.-note—I never had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note in my hand—I did not receive out of your hands on Christmas eve one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes I gave you—they were all my friends who were at the dinner—I dare say they were twenty-two in number—I was present at the time Mr. Robinson, the wine merchant, came in—I know nothing of my son's birthday," which was on 3rd Jan., being kept at your expense, on the 27th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, and live at No. 68 1/2, Augustus-street, Regent's-park. The deceased, Eliza Lea, was my eldest daughter—she was in her twenty-sixth year—I know the prisoner well—he had lived with my daughter between five and six years—during that time they had separated four times—they had been separated the last time between five and six months before her death—on Sunday, 30th Jan. last, she came to my house as usual to dinner—the last time I saw her alive was at half-past 7 o'clock on Monday morning, the 31st—she slept at my house on Sunday night; it being a wet night I did not wish her to go home—she resided in Townsend-buildings, Portland-town; that is near St. John's-wood, on the other side of the Regent's-park—I went out to my work at 6 o'clock on Monday morning; but I came home at half-past 7 o'clock, to tell my wife that I should not be home to breakfast, and I then left my daughter at home,</p>

               <p>well, happy and comfortable—I saw her body at half-past 11 o'clock that night at the Regalia Tavern, in Augustus-street, about 150 yards from my house—the body was naked, wrapped up in blankets—her clothes were lying on the table—they were drenched with water—I know the Victoria public house, and the towing path which runs at the back of the Regalia—a person coming from the Victoria to the Regalia would come over the railway bridge into Augustus-street, and a few yards further is the Regalia Tavern—the towing path is in the direct road to my house, down a little passage—a person would not go down there without turning down on purpose—I expected my daughter home that night, and sat up for her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the deceased—she was at my house on the Sunday before her death—she did not live with me, but at Portland-town—she supported herself by going out to work, ironing—she came to spend the day with me on Sunday—on the Monday morning I gave her a half-sovereign, to go to Tottenham-court-road, and get some merino out of pledge—it was intended for some dresses for two of my children—She was also to buy some lining, some buttons, and a reel of cotton—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some merino and other things produced by the officer</hi>)—this is what I ordered her to take out of pawn, and these are the things she was to get—I did not see the lining and other things until after her death—this is the merino I sent her for—it was in pawn for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I allowed her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the lining and trimming, and if it cost more she was to pay it—there was the interest on the merino to pay; I do not exactly know how much that would be—it had been in pawn about eleven months—she would have about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the half-sovereign—I knew of her living with the prisoner for some years—the last time they separated was about five months before her death—she was usually in good spirits, and continued so after the separation—she was very happy when I sent her out; that was about half-past 9 o'clock on Monday morning—she said as she went out, "Mother, I shall be back in half an hour, pro vided I am not kept at the shop, or an hour at the outside"—she never returned, and I never saw her alive afterwards—I was in great fear and great trouble for fear the prisoner had met her—she was occasionally addicted to drink, by following this man—she was not in the habit of getting tipsy; she used to take a little when she was in company—I had not seen her tipsy lately before her death—she was in very good health in general—she was rather hysterical if she was a little upset—I did not observe anything at all different from her usual manner on the Monday morning when she went out; she was as happy, indeed more happy than I have been since her death.</p>

In Jan. last I lodged in Pratt-street, Camden-town—I know the prisoner—he was a fellow workman of my husband's, as a mason's labourer—I knew the deceased while she was living with the prisoner—on Monday, 31st Jan., I met the deceased in the Hampstead-road, about a quarter to 11 o'clock in the morning—she was alone—she was going towards Camden-town—she had a brown paper parcel with her—I saw it opened, and she showed me the things that were in it—these produced are the things, I know them again—in the course of conversation the deceased made some inquiry about the prisoner, in consequence of which I accompanied her to Kensington—the prisoner was not there—in consequence of what was told us, we came back to Margaret-street, Oxford-street, and found the prisoner working there, at a church that is being built—it was about 20 minutes past 5 o'clock when we got back to Margaret-street—the men were then leaving off work—the prisoner there joined our company—he had on a white flannel jacket and a pair of cord trousers—he had a basket and a tin bottle (a <hi rend="italic">basket and tin bottle were here produced</hi>)—it was a basket like this—I cannot say this is the one; and it was such a tin bottle as this—we had a pot of beer together, in the neighbourhood of the building, before we started—it came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the deceased paid for it—when we first met the prisoner, the deceased asked him what he was going to stand—he said he could not stand anything, for he had got no money—while we were in the public house drinking the beer, the prisoner told her that he was married—she said she would not believe it—he said, "I am, so help me God"—she said she would not believe it unless she saw the certificate—he said he hoped she would not come to trouble him—nothing more passed upon that subject—we then all three came away, towards Camden-town—we stopped at a public house at the corner of the New-road, and we had a pot of beer there—she paid for it—we then came on to Camden-town together—we went to the Southampton Arms, and had a quartern of gin, that is, three glasses; we</p>

               <p>it was too dark to fee anybody in the water; we could not fee far into the canal—Mr. Woolfe said, "I will go and fetch a light," and he went for one—the man that went down with us followed him up, as I thought, to assist him in getting the light and a rope—I stayed by the canal—while Mr. Woolfe was away I heard the last sounds, merely two splashes, and then I heard no more—Mr. Woolfe returned with a light and a rope, he bad been detained about two minutes—the man in the flannel jacket did not come back at all; I saw no more of him—directly I missed him, something occurred to me, and I ran after him—I did not find him—when I got to the top of the passage, I turned to the right, and proceeded towards Cumberland market; I went about half way down the street—I met a policeman on the opposite side of the way, and I called to him, and asked him if he had seen a man of that description—it was the policeman 144; I met him about half-way down Augustus-street, opposite Lea's wharf—I then returned back to the canal with the policeman—the body of a woman was got out of the water, she was quite dead—she was earned into the tap room of the Regalia, and a surgeon was sent for; he tried every means of restoring her, but she was quite dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the end of the place where you heard the splashing, does the canal go deep at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know; it is a narrow part, and the barges have to pass that way; I should say it does—if a person were to fall, or go off the towing-path, I should say they would get into deep water; none of the lads in the neighbourhood dare to go in there.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what width if the canal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know exactly, I should say from thirty to forty feet—the body was found nearer the other side—it was an extremely foggy night—when I first went down, it might have been in consequence of coming from a light room, but I certainly could not see more than a foot or two into the water—there is a garden at the back of the Regalia; the bottom of it abuts on the towing-path—I was about one-third from the house—I had to go through two doors before I got out; I had to push one and draw the other to me, and then I was within ten feet of the top of the passage—there is a lamp at the door of the Regalia, but I do not think it was alight that night; there was something the matter with the gas—there was no light at the top of the passage—the passage is about fifteen feet wide at the top, it is narrow as you go down—it is a horse way, it runs slightly downwards, it is not level—there is a large gate to it, it is always left open; the police ought to have the key, I believe, in the middle of the night, as sometimes barge horses come up there—the Regalia is on one side of the passage, and a dead wall</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Regalia Tavern, in Augustus-street. I recollect on the night of 31st Jan., Mr. Wilson calling my attention to something out of doors—I left the house that moment and followed him—there is a passage at the side of my house which runs down to the side of the canal—at the top of that passage, at the street end, there is a gate across; it is kept half open, one half is closed and the other open—just outside there we met a man, four or five feet inside—I observed that he was dressed in white clothing, something like flannel, or moleskin, or corduroy; it was a light dress, what it was I cannot say, I did not observe the texture of it—he had a cap on his head; I could not exactly distinguish the colour of it, it looked light, the same as his clothing—it was exactly such a man as the prisoner in height and appearance—I am not able to say further; I did not notice him sufficiently—as I ran I rather headed Wilson, and I ran upon this man—I said, "Hallo, what is the matter?" he made an answer, I am not quite positive what it was, it was either "I think there is a woman in the water," or, "I think somebody has thrown herself in the water;" and I in answer said, "Let us go and see if we cannot assist her;" I ran forward, leaving them to follow me down, which they did to the water's edge—I was first at the water's edge—Mr. Wilson and the man came down immediately behind me—I heard a stifling or gurgling, like a choking in the water—I could see nothing—I could hardly distinguish the water from the land—there was a good deal of fog on the water—I called out "Are you afloat? can you speak?" and receiving no answer—I said, "Hold hard, I will run and get a light"—I went away directly, leaving Mr. Wilson and the man at the water's edge—I ran in doors and got a candle and a rope, which I had handy, and returned I should think in two or three minutes—I then saw Wilson alone—I said something to him, and upon that he ran up the passage—I afterwards ran up the passage into Augustus-street—at that tine there was no sound proceeding from the person in the water—all was still when I returned with the rope and the candle—the policeman got the body out, and it was taken into my house—I have no doubt she was quite dead.</p>

               <p>—I got information from Mr. Norris, the clerk of the works, and went to Eccleston-buildings, High-street, Marylebone, near the police court—I knocked at the door, and inquired for Mackett—the prisoner came out—I was in plain clothes—he walked with me—after we had gone some distance together, I said to him, "I am a police officer, and I want to askyoua question or two; you can answer or not, as you think fit"—I said, "I believe you were in company of a woman, named Lea, last night?" he said, "I was"—I said, "Where did you leave her?" he said, "At a friend's house, in Pratt-street, Camden-town; where is she now?"—I said, "I believe she is in St. Pancras Workhouse; she was found in the Regent's-canal, at the back of the Regalia last night"—he said, "Is she dead?"—I said, "She is; and I shall take you into custody upon suspicion of having caused her death by throwing her into the water"—he immediately dropped his head upon his bosom—I took him by the sleeve, and walked, I should think, about 200 yards; neither of us spoke—he then shook himself up, and said, "I shall be able to clear myself;" I then took him to the station house—before we got there, I said to him, "Was that your wife that answered the door when I knocked?" he said, "Yes, it was; I was married last Sunday week"—I left him at the station at about half past 1 o'clock; it was about 1 o'clock when I went to the house in Eccleston-buildings—I afterwards went back to that house, and saw the woman who had opened the door, to me when I first went—I told her what I came for—I asked for a parcel; I got it some time afterwards, at the house—it was the merino that I have produced to-day—I was at the house more than half an hour on the second occasion before it was produced; the parcel was not in the house at the time I went there—an elderly woman went out first, and after she had been gone some considerable time, the other person went out and saw her coming up North-street I think—she ran and met her, took the cloak and bonnet from the old woman, and put it on herself, and the old woman gave her some money—she then went away, and afterwards returned with the parcel—this tin can and basket was standing on a chest of drawers in the room when I went there; I brought them from the house—this cap (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>) I took from the prisoner's jacket pocket after I took him into custody—he had a hat on his head when he went to the station.</p>

On 16th April I saw the prosecutor near the New Inn, Ealing-lane, and Whitman—I heard him ask the prosecutor for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay his lodging—he replied that he had given him enough already, and he wanted to go to the station—about 7 in the evening I received information of the robbery, and went to the house of Stuckey—I there found Stuckey, Davis, Wheatley, and another girl—I took them all four into custody—they were taken to the station, and all shown to the prosecutor—he was rather intoxicated at the time, and seemed to express a doubt about their being the parties, and, in consequence of that doubt, I allowed them to go—Whitman had been taken previously—I went next morning with the prosecutor into the fields, and near the third stile I observed marks—he pointed it out as the spot where he was robbed—there appeared to have been a struggle—that is one way to the railway station—I apprehended the prisoners again on Sunday.</p>

Savory—on turning in this book to 24th Dec. 1850, I find No. 18,362, a lady's gold lever watch, was delivered to White—my initials are not against it—having looked at this entry, I have a recollection of having delivered that watch to White—on 30th Dec, here is a gold watch, No. 12,827, delivered to White—on 8th Jan., 1851, I find an entry of five gold watches, Nos. 10,160; 10,161; 15,409; 18. 364; and 18,365, all delivered to White—on 13th Jan., here is an entry of two gold three-quarter plate lever watches, Nos. 12,746, and 12,747, to White—all these entries are in the name of White—my initials are not against any of them—I gave all these to the prisoner, they have never been returned to me—it was the prisoner's duty to give them to the foreman, George Hide.</p>

Q.</hi> Here is in this book numbers "18362" and "12827," which have not your initials to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the work that was going on at the end of the week was paid for, but, unless it was finished and delivered, it was not signed for—my signature indicates the return of the property to me—I judge these were not delivered to me, by seeing no initials of mine against them—these initials were put on Saturday when the work was delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But suppose the work was delivered on a Thursday, would you put your initials on the Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should put my initials when I received the work—the work is generally delivered on a Saturday afternoon—the prisoner left on 16th Jan.; I think it was on a Thursday—here is number "15409," "10160," and "10161"—numbers "12746" and "12747" are not here; "18362" is under Jan. 13th, and "18364" and "18365" are under 11th Jan.—it might possibly take the prisoner a fortnight to finish a watch, and do what he had to do to it—he could have completed the majority of the watches he is charged with stealing by the Saturday previous to his leaving—there was no one else to whom these things were to be delivered; they must all pass through my hands—there was no other person to whom the workmen would deliver the work, and who would deliver it to me—I have no recollection that that has ever occurred—the work would not be delivered into my hands by any other person but the workman—I cannot swear that such a thing has never happened—I am always on the premises in business hours—I only go out to my meals—my duty is to receive the work from the workmen, and give it to Harrison.</p>

I am robbed;" I cannot say exactly how long; I was very much confused—two other men were brought back, but I could not recognise them positively at that time; but I had an idea of them—I swear I saw the purse in one of their hands—I saw the band distinctly, and the purse in it, but I did not see who it was—I could not see his face; he was behind me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective police-officer. On 1st April I saw the prisoner Johnson in the Strand, in company with an old man, and Jones was following about twenty yards behind—I saw Price on the other side of the way, in the company of another man, whom I knew to be a companion of Johnson—Price and Jones apparently were watching Johnson-Johnson and the strange man then went into a public-house in the Strand—after Johnson had gone in, Price went and spoke to Jones, who was outside the house—Jones then made a motion with his hand towards the side door of the public-house, and Price went in at the door, and Jones followed him—I then saw Atkins standing outside; I had not noticed him before—I knew him to be a companion of Johnson—I went to Scotland-yard, and returned in about twenty minutes—I then saw Jones and Price come out of the public-house, and speak to Atkins—Johnson then came out of the public-house, leading the old man that he went in with, who was then very drunk—we followed them to Holy well-street, and there they were all apprehended—Johnson was leading the old man, who could scarcely walk—the others were following behind—I have known Johnson, Atkins, and Jones, as companions, for about eighteen months—I had heard of this robbery at the time I saw them in the Strand, and that was the reason I went to Scotland-yard to get assistance to take them—Jones, Atkins, and Johnson, gave false addresses-Jones said he lived at No. 28, Marigold-street, Rotherhithe; Johnson gave his address at some street in Pentonville; I do not know the name of it—I made inquiry the next day, or the next day but one; there is such a street, hut no such person was known there—Atkins gave his address in Brunswick-street, Hackney-road—I made inquiry, but no such person was known—he gave a number; I think it was 20; I found he was not living there.</p>

Dr. Steines—the letter states that the writer has been for twenty years a music master, and was in great distress—Davidson afterwards called, on the subject of that letter; he referred to it,</p>

               <p>and asked for relief—I told the clerk to give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then went through the office, and saw a young man—I said, "Have you been twenty years in England?"—he said, "No, only ten years"—I said, "You had better get off, for I suspect it is a forgery," and I let him go—he told me that his name was Spero, and that he applied for relief—on 31st Jan. he came to the Society of Foreigners, distressed, with a recommendation from the Rev. Dr. Steines; I recognized him immediately, and asked him if he had never seen me before; he protested strongly that he had never seen me—I asked him to sit down for a minute, and sent for the clerk who had given him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., who immediately said, "That is the man you gave 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to, and took from him for attempting to impose upon you"—Davidson asked me not to be hard upon him, and he was dismissed—a short time afterwards I received a letter from Mr. Vander-Nast.</p>

Bank of England note, No. 21,125, dated 10th Jan., 1853—that entry must have been made from the note itself—it is our practice to make up our balances every night—on the night of 14th April I am informed there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short; I was not present—on 23rd April the prisoner was charged with stealing the note—he denied it—I asked him what time he left for dinner on 14th April—I think he said between I and 2—the ordinary time allowed for dinner is under an hour—he said the entry that I have referred to in the waste book, must have been made soon after 12, or about 12—after making the entry he would pass the notes and checks into another box which stands before him, and then they would either go into the till, or be paid into the Bank at night; generally speaking, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes go to the Bank of England—they are not often paid away, unless they are new notes—after the prisoner had been charged with stealing the note, he said that it came from Messrs. White—that is the note that had been missed—I see the name of "James Duke, 19, Ebury-street, Pimlico," on this note—I have seen the prisoner write—I believe that to be in his handwriting.</p>

               <p>sit at the desk, or who may hare occasion to pass it, could have access to it—there are other clerks who keep waste books besides the prisoner—the produce of their books all goes into the waste box, they all mingle together—the cashiers can draw notes out of the box if they wish, and they do occasionally; they do not often have occasion to do it—there are six or seven cashiers—the prisoner was a collecting clerk—he was introduced by Mr. Brady, the member of Parliament—we should not have taken him without a high character; I am not aware what sort of character Mr. Brady gave him—I understand he originally came from Ireland—I do not know what the amount of his collection may have been, I should not have hesitated to allow him to collect large sums—I cannot charge my memory that he has collected 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day, he may have collected 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or he may have had 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6. 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have had no occasion to refer—his collection was on the Southwark side, which does not include many bankers, therefore it would not probably be very large—when I first charged him with this, I told him that the note had been changed at the Bank between 3 and 4 o'clock; I was told so, not by the person who changed it—the prisoner's ordinary time for going to dinner was from 1 to 2 o'clock—I do not state that of my own knowledge—I do not of my own knowledge know what was his ordinary time of going to dinner, I have been informed by others—my duty is a general superintendence of the whole establishment—there are fifty-one clerks—all those clerks would not have occasion to go to the part of the bank where the waste box is kept, but not being a closed box, they could go to it—they would have access to it undoubtedly—perhaps half a dozen persons would have access to it in the course of their duty during the day; it might be ten or twelve—I have seen the prisoner write many times before 14th April—I have seen the entries in this book since this charge was made—I have compared the note with the entries—I have not compared the note with the handwriting in the book since the charge was made; I did before it was made—I had no doubt about the handwriting; I never bad any doubt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the reason you compared it with the entries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was struck with the similarity between them—not the first time I saw it; the first time I saw it I merely recognized the handwriting as that of some one whom I knew—my suspicions did not light on any other person first—I swear that—I did not compare it with the handwriting of any one but the prisoner—I did not order any one else to do so—I did not look at any other clerk's handwriting—I first looked at the prisoner's handwriting, for the purpose of comparing the note with it, when we had a notice from the Bank—I did not see the note on the 14th—I think not until the Wednesday or Thursday before the Saturday on which the prisoner was charged—I then compared it with handwriting of his—I think I compared it altogether three times; I cannot tell you for how long I was comparing it each time—I was comparing it then as a confirmation of my own views—the first time I was not half a minute comparing it—I cannot tell how long I was the second time, it might be two or three minutes; and the third time two or three minutes—I did not compare it six or seven times, it was two or three times; I am not speaking by the card—one clerk was comparing it with me; his name is Gray; that was only upon one occasion—I think that was upon the second occasion—the first time I compared it was the word "Pimlico," with the Pimlico which we have in his address—that was immediately I had the note I cannot charge my memory whether it was on the Wednesday or Thursday—I cannot say on what day I last compared it—Mr. Mullens, the solicitor, was with me on one occasion; he had the note, and 1 had the book; he was struck with the-great</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090125"/>
               <p>similarity—I think that was at the time the prisoner was charged with it—I believe I was the only person examined about the handwriting before the Magistrate—I do not remember whether there was another clerk there or not—since then I have been asked whether any other clerk knew his handwriting—I have not been told that it was necessary to bring further evidence as to the handwriting; I swear that—I was asked if I knew any other clerk that could speak to his handwriting, as it would be desirable to have the evidence strengthened—there are two other clerks here to-day to speak to it—one of those certainly was not examined before the Magistrate; I cannot charge my memory whether the other was or not—Mr. Gray is not here—he is not in the department where the prisoner was, quite apart from it; it was mere matter of curiosity with him—he does not profess to know his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With reference to this 219<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., would you yourself, after it had been received from the Messrs. White, have to make the entry about it, or do anything with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I happened on that morning to have entered it in the cashiers' receiving book—there was pressure of business at the counter, and I was down there, and happened to make the first entry of it—it had not at that time passed through the prisoner's hands—after I made the entry it would pass to the cash book keeper, who would then pass it on to the waste box, from which the prisoner would take it and enter it, the cash book keeper takes the amount only—after the prisoner enters it, it ii put into another box, an open tin box sometimes; they are only put in, sometimes, a weight is put upon them—the waste book is not made up in any way at the end of the day; it is called over by clerk with the cashier, but the posting is from the cash book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>, When these bundles of notes or checks are put in the waste box, how does the clerk (the prisoner for instance, in this case) know to whose account they are to be credited? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the original ticket, or particulars stated, remains upon them—there is particular ticket with each parcel, that states the name of the customer, and sometimes it states the separate amounts of the checks and notes—for the number and date of the note, the party must look to the note itself, it may be that the notes received from the customers and put into the waste box are taken out again for the general purposes of the bank, when required; that is after they are entered; they are never used till after they are entered in the waste book—when they are entered they are placed in tin box, at least they ought to be; that is separate box from the waste box—notes are not taken from the waste box for the general use of the bunk, but from the box in which they are placed after they have been entered—I at first heard that this note had been presented at the bank between 3 and 4 o'clock, I afterwards heard that that was mistake—when I told the prisoner that I had heard the note was presented at the bank between 3 and 4 o'clock, he said he had not been out the whole of the afternoon; he repeated that several times—I ascertained that he had been out between 3 and 4 o'clock; I told him so, and produced the book to show him—he said he thought I referred to the morning collection—I understood that his usual hour for dinner was from 1 to 2 o'clock; that was left for mutual arrangement among the clerks themselves—I think I first saw this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the Wednesday before the Saturday on which the prisoner was given into custody—I communicated with Mr. Mullens immediately we received the notice from the bank I think, or on Monday morning—the note was changed at the bank on Thursday, we stopped it on Friday morning, but we got no information from the hank of its having been</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in the London and County Bank, and have been so three years—the prisoner has been employed there about three months—I remember on 14th April, the balance being wrong 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was at the bank all that day—I sat at the same desk with the prisoner—his general habit was to leave for his dinner at 1 o'clock, or little after, and to return some time after 2 o'clock; he varied much more in the hour of returning than in the time of leaving—I have known him sometimes as late as half past 2 o'clock—his time for going was very regular while he was in that department—he was employed in that department on 14th April—it is called the Waste Book department—entering credits—I cannot fix the particular time at which he went to his dinner that day, but if he had departed from his usual habit to any extent, I should have observed it—I did not go to dinner myself at all that day, until after bank hours—I believe the prisoner went little after 1 o'clock—he was expected to go at 1 o'clock—we were detained till nearly half past 11 o'clock that night, endeavouring to trace the deficiency—we at last discovered that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was missing, and next day we discovered the number and date of the missing note—I had conversation with the prisoner about it—I believed that the note had been mislaid—the Waste Book keeper was frequently in the habit of passing notes in halves, not joined, to another desk where they are joined by others, and where it is much more likely they would be mislaid, or get into book—I asked the prisoner whether it was likely he had passed the note behind to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090127"/>
               <p>be joined? he answered, that he had perfect recollection that he had passed no notes behind to be joined, received from town customers at that time of day—White and Co. would be town customers—I have seen the prisoner write—I believe this, "Duke, Ebury-street, Pimlico," on this note, to be his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you were not before the Magistrates? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was on leave at the time—the clerks arranged pretty much among themselves as to the hour at which they should go to dinner, but they go at fixed hour—an hour is generally allowed them—if they go at 1 o'clock they ought to be back at 2 o'clock—if they are not, sometimes notice is not taken of it, it is left to their own discretion—it need not be from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock; it may be from half-past 2 o'clock to half past 3 o'clock, or when their duty permits them—the prisoner had a certain duty to discharge at exactly few minutes before 1 o'clock—he would be expected to return about 2 o'clock—I remember that he did not return immediately within the hour—he was in the habit of stopping more than the hour—I was not at any time in the County department that day, except to pass through it—I was not occupied there—I always endeavour in my department to note the time the young men go and return, or should be expected to return—I was first asked about—the time at which the prisoner went to dinner that day, after my return on leave—I do not recollect the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you when you returned compare this note with the handwriting of the prisoner in the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw his handwriting in the book afterwards; that might be for the purpose of strengthening my opinion with regard to the writing, but I had no doubt of the handwriting when I saw it—I did not wish to see it to strengthen my opinion, but it was shown to me by Mr. McKewan—he did not in words ask me to compare it—he produced the book for the purpose of doing so—he did not do so more than once—I compared it with him—I do not recollect that I did it with any one else—I check this waste book with the cash book keeper, at about quarter to 1 o'clock in the day, after which the prisoner was expected to go to dinner—that was at 1 o'clock—one young man would be allowed to exchange hit dinner hour with another, but I should be aware of it in that department.</p>

                  </hi>. I am grainer, and live in Medway-street, Horseferry-road; on 11th April, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was coming down on the right hand side of Holborn-hill, the side the church is—I was nearly at the bottom of the hill, walking with Ann Davis—as I was walking along I saw number of persons—I cannot say how many—there was sham fight going on between two men—I believe it to have been a sham fight—the other persons were round them—in going through these people Miss Davis said someone had hold of her dress, near the pocket—I did not stop at all to look at the fight—I was surrounded, and could not get on—I turned round, and there was jerk at silver guard chain which was round my neck, and I missed my own watch directly—I turned round, and saw my watch in the prisoner's hand—I saw portion of it—the ring and the knob were out of his hand—it was very large watch—I do not think a man of his size could grasp it in his hand—I could not do it myself—the prisoner then ran away, and ran up court, and some persons stopped me from going up—he was let up the court, and I was not—when I lost my watch I was trying to get the female out of the crowd—I said, "It is only a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, take care of your pocket"—when the prisoner entered the court I was almost within arm's length of him, running close behind him—the court was about as far from where I lost my watch as to the corner of this court—I believe the prisoner is the man who took the watch.

Williams and Clapham's shop is on the left hand side of the Strand, going from there—I was not satisfied, and took him to the station—I searched him, and found on him a gold watch, which has been identified.</p>

On 8th April I was at Elmore's beer shop, about 1 o'clock in the day—I had two pints of beer in the parlour; Mr. Elmore was there with me, but nobody else—I had seven half crowns in my pocket, and changed one to pay for the porter—they were in my purse in ray left band trowser's pocket—Mr. Elmore left the room after that, and I went into the yard, and then came back into the tap room—the prisoner was there then, and two men—she pushed me down on the settle, and sat down on my knee, slapped her hand on my left hand pocket, and said, "Old mate, are you going to pay for some beer?"—I told her I should not, pushed her off my knee, crossed the tap room, and sat down in the opposite corner—the prisoner came again, and began pulling me about—she called for some beer, which was brought by Miss Elmore, who asked for the money—the prisoner said, "That man will pay for it"—Miss Elmore said she knew I would not—the prisoner began pulling me about again, and in pushing her off my knee I broke the window with my elbow—I had bad two pints of beer, and I laid down and went to sleep—when I awoke there was nobody there; I went home, and when I got up next morning, about 5 o'clock, I missed my six half crowns, but not the change which I had received for the other half crown—I went to Mr. Elmore's, beard something there, and gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired captain in the army, but am now agent for Gordon and Co., wine merchants, in Dublin; I lodge in George-street, Old Kent-road. On 12th April I was in the main road, which I consider High-street, Deptford—I met a man named Murphy, and had some conversation with him—I had never seen him before, but he was a poor-looking wretch, and I thought I would give him a meal—in consequence of that I went to a butcher's shop and purchased a beef steak; I went to the Star and Garter beer shop to have it cooked—after I had finished it, and sat a little time, the prisoner came into the room; I am not sure whether he came in before I finished my steak or afterwards—Murphy addressed him, and had some conversation with him—after I had finished my steak, the prisoner and I had some conversation—I gave him some refreshment, some bread and meat</p>

               <p>—when the landlady came in I took my parse from my left waistcoat pocket and paid her—she gave me some change, and I then put my purse in my left waistcoat pocket—the prisoner, who was standing near the fire, immediately sidled up to me—I think I paid about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I had in change 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I put the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece in my purse, and put my purse into my pocket—the prisoner was in the room when I took my purse out—it was a crimson velvet purse, with a brass clasp, which had worn very bright—after I had paid the landlady I had a sovereign in my purse and some silver, I am not exactly clear how much—after I had paid, and placed the purse in my pocket, the prisoner, who had been leaning against the mantelpiece, came close up to me, and sat down on my left bane, close to me—that was the side on which the purse was—there was a little con venation between us, I do not recollect the substance of it; and he very shortly after that left the room—I do not recollect any particular remark that he made before he left—Murphy shortly followed him—I then put my hand into my left waistcoat pocket, and found my purse was gone—that could not have been above a couple of minutes after Cotter was gone—it was a very short time—I exclaimed, "I have been robbed!"—I got up, went out of the house, and got a policeman—I went down the street, and fell in with Murphy; I gave him in charge, and immediately after I met the prisoner and gave him in charge, as the person who picked my pocket—between the time of my putting my purse in my pocket and missing it, no one had been near me but the prisoner, with the exception of Murphy, who was on my right band—I had been walking about all day, and had had a glass or two of ale—I was a little excited; I had walked about a great deal</p>

I keep a shop in Woolwich for butter, tea, and chandlery—I supplied the soldiers in the barracks—I recollect, on 2nd April, the prisoner coming to my shop—he asked me for half a pound of butter and a quarter of a pound of cheese for Capt. Cox's company, 45 room—I supplied him with the articles, and he left the shop—he came again at 8 o'clock the same night, and asked for half a pound of butter for the same room—I let him have it—on 5th April he came again for a pound of butter for 46 room, for Capt. Cox's company—I did not supply that—after he left the shop I sent my servant directly to give him in charge to one of the guards—at the time I supplied him with the goods I believed he came from 44 room, Capt. Cox's company.</p>

I manage the business of Henry and Edward Fownes, glove manufacturers, of No. 41, Cheapside; their factory is at Battersea—I have been in their employment sit or seven years—the prisoner was employed by them as a glove cutter—he worked for no other firm, that we knew of—I do not believe there was any special arrangement with him about serving other firms; it is not the custom—nothing was said to him about not serving other firms, but those in our employment are decidedly not permitted to work for other firms; if such a thing was discovered, the person would be discharged—I have been in the habit of delivering work to the prisoner—on 9th April I delivered some skins to him to cut into nine dozen tranks; tranks are unmade gloves—my attention was particularly directed, in consequence of some circumstances, to the skins which I delivered to him for some months back—this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was made at the time I gave him the skins; it is a copy of the written instructions I gave him—the kid was what we call bottle-green colour—I either gave the skins to him or to the person who took them for him—if I gave any verbal instructions, it would be, "Cut these to these sizes"—I gave a copy of the sizes on a piece of paper; there was no mark on the skins themselves, merely the quantity—the paper and skins were given either to the prisoner or his daughter—his daughter was the person who ordinarily received the skins for him—I wrote</p>

Fownes Brothers"—he said, "I am very sorry, it is a bad job"—he pointed out a small quantity of leather in different parts of the room; he had got a large quantity before him, and said, "This belongs to Messrs.
