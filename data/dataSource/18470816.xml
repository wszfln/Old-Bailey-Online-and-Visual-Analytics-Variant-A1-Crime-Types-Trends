                  </hi> I am a grocer and tea-dealer, in the Bethnal-green-road. The prisoner Evans was in my service as assistant for about nine months, and left six or seven months ago—in March last I was in some pecuniary difficulties, and wished to raise some money on some goods—I consulted Evans on the subject—he said he had a brother or a friend in the trade, who would take these goods of him, and I should have the money to pay a dividend to my creditors there and then—he said it was the only plan I could adopt to raise the money and to pay it down directly; and the party I employed stated it would be much easier and better for him to do it, if I could pay the money there and then, and that was the only way I could do it—in consequence of that, I entrusted the property to Evans—the arrange<lb/>ment between us was, that if I required the money, I should have it, and if not, I should have the property returned, but I did not want the property turned into money, as I was able to borrow 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay to my creditors—the goods were delivered about the 14th of April—the prisoner Price carried them away in his own cart—Evans took them out of my shop and delivered them into the cart—Price received them into his cart—I believe that was the</p>

               <p>same day that I had the conversation with Evans—there was half-a-chest of gunpowder tea, half-a-chest of twankay, some almond, ginger, oleander seed, rice, and sugar—there was no invoice, only a list of the goods in pencil on a piece of paper—I made part of it myself, and Evans made part—the goods were all my property, and about the value of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., indeed, I would much rather have the goods than the money, they are more valuable to me than that—Price is brother-in-law to Evans—I did not employ Price—I cannot say whether I saw Evans again the same evening that the goods were taken, but I saw him about two days after—I am not aware that there was anything particular said relating to the goods, the first time I saw him; but in the course of a week, or a fortnight, he refused to tell me where the goods were when I asked him about them—before he took the goods away, he had arranged to take them to his mother-in-law's, and before he took the second load, he said that his mother had refused to take them in, and he had placed them with a friend whom he knew, and that they were perfectly safe—I said, "Now, Evans, you will not lead me astray, you will have these goods quite right"—he said, "Quite right, let me have them all"—I asked him if they were perfectly safe, and he said they were—I afterwards borrowed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a friend of mine, and I did not then require the goods to be sold—I have never got them back, nor received anything for them—about a fort-night after, I requested Evans to return either all or part of them, and he set me at defiance, and said I might do my best and my worst—I saw him at Knightsbridge, and asked him where the goods were—he said he had placed them with a party of the name of Ratford, a horse-dealer—he did not tell me at that time where Ratford and the goods were—he afterwards brought this Ratford before me—his name turns out to be Purdy—I had seen Evans before that, at a public-house in Fenchurch-street, and he promised to meet me at half-past eight—he then said he had seen Ratford, and Ratford required 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before he would deliver up the property—he had got a letter in his hand, and he read it to me, as having been received from Ratford, but I can swear to it as having been in his own handwriting—that letter is not here—Ratford can neither read nor write—I have a letter here which I received from Evans—this is it, it is in Evans's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Peter Taylor, Canton House, Bethnal-green-road, Thursday evening. Dear Sir, I have seen that scamp to-day, and have positively done all I could to bring him to something like reason; but I am sorry to say, nothing seems to move the vagabond from what he proposed, but we will se what to-morrow may bring; perhaps both of us may do something with him. I have promised to meet him to-morrow morning, at eleven o'clock, at the Grapes public-house, three or four doors from kingsland-road, in Old-street. Yours, A. Evans. Mrs. Evans has just told me that the Revd. has called. I would come down this evening, but my brother is without a young man, and wants my services. I shall see you to-morrow, at eleven o'clock")—In consequence of that letter I went to the Grapes public-house, in Old-street-road, the next day at eleven o'clock—it was on a Friday in the early part of April, about three weeks or a month after the goods were moved—Evans met me himself first, and afterwards Ratford came in—I had never seen him before—Evans said, "Now Ratford this is my friend Taylor, I went to see if we cannot come to something like reason about these goods"—after a little while Ratford said, "It is no use stating anything but what is right, I have made away with the goods"—Evans on that rose up, called him a scamp and a vagabond, and wanted to fight him, and said he would die in a ditch—Ratford said, "If I do, you will die in the one next to me"—no blow was</p>

               <p>struck—I asked Ratford if he knew the value of the property he had had of mine—he said he did not—I said, "It is 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you have made away with it I am a ruined man for ever"—he said he did not know about that, and seemed quite struck at the value of the property—Evans still continued in the same bustle—he appeared to be quite angry with Ratford, wanted to fight him, and called him any name but a gentleman, but he did not touch him—he told me to come out—we went outside together—he directly went back into the house, continued there about a minute, and then came home with me—a man named Payne was there—I had never seen him before—Payne said in Evans's presence that it was an understanding between Evans and Rat<lb/>ford that the goods were to be made away with immediately, and not to remain in his house—in the middle of May I went with Purdy to Knighta<lb/>bridge, and saw Evans there—I had not been able to get the slightest account from Evans of the goods or the money—I am not exactly aware of what passed between Purdy and Evans—Purdy wished him to do some<lb/>thing in the matter of these goods—Evans said, "Purdy knows nothing of the goods, I exonerate him, I take the whole charge on myself; Taylor do your best and worst, I do not value you that" (<hi rend="italic">snapping his fingers.</hi>)—"I said, "Well, Evans, if you had told me that before, I should have known how to have acted."—Purdy said, "I have been away from my house for three or four days to vindicate your case for a paltry sovereign, and now I shall stay away no longer; I shall speak the truth, you have trod on my foot, and I shall tread on yours"—Evan's said, "Well if you have been away from home at all you are only a fool, how am I to know that?"—Purdy did not tell me in Evans' presence what had occurred between them—he had stated it to me be<lb/>fore—I gave Evans a sovereign towards the expenses incurred in moving the goods, and taking charge of them.</p>

I did not require the goods to be sold—the goods went off in the early part of the week, and I obtained the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Friday or the Saturday—I handed over 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mollett, and kept 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself—Mollett is not here—the 14th of April was Wednesday or Thursday to the best of my recollection, and on Friday I obtained 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Phillips, a friend of mine, now residing with me—I intended to divide my property equally among the creditors—I authorized Mollett to go to Messrs.

Brecon note—I kept my bag at the bottom of my bed, and always locked—I had seen the money in it on the morning of the 14th of June—on Wednesday morning, the 16th, I found my bag broken open—the lock was not broken, but one side of the bag was wrenched open, just sufficient for the parcel containing the money to be drawn out—all the money was gone, but no<lb/>thing else—the money was the very top parcel in the bag—the prisoner lodged in the next room to mine, but I do not think I ever saw him—the partition between the rooms is very thin—I heard some persons in the prisoner's room on the Monday—two young females occupied my room as well as myself—I occupied two rooms, and the prisoner occupied the third room with the land<lb/>lord's brother—the females remained after I missed my money—they slept in the room next to the prisoner's—that was the room in which I had previously slept, but I did not sleep in that room that night, I slept in the next room—the women were in the room in which the bag was—they are not here—in consequence of information, I went after the prisoner on Wednesday, the 16th—I went to Mr. Nash, of Marylebone-street, to Mr. Maddox's, to Gravesend, and to Richmond—I traced him to Gravesend, but could not trace the notes—I did not see the prisoner till he was taken into custody on Sunday morning.</p>

Orrow, and Cheese<lb/>man, and Mr. Wood, the clerk to Messrs.

                  </hi> I had charge of a wharf at Battle-bridge for Mr. Brassey—in March or April last, a large quantity of iron-rails were brought there from Wales, for the Great Northern Railway—part of them were afterwards removed to the line of the intended railway, in the Caledonian-road—in May last, I missed 181 of the 15ft. and 8 of the 12ft. rails—in consequence of information, I afterwards went to Mr. Plumley's premises at Bankside, and found 182 of the rails, which I claimed, as belonging to Mr. Brassey—I have every reason to believe they were part of the rails that were placed in the Caledonian-road—they have a red mark on each end, and some white paint on some of them—the police took possession of them—they were worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I have a carpet-ground near the line of the intended railway, in the Caledonian-road—I saw iron-rails carried away from there several times—the last van that came I took particular notice of—it was on the 1st of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—it was a yellow van, with an iron-grey horse—I had never seen that van and horse before, but I was given to understand it had been there in the morning—the prisoner was the person who was driving the van, and had charge of it—I am quite certain of him; there were others with him loading, he assisted to load—he put the rails into the van, and they drove away to the King's Head bar in the Holloway-road.</p>

                  </hi> I am a member of the Stock Exchange, and live in Albion-villas, Hornsey. On the 15th of July, about twenty minutes past nine at night, I was going over London Bridge, arm-in-arm with a friend—a women touched our arms, and asked if we had been robbed—I put my hand into my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I saw the prisoner and another lad crossing the road—I crossed and took the other lad, I did not find my handkerchief on him—I then took the prisoner, and asked him if he had got anything belonging to me—he said, "No"—I said, "I think you have; at all events, I will see"—I took him by the collar, opened his coat, and found my handkerchief tucked under his arm—this produced is it.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 40, Basinghall-street. The pri<lb/>soner was in my service—in consequence of circumstances I thought it neces<lb/>sary to search his box on the morning of the 4th of August—I had missed about three pieces of fancy plaids, which had been torn off goods—after breaking open his box. I found the ends which precisely matched the pieces they were torn from—this is one of them, it is part of what I lost—the pri<lb/>soner had no right to have it in his box—his box had no business on my premises—it was there without my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon in the regiment of Horse Guards (Blue), and was so in 1843—I was then well acquainted with Mr. Munro, the prisoner—he was then a lieutenant in the same regiment—I had known him very intimately—in June, 1843, the regiment was quartered at the Regent's-park barracks—on Saturday morning, the 1st of July, between four and five o'clock, I was called up by Mr. Munro—he came onto my bedroom,</p>

               <p>awoke me, and said he wanted me to go with him, that he had to settle an affair with Colonel Fawcett—that was while I was still in bed—I objected to go at first, but he pressed me, and said I might be of use to him, and so I went—he had previously spoken to me of some misunderstanding about the sale of a house—that Colonel Fawcett had intrusted him with the sale of a house, and that he had obtained more for it than Colonel Fawcett either de<lb/>manded or expected, and that Colonel Fawcett, so far from showing any kind<lb/>ness on account of the trouble he had taken in his behalf, had behaved in an unkindly manner, instead of being grateful to him for what he had done—he did not tell me that a quarrel had been the consequence, he merely mentioned it in the way that any person would mention a family disagreement—I was aware that Colonel Fawcett and Mr. Munro had married two sisters—I do not remember whether Mr. Munro remained with me while I was dressing—we went together in his carriage to the Brecknock-arms, near Copenhagen-house, in the north of London—I do not know whether it is Kentish-town or Camden-town—we arrived there about half-past five or six o'clock—I do not think we found any one there when we arrived—some one drove up afterwards, I think it was Colonel Fawcett, but I am not certain—I saw Colonel Fawcett afterwards in a field, near the Brecknock-arms, with Mr. Munro, and two other gentlemen with him—one was Mr. Grant—I knew him—the other one I have been since told was Major Cuddy—I did not know him at the time—Mr. Grant either had been, or was then, in the army—I know he was a lieutenant at one time, whether he was then or not I do not know—Mr. Munro did not tell me what Mr. Grant was there for, he told me nothing about it—when these gentlemen were in the field I went out of the field, and left them there—I was going down the Tottenham-road—the field I left adjoins the road—they went into a field further away from the road, next but one to the road—I saw nothing done there—Mr. Munro called me into the field—I had heard nothing before that—that was before there was any shot—he shouted to me, and asked me to come into the field, and said something to the effect that I might be of use to him—I thought they were going to settle it—I got over the paling into the field to them—they seemed to be standing all together—I cannot say that I saw them all four—I saw three or four—I had no conversation with Mr. Munro on that occasion—I went up to them, and they retired from me, and then I turned my back to them, I thought they were at conference—they did not go out of that field—they went a little farther away in the same field, and in about a minute, as near as I can recollect, I heard a report as of a pistol—I only heard one re<lb/>port—there was immediately a shout for me—it was either "Gulliver," or "Doctor," or some such shout—I turned round, and saw Colonel Fawcett down on the grass—Mr. Munro was standing by him saying something—Mr. Cuddy was there—Mr. Munro said something to the effect that Colonel Faw<lb/>cett had been levelling at him, I forget the words—Colonel Fawcett said he had not, and he afterwards said it was an accident—I think that was said to the policeman—that was half an hour after at least—after Colonel Fawcett said he had not, he and Mr. Munro shook hands, and Mr. Munro went away—I did not see him drive off in his carriage—I do not know whether any one went with him, of course Mr. Grant went away—I lost sight of him—Mr. Cuddy remained with Colonel Fawcett—I found Colonel Fawcett was likely to die—he was wounded on the right side of the chest, under the arm—I raised him up, he rallied a little after that, and then Mr. Cuddy went to get some assistance, and came with a board for the purpose of taking him away—he</p>

               <p>was taken to the Brecknock-arms first—Mr. Cuddy took a note for me directed to Sir Benjamin Brodie, or Mr. Liston—they refused to take him in at the Brecknock-arms, and he was taken to the Camden-arms, and re<lb/>mained there till his death, I believe, but I speak of that from hearsay—I was present when Mr. Liston and Mr. Sands saw him—we saw him together—I think it was the day after, I am not quite certain—I think I saw him both days—Mr. Liston and I helped to move him on the Sunday, to shift his position—I saw him also with Sir Benjamin Brodie.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see all the three parties go into the parlour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw them all three—the little man came in first, and went into the parlour—he then went out again and came in with Smith; the prisoner came in afterwards—I went to the Compter, a few days afterwards—the prisoner was placed amongst other persons there, I did not find him; I did not look at the persons, I was too timid—I just looked, and the gaoler spoke very roughly to me, and behaved very rudely—he asked me if I Knew him, and I said really I did not look, I could not say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not see the prisoner; did he not catch your eye and hang back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said to the gaoler, "I cannot go down here"—and he said, "Go on; what are you afraid of?"—and he said, "It is no use bringing such people as these here, for they never look"—the man caught my eye—I did not say, "That is the man:" I said I could not tell—I was at the Compter on Saturday, and was before the Magistrate on the Wednesday after-wards; the prisoner was there—I had had no conversation with the police-man—I had not known the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi> I am gate-keeper of the goods-station of the Eastern Counties Railway, in Brick-lane—the prisoners were porters there. On Sunday, the 4th of July, it was their duty to unload the trucks of the goods and fish that came from the country, and to put them on the platform—about two o'clock that afternoon I received directions, and placed myself where I could have a view of the platform—there were two trucks there, one contained pods of shrimps, and the other beer—about twenty minutes before three o'clock I saw Cherry go to the truck—there were five baskets, he took one off, and then took another—he lifted up the lid of the third one, put his hand in four times, and put some shrimps into his pocket—I then saw Allen go to the same pod—he took two handfuls of shrimps out and put them into his right-hand pocket—I then saw Baker go, take a handful out, and place it in his waistcoat pocket—he then took another handful, which he sat down to eat, on a case containing goods—I saw Wood go and take two handfuls, and place them in his right-hand pocket—they were there when they were taken by the officer.</p>

                  </hi> I am servant to Mr. Roberts Smith, of Percy-street, Rath<lb/>bone-place—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Pancras. On the 22nd of July, about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning, I was in bed asleep in the front kitchen—I was awoke by the noise of the window lifting up—I heard it the second time and got out of bed, rung the bell for my master, went up stairs, and gave an alarm—I called two constables, who came to the door—I let them in and found the prisoner in custody—before I went to bed the night before, I had left the house all fastened, except the window that he got in at, that window was quite down, and the shutters were closed—I did not see it lifted up—I saw it open afterwards—there was a light there.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 2nd of June, about a quarter-past four o'clock, I was on duty in Adam-street, Marylebone, and saw the prisoner put her head outside of the door of No. 40—she looked round, looked on each side, till she saw me, and directly with-drew her head, and closed the door—in consequence of this, I watched the house till about a quarter to five—I then saw the prisoner coming out with two large bundles, one under each arm—she merely came outside the door, I suppose not half-a-yard, before she saw the shine of the leather at the top of my bat, as I was watching round the corner on the opposite side of the road, from fifteen to twenty yards from the door—on seeing me, the prisoner</p>

               <p>directly threw the bundles behind her into the passage, went in, and closed the door—I waited a few minutes, then went over to the door, tried it, and found it fast—I continued to watch the house till saw the door open about an inch or an inch and a half—that was about a quarter-past five—I put my fingers inside, and tried to open it, but found some one pushing against me—I then put my shoulder to the door, forced it open, and saw the prisoner standing behind it, with the two bundles by her side—I said, "Do those bundles belong to you?"—she said, "Yes, they do"—I said, "Had you been an honest woman you would have taken one of those <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> in the street, and not have watched till the policeman was out of sight"—there was a cab-stand fifteen or twenty yards from the house—she did not make any answer to that—I said, "Did you," or "have you lived in the house?"—she said, "Yes, I have been living with an old lady on the first-floor, up stairs"—I said, "I must trouble you to show me this old lady up stairs"—she said, "You can go, and I will wait here"—I said, "Certainly not, I shall not part with you, nor yet the bundles, until I have seen the old lady"—she went me up about four stairs, then suddenly turned—round, and said, "I suppose it is no use telling you a lie?"—I said, "No, nor a thousand will not satisfy me until I see the old lady"—she said, "The truth is, I have been living with the old lady in the front kitchen, down stairs"—I said, "We will go down stairs and see the old lady"—she was very unwilling to go down—I insisted on her going down with me, and she went down—I went to the door of the front kitchen—on going down she said, "It is of no use for you to knock, for she is as deaf as a stone"—I knocked repeatedly with<lb/>out receiving an answer—I said to the prisoner, "Is there not a window to this kitchen?"—she said, "Yes, in the front area"—I went into the front area—the prisoner went with me, after a good deal of hesitation, I took hold of her by the arm—I looked through the window of the kitchen—there was no shutter to the window—I found the kitchen quite empty, and said to the prisoner, "This is the second falsehood you have told me, when are we coming to the truth?"—she made no answer to that—I then went towards the back yards—the prisoner offered me half-a-crown, and said, "This will do to get you something to drink, or I have a crown; or, I think I have 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "This looks blacker still"—I had hold of her at the time, and said I should not part with her till I had seen the lady in the front shop up stairs—I said that, because I suspected something was wrong, by her offering me the money—she said she wanted to get away without paying her rent—she gave me no other reason for offering me money—I then tried the back kitchen door with my shoulder, and heard the lock make a noise as if the door was coming open—the prisoner directly turned round and said, "You have come to the truth; do not say I did it, for I have not seen her since last night"—I felt in the keyhole of the door, and not finding the key I said, "This looks very suspicious," I directly took the prisoner up stairs to the door of the shop, which is on the ground-floor, knocked, and asked to be admitted—there was a female in the room who declined to admit me, as she was undressed—I asked her if she knew the party I had outside—I asked her whether she knew her by her voice, and I asked the prisoner to speak—I believe the words she said were, "It is me, Miss Smallbone," on that Miss Smallbone said, "It is Mrs. Hunt she is living with, an old lady in the back kitchen down stairs"—I then said to the prisoner, "It has come to the back kitchen, has it? you must go with me"—I went down with her—as she was going down she said, "As I told you before, it is no use for you to knock, for she is as deaf as a stone."—I knocked at the door repeatedly, but received no answer—I inquired for the key—the prisoner said she had not</p>

S."—they all were afterwards shown to Elizabeth Wills, the deceased's daughter—I afterwards went back to the house in Adam-street with Mr. Hunt—a poker was found by the body—I returned to the station-house, and searched a reticule and other things which the prisoner had with her—she was searched a reticule and other things which the prisoner had with her—she was searched by a female—I found four letters in her reticule, one partly torn up in her hand, a glove, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all in silver—these are the letters—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the inquest</p>

               <p>About five O'clock in the morning of the 2nd of June, I was called to see the body of the deceased—I found the head lying under the grate, partly across the fender, the right shoulder and neck across the fender, the head being under the grate among the cinders—the legs were slightly bent, the hands were stretched out under the grate, a little beyond the head, and just beyond the hands was lying a thimble, under the grate—there was some blood lying under the head and under the shoulder—I noticed a string round the neck—it was passed six times round the neck—I also noticed that the string was quite loose—I did not see the ends then—it was loose enough to admit the hand of person, or two or three hands—no bruise was visible in that position of the body—I did not shift the body on that occasion—I no<lb/>ticed a mark of violence, that had occurred from an injury inflicted since death—the bone was not fractured, nor the skin broken, it was dried or red—it was a dry red, harsh and greasy—it would not result from fire—it would result from the application of a blow shortly after death—a blow before death would produce a very different appearance—it would produce a blackness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you judge whether that was a blow of any violence or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not tell whether it was an actual blow, or merely pressure, but there was considerable force—I think the woman had been dead for about eight hours—it was half-past five when I made my notes—I had gone home and dressed before that—I think it was about a quarter-past five when I saw the body—it was fully dressed, with the exception of the head—the cap was off, lying underneath the grate, and the false front of hair with it—there was no fire burning—I did not then trace from what part of her person the blood came that I saw about the head, but it came from the mouth—it might also have come from any wound which I had not then seen, as I did not lift the body up; but it was also flowing from the mouth—on the same day I proceeded to make an examination of the body—for that purpose it was lifted from the floor on to a shutter—a halfpenny and the key of the room door was found underneath the body when it was moved—I then no<lb/>ticed that a very extensive bruise had been given over the socket of the right eye, inflicted during life—there was a slight mark of pressure on the bones at the back of the neck, and a slight mark of pressure on the top of the head—both those marks appeared to have been made after death—I examined those marks immediately, to see whether they were of any importance, and found them to be of none—I then proceeded to make an internal examination of the body—I found the brain perfectly healthy, and the skull very sound—I found the ribs broken on both sides, very extensively, eight on one side, and six on the other—I found that those ribs had been broken during life—I found that the lower rings of the wind-pipe had been pressed from each side towards the middle, so as to break them in the centre—there was no evidence whether that injury had been inflicted during life—I could not tell one way or the other—the right lung having been diseased for many years, was broken up in its diseased false texture, which it had acquired from disease for a number of years, and was lacerated by the projecting piece of one of the ribs, so that the blood flowed from out of its texture into the air-vessels to a con<lb/>siderable extent, and that was the source, and the only source of the blood that was found lying on the floor—the blood having flowed into the air-ves<lb/>sels, escaped by the mouth—that was only the case with the diseased lung, the left lung was slightly diseased—I think that injury to the right lung would not of itself have been mortal—the left lung was much more healthy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160079"/>
               <p>than lungs are usually found in persons of her age—it was slightly diseased—it had been inflamed at times, there was no laceration of that—I found everything else extremely healthy—I ascribe the death to the same power that broke the ribs—the same power being continued would inevitably stop the person's power of breathing—the same, or even a less pressure than that which broke the ribs, would stop the power of expansion of the chest, and cause death, but how soon death would ensue would depend on the age; with a young person not very soon, in a woman of her age I suppose a minute and a half.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the presumption that a poker had been used by any person or persons seeking to destroy the life of the deceased, do you now think that you can account for the possibility of the death being caused by one person and one only? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The breaking of the ribs by blows would not necessarily have done any mortal injury, but that the ribs might have been broken to all that extent by one person, there can be no doubt—if a body were fixed in a position, very difficult to imagine, namely, tied ready for it, and one person was to go about with a poker beating it all over, taking excellent aim at each rib, they might, <hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi>, break every rib—in my opinion it is quite impossible that the ribs could have been broken by the poker, but I am taking your hypothetical case—I think it quite impossible that the use of a poker would account for the appearances I found about the body—the blow below the orbit of the eye would not be likely to be occasioned by a poker—I believe the poker was not used at all—the only way in which I can imagine this to have happened, is by the sitting on the body, and by the pressure of both sides the ribs were broken—I believe the woman to have been lying on her back on the ground—I assume</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160080"/>
               <p>the ribs to have been broken by the bumping of the assailant on the chest of the deceased, and at the same time assailing the throat as I have represented—I am not driven to assume that that was the mode of death, because I am other<lb/>wise unable to account for it—the compression of the throat was not necessary to death—I believe the compression of the throat had no effect in extinguishing vitality—I form the same opinion with reference to the rope round the neck—the bumping would be unnecessary after once the ribs were broken—the first bump might break the ribs, and after that the sitting on the chest would be sufficient to prevent the deceased breathing—the mere lying of the weight of a corpse on the chest would have been sufficient—I do not think that one bump would produce the breaking of all the ribs—the power of bumping is merely the rising up of a body and sitting it down again—I cannot describe that as considerable, but previous to the bump she must have received the blow over the eye, that was a blow given whilst the woman was alive—I examined it—I did not lay it open—I am quite certain that that injury had no reference to the death—the bone immediately under the spot where the blow was received was not fractured, or driven in—the bone is very thin there, and it might be driven in to a considerable extent, and yet produce no injury—the blow was immediately over the frontal sinus, the vacant space in connection with the cavity of the nose, that was not broken in—there was no injury about the head inflicted whilst life remained—there was a mark over the forehead of an injury that had occurred after death, at the root of the hair—the head was very bald, but not quite bald—it was much easier to ascertain that the fractured rib driven into the deceased's lung had produced the discharge of blood that escaped from the mouth, than it was to account for the means by which the broken ribs had been fractured—it was occular—I could trace the stream of blood from the spot—I consider that suffocation produced death, and that suffocation was caused by pressure on the chest, and preventing its expansion—I believe the hemorrhage had nothing to do with it—death from hemorrhage would have occurred in three or four hours per<lb/>haps—I form my opinion of the woman having been dead about eight hours, from experience, and from the rigidity of the muscles, I am chiefly guided by the rigidity of the muscles, making allowance for the heat of the weather, it was very hot weather at that time—she might have been dead six or twelve hours—I might be as much out as that, but it is not likely.</p>

               <p>continuation of those fits for a number of years might contribute to a per<lb/>manent injury to the brain—I have heard the whole of the evidence in this case—I should describe the fits, from which the prisoner is said to have suf<lb/>fered, as hysterical fits—a person would not have a fit without the brain being affected—the proximate cause of the fit would be some operation on the brain—if these fits were repeated over and over again, it might superin<lb/>duce disease of the brain—I have know persons suffering from these fits, arising from the same cause, who have lost their reasoning powers for short periods while under the influence of the fit, and for a short period afterwards while the brain was recovering itself—I do not believe that a person would be able to distinguish what she was doing, or the circumstances surrounding her, during the fit; she would be gradually coming round after the fit—the continuance of these fits would operate prejudicially to the health in every respect, and I should say it would operate upon the mental powers—that is the case with every disease that has its origin in the brain, or by which the brain is at all affected—where there is disease in one member of a family, it is likely that there would be a predisposition to it in others, in some diseases particularly—if there was such a predisposition in a family, any exciting cause would be likely to produce insanity.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose in the course of your experience, your atten<lb/>tion being particularly directed to the diseases of women, you have met with innumerable cases of women suffering more or less inconvenience from an obstruction of this kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—it is a complaint to which very many young women are subject—if a person is in a situation that requires them to work or exert themselves for their livelihood while labouring under this obstruction, of course they will have fainting fits—during those fainting fits the patient would be quite insensible, and incapable of any determinate action; during the fainting fits, but not during the struggling—I should describe the fits which the prisoner is said to have had, as fainting fits—I have heard it stated that on one or two occasions she screamed and was violent, with a convulsive action of the muscles—those I attribute to hysteria, but I attribute both to the same cause, the obstruction—I do not recollect ever meeting with a case in the course of my practice in which a woman became permanently insane from fainting fits or hysteria—in a fainting fit the patient would be per<lb/>fectly quiet and insensible—persons are very violent in some cases of hysteris, but equally incapable of determinate action—I have know the fit last for many hours—with proper applications persons would recover earlier than they would without—it is followed by lassitude and depression of spirits, until nature recovers herself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person to have been subject to occasional obstruction and irregularity of this kind, would any successful effort of nature causing a discharged, have a tendency to relieve the inconvenience that would be felt by the want of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have noticed that at the time the discharge comes on they are rather more inclined to have fits—if a person suffered from suppres<lb/>sion, and had a return, they are nearly sure to have a fit at the period of the return—the return is the consequence of an effort of nature, and is curative as far as it goes—the fit would mark the crisis—if it were followed or accom<lb/>pained by a return of the natural action, it would be curative for a time—there always increased irritation in the female constitution at the time the discharge commences, even where they are in good health, but not such as to cause fits—I am speaking of a case where there has been suppression for a considerable time.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, living at Brighton—I am surgeon to the Infirmary there.

               <p>anything like insanity in the family, drink would be more likely to promote those appearance—I have heard the evidence that has been given in this case, with reference to the fits and the obstruction of the menses—there is no doubt that is continuation for a long time might affect the brain, and that affection of the brain might be exhibited, by melancholy, or violent excitement—I mean excitement of such an extent, that I have a person labouring under such an obstruction, and she is obliged to be put under restraint—that continues for a few days—I should say during the period of that excitement, they would not be capable of knowing what they were doing, and would not be answerable for it; and during that violent paroxyam they have a greater hatred to their immediate friends than to other people—I have known females of a naturally kind and humane disposition who have exhibited those symptoms of ferocity under such circumstances—it is a very common symptom.</p>

On Tuesday, the 8th of June, I had been out to work—I came home at half-past seven in the evening, and found my room-door open—I had left it locked, and had the key in my pocket all day—when I got in I found my things disturbed—I opened the shutters, and then saw the prisoner standing in the corner of the room—I did not know her before—my tea-pot was moved from my drawers on to the table with the candlestick, which had been on the shelf; a gown had been taken from a nail behind the door, and thrown on to another table, a cloak and bonnet were moved, and two sheets—these are the things—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all mine—I said to the prisoner, "What do you do in my room?"—she said, "Do not be afraid; have you lost anything? two ladies sent me to ask you to go to work"—I said, "What ladies?"—she said she could not say, but they were little ladies—Sarah Robertson was in the passage, and she went and fetched the officer.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Thomas Buckthorpe, a coffee-merchant, of No. 1, Mincing-lane. I have known the prisoner for about twelve months. On the 4th of June last, he was indebted to Mr. Buckthorpe in the sum of about 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—previous to that, we had received the warrants for some coffee that had arrived by the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>—these warrants (<hi rend="italic">looking at some pro<lb/>duced by Mr. Mullens</hi>) are them—the prisoner was aware that we had them—previously to the 4th of June he had had the loan of them for he purpose of sampling and inspecting the coffee at the docks, and he returned them—he was merely a customer of Mr. Buckthorpe's—he bought of him—he is a com<lb/>mission agent for some parties, and does business on his own account as a merchant—on the 4th of June he came to Mr. Buckthorpe's office, and said he had a friend in town from Newcastle whom he thought was a purchaser of that description of coffee, that he was a very particular sort of man in the mode in which he conducted his business, and he wished to inspect the goods himself before he would make a purchase—he said, "Will you let me have the warrants, I and my friend will go down directly, and they shall be returned in about an hour?"—I said that he had previously drawn samples, and I did not see the necessity for his doing so again—Mr. Buckthorpe was in the next</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160105"/>
               <p>office, and I just mentioned to him that he wanted them—after that I agreed to give him the warrants—I delivered them to him, and he went away with them—I did not see him again till he was in custody—on the following day we received this noted from him—(<hi rend="italic">read, marked "A," signed Thomas Smith, dated June</hi> 5, 1847—"Gentlemen, I told you on Thursday I should pay you 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-day. I then felt certain of receiving that amount from the country this morning, but owing to my journey being due in the north next week, the party has written me saying, he will pay me when there. I very much regret that it has occurred so, but if you will call at the Bank of England on Thurs<lb/>day, you will receive the full amount of what I owe you, as I shall pay it on Wednesday to your credit through the branch at Newcastle. The <hi rend="italic">Morning Star's</hi> I have sold this morning, and the party will pay me for them on Tuesday, as he leaves town to-night, and has not quite enough with him. The amount I will remit with the other on Wednesday, if you will have the kindness to forward me the invoice, deducting rent, &amp;c., to the Post-office, Newcastle. I presume you will charge me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the transaction being a cash one.")—I received this other letter from him the same evening—I had written an answer to the first letter in the interval, directed to his office in St. Swithin's-lane—(<hi rend="italic">read, from Mr. Smith to Mr. Oliver</hi>—"Sir, I feel exceedingly surprised at your note just received, and the conduct you have pursued towards me with<lb/>out any cause. I would have met you this morning, but it is now needless, as you seem determined if you can to ruin me. All I need say is, that although it was my intention to have left for Newcastle to-night, I shall not now do so until Monday; and if you will then call on me, at ten o'clock in the morning, with the invoice of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star's</hi> I will pay you for them; and during the week you shall have the balance of your account, as before stated.")—I received no other letter from him myself, and did not see him till he was taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you offer to take a bill for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I once said, that if he met with a customer for them whom we approved of, and drew upon him, and handed us that party's acceptance, that then we would sell him the coffees, and take such a bill in payment—I offered to sell him the coffees, if he met with a customer whose bill we approved of—he had had possession of the warrants three or four weeks before—I think he had them one day, and returned them on the following morning—I shall swear he did not hold them two or three days—we did not make any great effort to get rid of the coffees—I asked 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for them on the last occasion; we were losing money on them I did not state to him, on the 4th of June, that if he did not take them I should expect the warrants back again in an hour—the usual credit on coffee is one month, and on tea we expect the cash on the Saturday following the delivery—the cash transaction were confined to the teas—he had inquired of me before I give him the warrants, what price I would take for cash for them—I said, to clear them up I would take 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, cash—I would have sold them to him for 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt., if he had brought me the cash—if he had returned with the cash, I should have been content to have made a contract with him under the circumstances—I should have asked for the warrants, to have the account made out—we had an entry of them in the book—we could have made out the account from that entry, but we should not have done so, because it is not the practice in the trade—we should have had nothing to do with his selling them—we had nothing to do with that; we had not sold them, and I would not have sold them, unless he had brought the warrants back, because it would not have been regular—I should have felt myself at liberty, during the time he was gone to the docks, to sample them for this party, to have sold them to any other party—I had not engaged to hold them for his answer—we could have sold them by our samples, and delivered the warrants when applied for—we should have been at liberty to do so, according to the custom of the trade—if he had returned with the 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt., we could have made out an invoice from our books and closed the transaction—we had had other transaction with him in credit, but the warrants were not delivered to him at the time he made the purchases on any former occasions that I recollect—I will undertake to swear that they were not principally delivered to him at the time of making the purchase—that is not the ordinary course of business—the ordinary course of business in the market is for a credit to be given of one month prompt, from the date of the sale; it does not follow that the warrants are to be delivered till the prompt ends, unless they are applied for; and then it would be at the option of the party selling, whether he would deliver the warrants with-out the cash or not—I might not hesitate to deliver the warrants, although the prompt had not expired, but I should require the cash for them, and that is the custom in the trade—I am not aware that in our</p>

                  </hi> I am a dealer in tea and coffee, and live at Nos. 1 and 2, Mincing-lane—I knew of the coffees coming by the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>—on the 4th of June I was in the adjoining counting-house tasting the coffee, and heard a conversation between Mr. Oliver and the prisoner; but I did not enter into it, because it was Mr. Oliver's business to sell—Mr. Oliver came to me and said, "Smith has asked for the warrants, to examine them down at the docks with a friend, is there any objection to his having them?"—I said, "No, but he must return them within one hour"—and I believe I said to the prisoner, "Why, Smith, it is not necessary for you to have the warrants to go down to see these coffees, because they have been sampled, and the coffees are here"—he said he had a friend up from Newcastle, who wanted to purchase that description of coffee, and that he being a particular man would not purchase unless he examined the coffee himself—the prisoner then received the warrants from Oliver—I do not think I said anything to him at the time he received them—I think I felt the counting-house, and went into Fenchurch-street—I saw the prisoner again, I should think ten minutes or a quarter if an hour afterwards—I met him very near the corner of Rood-lane, as I was returning—he was not going towards the docks—we ran against each other—I said, "Smith, you are not going to the docks"—he said, "No, Sir, I am going to Gracechurch-street to meet my friend; I have the warrants here," holding up the warrants in his hand; which I knew were the warrants by the marks on them, by which I could distinguish them—I said, "Now mind, if going with your friend to the docks that you return them as you pass, or send them immediately you return from the docks, as we may want them"—he said, "Sir, rest assured I will do so"—we had further conversation, not connected with the business, it was about his getting married—he could not very well come from the docks without coming past Mincing-lane—Mr. Oliver had power to sell or do anything in my business, as much power as myself, I do not interface with these things—after receiving the second letter from the prisoner, I applied with Mr. Oliver at the Mansion-house—on that Saturday evening, as we could not find Smith the whole of the day, we sent on to his counting-house at ten o'clock—the clerk's answer was, that he was not at home—we sent there two or three times, and then applied at the Mansion-house; after which I received this letter, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), on the Monday morning; it was brought by a person</p>

               <p>who is in Court, it is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Buck thorpe, —Sir, —I consider the course you have acted towards me is most shameful and uncalled-for; had I wished to have acted dishonourably towards you, I should hardly have taken up Dixon's bill and offered you a 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill as good as a bank, one only a few days ago; I have paid you a great deal of money, and paid you very punctually too; in the present instance nearly all I owe you has become due at once, but in a very few days you would have been paid, as my prospects are too good for me to throw them away; in regard to the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>, Mr. Oliver had repeatedly pressed me to buy them; I have had the warrants before, as long as I have now had them. On Friday, I thought I had a customer for them for the purpose of sampling; the party could not pay me until I got to Newcastle, and being particularly in want of some money to meet a pressing engagement, I borrowed an amount on them; but this I would not have done if I did not consider them as bought by me, as they really were; as the understanding was, that if I did not sell them I would bring them back again to you; Mr. Oliver even went so far as to say, that if I drew a bill upon the party to whom they were sold, that he was willing to take it—was not this making me the purchaser? I had fully intended to have taken the warrants up again on Monday morning, or paid for them, as I pro<lb/>mised in my note of Saturday evening; but finding I am rather short I have left town, as I originally intended, or at least shall do so by the train this evening; and it now only rests for you to say, whether you will have money for the coffees or the warrants returned; at the same time I candidly tell you that, although I shall now leave town, I will not go home until I receive the invoice of the coffees, as rather than I would run the risk of being placed in the position you threaten, I would put a pistol to my head, or leave the country: my cousin, Mr. Robinson, will give you this; and he only knows where I shall be. If you give him the invoice, and show the confidence which you never had cause to lose, you will not find that confidence misplaced.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any doubt that you may sample coffees, or any other thing, by order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends upon whether warrants are specially endorsed, so that you have a power of getting a written order for the sampling—it would then be an authority, but they are generally sampled by the warrants—sometimes merchants have power from the holder of the warrants to give an order, as many circumstances may occur to prevent your getting the warrants for a week or ten days after you have purchased the coffee—it must be an order from the broker, specially endorsed by the merchant who has imported the coffee, because he is in possession—I may buy coffee to-day and not apply for the warrants until my months has expired—I am not in possession of the warrants until the Satur<lb/>day following; they then present the warrants to me, and I give the money—it is not every day's practice to sample coffee from an order in the name of any person whose name is in the dock-books—it is not constantly or frequently done—it is done sometimes, under peculiar circumstances.</p>

On Friday, the 2nd of July, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner, another man, and a woman came to the shop—the other man asked to see some diamond pins—I took out a tray, and showed it to him—they looked at them—the prisoner took some out—he looked at a large one, and said he wanted something like that—he laid one of the pins down on the counter, and put one into the tray—the other man explained a diamond pin that they wanted, and another article—he acted as an interpreter, and said he wanted a pin with a stone in the centre, and other diamonds round it—the woman took a ring off her finger, and the other man said he wanted a ring like that—my father said he would get the articles by five o'clock that afternoon—they went away, they did not buy anything—after they were gone I missed a diamond pin, worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which had been in the tray which I had shown them—I saw it again at the station the same evening when the prisoner was in custody—this is it, it is my father's.</p>

                  </hi> I am a hosier. I carry on business, and occupy a house in the parish of St. Mildred the Virgin, in the Poultry. On Friday afternoon, the 2nd of July, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop with another man, and a woman—the other man who acted as an interpreter, asked to look at some goods—he desired to have some red and white silk handkerchiefs—I showed him some—the prisoner looked at them, and they talked together—they pointed at another pile of handker<lb/>chiefs—I produced them, they looked at them, and each man pulled a piece of handkerchief out of the fold, and spread it all over the counter over the other goods as if to look at it—the other man then said he would take five handkerchiefs; which I cut off, and did up in paper—they were cut from dif<lb/>ferent pieces—the prisoner then offered me a foreign coin, I said I could not change it—the party who was acting as interpreter said they would call again—the prisoner took back the coin, and they went away—they did not take the handkerchiefs—in about ten minutes I missed some handkerchiefs—I then heard that one of the party had been taken—I went to the station, and saw the prisoner there, and some handkerchiefs, but none of them were mine—I could not tell how many I missed, because we have a very large stock, but I thought I missed some—I heard nothing more of my hand<lb/>kerchiefs till the Saturday week following, when they were brought to my shop by a policeman, who stated that they were found in Coleman-street—there were forty-seven—my young man examined them, and saw</p>

               <p>they were all mine—they had my mark on them—these are them—I can identify every one of them—I examined my stock between that Fri<lb/>day, the 2nd of July, and the Saturday week following, and ascertained that I had missed some, but I could not tell the number that were gone, or exactly of what sort, we have so many sorts—these are all my handkerchiefs, they have the tickets on them with the mark in my own writing—this is one of the pieces that I showed to the prisoner and the other man—this is one piece from which I cut a handkerchief off for them—there were four handkerchiefs on this piece, I cut off one handkerchief for them, and here are now three remaining—my impression is, that these others are the same that I showed to the party, they all bear my shop-mark.</p>

                  </hi> On the 13th of Aug., I and the prisoner, who is my hus<lb/>band, were living at 31, Monkwell-street, near Falcom-square—I remember his coming home between three and four o'clock that afternoon—he was not sober—I told him his dinner was ready—he said he should like to lie down—he did lie down, and told me to rouse him in an hour—I let him lie about an hour and a half—I then awoke him—he came down, and we had tea—we had no quarrel, we were quite comfortable—as I was putting away the tea-things he saw part of his work lying on the table, and said, "Where is the other part?"—I said, "I don't know, you have not left it anywhere, have you?"—he said, "No, I have not," and he then struck me once or twice on my face and back—I got out of the room, and was going down stairs—be<lb/>fore I left the room I saw him take a file in his hand, as if to go into the shop to work—he uses a file—when I had got down about three stairs, I found the file in my back—I took it out, and found some blood—I believe I called out, "O Baxter, see here at my back!"—I did not observe where my husband was—I went into Baxter's room, and my back was washed—my husband came into the room while my back was being washed, and struck me again—I went to Mr. Childs, the surgeon—I am not under his care now.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon. I was sent for to the house, examined Mrs. Smith's back, and found she had received an oblique punctured wound, close on the left border of the shoulder-blade towards the spine—she had lost a considerable quantity of blood—it was a triangular wound, such an instrument as this file would certainly have caused it—I should say it was done with this—I considered it likely to be dangerous; it was over an important artery, if it had not struck against the shoulder-blade it would most likely have entered the lung—the end of the file is not sharp therefore it must have been struck with great force.</p>

On Sunday morning the 1st of August, I was going down Chancery-lane about twenty minutes before five o'clock, and heard a noise at No. 39—I went to the side-door in Cursitor-street, pushed it, and it went open—I got in and saw the prisoner—he had this coat under his arm—these candlesticks were wrapped up in the coat—this ring was in the pocket—this hat was on the prisoner's head—he had exchanged this old one for it, which was left behind; it exactly fits him—I alarmed the house, locked the street door, put the key in my pocket, and said to the prisoner, "I shall search you and see what there is about you"—he pulled out this file, a knife, and a small bag of matches, and said the property was given him by a person to hold till he came back—I said, "If that is the case I shall lock the door and let him knock"—no one knocked—I looked about the premises and found a pane of glass had been broken in a glass door in the lobby—I found the swing window of the water-closet was also broken—the house had been entered by the back kitchen from the area—a person must have dropped from the wall into the</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, living in Great Percy-street, Clerkenwell. On the 3rd of Nov., 1844, between one and three o'clock in the morning, I was called to a house in Constitution-row, Gray's Inn-road, and found there a person, who I afterwards found to be Henry Williams—he was in an insensible state—one of his eyes were swollen—it had a small wound over it, under the eyebrow, within the orbit of the eye, at the corner—the direction of the wound was upwards and backwards.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the 2nd battalion of the fusiller-guards. On Saturday afternoon, the 14th of Aug., I was in Bridcage-walk, at a quarter to two o'clock, coming from Storey's-gate towards Buckinggham Palace, I observed a carriage and pair of horses, with a coachman and a woman sitting on the box—no one was inside—when it was coming by the Wellington Barracks cha<lb/>pel I was about twenty or thirty paces on this side of Queen-square gate—I was close to it when the accident happened—I did not see it came through Buckingham-gate—it is a straight line, but I did not notice it—when I got this side of Queen-square gate I saw it coming up at a full gallop—I was about 130 yards from it when I first saw it—I saw the child in the road before the carriage came up to it, she was crossing the road in the park towards Queen-square gate, coming out of the park into the square—at the time the child came out into the road, the horses were about ten yards from the place of crossing—the child came out running—it was knocked down by the horses, and I saw the wheel pass over the side of its head—I called out to the coachman, "Stop, coachman, stop!"—he must have heard me—he did not seem to take any notice, but still went on—if he had had his eye on his horses he must have seen the child knocked down—he was not doing any<lb/>thing with his horses at the time they went over the child—I saw him whip<lb/>ping them before he came up to the chapel—that was about 100 yards off—they were in a gallop then, he seemed to have the reins right, and his whip was across the reins—I went and took the child up—its eyes were closed, and the blood was pouring out of each ear—I took it to a doctor in Queen-square—the coachman did not in my presence make any effort to pull up the horses—I saw the child in front of the horses before it was struck—I did not see the line of the horses altered, or the least effort made by the coachman to stop them—I did not see him stopped, but I afterwards saw him at the station—he then appeared as if he had been drinking, but he appeared to know what he was about.</p>

                  </hi> I am shoe-manufacture, and live in Queen's-row. On Saturday afternoon, at two o'clock, I was in the neighbourhood of Queen's-row, opposite the end of Arabella-row, Pimlico—I saw a carriage and horses driven by the prisoner, in Birdcage-walk—it is perhaps 150 or 200 yards from Buckingham-gate into Birdcage-walk—I was in a shop, serving—the lashing of the whip caused me to run to the door, and I saw the prisoner's carriage strike my cart, which was standing at the door, knock my pony round, strike my boy, who was in the cart, knock my seat and box out of the cart, and the top, which I carry to keep my goods dry—the horses were gallop<lb/>ing when they passed my cart—I hallooed to him—he did not stop—the boy of the shop ran after him, and caught hold of the reins of his horses—he did pull up before he got to Buckingham-gate—the boy asked him to come back—he did not come back—I put my seat in my cart and drove after him—I drove full trot till I got into the park, and then I whipped my pony and galloped after him as fast as I could make my pony gallop—I think I gained on the carriage, but could not overtake it—before I got to Storey's-gate the accident occurred—I pulled up the little, but I still drove through Storey's-gate, and as I was going along George-street, he was turning and coming back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> His cart was on the wrong side of the road; I could not pass, I caught the other rein and turned it round; there was a wagon on the side, and the cart on the other, and I could not pass them both; I tried to pull up, and could not. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I swear I heard the sound of his whip—that attracted my attention—I heard three or four lashings of the whip.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon, at Westminster Hospital. On the 14th of Aug. the child was brought to me—she was in a state of insensibility, bleeding from the ears, and had a coutusion on the left side of the head, such as would be likely to be occasioned by the passage of a carriage-wheel over it—re-action never came on, and the child died from concussion—I have not the slightest doubt that it died from the bruise on the head.</p>

                  </hi> I am seventeen years old. In July last I lived at the prisoner's house in Keate-street, Spitalfields, and had been living there about four months. I know the prisoner, and also Mary Ann Sullivan, whom he was living with—on Sunday night, the 25th of July, I came back to the house in Keate-street—there was nobody at home—I waited at the door till the prisoner came up—he and Mary Ann Sullivan came up together—Sullivan had been drinking, but not so much as the prisoner—when the door was opened, I went in first, and the prisoner and Sullivan went into the parlour on the ground-floor—I heard the prisoner say something to Sullivan—I could not understand the words—Sullivan said, with an oath, that she would not live with the prisoner any longer—he did not say anything to that, but took up a white-handled knife off the table, and attempted to stab her—he said nothing when he took up the knife—he did not say anything till he had said it down again—he took it up in a passion with the intention of stabbing her—he cut her hand—he was going to put it somewhere about her neck, she put her hand up to save herself, and the knife went across her hand—they were close together—the point of the knife was nearest her throat—he had the handle in his hand—if she had not raised her hand the knife must either have gone to the front or side of her neck—her hand bled very much—the prisoner threw the knife on the table, and said he would do for her—at that time she was stand<lb/>ing in the passage at the door of the room—she did not fall down—she cried out, "Help" and "Murder," and told the prisoner that he had cut her hand—he then struck her, and knocked her down in the passage—I called the po<lb/>liceman.

                  </hi> I was acting as house-surgeon at the London Hospital when Sullivan was brought there—I found an incised wound on the little finger of the left hand—it began on the inside of the finger and went round—it went to the bone—it was a wound that must have been inflicted by some sharp instrument; a small sized knife would have done it—supposing a thrust was made at a person with a weapon of that sort, and the hand was suddenly raised, the injury I have described might have been inflicted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean a thrust, as if by the point of a sword, that the injury would be inflicted in that way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If the hand were placed in that position to prevent a sword or knife coming—the would appeared as if made by the edge of the blade, not by the point—it was on the inside of the little finger of the left hand, at the bottom of the finger, close to the hand—it is just likely that such an injury might have been inflicted by the party seizing the knife and making a grasp at it—I do not think it could be caused by grasping the knife, because the would extended farther round—it is just possible it might—if the knife was grasped, and then it was drawn from the hand, it might be drawn round—the wound went from the inside to the out<lb/>side of the little finger.</p>

                  </hi> I am mistress of the Infant School, in the Maryle<lb/>bone workhouse—on the 22nd of April a child named Mary Ann Allen was brought to the workhouse—I first saw her on the 27th of April, she was in a very destitute state, apparently starved, when given to me—it was very emaciated indeed—it remained under my care till the 30th of May, when it died—it appeared to rally a little, but it was always in a weak and delicate way, and very thin—at first it was unable to play or move about at all, but afterwards it was able to play a little with the other children—while in the workhouse it was allowed wine and arrowroot, and nourishment.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 26, Wells-street, Oxford-street, the prisoner and her husband occupied the back attic of my house—they had two children, one of them was Mary Ann Allen, the deceased—she was about four years of age—the children were both taken together to the Marylebone workhouse—my attention was drawn to the deceased on the 22nd of April, by a person of the name of Hobson—I went up to the back attic, and when I came to the door the eldest little girl was inside, crying—I requested her to open the door—she said, the mother was gone out, and had locked them in—the door was locked—I went into my shop, got a bunch of old keys, and opened it—I found the eldest child sitting upright on the sacking, and the youngest lying on her side, close by the other—they were in the most dirty beastly state that I ever saw, and the room was equally as bad—there was a large tub</p>

               <p>standing by the side of the bed, full of human soil—it had been there, I suppose, for six months, from the stench; I could not go into the room for some time—there was a large baking-dish underneath the bed, also full, and some in another corner of the room, in an old saucepan without a handle—there was nothing in the room but the bedstead, an old table, a chest of drawers, and an old fender—the children were literally naked, they had nothing on them but what appeared to be a bit of calico, as black as my hat, round their shoulders—they were both in that state—I received information from one of them—the prisoner came to lodge there on the 18th of March, 1835, and lodged there until this time—I do not know how the youngest child was treated—I could very often hear the eldest crying—I never heard the youngest cry, as she was so very weak—I do not know of my own knowledge that she did have a proper supply of food, I have every reason to believe that she did not—I have never had any conversation with the prisoner upon the subject—the father was in the hospital for three weeks altogether—I think he went on the 22nd of April, but I did not take particular notice—I know he was in the hospital at this time—the children remained together in the room, till I had the prisoner taken for robbing the apartment—they were taken to the work-house at eleven o'clock that night—I seldom had an opportunity of seeing at what time the prisoner came in and out—she used to go out generally at eight o'clock in the morning, and sometimes came home again about one or two, but not always, and then went out again—she was a charwoman at two houses in Carburton-street—I think the husband was there in the morning as I took the children away at night—I think he went to the hospital on that day, for I knew he was going to the hospital, and that made me go into the room.</p>

                  </hi> I lodge at No. 26, Wells-street. I remember the child being taken to the workhouse—I cannot say how long before that, the father had been to the hospital—I do not know whether he had been at home on that day—I was called by the last witness to look at the child—I never observed the prisoner beat her; she did not attend to it, or take a mother's care of it; quite the reverse, she neglected it in every possible way, never cleaned or dressed it—it was hardly ever fed, and then only with food of the worst description—it was occasionally brought down to my school and left with me, once a month or so—when I first saw the child two years and a half ago, it was in a very weakly state, and covered with sores; it could not stand.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160141"/>
               <p>it was in its mother's arms covered with a piece of green baize; it had a scabbed face—I conceive that the child was slighted and neglected by its mother; though she has repeatedly told me that the children were fed better than I was, every day of my life—she certainly had the means of giving them food, and supporting them with credit, if she had thought proper—I know that her husband was out of work for a few weeks; but she told me that even when he was out of work he used to bring her home 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week; out of work, or in work, she told me she always had that, and she had coals every Saturday night from some charitable institution—when her husband was not employed at the coach-making, I understood from her that he acted as tap<lb/>room man, or something at a public-house—when she brought the children to school she used to give the elder girl three halfpence, to buy their dinner with—I was called up by the landlord on the day the child was taken to the work-house—she was lying as perfectly naked as she was born, and the bones were protruding through the skin—the skin was actually broken at the bottom part of its back, and the bone was bare—the prisoner was always very meanly clad herself—I cannot say that I ever saw her perfectly sober—I occasionally saw her during the last week or so before the child was removed, but I never saw her perfectly sober—I have repeatedly spoken to her about the children, and she has told me to mind my own business, that they were better fed than I was.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Rich, who keeps the Windsor Castle public-house, in Albany-street. The prisoner was in our service for nearly six months—on the 16th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, as she was at work in the kitchen, she complained of being very ill with the spasms—I gave her a little brandy-and-water, sent for the doctor, and told her to go and lie down on the bed till he came, as she was so ill—she went up stairs—I went up a little while afterwards, and saw her—she said she was better—I did not stop long in the room, I left immediately, and did not notice anything—I went up again in twenty minutes or half-an-hour, with the doctor—she was not undressed, but lying on the bed—I heard a strange noise when I went into the room, and asked her what it was—she said it was merely the water coming in outside the window—I cannot describe what noise it was—she told the doctor she was much better, he left, and sent her some medicine—she got up again that same evening, and did her work—on the following Friday I found what had been the matter, and accused her of having had a child—she said she had—I asked her if it was alive—she said, yes, it was alive, and the noise I had heard when I was in the room, was the child under the bed, and the hand-basin covered over it—I asked what she did with the child—she said she had given a man outside 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take it away and bury it—I told her I would not believe any such improbable story, for there was no man that would take charge of such a thing and bury it for the sake of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a policeman was sent for on the Saturday, but before he was sent for, I told her it was no use her persisting in that falsehood, for I did not believe it, that the child was either in one of her boxes, or in the water-closet, that we were going to have them both searched, therefore she had better tell me what she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160144"/>
               <p>had done with it—she said the child was not in the house—I said if it was not in the house, it was certainly in the waster-closet—she said it was, that she had taken it down in the slop-pail on Saturday morning, and put it into the waster-closet, that she had taken the stick that we keep to close the shutters with, and <hi rend="italic">poked</hi> it down as low as she could in the water-closet—I asked her about the baby's clothes, she said she had none provided for it, that she was not aware she was in that way at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The water was coming in at the time mistress came up; if the child had been alive, which it was not, it would have been impossible for it to have made a noise like that; I am quite certain that it was not alive, for I never saw it; as it came from me in the chamber utensil, so it remained. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was water coming in at the window at the time, but that was not the sound I heard—it was not a child's cry, it was as if a person was making a noise in the throat—there were two utensils in the room—when I first went into the room the prisoner was sitting on one, and was being sick into the other—I did not notice them when I went into the room with the doctor—she had put it under the bed and covered it over with the hand-basin, but I did not notice it—it was her duty to empty those things—she was lying on the bed at the time I heard the noise, with the blanket and counter-pane thrown over her.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Little Albany-street, and work for Mrs. Rich. On Thursday, the 22nd of July, I saw the prisoner—she told me she was very much distressed in her mind—I said that nothing distressed me but poverty, and I was afraid when my little one was born that I should have nothing to put it in—she said, "I had plenty of things with my baby"—I said, "Have you had a baby, then?"—she said, yes, she had one—I said, "Was it alive?"—she said, "Yes, it was born alive"—I asked what she had done with it—she said she had sent it away—she afterwards told me that when her mistress came into the room with the doctor, it was making a noise, and her mistress asked her what it was, and she said it was the gurgling of the water that was coming into a water-closet close by her bed-room window—I cleaned out the prisoner's bed-room the same day, noticed a large make on the floor close by the bedside—it had been wiped up, and the carpet put over it.</p>

                  </hi> I am assistant to Mr. Cooper, who was surgeon to the workhouse at Camden-town. The prisoner was brought there—I asked her if she had had a child—she said she had—I asked her if it was born alive—she said it was—I asked how she had disposed of it—she said she delivered herself in the chamber utensil, then put it under the bed, and covered it with the washhand basin, and next morning carried it down to the water-closet, and deposited it there—I asked whether she had prepared any clothes—she said she had not, that she did not know she was in the family way—I saw the body of the child—it had the umbilical cord and the after-birth attached to it—it was altogether—that would indicate a rapid birth—it might have taken place into the chamber utensil—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the child—I opened the chest, and found the lungs of a florid red colour, and on cutting into them I found that they contained blood and air, from which I infer that the child had breathed—I thought it was born at its full period—there were no marks of injury about it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tailor and draper, and live in Mon<lb/>mouth-street, Birmingham. In the beginning of July the prisoner came to my shop, and selected a coat and trowsers—he requested the coat should be put by and left a shilling on it—the trowsers he wanted to take away—they came to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered in payment this check for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be drawn by Lord Skelmersdale—he indorsed this one the back of it, "Pay to Mr. Findley, C. Wheeler"—from the smallness of the amount I suspected it was not genuine, and I said it was not regular to take these things in busi<lb/>ness, but if he would leave it I would remit it to my brother—he agreed to that at once, and he showed me this letter enclosed in an envelope—he called on the Saturday evening afterwards, took the trowsers, and I paid him the balance, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was there any objection on my part when I brought the cheek, to give my address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the slightest—it was my proposition</p>

               <p>that you should indorse it, and you agreed to it—I did not sufficiently examine it to know whether the indorsement and the body of the check are the same writing—I sent it up to my brother to get it cashed—I believe your address was found to be correct—I made no enquiry as to who or what you were—I had a young man in my employ who went by the name of Frederick, he is not here.</p>

                  </hi> I am a superannuated officer of Government. On the night of Tuesday, the 3rd of Aug., I went to the Seabright Arms, Bethnal-green, and had a little porter—I left at a little after nine o'clock—when I was leaving, the landlord recommended me to go down a passage, which is not further from the Seabright Arms than across this Court—when I got a little way down, four men rushed upon me, pinned me against the brick-wall, and began to search me—I stood very quietly, and allowed them to do it—while they were doing it, I noticed their faces—the prisoner was one, I have no doubt of it—there was a light directly opposite—they put their hands into my pockets, and took out about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a pocket-book, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160163"/>
               <p>some memorandums—I never attempted to prevent their doing it; if I had been a younger man I should—I was not at all afraid—I am seventy-eight years old—when they had got my money and book, they ran off as fast as they could—I took the shortest end of the passage, and sent a hue and cry after them as soon as possible—I said to some one, "If you make haste, you will over<lb/>take them before they get to Hackney-road"—I then went back to the Seabright Arms—I was a little alarmed, and I called for a glass of water—in less than ten minutes the prisoner was brought back—he said he hoped I would not prose<lb/>cute him, he was not the one that robbed me—I had not said anything about robbing.</p>

About half-past nine, or twenty<lb/>five minutes to ten o'clock that night, I was on duty near Elisabeth-street, Hackney-road, which is only across the road from the passage—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw two men running across from the passage—the prisoner was one of them—as soon as they saw me they separated—the other one ran on the other side—I lost him, and gave chase to the prisoner—I was not two yards from him the whole way—I caught hold of him—another policeman came up in the other direction—he said, "Let me alone, I know nothing about it"—I had not at that time said anything to him, for I did not know what had happened—I took him to Hackney-road, and inquired—I heard that a gentleman at the Seabright Arms had lost his money, and said, "You must come there, and we will see"—he made no answer, I think, but while he was going he said it was a shame he should be dragged along the street in that disgraceful manner—when I got near the Seabright Arms, he said, "It is not me, if you lock me up I shall be ruined"—I said, "Hold your tongue; which gentleman has been robbed?"—Manning said, "I have been robbed"—he had not opened his mouth before the prisoner said what he did.</p>

Now, Miss, I shall write to your brother and explain all to him, and write to your family and explain all to them, unless you do one thing, and that only shall save you. I know of a very poor family who is in the greatest distress, brought on by the bad conduct of the father, who died six months age all through his extravagant ways, by keeping another woman, and suffering his <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> wife and family to want.

                  </hi> I am in the employ of Isaac Jacobson, of No. 112, Oxford-street—on Wednesday morning, the 4th of Aug., the prisoner came to our shop, shortly before eleven o'clock, and asked to took at some gold watches—I showed him some—he asked if I would have any objection to send some to the Boar and Castle, for his father to look at—he selected three—I went with them to the Boar and Castle, and went up stairs with the prisoner into a bed-room—after I had been there some time, from his man<lb/>ner I began to get very uneasy, and asked him if the gentleman who wished to see the watches, had not better step into the shop, as it was only a few doors off, and he would see a great variety to look at—he said he would see—he went out of the room, came and said if I would go with him to his father's room he would look at them and choose them—I walked across the room, and we met near the door—we were walking out together, side by side, through the door-way, and just as we got under the door-way, he struck me two or three blows on the side of the head with a life-preserver, which I produce—he laid hold of my left hand which had the watches in it—by a sud<lb/>den jerk I pushed my hands away from him, and, turning round at the same time, caught his had falling on my head with the life-preserver again—the watches were partly in his hand and partly in mine—they were never out of my possession—he never got them—I called out. "Murder!" and held him till the waiter came to my assistance, and he was taken into custody—this is the hat I had on at the time—(<hi rend="italic">producing it, very much broken</hi>)—this is the effect of the blows—it is not beaten through—there is no hole in it—I had a large bump on my head, and I was constantly bathing it for a fortnight afterwards—I have been under the doctor's care ever since.</p>

On the 7th of Aug., about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was in Grace's-alley, Wellclose-square, and saw the prisoner there striking a young women—I said, "Why not leave the women alone?"—he then left her, and seized me by the neck-handkerchief, twisted it round, and nearly choked me—a constable came up, and sent him one way, and me another—when I had got about 150 yards from the spot, he came running back—he ran past me about a yard or two, then turned suddenly round, and aimed a blow at me, which I thought was with his fist—he then stepped little way back; and as he rose his hand a second time, I caught the reflection of the blade of a knife, or some sharp instrument—it was under a gas-lamp—I then hit him, and knocked him down—he aimed a second blow, which cut me slightly on the neck—I found my arm cut about an inch, or rather better—I was taken to the hospital, and am there still.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had no knife on me, nor was any found—there were sailors and others round—he had me on the ground, and two men were on me—they took my handkerchief and cap from me, and he collared me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman H</hi> 155.) A little before twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the seventh of Aug., I saw the prisoner and prosecutor scuffling together in Grace's-alley—they had hold of each other by the collar—the prisoner wanted me to take charge of the prosecutor for striking him—I separated them and sent one one way and one the other—I then went on my beat—I was fetched back by a female, and saw the prosecutor bleeding very much from the arm, stating that he was stabbed—a house was pointed out to me where the prisoner had gone—I gained admittance, got a candle, searched the house, and found him in a water-closet in the kitchen—the door was closed—I saw no knife—when I was called back I believe they were chiefly the prosecutor's friends about him—the prisoner was without his cap the first time.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I examined the prosecutor's arm, and found an incised wound about an inch in length, and little more than that in depth—it must have been inflicted with a very sharp instrument—there was also a superficial wound at the back of the neck, I should say inflicted by the same instrument—the wound on the arm was such a one as would be received in parrying a blow—it was followed by inflammation and erysipelas, and was likely to have been very serious—as the man was of a bad habit of body.</p>

On the 27th of July last, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, in consequence of instruction I received, I went to the station-house at Bow-street, and after being there searched by a policeman, I went to No. 51, Holywell-street, Strand, followed by the policeman—I went into the shop and asked for a book, which the prisoner showed me, and which I produce—I paid a guinea for it—I then left the shop, and went, closely followed by the policeman who had searched me, to the Society's chambers, where he took from my pocket the book I had bought of the defendant.</p>

Please to look to this; the hint is enough to you, I know. Give us a call here soon; the parties named are Sarah Gale, Thomas Cornelius Wright, and Ann Gale")—That related to an indictment that was brought, or proposed to be brought, in the Queen's Bench—information of it was given me by Wells, and of course I looked up to you to protect Mrs. Gale.</p>

I went out, and detected Jane committing a robbery—I then went with an officer to the prisoner's mother's house, and found these flowers, and other things—I saw the prisoner with her hand under the bed, between the bed and the sacking—I said, "Let me look there?"—she had previously said there was nothing there belonging to me—I there found some other things—she said her mother brought the flowers from Kingsland.</p>

                  </hi> I am barman at the Golden Horse, in Aldersgate-street. On Friday night, the 14th of Aug., the prisoners came to the house about twelve o'clock, they said they came from the Blackwall Railway, and asked for a bed—they went to bed, I went to bed about one o'clock—I heard them talking in a suppressed whisper, though I could not understand what they said—the next morning I was down in the bar, Mrs. Witcher came down, and said there was somebody in Mrs. Fitzgibbon's room, for she tried to open the door, and it was pushed against her—I went up and saw nobody, I then came down to my room, which is on the second-floor, and found my clothes where gone out of the box—I came down and fastened the front door—I said to some coal-heavers who were there, "Don't let anybody out, we have been robbed"—I let the officer know, then ran up, and saw Williams putting some things under the bed where the prisoners had slept—I went to the bed, and found a bunch of keys—I called Mrs. Fitzgibbon, and she iden<lb/>tified them—I then found these trinkets under their bed—I had seen Williams putting them under the bed, Saunders was standing by him—my boots, coat, waistcoat, and other things, were found by Mrs. Fitzgibbon hidden in my bed—there was nobody who could have removed these things but the two pri<lb/>soners.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Whitewood, of South-street, Greenwich—the prisoner was in my service. On the 9th of Aug., a gentleman called to pay me some rent—he paid me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I put it all into a pocket-book, and placed it in a sideboard-drawer, in the parlour—the prisoner knew of it—I said before her that I had received it—she had access to the room—the drawer was left open—next day I placed the pocket-book under lock and key, without examining it—I do not know whether the note was in it then or not—next day, Wednesday the 11th, I went to the pocket-book, and missed the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—nobody but the prisoner and my daughter knew anything about it—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner said, in my presence, she had not seen it—on Friday, the 13th, she came into the kichen, and asked me if I would forgive her if she paid me back the whole of the money—I asked her if she took the money—she said, "No"—I said, "Can I receive of you what you say you have never taken of me? No, I cannot do it"—in about a minute she came again, begged me to forgive her, and said she had taken the note and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had told her that day, that if she had been tempted to take it, if she would replaced it, I would forgive her—I said nothing about her confessing, only about replacing the money—I sent for a policeman in the evening, and gave her in charge for something else—she is an orphan—I had no character with her—mine is the first place she has been at.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman R</hi> 56.) I was on duty at Woolwich Dockyard on Friday evening, the 30th of July, at the Watergate—my attention was drawn to the prisoner Daniels, who was on the upper deck of the ship called the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi>, which was lying in the stream opposite the dockyard—she is a hulk, for the accommodation of seamen while ships are fitting out—the <hi rend="italic">Spite<lb/>ful</hi> steamboat was lying alongside the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi>—the men on board the <hi rend="italic">Spiteful</hi> had been paid off the some day, and there were none on board—I saw Daniels passing some rope and canvas down the accommodation-ladder of the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi> into a boat, which was between the two vessels, moored at the bot<lb/>tom of the gangway, alongside of the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi>—I saw one man in the boat, but I cannot say who it was, he appeared to be assisting in putting the things into the boat—I then procured the assistance of Sergeant Glascock, and went to pursue the prisoners in a boat—I had noticed Daniels get into the boat, and about ten minutes before the boat left, I noticed that there were four other men in it—when I got near to the boat I saw the prisoner Daniels in it, the four rowers, a female, and a man who is boatswain of the <hi rend="italic">Spiteful</hi> steam-ship—they</p>

On the 6th of July, about twenty-five minutes past ten at night, I saw her in the yard—she had taken a drop, but was not too far gone then—she was able to walk—she had the child in her arms, holding it round, close to her—I took it out of her arms, and said, "Take care of your child, and yourself too"—she did not seem satisfied to part with it, and I gave it her back again, settled it to her in her arms, and closed the shawl up—she was not holding it in a dangerous way, but the shawl was hanging down, and I settled it about the baby—she then went towards the Bull public-house, and I lost sight of her—I saw her again in about five minutes, going by the thoroughfare that there was—there is a drain there, she missed her footing, and fell down with the baby in her arms—the baby happened to come on its head; it fell under her—I went towards her, she picked herself up imme<lb/>diately, and went through the thoroughfare—I heard the child groan after she rose—I did not see her again till the Tuesday morning following.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Digweed, a grocer, of High-street, Lambeth. On Saturday night, the 10th of July, about half-past ten, I was behind the counter—the prisoner came in very tipsy, and staggering—he asked how I did, then turned round from me to the boy Blake, who was sitting on a sugar-tub by the door, and began pulling him about, roughing up his hair on each side, and saying, "You are the chap that serves out the coffee"—he pulled him off the tub, and pushed him against the street-door, he then dragged him back to the counter, then took him round the head with his arm, and the boy being shorter than himself, he had that power over him that he reeled him round and round, and I thought both would have fallen into the street—he took the boy off his feet—they both went out into the street together, and as they went out, they met an old lady, who was stepping on the edge of the path with her supper-beer in her hand, and with one blow they went against her, and knocked her backwards—they were both together at the time the blow was struck—the prisoner had the boy round as he went out of the shop, and went against the old lady—it is a small shop, and the counter is near the door—I could see pretty plainly, there was a lamp alight at a public-house opposite—the old lady turned out to be Mrs. Allsworth, who I knew very well as living four doors off—I saw her fall, with her jug in her hand, as if she had fallen from some high place, she fell direct on the back of her head—I ran out to her, and heard her say, "Oh my head; this will be my death-blow"—I lifted her up, and she was taken home—the pri<lb/>soner</p>

               <p>went away as far as William-street, which is one door from us, he was afterwards brought back by the boy—Blake said to him, "Come back, and see what you have done; you have knocked the old woman down"—his reply was, "What am I to do? am I to pay for 1/2 oz. of coffee? if I have hurt you, mother, God bless you!" and away he went—he was quite drunk—thinking she was not much hurt, I let him go—I went home with the de<lb/>ceased, and saw her bonnet taken off, it was very much dented in at the back—there was no blood—she was still groaning, "Oh, my head"—her daughter laid her on the bed—she died next morning.</p>

                  </hi> I am a labourer, and live at Norwood. On the 12th of Aug.

                  </hi> I am the wife of Joseph Barnes, and live at Walworth. On Thursday evening, the 13th of July, I was in the Walworth-road, at nearly eleven o'clock—I passed up to Walworth-terrace—the place was quite clear, there was no one before me—all at once two men came from behind and prevented my walking on—one kept before me and kept looking in my face, the other was by my side—I had my hand on my pocket, and presently my shawl got off—one of the men looking very impudently in my face caused me to look towards the terrace—if I went one way to avoid them, they went the same way—the prisoner is not the one who looked in my face, he kept close at my side, and the other just before me—in a moment I was left quite by myself—I put my hand into my pocket, and my purse was gone—I had but a few moments before been speaking to Mr. Tarry, and given him a little order—I had my purse then—I am sure the prisoner is one of the men that was there—he had a dark coat on, either black or blue—I lost this check, a sovereign, a half-crown, and my purse—I went the next morning to the Bank to stop the check, and saw the prisoner there—I was there from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, waiting in an inner room—as soon as the check was presented, a gentleman brought it to me—I said it was mine—that was exactly nine o'clock, the moment the Bank opened.</p>

               <p>went in to the tap-room, put the bucket down, and said, "I think I will have a pint of porter"—I served him—he stood at the bar and drank it—there were many persons came in for their supper-beer—he remained in my shop up to twelve o'clock, till shutting-up time—I was there all that time—it was impossible for me to leave—I am sure the prisoner was there during the whole of that time, up to the closing—a next door neighbour, Mr. Dickindon, came in—the prisoner asked him if he would have a drink of his porter, which he did, and then Mr. Dickinson called for another, which, to the best or my recollection, was pint of stout, and then he said he would have a pipe of tobacco, and asked me to give him a pipe, which I did—he had his own tobacco—he was there drinking, smoking, and talking, all that time—when he left, he left with the bucket; he went behind, fetched the water, and went home—I do not know that I know Manor-place, Walworth-road—I am not much acquainted with London—the prisoner came from Bath, the same town as I did—I have known him from a child—I never knew anything against his character—I was examined before the Magistrate, and Mr. Dickinson also—they came to my house the next morning, and said the prisoner was appre<lb/>hended for a robbery that took place at eleven o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> I am a carman. The prisoner was in my employ—on the 27th of July I employed him to do Mr. Barber's work—I afterwards missed a nose-bag—I was in bed when they came and told about this—my wife called me up, and I said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, here is another serious case"—I got an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>
