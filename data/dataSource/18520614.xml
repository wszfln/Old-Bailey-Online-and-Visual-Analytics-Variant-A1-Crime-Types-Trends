I am a deacon of Enon Chapel, and was so in 1840 and 1841—I am the person mentioned as the trustee in the second deed—I was appointed trustee in 1843, in the place of Jesse Meakins, who died—the defendant was my co-trustee—on 29th Dec, 1847, I went to Mr. Gwenap's house, and met Dr. Burns there—I did not go with him—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bears my signature to it, and this is Dr. Burns's sig<lb/>nature, I believe—I do not know whose writing the body of it is—(<hi rend="italic">this being read was a declaration, dated</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th Dec.,</hi> 1847, <hi rend="italic">by Jabez Burns and George East, as trustees of the deed; that they were fully aware that Mr. Gwenap had executed the same to meet legal difficulties, but designing that the annuities should not be paid till after his death, as during his life he contributed largely to the charities of the chapel</hi>)—I find Mr. Gwenap's writing on the back of it—I do not remember who gave it to me to sign, or the particular circumstances which transpired on that occasion; in fact, I had really forgotten the existence of the document.</p>

I am the youngest daughter of the late Mr. Thomas Gwenap, who died in Nov. 1850—I was a party to this suit in Chancery, to set aside the Annuity Deed—my father was in his eighty-sixth year when he died—I know Dr. Burns very well—he is the pastor of Enon Chapel, in Little Church-street—I know his handwriting—the signature to this deed, of 1839, is his—I remember this deed being executed by my father, in 1839—the defendant knew about that deed, and had conversation with my father about it—I have heard them conversing about it—that was about the year 1839, and, afterwards, on more than one occasion, I have heard it said that the money was not to be payable till his death—my father used to say that to Dr. Burns—he may have said it more than once, but not that I remember—that was about 1839, just about the time of the execution of the deed—I was for some years superintendant of a Sunday school, connected with the chapel; and I was treasurer of late years, when my father was not able to attend to it—I never received any money for the school under that deed, from my father—to my knowledge he never paid anything to Dr. Burns, under the deed—I never</p>

               <p>heard Dr. Burns ask for anything to be paid under that deed—I think my father had known Dr. Burns about fifteen or sixteen years—they were con<lb/>stantly in the habit of seeing each other for many years—my father contri<lb/>buted to the chapel—he has given Dr. Burns moneys for the use of the chapel, but when he was able he used to attend the chapel, and give it himself—to the best of my belief, he was a trustee of the chapel—at one time he took an active part in the chapel—I afterwards took an active part in it—I saw the probate of my father's will—it was in the house with the other deeds and papers, and they were all given up—the deed of 1839 remained in my father's hands after it was executed, for some years, until he let a sister of mine have it, a Mrs. Way, in the Isle of Wight—she is a plaintiff in the second suit—Mr. Van Sandau, who is now the attorney of Dr. Burns, acted for some time as my attorney—he was changed after the second suit—Mr. Lewis was my sister's attorney under the second suit—she filed a bill to set aside this deed—prior to the second suit Mr. Van Sandau was acting for me as well as for Dr. Burns—he acted from the beginning for the defendants as well as the plaintiffs—Dr. Burns has now about l,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his hands, derived from my father's estate—he has not told me so, but I know so—my father was possessed of three or four houses, and also a valuable collection of pictures—Dr. Burns has the money; I have not got any—we have not been paid our half year's money—Dr. Burns is the executor under my father's will—Mr. Chapman was a co-executor; he resigned, and Dr. Burns is the sole acting executor—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the memorandum produced</hi>) I remember the night this was signed; it was signed in the parlour of my father's house, in Grove-road, by Dr. Burns and Mr. East—I was not in the room at the time—I was in the house—I do not know any reason why I was not there—I saw it lying on the table—I know this is Dr. Burns' signature—I had heard conversation between him and my father, that this document was to be signed to protect his family from any arrears after my father's death—neither I or my sister, or any of our family, have any control whatever over my father's property—I remember my father signing this check for 1,045<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in June 1850—I distinctly recollect the circumstances under which it was signed—Dr. Burns was dining with us, and he said to my father that after dinner he should want him to give him a check for the amount of arrears on the deed, and my father said, "I suppose you have been taking advice?"—Dr. Burns said he had, and after dinner Dr. Burns dictated the check to my father, and he wrote it as he was told, cutting it out of the further end of the check book, the last leaf—it was arranged between Dr. Burns and my father, that this check was to be presented at a meeting at the chapel in the evening, and it was to be returned, as it was a mere matter of form to secure himself and Mr. East the co-trustee from any claims that any one might make on them, for the various charities in the deed—he did return the check in the evening, and when it was brought back, I asked my father, in the presence of Dr. Burns, what I should do with it, and I also asked Dr. Burns what I should do with it, and he told me I might keep it or destroy it—my father said I might destroy it, it was of no consequence—I did not do so, as it had my father's handwriting on it, I preserved it in a little box, and put it in a drawer with some other papers—I do not remember anything passing about the date of the check—when Dr. Burns asked my father to give him the check, my father said he was never poorer in his life, and if it went to his bankers there would not be money enough to pay it, nor if he took all the money there was in the house besides—after my father's death Dr. Burns asked me what I had done with check, if I had destroyed it—I said "You told me I might destroy it"—he said, "Have you destroyed it?"—I said no, I</p>

               <p>had kept it—he asked me to give it him, which I did—that was not long after my father's death—I heard that my sister was about filing the second bill—I had no conversation with Dr. Burns about it—he told me at one time that he thought the deed would not be maintained—I have ceased to be a member of Enon Chapel—I sent in my resignation to Mr. East on 5th April last—I found this memorandum of 1847 shortly after my father's death—I had seen it previously, when he put it into a little French table, and there I found it—I knew where it was—Mr. Van Sandau was my attorney during the time I had it in my possession—I handed it to my sister, Mrs. Bishop, in March last, at her request—I have seen Mr. Burns since I resigned as a member of his congregation, but have had no personal communication with him—I have had letters—I had been a member of the chapel between fifteen and sixteen years—I received these two letters from him—(<hi rend="italic">letters read</hi>—"To Miss Gwenap, 29th April, 1852. Dr. Burns begs to inform Miss Gwenap that her letter to him of this morning is entirely unsatisfactory; and therefore, as he has to appear before the City Magistrate at the Guildhall Court against Robert Bishop to-morrow at 12 o'clock, and intends at the same time to take out a summons or warrant against Miss Gwenap, he feels it his duty to state that he will not be satisfied without a further letter, in which she will solemnly pledge herself to cease her malicious defamations against his character, and her deep regret that she has again assailed the reputation of Miss----. He wishes her to know that Mr. Underwood is privy to this, and went with him to the solicitor yesterday. Dr. Burns will not assuredly take any measures beyond this note to avert the just punishment which a trial before the Criminal Court of the Old Bailey must award. He has already called Mrs. Best's attention to the fact, that he will be compelled to call her as his chief evidence in reference to Miss Gwenap's guilt, for conspiracy and defamation, and which is still more fully ratified by her letters in Dr. Burns' possession. Dr. Burns deeply regrets that he cannot secure or retain a Christian reputation on other terms; if he were a private person, he might be indifferent to such slanders, but as a Christian minister he cannot and will not allow the friends of religion to be surprised at the evil reports Miss Gwenap has circulated. Dr. Burns begs to say that he knows of no greater or more atrocious crime than to slander a spotless person, who for weeks, with a few exceptions, has been confined to a sick room; and that Miss----was thus confined in her brother's house in Rochester, where Miss Gwenap states she was in constant company with Dr. Burns. As Dr. Burns will leave his study for the City at 10 to-morrow morning, Friday, 30th, Miss Gwenap will take such steps as she deems best." <hi rend="italic">The following paper was enclosed in the letter</hi>: "The points upon which Dr. Burns requests Miss Gwenap's solemn and truthful declaration are the following: 1st. That Dr. Burns never did influence her father in regard to the bequests to the chapel; 2nd. That Dr. Burns never did induce him to leave Miss Gwenap less, that he might give the more to the chapel; 3rd. That Dr. Burns never did conspire or arrange with her father to evade the law, or to deprive the family of his property to advantage the chapel; 4th. That Miss Gwenap deeply regrets that such reports should prevail, and will endeavour to correct them; 5th. That Miss Gwenap will never again assail the Christian reputation of Dr. Burns; 6th. That Miss Gwenap deeply regrets having circulated the report concerning Miss----, and will never speak to the disparagement of that person again." "May 7th, 1852. Dr. Burns begs to inform Miss Gwenap that he has been waiting for a reply to his last communication, and would not have sent this note till the affair of Bishop had been settled; but as Mr. Jardine, of Bow-street, has this day held Bishop to bail to appear next Friday, it is not Dr. Burns' intention to wait</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185206140009"/>
               <p>till then, and therefore he begs to apprise you that unless you apologise for the untrue and defamatory statements you have made, and—have made, and engage to abstain from such a course in future, he must demand that justice from a legal tribunal which you refuse to give.")—my father died in June, 1850—at the time the check was dictated to him by Dr. Burns in Nov. he was very feeble, and in very poor health.</p>

Dr. Burns, the minister of a chapel in New Church-street, and that strange doings had been known to take place—she indicted the letter herself—to the best of my belief, I received Dr. Burns' letters after the dismissal of the case before Mr. Jardine—I was before Mr. Jardine on 6th April—I received the letters before this indictment was preferred.</p>

               <p>in the suit—he was made a party to it, after it commenced—the whole context of the will was such that no executor could safely have acted under it, except under the sanction of the Court; almost every part of the will required the consideration and decision of the Court—the assent or dissent of the Attorney-General is not on the face of the record—I have a note from the Attorney-General's solicitor telling me Mr. James' opinion—the suit was instituted, and on July 15th, 1851, a decree was made, directing a reference to the Master to inquire whether any, and what proceedings should be taken, with a view to set aside the rent charge, and by whom—under that decree I carried into the Master's Office the state of facts, which I have here, on the part of the plaintiffs, alleging the rent charge to be valid on the face of it, but under the circumstances invalid; and on the part of Dr. Burns I carried in a submission, admitting the general accuracy of the plaintiffs' state of facts, that although he was not prepared to admit the invalidity of the rent charge, yet if the Attorney-General would consent, he was prepared to release, because he deprecated any proceedings to set it aside—I have the examined copies of both the hills in the two suits, and the original decree in that suit, referring it to the Master, with the Master's own endorse<lb/>ment on it—in consequence of a difference of opinion on the part of the Attorney-General and Mr. Rolt, who was consulted, matters were forced to go on—the answer was filed, and on the admissions in the answer the decree was made—the answer was before the reference to the Master—I was at Bow-street on 5th April—Dr. Burns was there on two charges of perjury, one in the suit of Gwenap and Burns, and the other on his answer in Way and Burns—Mr. Bishop was present, and was examined as a witness—the case was dis<lb/>missed without calling on Dr. Burns—on 27th April, when leaving my office, I found this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which is in Bishop's writing.</p>

In money, and the rest consists of the leasehold premises and the rents—I do not believe there is 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his possession, but I am not prepared to state the amount—there have been receipts and payments—under the will, three daughters are entitled to annuities, payable out of the rents annually—the other property is all disposed of—three of the grandchildren take an interest out of the income, and the rest was given for charitable purposes, which is in part void—the first half-year's annuity has been paid to the relations; the second has not, because the principal part of the premises are out of tenancy, and because there are not rents to pay them—with the exception of several small legacies which have been paid, the great bulk is for different charitable purposes connected with the chapel—the date of the endorsement of the will is 10th July, 1849—the residuary legatees are Dr. Burns and Mr. Chapman, who has renounced—I believe the case did not take much more than half an hour to an hour's investigating before the Alderman before it was dismissed—I believe some letters of mine, and this letter also, were read by him—to the beet of my belief, the case did not occupy an hour—Mr. Lewis was the attorney at Bow-street for Mrs. Way—the suit of Gwenap and Burns was instituted for the purpose of invalidating the deed—afterwards a second suit was instituted of Way and Burns—a decree was made in Gwenap and Burns, raising the question—that was a friendly suit, instituted by all the family, including the Ways—the deed is in course of invalidation now—Dr. Burns still remains trustee—it is still in course of litigation in the suit of Gwenap and Burns—I should state that it was not possible in either suit to declare the deed invalid—the only decree that could be made was the decree which was made referring to the Master—the probability is that the first suit would have been over already, if it had not been for the institution of the second suit—that was a hostile suit, which has been stayed by the order of the Court, on account of their own statement and Dr. Burns' statement—I mean distinctly to swear that the suit was instituted by me in the utter conviction that the deed was absolutely bad, and that this suit would necessarily invalidate it—the several answers were put in for the purpose of the administration of the suit, with a view to determine the validity of the deed—Dr. Burns deprecates the continuance of the deed—he has sought to got rid of it, and he will not seek in</p>

               <p>any way to establish it; so much so, that I laid the case before Mr. Rolt, and sent a copy of it to the Attorney-General's solicitor, in order that Mr. Rolt might persuade Mr. James that there was no possible chance of main<lb/>taining the deed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a minister of a Baptist congregation at Enon Chapel—this is my seventeenth year—Mr. Gwenap was not a member of that congregation when I went, he became a member afterwards—I was very inti<lb/>mately acquainted with him—before the deed in question was executed I knew something of the purposes for which it was intended—Mr. Gwenap was in a state of very delicate health, and he intimated to me his purpose to consider the charities which he was then supporting, after his death—I saw no deed; he intimated to me that he proposed to benefit the charities; beyond that I knew none of the particulars—I did not before or at the time of the execution of the deed enter into any arrangement that it should not be carried into effect—I did not at the time of its execution know of any such intention on the part of Mr. Gwenap—I was called upon to answer a bill in the Court of Chancery—Mr. Van Sandau was Mr. Gwenap's attorney, and afterwards became mine—every word that I stated in my answer was most strictly true; I could have no motive for anything else—I have not derived a single half farthing from the proceeds of this annuity—I am never likely to derive the smallest benefit from it—in the Chancery suit, I acted as exe<lb/>cutor, and in no other capacity, and with no other view—a charge of perjury was made against me at Bow-street, which was dismissed—I had not the least notice of any bill being about to be preferred against me for the same thing—I signed this document (<hi rend="italic">the memorandum</hi>)—do not know who brought it to me to sign—the purpose of the document was strictly this; myself and the other trustee of the deed knew at the time that the charities had not received the bequests, and we also presumed that we might be exposed to actions from the treasurers of the charities to pay what we had not received.—I do not know in whose writing it is—Bishop was in the room at the time it was signed—when I was called upon to make my answer I did not recollect this document—I did not speak to my co-trustee until I received a summons for perjury—I found out about this document when I waited upon Mr. Van Sandau—until he called my attention to it I recollected nothing at all about it; it had never been in my possession, and I had never seen it, it was left with the parties who would be benefited by it—I cannot exactly state what amount of funds I have now in my capacity as executor; I have surrendered accounts to the Court of Chancery very recently, I think probably 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Or 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I am now speaking merely at random, I have that to account for to the estate.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185206140020"/>
               <p>made acquainted with this deed—I do not think they knew of it when it was executed—I do not know when, I should say within a few years afterwards probably two or three years afterwards—I think I can give a very good rea<lb/>son for not mentioning it before; Mr. Gwenap was trustee of the chapel, treasurer of the chapel, and himself had to do with all the charities of the chapel—we govern on the congregational system—there are two deacons—we have frequent meetings for the purpose of the government of the chapel—I do not remember the time when I communicated the existence of the deed, but it was within two or three years—I signed the deed, I presume, when it was executed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you really mean to say that you did not know anything about the contents of the deed before it was executed, or how the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be dis<lb/>tributed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have already stated that Mr. Gwenap had intimated generally his purpose respecting the charities he intended to benefit—one of them is for an increase in the salary of the minister, upon certain conditions, if it did not reach a certain sum—I have never availed myself of that, or had the necessity of doing so—I wish to get rid of this deed altogether; I have sought to do so—that has been my object—hitherto I have failed in doing so—I really do not know technically whether I have put in two answers; I believe I have—I believe I knew that I was answering a bill filed for invali<lb/>dating the deed—I have always consented to the invalidation of the deed—I answered the bill; I believe that answer was read yesterday, and it distinctly admitted the ground of invalidity stated by the other party—the deed was certainly intended to be enforced originally, but afterwards not—the deed is not yet invalidated; I wish it was—I presume I was present at the execution of the will of Mr. Gwenap; I think he was then in his eighty-second year—he was eighty-six at the time of his death—if his will was executed in 1849, I am mistaken as to the date; I thought it was three or four years before his death—I forgot that, as I did that document—I had conversation with him about his will before—I was perfectly aware of his intentions respect<lb/>ing it—I was very intimate with him, and had been for sixteen years, since I had been pastor of this chapel—there was a transaction between him and me about a check—I did not in June, 1850, before his death in Nov., ask him to draw a check for the arrears of the annuity—I was present at the examina<lb/>tion of Miss Gwenap yesterday, painfully so—what she stated was perfectly false—the check was drawn under the impression that the whole affair, with respect to the charities, would probably be exposed to litigation—it was drawn to protect myself and the other trustee from any consequences under the deed—it was a check intended to be presented to the officers of the church—it was presented to them, and returned to Mr. Gwenap that same evening—I think the 1,045<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. represented the eleven years arrears of the annuity—I intended the officers, when they received the check, to do with it as they pleased—it had not been arranged between myself and the officers what should be done about the check—nothing had been arranged—I took the check to the trustees and officers of the church, and they returned it to Mr. Gwenap the very same evening—I do not remember that I had before that explained either to the trustees or officers anything about this check—I can certainly state on my oath, positively, that it had not been previously arranged all that was to be done—I had not mentioned anything about this check to the trustees or officers—I might have had conversation with the officers of the chapel with respect to the circumstances of the grants and the arrears; I think I did—I think it is probable—I certainly never told Mr. Gwenap when tge check was drawn, that it should not be presented, but should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185206140021"/>
               <p>be returned to him—if Miss Gwenap stated that yesterday, I say it is untrue—I really do not know whether she was present—before I took the check to the chapel, I presume no person knew that I was going to get a check from Mr. Gwenap—I had given them no information about any check, certainly—I cannot at all make oath as to whether I conversed with the officers of the church on the subject of any payment of arrears—this is the check (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not dictate the check—I am not conscious that I dictated any paper to him that evening—I think Mr. Gwenap became aware that we, as trustees, were exposed to litigation—I have already stated that, and, there<lb/>fore, as we had committed no error in that matter, he was anxious we should not be exposed to personal responsibility; and, therefore, this check was written and presented to the officers of the church—I did not know that it was never intended to present the check, or to make use of it in any way, to recover the testator's money from him—there can be no mistake about that—I presumed there would be no use made of it—I did not tell Mr. Gwenap so; I could not tell him that—he voluntarily gave me the check, which he wished me to present to the officers of the church—there was no understanding, or engagement, that it should be returned to bim, or that it should not be pre<lb/>sented at his bankers'—he did not state that at that time he had not 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at his bankers'—I do not know that he had not; I did not know it then—I heard the bankers' clerk examined yesterday—I am not aware that the check was post dated—I do not know that Mr. Gwenap post dated it, for the purpose of protecting himself—I am not aware that I have stated that it was a post dated check.</p>

On 27th April the prisoner came, and said he wished to look at two bells, of 2 cwt. each, for a contract he had got in the country—I told him we had not any of that size made then, but there was another small bell, which he said would do—I said we were making some, which he could have—he then said he wished for four dozen alarums for warehouse doors—he went with me up to another part of the warehouse to look out the size—he then said he had left his pocket-book, containing the order—I said it was very unfortunate—the small bell was sent to him on 29th April, by my brother's cart, and on 1st May a town carman delivered to him the second bell, and the four dozen alarums—on 14th May I went to a shop in Cow-cross, and saw two of the alarums, and the large bell, which had been delivered by the carman on 1st May—it was worth about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have also seen the bell which went away on 29th April, at a saleroom in Leadenhall-street—I had my brother's consent before I parted with the articles—the large bell left between 3 and 4 o'clock on 1st May.</p>

On Sunday evening, 9th May, the prisoner came there and asked for a penny biscuit—she gave me a sixpence—I thought it was bad, and told her so—she said it was not—I put it in my mouth and bit it—she said, "Let me have it again"—I said I would not, and she went away without it—I put it on a shell apart from other coin—in half an hour afterwards I saw my mistress take it away—it was the same sixpence—no one had been in the shop in the mean time.</p>

On Friday, 14th May, I was assisting at the Princess of Wales—the prisoner came in for half a pint of porter—he gave me a shilling—I thought it was not. good, and put it down by the side of the till—after he was gone I tried it, and it was bad—I called Mr. Callingham and showed it him—he was looking at it when another man came in and put down a shilling for half a pint of porter—I took up that shilling and found it was bad—I had that other man detained, and I went to the door and looked down the lane; I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the footpath—I went and took hold of him and brought him back—I said he had been in about 10 minutes before, and given a bad shilling—he said he had not been in the house before—I am quite certain be is the man—I marked the shilling and gave it to the policeman; and also the shilling I took from the other man—the prisoner had a smockfrock on over his great coat, and when I took him he had his great coat over his smockfrock.</p>

I was on duty at Bromley, on 3rd May, last year—about 12 o'clock at night there were some persons fighting in the High-street, Bromley—I went to them for the purpose of preventing it, and dispersing the crowd—Paul, another constable, was with me—a man named Howlett attacked me, and knocked me down, and I was kicked and struck several times—blood flowed from my head, from the injuries I received from Howlett—when I was down I was held for some time—I got up and was knocked down again—I had got my staff out after Howlett struck me; it was taken from me by the prisoner and his brother, William Sullivan—I was standing up at that time—I laid hold of Howlett with my left hand, and the prisoner struck me with the staff on my head, and knocked me down insensible—when I recovered I was in the surgeon's shop—I was off duty for five or six weeks—I am suffering now from the effects of the blows—the prisoner was taken about three weeks ago—I had not seen him before—his brother and Howlett were tried at a former session.</p>

On 4th May, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was called to see two police officers, who were injured—I saw Curtis—I examined bis head; it had been previously strapped up by my uncle, who lives in the neighbourhood—on removing the strapping, about three days afterwards, I saw a jagged wound in the upper part of the frontal bone, on the right side of the head, about an inch and a quarter in length—in my opinion it was an injury done by some instrument sharper than a staff, but not a sharp knife—it might have been a stone or a pewter pot—I do not think such a staff as this would do it—I found a great many bruises about the head of Curtis—I did not find any other wound that would have bled at the time that was inflicted—he had but one wound, and I think that was not from a staff.</p>

About 2 o'clock in the morning I was passing the east end of Cambridge-square, and saw the prisoner and another man come from a doorway in the square—they came towards me, and turned into Upper Porchester-street—I and Masters followed them, and they were stopped—I asked the prisoner what he was doing in the doorway in the square at that hour in the morning—he said he was not in the doorway—I said, "You were there, I saw you"—he then put his right hand inside the left side of his coat, and held his coat with his left hand—I said, "What have you got there?"—I put my hand towards him, and was immediately knocked to the ground—I could not see what it was done with—it was done instantly—here is the wound—theblow was on the side of the temple—I was confined to my bed for a week, and was attended by a surgeon—when I recovered myself I saw two men on Oxford-terrace—I was bleeding very much indeed—Masters sprang his rattle, and very shortly after I saw the prisoner in the custody of Dunlap—I ran after the other man, and when I came back Dunlap pointed out this instrument lying in the road—it was close by where the prisoner was—there is a mark of blood upon it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Red Cross, 33, Barbican. I have a brother, a carpenter, who lives at 21, Gerard-street, Soho—the prisoner Grover had been in my brother's service—I had known him about two years—on Saturday, 17th April, about 4 o'clock, he came to my house before the bar, and called for a pint of porter—he said, "How do you do, Mr. Salway?"—I said, "I am very well, thank you; what are you doing now?"—he said, "Nothing"—he stood there for some few minutes, and then put his elbow on the counter, and whispered to me, "Have you ever taken any bad money since you have been here?"—I then said, "Well, what has been brought I have been very fortunate, I have detected it"—he then put his hand into his trowsers' pocket, pulled out a shilling, and said he served butchers and bakers, and publicans, with this sort of coin at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per dozen—I then asked him how long he had followed that profession—he replied, "About a month after I left your brother, as I had neither money nor clothes"—he then took the shilling up off the counter, and went away as he saw me going towards the private box, I suppose he thought I was coming out to him—after he had gone I told the sergeant of police—I saw no more of Grover until the Saturday following, when he came about 10 in the morning—he asked me if I could change him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked him was it genuine, or how he came in possession of it, knowing the capacity he was in before—he said, "It is; we fell across it," or "tumbled over it in Drury-lane"—I then said, "Well, bring it and let me look at it"—he then said, "What time shall I come?"—I said, "At 5 o'clock"—he said he would come at 7—I said, "I shall be busy at that time, come at 5"—he agreed to do so, and went away—I went to the police station, and told them what had occurred, and about 4 in the afternoon Bull and Packman came, and waited there up till 11 at night—Grover did not come, and they then went away—on the Saturday following, 1st May, about 7 in the evening, Grover came, in company with Donoghue—they came together—I was at the bar—Grover said, "I have brought these notes, can you change them for me?"—I then did as the police constable had told me, invited them into the parlour, and went into the parlour to them—I first sent my barman over for the police—Donoghue pulled the notes out of his pocket—they were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I did not look at them at that time, but I did when I took them into the kitchen—I said, "What do you want for them?"—he said, "17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Grover was in the room, and within hearing—I said, "I suppose you would take 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would you not?"—he said, "No, not less than 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; look at them"—I did not look at them—I put them into my pocket, and went out—I told them to wait a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>, and I would bring them the change—I went out of the parlour to the back door, expecting to find the police—Costigan, an officer, was there—my barman had fetched him—I took him to the parlour, and said, "Stop these men; don't allow them to move out of the parlour"—before that, as I was coming out of the parlour, I heard Grover say to Donoghue, "It is <hi rend="italic">all over</hi> with us"—I think he saw Costigan—he was in his uniform—I then went into the kitchen with the officer Banks, who had come in afterwards—I showed the notes to him, and told him what had transpired—I then returned to the parlour with Banks, and said to the prisoners, "These gentlemen will give you the change"—the policemen took them into custody—I handed the notes to Banks.</p>

I have known the prisoner by sight about nine months, as near as I can recollect—one Sunday morning, some time ago, I was taking my dinner to the baker's; he accosted me, and asked me if I had apartments to let—I said I did not know, when did he want them—he said, "To-morrow"—I said I should have to inquire into his character—he said, "Are you a widow?"—I said, "Yes; why?"—he said, "Because I am single, and perhaps we may make a match of it"—I left word, in the evening, that I had no apartments for him—nearly three weeks afterwards he came, under the pretence of having some shirts made; he conducted himself in a very shameful manner; he wished to take improper liberties, and I turned him out myself—he has not been to the house again, but he has annoyed me ever since—on 22nd May, about half past 9 o'clock, when it was nearly dark, I went to take some linen in; as I was paying the money, the prisoner came in, and said, "Now Mrs. Robinson, you have been my ruin; d—you, I will do for you"—he then struck me a violent blow with a hammer on the right side of my head; it cut through my bonnet, and my head bled profusely—he said he was very sorry he had not quite done it—I succeeded in getting the hammer from him, and he was given in charge—I then became insensible for some minutes, and do not remember what took place—I did not feel insensible till he was gone,</p>

I was employed by Pace and Co., and Mr. Watts, to apprehend the prisoner—I found him on 18th May, at the Court of Queen's Bench, Westminster, standing in the passage—I said, "Fiddes, I want to see you about a promissory note for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you</p>

I said, "No"—he said, "I shall not give up these bills till I get 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he was taken into custody, taken to Bow-street, and afterwards to Marlborough-street, and was remanded on his own recognizance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Mr. Watts met me at the King William the Fourth, King William-street, Strand, and asked me if I could discount a promissory note of Pace, Nephew, and Co., with a deposit of shares in the Galtymaen Min<lb/>ing Company, with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid up on each share, value in the market, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per share; I said there was no difficulty; I received the shares from him next day, went to a respectable stock-broker in the City to make inquiries about the shares, and was requested to call in a day or two; I saw Mr. Watts and told him if the shares were of any use, the bill would be cashed, and he had better get the promissory note, and I should be able to carry the matter out; I met him the following day, he gave me the note, and I went into the City to make inquiries about the shares, but could not get any answer; I said, "I am going to visit a friend of mine close to Oxford-street, who will give me the money if the shares are all right;" I left him at the American Stores; I waited for my friend two or three hours, he did not come; I was tired of waiting, and did not return to Mr. Watts, as I thought he had gone; I went into the City next day with Mr. Davis, to make inquiries about the shares, we could get no answer; we then went to Mr. Isaacs, he left me out<lb/>side and took the note into the office to get it discounted; Mr. Isaacs came out, looked at me, and went in again, and Mr. Davis and I walked away toge<lb/>ther; he said, "I have got to be in London about 3, o'clock, we will meet again in the morning;" I went and found out that the shares were not worth a halfpenny, it was a regular swindle, the stock broker and the mining broker said that a cart load of them was not worth the trouble of fetching away; I took them away, and I believe they were left at Mr. Isaacs' with the bill; we went several days afterwards to a tavern in Catherine-street, Strand, between 12 and 1; we sat down and took some beer, and he wrote out some memo<lb/>randum, I do not know what it was, I signed it; whether this is the piece of paper I signed, I do not know, but I have never received any communica<lb/>tion from Mr. Davis, and therefore the bill has not been discounted; if the shares were worth the money I should have received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and therefore I detained the bill for my commission, and demanded 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give it up; when I was before Mr. Jardine, I said, if he thought I was not entitled to any remuneration for my trouble, I would return the bill and shares within a few hours; he said it was out of his jurisdiction, and the case was adjourned to Marlborough-street; the bill has never been discounted, nor are the shares worth a farthing; Mr. Watts said if I could get this carried out, he would give me 1,000 more shares to borrow money on, and therefore he was rais<lb/>ing money by false pretences, as 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has not been paid upon them; I am innocent of any charge of fraud whatever.</p>

On Thursday evening, 10th June, about half past 10 o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Duke-street with Thompson, a relation of mine—we met with a man, who tripped up Thompson's heels to throw us both on the ground—we turned round to ask why he did so, when a woman, who he said was his wife, began to abuse us, and the prisoner passed between us, and took the watch from my right hand waistcoat pocket—I felt a <hi rend="italic">tug</hi> from the chain round my neck, and saw the watch in his hand—I saw his hand come from my chain with the watch in his hand—there was force in taking it from me—he passed between two other young men, but I did not see what he did with the watch—I caught him within about five yards—I did not recover my watch—it was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I kept hold of the prisoner, and gave him in charge—I had seen the watch about two minutes before it was laid hold of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of detective police. On Friday even<lb/>ing, 4th June, I was on duty with Brett in plain clothes—about half past 10 o'clock that evening I observed the three prisoners—Davis was standing in the middle of the road at the King William-street end of Cannon-street—she was talking to a gentleman, and Smith and Williams were standing about twenty</p>

               <p>yards off under a lamp post, looking towards them—the gentleman left Davis, and she went along King William-street towards the Bank—the two male prisoners crossed to the other side of King William-street, and followed Davis a short distance towards the Bank—Davis accosted another gentleman, and turned back with him to the corner of Cannon-street—she remained talk<lb/>ing to him there for about a minute, and Smith and Williams returned to the corner of King William-street opposite the corner of Cannon-street—as soon as the gentleman had left Davis, Smith and Williams crossed from the corner of King William-street, and stood talking with her for about a minute—they then went down Cannon-street to Neighbour's Tavern, into which they all three went—they remained in there about ten minutes, and they all three came out together—Davis went down King William-street, and Smith and Williams crossed over to the other side—we followed them for about an hour, during which time Davis accosted twelve or fourteen gentlemen, and upon all occasions Smith and Williams were within sight, keeping pace with her and stopping when she stopped, until they got to the corner of Bow-lane—at nearly half past 11, Davis there accosted the prosecutor, and went with him along Bow-lane as far as George-yard, and Smith and Williams crossed from the opposite side, and went up Bow-lane after Davis and the prosecutor on the same side—there is but one pavement there—Davis and the prosecutor stopped at the corner of George-yard—Smith stood about eight or ten feet from the corner of the yard in a doorway; I lost sight of Williams—I saw Smith and Williams go into Bow-lane—I still kept sight of Smith, but I lost sight of Williams—Davis and the prosecutor remained there between five and ten minutes; at the end of that time I heard a cough, and at the same mo<lb/>ment I saw Davis running from George-yard along Bow-lane into Bow Church-yard, at the corner of which I was standing—I went after her, and overtook her about half way through the Churchyard—I laid hold of both her hands, and said, "You have robbed that gentleman; what have you got?"—she said, "What do you mean? I have got nothing;" but finding she kept her left hand clenched, Iendeavoured to open it—she struggled very violently to prevent me, and in the struggle we both fell—she endeavoured, by kicking and biting my hand, and dragging my hand to her mouth, to pre<lb/>vent my opening her hand—at last I succeeded, and took this watch out of her hand, and this chain—the glass of the watch was broken, and one of the hands—on the road to the station she asked me what I wanted with her; I told her it was for stealing a gold watch—I took her to the station and left her with an officer, and I went back and found Smith and Williams were secured—I went back to the station and resumed the charge of Davis—I was not gone above half a minute—Davis was asked by the inspector where she lived, but she and Smith refused to tell—I found on Smith a gold ring and a door key, on Williams one farthing, and on Davis a key was found by the female searcher—before Davis accosted the prosecutor I had noticed him, and I saw a chain in front of his waistcoat—I passed at the moment she accosted him—when this watch and chain were shown to him he claimed them at once—I had seen the prisoner Williams frequently before, and I have an indistinct recollection of the others.</p>

I know Jones, a slater—on 19th Feb. he came to me and asked if I would buy a few sheets of lead; he said he was at work for a person in High Holborn, and they were short of cash—I asked who the party was, he gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced, similar to the other</hi>)—he asked 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton, which I gave him, with eight per cent, discount; the whole amount was 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 21st Feb. the prisoner came, handed me a similar card to the one Jones had given me, and said, "My name is Richards"—he said, "I have two or three sheets of lead for sale, are you a buyer of them"—we agreed, and I bought tbem of him at 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton—he gave me this receipt; it was filled up, and he signed it in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "London, 21st Feb.; received of Mr. Miles, 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as per bill delivered. Charles Mark ham")—I saw him fill up something, I cannot say whether it was the name or not—two or three days after that, I saw him again, and he said he had three or four more sheets on hand, and would I take them, he had a heavy job at Barking, and was short of money, and I agreed to buy them at 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received them on 24th, and paid for them on 25th—he gave me this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">produced, this was for </hi>25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Norwich-court, East Smithfield. On Sunday night, 30th May, about half-past 9 o'clock, I went to the Three Crowns public-house, East Smithfield, and stopped till about 11—Thomas Murley was with me, and Daniel Tennison—we three were drinking together—Angelina Heath, a girl of the town, was there—she was not drinking with us—I do not know that she was with any particular party—I only saw her there—there was a party of foreigners at the Three Crowns—I did not see the prisoners there—two glasses of liquor were upset on the table, and a dis<lb/>turbance took place between Murley and one of the foreigners—it resulted in a fight between Tennison and one of the foreigners—the girl Heath was <hi rend="italic">growling</hi> and <hi rend="italic">going on</hi> at Tennison, and saying they ought to know better—she did not strike them—she only scolded them, and abused Tennison—the landlord turned the whole party out of the house—I do not know whether one of the foreigners got a blow at that time—Tennison and me then went to the One Crown, in Butler's-buildings, East Smithfield—Brown Bear-alley crosses Butler's-buildings—a man named Conolly came in, and I asked him to drink—the foreigners were there, but neither of the risoners—I was there drinking a couple of hours, till twenty minutes past 1 on Monday morning, when we all four came out into Brown Bear-alley, where Conolly lived—I saw Angelina standing at the door of No. 5—that was not Conolly's house—he lives at No. 6, next door—Tennison went up and spoke to her—she said something to him, and I heard him say he would spit in her eye if she did not leave him alone—he was drunk—I cannot say whether she was sober—she had spoken to him in the Three Crowns—when he said that to her, I saw Guiseppe standing by himself behind Angelina, in the middle of Brown Bear-alley—he was near enough to hear what Tennison said to her—Conolly went from his own steps, put his arm round Tennison's waist, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185206140059"/>
               <p>said, "Now then, I won't leave you till I get you home"—Conolly was sober—while he had hold of Tennison by the waist, I saw Antola come out with a poker from No. 6 passage on the opposite side of the alley to which Angelina was standing—he struck Conolly across the back with the poker as he had hold of Tennison—his back was towards Antola—Murley ran to Antola, laid hold of the poker, and pulled it out of his hand—he came back about six feet from No. 6 door, with the poker in his hand, towards the top of the court—that was further from No. 5 than he had been before—when Murley took the poker away, Remorino was standing across the gutter on the other side of the court, against No. 5 door, and he ran up and hit Murley under<lb/>handed in the stomach; I mean upwards—that was before Murley had gone the six feet up the court—it was just as he had got the poker from Antola—he came back with the poker in his hand—Mrs. Wallis came to him and said, "Murley, that is my poker"—he said, "Take it, I am stabbed"—I pulled his trowsers down, lifted his shirt up, and saw blood running down his belly, and his entrails coming out—I led him away, met a policeman, and told him—I set Murley down under a chandler's shop-window, and went with the policeman to the place where the stab bad taken place, but the prisoners were gone—on the Monday morning the girls gave us some information, and we ran and took Antola—he was taken to the hospital, and I went with him.</p>

               <p>Englishmen struck him on the head with a stick—he spoke English rather imperfectly, but I perfectly understood what he said—there was a slight mark on his forehead—I took him to the London Hospital, where Murley was in bed, about half-past 4 o'clock—I asked Murley if he knew him—he said, "Yes; that is the man who stabbed me with the knife"—Guiseppe spoke in Italian, and I could not understand what he said.</p>

The deceased was brought there about half-past 2 o'clock in the morning—he died there about 10 minutes past 12 that night, from a wound on the lower part of his person, from which the bowels were protruding to the extent of four inches—there was hope of recovery, but it very seldom happens—it was a wound which might have been inflicted with a knife of this kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Rudduck; we are porter merchants, at Exeter-hall Vaults, Strand. The prisoner was our clerk; it was his duty to receive money, and account for it the next morning to my partner—he had a rough cash book in which he was to enter the sums he received—on 15th March some communication had been made to me with reference to what I imagined an inaccuracy in the prisoner's account—I called the prisoner into the counting house, and told him I could not admit of such inaccuracy, and therefore I should dismiss him—I told him what I had dis<lb/>covered—two small amounts—I said, having discovered that he had received money, and not entered it, and not handed it over to my partner, I considered him inaccurate, and therefore should dismiss him—he said he hoped I did not</p>

               <p>consider him dishonest—I said no, I had no reason to suppose he was—he said, "Don't suppose, Sir, that I am guilty of fraud"—he seemed very indignant, and said the least I could do, dismissing him so suddenly, would be to give him a year's salary, he having been of great service to me—I said certainly not, he was legally entitled to a quarter's salary, and dismissing him suddenly I should pay him that—I told him to fetch a receipt, and I gave him a check for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me this receipt, "Received of Messrs. Daukes and Rudduck, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being the balance of my salary to March 1852, and the remainder one quarter's salary paid to me in lieu of notice"—he then said, "Before I leave you, Sir, will you give me up the security which you hold from the Guarantee Society?"—I held a security from the Guarantee Society—I asked the prisoner whether his cash in his box was correct, he said yes it was—when he asked about the security, I said it required consi<lb/>deration in giving up a document of such importance, I should consider of it—I told him I had no objection to meet him the next morning, and tell him what I should do—I appointed to meet him at my partner's, Mr. Rudduck's—I met him the next day at 1 o'clock, at Mr. Rudduck's—I said the object of his visit was to know whether I should give up the security; I told him I had determined to retain it—he said he was very sorry indeed to inform me that it was not only the trifling sum already stated, but a considerable sum of money, and he urged me not to apply to the Guarantee Society, as it would be his ruin; he had said on the previous day that he should apply to the Guarantee Society to show them for what a trivial cause he had been dismissed—on this day he told me there were further sums, and urged me not to apply to the Guarantee Society—I said, "Well, what was the cause of your taking this money?"—he said he had suffered a great deal of deprivation, he was extremely sorry, and be would not do so again—I said, "Well, of course, if you are penitent, you have brought me back the check that I gave you yes<lb/>terday?"—he said he had spent it, but he had a few pounds left, if I liked to take that—I said, "Certainly not"—I said he was a rogue, and I should immediately apply to the Guarantee Society, and leave the matter with them—I did apply to them—I saw the prisoner afterwards, he called at Mr. Rud<lb/>duck's chambers—he said he had received a notice from the Guarantee Society, and the least he could do would be to put our books straight—he gave me a list of the sums which I have here—he makes it a total of 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but it is wrongly added up; it ought to be 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and beside that, there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deficient in the cash—this list does not contain the names of Wilcox or Cope—I find the name of Street here—I produce the rough cash book in which it was the prisoner's duty to enter the sums which he received—I do not find here, 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received on the 25th of Sept., from Mr. Street—on the 27th of Sept.

               <p>

                  </hi>. I lodge with the last witness—I recollect on that morning seeing the scuffle with Cole and the two prisoners; they came to the door, and Esther Cole said her brother was not there—Stockbridge said it was a lie he could hear him in the parlour, and if she did not let him in he would stick a knife in her—William Cole came out, and Stockbridge laid hold of him—they fell down, and Darvill fell on the top of him—I saw Darvill stick him in the back with a knife—it went in his clothes, not in the flesh—Darvill said he would stick any one who came near him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the granary porters at the Brick-lane station of the Eastern Counties Railway; the prisoners were employed by the company as carmen. On 6th May I superintended the loading of a wagon, No. 154, with malt; Green and another person were loading it—I saw a full sack, marked, "Eastern Counties Railway Co.," in red letters, put in—the other sacks were marked, "Bridges, Stowmarket," in</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weaver, and live at 54, Green-street, Bethnal Green. On Tuesday, 1st June, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the street by my house, and saw the prisoner coming along the street standing in a cart drawn by two horses, one before the other—he had no reins attached to the horses, and I did not notice any whip—he was going about three miles an hour—as the cart was coming along, my grandmother, Sarah Millo, was trying to cross the road by herself—she was eighty-three years Old—she was about a yard from the kerb she had just left—I thought she was in danger, and cried out to the prisoner, "Stop!"—he hallooed out, "<hi rend="italic">Whoa! whoa</hi>!" and jumped out of the cart immediately—his crying out did not have the effect of stopping the horses—several of us hallooed out together, which made the horses go faster—the first horse knocked my grandmother down, and the wheel passed over her—the prisoner did not jump out before my grandmother was knocked down—it was almost instantaneously—as soon as she was knocked down, he jumped out—I picked her up—she was unable to speak—I took her into a doctor's—he was not at home, and she was put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and taken to the London Hospital, but she died before she got there—the body was left there.</p>

I know the prisoner and deceased by living next door to them; they lived together—I believe she was married to him—I always understood her to go by the name of Mrs. Bailey while they have lived there, which is about a year—I believe he is a corn porter—she came there as Mrs. Bailey—I do not know her Christian name—on Saturday, 8th May, about 6 o'clock, she passed me with the prisoner—she had no marks or bruises about her face, but she appeared to have been crying—she went indoors with the prisoner, and a little while afterwards I heard a fall in the front room ground floor, which they lived in—I live down stairs in the back room, next door; my back room is next to their back room—when I heard the fall I was at the street door—not many minutes after the fall I heard the prisoner say, "Take that!" and then he said if any man or woman in the house interfered be would serve them the same way—I believe he was in the passage when he said that—about half past 8 I heard of the woman's death—I went into her room and she was dead, on the bed—the prisoner was not there, he had been taken by the police—she had a black eye, a mark on the forehead, and a mark under the chin, which were not there when she went into the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Knight, and live at 43, Devonshire-street, in the same house as the prisoner. I was at home on 8th May—I knew the deceased, they used to call her <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi>—I was on the first floor up stairs all day long—my room is right over hers—I heard them come home about half past 5 o'clock; directly they got inside the house I heard her fall, and heard the prisoner say, "Take that!"—immediately after she fell—they were then in the passage—the fall was in the passage—I heard the door of the room unlocked, and directly it was opened I heard a second fall, and then heard him strike one of his hands against the other—he used some vulgar language, and said if any man or woman came to interfere with him he would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185206140078"/>
               <p>serve them the same—I then heard the room door shut again, and heard her say twice, "Oh dear! John"—I afterwards heard a third fall, but did not hear him speak any more—it was all so quiet after that that I thought they were gone to bed—I had seen the prisoner come home at 5 with his mates, but did not see him again till after 6, when he came up to my room door, and said "Pray, Mrs. Knight, there's a good soul, come down and see what you can do with my old woman"—he was very much excited—I went down, and found her lying perfectly dead on the floor on her right side, with her arms folded, her knees drawn up, and her head buried into her neck—she was a very good sized woman, not very stout, and not very thin; she always said her age was thirty-two—her mouth had blood on it—there was no appearance of it's having been washed—her face had been washed, apparently to refresh her—there is a waterbut in the yard, just outside the door, to which the prisoner went twice or three times after the third fall to draw water—I undid the deceased's clothes, and observed marks on her face; her left eye was very much blackened, her forehead had a bruise, and there was one under ber chin—I had not seen her before that day—I know she was <hi rend="italic">on the drink</hi> very much—when the prisoner came up to roe, I said, "Good God! Bailey, what have you done?"—he said, "You know how drunk she gets, and aggravates me by her getting drunk, and I smacked her face"—she was a very quiet woman generally; but every three or four months she would get <hi rend="italic">on the drink</hi>, and drink for a week or a fortnight together, if her things would last—I have known her to go without her linen three days for drink, or as long as her pawning her things would last, or selling them either—she was a quiet woman at all times.</p>

I have not, I have only smacked her face"—I then went to the room with him, and saw her lying on the floor, and Mrs. Knight undoing her clothes—I lifted up her head, and said to the prisoner, "Oh, dear me! a smack of the face never did this"—he answered, "Oh, Mrs. Rogers, I did not do it! I did not do it!"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and a bachelor of medicine of the Commercial-road. On 8th May I was called to see the deceased at 43, Devonshire-street—I found her lying on the floor quite dead—I got there as nearly at half-past 6 o'clock as possible—I examined her externally at that time, and found the left eye blackened, two bruises on the forehead, one on the right side of the cheek, and a very severe one on the left side of the chin—they were all recent except the black-eye, it was rather the remains of a black-eye, the bruise was of a greenish colour—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examin<lb/>ation on the 10th; the whole body was healthy except the head—the brain itself was healthy, but there was a clot of blood pressing on it—on removing the brain from the skull I found this clot of blood at the base of the brain covering a portion of the brain under the projecting bone, at the very bend of the neck, just where the spine joins the skull—I attribute death to the clot of blood being there—apoplexy would produce the clot—taking into con<lb/>sideration the age of the woman, and the healthy state of the brain and vessels I should say that clot was produced by external violence, either by a blow or fall, or both—a blow behind would do it, but I should rather attribute it to a blow on the front part of the head—that would be much more likely to produce it than a blow behind; or it might be produced by a fall either back-wards or forwards—there was no external mark on the back of the head—if she had fallen forwards, and hit her forehead on the ground, that might have produced it; or if she had fallen backwards, but if she had fallen backwards there would probably have been some external marks—a blow under the chin might, by suddenly throwing the head back, rupture a small vessel at the base of the brain; but I should rather attribute the mark on the chin to a fall than a blow, on account of the skin having been abraded in a very slight manner—intoxication would predispose her to the injury, and less violence would produce the effect than on a sober woman.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, in which he stated that he had lived with the deceased eight years, and had suffered much from her drunken habits, from which it was impossible to reclaim her; and whilst in that state she would make away with everything they possessed; that at the time in question she had been for some time intoxicated, and he had fetched her from the public-house; that she insisted on leaving the room to go for more drink; that he rushed before the door to prevent her, and pushed her, upon which she fell, and so received the injury.</hi>)</p>

               <p>and am a wearer. On 31st May I had some silk in my loom in the course of manufacturing—I covered it over, and left home at 11 o'clock in the forenoon—the silk was not finished—there was as near as possible about thirty yards—I had also some shute on bobbins—I lost about seven ounces of crimson shute, and about eight ounces of green—when I left home I left no one in the house—I double-locked my door—I returned about a quarter past 12 at night—as soon as I placed the key in the door, and gave it one turn, the door flew open—it was only single-locked then, not double-locked—I instantly got a light, and perceived my door had been broken open—I went up stairs, and found my work cut out and gone, and the breast roll standing about a yard from the loom—I missed seven ounces of crimson shute on ten bobbins, and about eight ounces of green shute taken off a machine—the value of the silk in the loom was about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the amount of the fifteen ounces of shute was about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not see any of my property again till 3rd June, at Worship-street—I did not see all I had lost, only the ready-made work out of the loom—this is it—I do not know either of the prisoners.</p>

On Wednesday, 2nd June, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the middle of the ware-house, and May came in, and said he had some silk for sale—it was wrapped up in a pocket handkerchief—I told him we did not want any—he wished me to purchase it—my father and brother were in the counting-house, having their tea—I told him I should not disturb them—he begged me to do so—I went in and asked them, and they declined it—May kept on begging me to purchase it—I asked him the price—he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I said no, I would not purchase it—he said I might have it at my own price—(the value of it was about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard)—I told him we were not in the habit of purchasing of strangers over the counter in the state that was in—in proof of his respec<lb/>tability, he referred me to Bull and Wilson, in St. Martin's-lane, and some other persons, whom I do not know—I know Bull and Wilson—he said that we had purchased before of his brother—I asked him who his brother was—he said, Mr. May—we knew his brother very well, and had purchased of him—I still declined to purchase, and he went away—in consequence of something passing in my mind, I directed my brother to follow him—the silk was displayed—it was for curtains or blinds for carriages—that was the only goods I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner May's daughter. I remember the prisoner Wallis bringing a piece of silk and some braid to our house on Whit-Monday, 2nd June, about 1 o'clock—Mrs. Oliver was present—she is here—when Wallis came in he opened the bundle on the table, and asked my father if he could buy it—my father said no, he did not know the value of it—Wallis said it was velvet before it was opened, and when it was opened it was silk—my father said, "I thought it was a piece of velvet"—Wallis said, "No, silk"—he said he did not know anywhere that he could go and</p>

               <p>sell it; only at one shop, and that was a long way off—he did not say where, but it was up at the West-end—Wallis took off his hat, and showed some narrow braid made of silk—nothing was said about what was to be done with the silk—they went out.</p>

               <p>78, St. Paul's Church-yard. Last Monday afternoon, 3rd June, the prisoners came about 3 o'clock together—one of them asked to look at some shawls, the others must have heard it—they were shown into the shawl-room, and some shawls were exhibited to them—I should say they looked at nearly a dozen, and ultimately one was sold to Mary Lynch for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the other two prisoners were by and saw what was going on—she gave me a sovereign and a half-sovereign—after selling the shawl, I folded it, and took it down stairs—I gave it to a young man to make out a bill—while this was going on I received some information; the prisoners had all come down and were waiting for the change—in consequence of what had been said, I went outside the counter to where the prisoners were standing, and saw a portion of a shawl, which I suspected was our property, hanging down about four inches below Seymour's shawl—I made the remark, "This will never do"—I told ber it was our shawl, and she immediately gave it up to me, this is it—I am quite certain it is one that I had shown them, here is our private mark on it made by myself—it is worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not seen the prisoners before, to my knowledge.</p>

On 8th June I was at Woodford Wells, and met the prisoner—he asked me if I would go to a shop and purchase some tobacco for him—he gave me a shilling, and told me to bring him the change; I went, and brought it to him—he then told me to go to Mrs. Holwell, and get a half quartern loaf; he gave me a shilling for that—I went, and gave the shilling, and Mr. Holwell bent it—an officer was sent for—I went with the officer, and took the bread to Fourtree-pond—the prisoner was there, and he was taken into custody by the officer.</p>

On 15th May I was at a public house at Blackheath, playing at bowls with two friends, from 4 o'clock to 7 or 8—when I began to play I took ray coat off, and laid it on a seat at the bottom of the bowling green—about two hours after I began playing, Dixie, a flyman, came in, and said something to me—we left about half past 8, in Dixie's fly, and I left my coat behind—I did not look for it before I left—the prisoner went on the box of the fly with the driver, and I and my friends inside—when we had gone about 300 yards I missed my great coat—I told Dixie I had left it behind, and he said he would drive us back—the prisoner could hear that, and when we got back he said, "Don't trouble yourself about it to-day, you had better come down on Monday and look for it"—I went into the bowling green with Dixie, but could not find my coat—we left the prisoner on the fly box, and when we came back he was gone—I then gave information at the police station, went to the railway station, and while there a police sergeant came to me—I went with him to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand, near the station, where Dixie's fly was, and the coat was found in my presence in the sword case—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I had then left the fly a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>those occasions—in consequence of his violent conduct on this evening I left the house—I left Maria Higgs there, who had heen with me all day helping me in my work—I went to No. 1, a neighbour's house, and staid there more than an hour—in consequence of a message which I received I went back to my own house about 9—I found my husband in the front room up stairs—I said to him, "I hope you will go to bed quiet"—he said, "I think I had better, or I shall go to Horsemonger-lane"—he then said, "I don't mind going there, as long as I don't go for murder"—I was making the bed at this time—his words became very violent, and threatening; he said he would have my life, and have my heart out, and I ran down stairs and he after me—I did not see anything in his hand—he overtook me in the front room down stairs—there was a light on the table there, but in the struggle it was knocked down and put out, and we were then in the dark—I felt a prick in my arm, and then a smarting as if it was cut by a knife, and I heard the knife fall on the floor—that was the first blow he had struck me that evening—I cried "Murder!" and said I was stabbed, and my son who was up stairs in the back bedroom came to my assistance—he is seventeen years old—he tried to pull me away, and my husband pulled him down by the hair of his head on to the floor in a minute; he at last got me away and I then ran to the door—a person brought in a light from next door—I then looked at my arm and found it gashed up a little as if by a knife, and it was bleeding very much—it is just above the wrist—there was a small pool of blood in the room where I was stabbed—the knife was found on the floor.</p>

I am stabbed!"—I heard her cry that in the dark—a light was brought in by a person next door—I found a good quantity of blood on the floor where I had seen them standing, and I found the knife lying where the blood was—there was blood on it—the police came, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in Kennington-lane, Lambeth. I was called to see Mrs. Wallis about 12 o'clock, on Saturday, 5th June—I found two wounds on her left arm, one on the upper part of the fore arm, towards the outer side, and another three or four inches above it—the lower wound was evidently done by some cutting instrument—a knife would do it—it looked as if it was a stab, not a straight incision from a downright blow; it went through the flesh, and tore it up—this knife might have inflicted it—it must have been done by a thrust—the other wound might have been pro<lb/>duced by the same blow, but it must have been under extraordinary circum<lb/>stances—they were not dangerous wounds.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I came home, and went up stairs, into the front room, and went to bed; I recollect my wife coming into the room; she said, "Wallis, shall I bring the children home?" I said, "You can do as you like;" with that she runs up to me, to the best of my recollection, and drags me out of bed, and then I suppose I followed her down; I have no recollec<lb/>tion of having the knife, or seeing it, until I saw it at the station on the Saturday; there is an iron round the, ironing board that my wife works at, and the knob is off the door of the front room, so that it has a sharp point sticking out, and she might, in the scuffle, have knocked her arm against that or the ironing board.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames police. About 4 o'clock in the morning on 9th June, I saw the three prisoners in a boat at Rotherithe—they rowed towards Wapping—I ordered my galley to row after them, and I followed them closely—just as I got near them, Jones and Farrell jumped overboard—I got them into my boat, and secured McCarthy—I took them all to the Thames police station at Wapping—i found in their boat these boys' coats, trowsers, and other things—I found this cigar case on Jones—it dropped from under his coat, and I found on him this other case and five cigars in it—I found on Farrell two waistcoats and two jackets, which he was wearing—one of the waistcoats and jackets were identified by Mr. Jeffery—I asked the prisoners whose things they were, and they said they were their own—they were locked up, and Captain Lobsell came and identified part of the property.</p>

               <p>head, and a rough blue sailor's jacket, which came down to the lower part of the waist, with pockets on the side—I saw him after that; I think it was the next day, or two days afterwards—he was then dressed the same as he was the day he brought the forks—on that occasion I heard him speak, and having heard him speak, I recognised him as the man who offered me the forks, and I still believe him to be the man—I have no doubt about it—when he came to offer the fork's I should think he remained in my shop nearly ten minutes—I had been in conversation with him during that time, and had asked him various questions.</p>

I recollect a man coming to our shop on 20th April, and bringing some forks—I was in the shop at the time, and I remained till he left—I believe the prisoner was the person—he gave the name of Boyce, and said he lived occasionally in White-chapel, and sometimes in Charles-street, Drury-lane—I think a person was brought to our shop by two policemen on the following Monday or Tuesday—the 20th of April was on Tuesday, and it was about a week afterwards—that person was not dressed in the same way as the person who brought the forks, and I did not recognize him—I did not hear him speak when he was brought the first time—I saw him again in three or four days afterwards, and at that time I heard him speak—after I had heard him speak I was able to recognize him—I believed he was the man then, and I still believe it—I have no doubt of it now—I recollect something was said about betting—he said he transacted business in that way for other persons, and sometimes for himself.</p>
