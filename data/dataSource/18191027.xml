On Saturday, the 16th of October, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I met the two prisoners at the end of Buckingham-street, Strand - they came up to me, one laid hold of each arm, and requested something to drink; they asked me to go and treat them, I said I would not. They wanted me to walk round the corner with them, I said I would not, for I was going home; I had no sooner said the words than one let go my arm, the other held my arm - they immediately gave me a push on my left side, and I fell on my right side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a hard push - A. Very hard; I immediately missed three 1 l. notes out of my pocket, and laid hold of Smith - the other was running off; I followed her, holding Smith, laid hold of her by the arm, and requested her to give me back the three 1 l. notes which she had stolen from me. She said she had got none of my money, and used very bad expressions. I immediately called the watchman, Donovan, he came, and took them in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel either of their hands in your pocket - A. No, but I think their hands must have been in my pocket at the time they shoved me - the money was in my right-hand breeches-pocket - it was safe just before they attacked me. I had my hand in my pocket just before, and felt it; I pulled my hand out of my pocket when they laid hold of me. I did not button my pocket up, it was then safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Might they not have fallen out - A. No, a piece of writing paper was in my pocket with them, and that was there afterwards.</p>

The prisoner came into our service on the 15th of September, and on the 28th, about half-past four o'clock, she asked to go out to purchase a few articles, and never returned. She had given me no notice - and at five we missed the articles stated in the indictment. We had a very good character with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house were the things in - A. The plate and table-cloth were in the kitchen; the scarf, shawl, and watches were in the bed-room. I saw all the plate safe at one o'clock, at dinner. I saw the watches safe within a day or two, and the shawl on Saturday, the 25th. On the Friday following I saw the prisoner at the Rainbow, public-house, at the top of our street. She surrendered herself to a constable there.</p>

            . I live in Feathers-court, Gray's Inn-lane. My husband is a brass-founder. I have known the prisoner about four years - she lived three months at the corner of our court, and used to see men. On the 28th of September, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, she came to my house, and asked me if I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270004"/>pawn a table-cloth for her? She produced it to me, and I pledged it at Beauchamp's, at Holborn Bars, for 2 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce any thing else - A. Yes, a shawl and scarf, which I pledged for her. She said she had some plate which she wished to sell out and out.</p>
               <p>Q. As you knew her before, did you ask her how she got them - A. I asked her if they were own? she said they were her husband's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pawn the things all at one place - A No, my Lord; I pawned the shawl for 5 s., and scarf for 8 s., the next day at Lee and Morritt's. I gave her the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she show you the plate - A. No, my Lord; I saw a pepper-box in her hand on the 28th - she slept at my house that night. She was out all the next day. I went out with her to buy a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to a public-house with her - A. Yes, on the Tuesday evening, about seven o'clock, we went to a young man there, she asked him if he would buy a watch? he said he had no money to buy it. Another man, who sat there, got up, touched her on the shoulder, and she went out with him - she returned in about a minute, and called me out. I and the young man who I was talking to, went with her and the other man to Walton's-court, she then gave a small bundle of things to the other man, he went away with it, returned in about a quarter of an hour, and called her aside - she told him to go back, and take it. What he said to her I do not know. He went, and returned in about five minutes, and gave her some silver - I heard it rattle. We went and had something to drink at another public-house, she paid for it, and we all parted. She went back to my house, and slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man here - A. No, nor the man whom I knew. I do not know where he lives, his name is

               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes, my Lord, we had four pots of porter among five of us. I went to Drury-lane, and there asked a woman the nearest way to Charing-cross. I was alone. The prisoner and another man came up, and said to the woman, What does he want? I said I wanted to be directed the nearest way to Charing-cross. They said they were going that way themselves, and should be there in a few minutes. One caught hold of each arm. I walked a very few paces with them before I told them I required no leading, but if they would direct me I would treat them with a pot of porter for their trouble. They wanted the porter, I saw a public-house door open, stepped in, and called for a pot; the landlord said it was too late, and he would not draw it. They both requested some gin, I would not give them any, and immediately stepped out of the door - they followed - the prisoner took my right arm and the other my left; we proceeded a little way down the street, and came to <placeName id="t18191027-4-crimeloc23">Brydges-street</placeName>

I said, No; he swore, and immediately the prisoner gave me a violent push on my shoulder, which forced me on the ground; the moment I was down the prisoner took a black leather pocket-book from my pocket - they cut it out, for the pocket was sound before, and I found it cut, and the pocket still buttoned. The other man put his hand into my other pocket, but it had nothing in it. I pursued the prisoner down Brydges-street, my foot slipped, and I fell again. I called out Stop thief! I was not more than forty yards behind the prisoner, and saw Smithers take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him - A. No, the street was very light - it was a moonlight night; I never saw him before - I had walked thirty or forty yards with him. The public-house was below Long-acre - he was not running when Smithers took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know the way to Charing-cross - A. If it had been daylight I should have known it; I think the other man ran a different way. I am certain the prisoner is the man - he was never out of my sight - he did not run above a hundred yards.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street. On the 11th of October, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going down Brydges-street, when I came to Exeter-street I heard somebody fall, and saw the prisoner running from the prosecutor, who called out Stop thief! - it was very light; I was not ten yards from him - he was running, but when he saw me he stopped and walked. When I came within a few yards of him, he himself called out Stop thief! I said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man." He said No, he was gone up the street. I told him that I could see nobody else in the street - there was nobody else in the street. The prosecutor came up, and said he was the man - I found only 6 d. on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night of the robbery I was returning from the Coburg Theatre, and heard the cry of Stop thief! A man ran out of a court on the right-hand side, I followed him, and Smithers collared me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober - A. I thought him rather fresh, but it might have been his agitation. He knew what he was about, and could run very well.</p>

I had heard of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270006"/>robbery that night, and informed Attfield that they were there, and he went. I pointed the prisoner out, and he took him - the others got away.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I playing cards with the rest - A. Yes, he was looking over the settle. I told the constable they were all there, but they all got away except the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Franks and the boy, who pointed the prisoner out - several of them were playing at cards; the prisoner was looking at them. I took him to the office, then searched him, and found five half-crowns and 12 s. in silver, on him - he said he had saved it up by working overtime at winding quills. I believe the other five persons have been out of the way ever since - they were not in the house with him. I took the prisoner.</p>

My mother lives in the house - she is seventy-five years of age; nobody else lives there. The prisoner went out with us, returned back, and overtook us again in a short time.

I met a fellow-workman, and went to work with him. I went home to breakfast, and the landlady's mother said she believed the prosecutrix's box had been broken open,</p>

About an hour after my landlord informed me I had been robbed - I immediately missed them. Both the prisoners lodged in the same room with me. Brooks had left the night before. I went to my box, and missed the other things stated in the indictment, and my hat from the kitchen - the prisoners were brought to me.

In about a quarter of an hour after he came down, unlocked the cellar-door, and went out - the prosecutor missed his property.</p>

On the 6th of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went into the cellar to fetch some wrappers - we had a cask of cyder came in three or four days before, which leaked; I moved it to see if it had stopped leaking. On moving it from the wall, I found a small paper parcel behind it, which contained a piece of French cambric - I put it in the paper, placed it where I found it, and put the cask back again. Another man informed Mr. Joll, the clerk. The servants had access to the cellar - it joins the warehouse.</p>

I had discharged the prisoner from my service about three weeks before that. About February last I lived in Bow-lane, the prisoner assisted me to pack a package containing this property, and moved it to Mr. Graves's, in Philpot-lane - in about six weeks it was removed from there to King-street, and then to St. Mary Axe. About a week ago I found it, and missed all this plate and linen. Suspicion fell on the prisoner, I gave him in charge, and told him if he would make a full confession I would forgive him.

            . On the 21st of October I was sent for by Mr. Perryman, to take the prisoner on suspicion of stealing this property. The prosecutor accused him of it, but he strongly denied it. Mr. Perryman then said if he would acknowledge taking them, he would forgive him; he did not acknowledge it that night, and I took him to the Compter. Next morning when I went to the Compter to him, I saw Morris, whom I understood was his sister. When the prisoner came out he said he would confess to me - he said he had pledged the prosecutor's property in St. Mary Axe, but not the whole of it. I took him to the Mansion House, and the prosecutor got from him a list of the things which he said he had pledged there - he was remanded until the Monday following; Morris turned out not to be his sister, and the prosecutor gave her in charge. She said if I would go over the water with her, she would give up all that she knew about the robbery; she gave me the duplicates out of a drawer - one was for a table-cloth pledged for 3 s. She took me to a pawnbroker's in Blackfriars-road, where the sheet and table-cloths were pledged; she said the duplicates of them were burnt, and gave me four duplicates of property pledged in St. Mary Axe.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Barker. On the morning of the 8th of October I was told the prisoner had gone out with a parcel; I followed him, brought him back to the shop, and asked him what he had in the bag which he had with him? He answered, Nothing. On examining it I found it contained 14 lbs. of string. I showed it to my master.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's servant. I have often seen Scott go out with bundles under his arm, when my master went to breakfast. I informed the apprentice of it. One day he was coming out of the cellar with a parcel, and saw my master coming from the counting-house, he threw it down stairs, but as soon as my master went to breakfast he brought it up, and went out with it. I informed the foreman of it on Friday morning when he went out, and he fetched him back.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of October I was sent for to Messrs. Barkers', and took the prisoner in charge for stealing a parcel of twine. I took him before the Lord Mayor, and he was remanded. He said he lived at No. 1, Osborne-street, Bermondsey - I could not find him there. As I returned I found he lived at No. 1, Salisbury-lane. I went to the house, and told his wife I wanted some brushes, she said she had no brushes there whatever. I searched, and found a quantity of twine, and the rest of the property stated in the indictment.</p>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is my first offence. I have had charge of the house several Sundays, and every thing was found safe.</p>

I said I was sure it was no such thing, and wanted to see what he had got in the petticoat - he would not let me. I pulled it from him, and found my boots wrapped up in it.

               <p>"Who is that? what is your business?" the answer was,</p>
               <p>"I am waiting for the boy from Water-lane." I said</p>
               <p>"What boy?" he said</p>
               <p>"Tucker, the boy from Water-lane." On going up to him, I found an ill-looking young man, quite a stranger to me, it was the witness, Jackson - I suspected him, asked his business, and at the same time saw a bundle at his feet, which I found to be tea-lead - it immediately occurred to me that it was part of a quantity of tea-lead delivered the preceding day, which had been deposited in the inner room to make stereotype plates. I rang the office-bell, and at the same time collared him. I desired them to secure the person inside the office, which they did - the prisoner was inside the office, he was the bookbinder's boy, and was in the habit of coming to my office at the latter end of every month for monthly publications. Having secured both, while I stood outside the door I desired the lead in the inner-room to be weighed - it was deficient 10 lbs., which was the quantity I found lying at the door. I asked the prisoner why he had gone up to my manufactory, contrary to the order I had given him? We took them to Bow-street. On our way there, finding Jackson worked at Bell's office, I called there, and while they were speaking to him about it he acknowledged it. The lead was like that left behind.</p>

Soon after I was going down, and he came up stairs to me - he had been ordered never to come up. I told him there was nothing ready. Soon after this the girl came and said I must come down, for the lead had been stolen. I found Tucker down there, and the prosecutor had Jackson.</p>

I pursued him, and lost sight only as he turned the corner. I followed him till he was caught - he was not out of my sight two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running - A. When I called out he began to run. Several persons came round when he was taken. I do not know who stopped him.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 7th of October, a little before four o'clock, I was going up Wimpole-street, and saw the prisoner, Brooker, down an area there, talking to a footman - I had no suspicion of him, and went on about my business, and saw Cox standing about, I then thought something not right was going on. I watched, and saw Brooker leave the footman, and join Cox. I went down Weymouth-street, and as I returned up Devonshire-street, I saw Cox and two or three more waiting at the corner of Devonshire-place (not one hundred yards from the prosecutor's). I live at No. 6, Devonshire-place. I rang the bell to go in, and saw Brooker come out of Mr. Walter's area, with something under his coat. I was going after him, and saw the girl come out of the area and cry Stop him! he then ran, I followed him round the corner into Beaumont-street, and he was there taken - I never lost sight of him. I saw him stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270011"/>and searched - a few halfpence and a knife were found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cox at the time - A. Yes, he came up, and tried to rescue him; when I saw that I secured Cox. Nothing particular was found on him. There were one or two more, who escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Brooker close to Cox, or the others, before he was taken - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>FDEDERICK TABOR. I am a builder. I was in Beaumont-street on the 7th of October, about four o'clock, heard the cry of Stop thief, and saw Brooker running, with something under his coat. I pursued, and when I got a short distance he dropped something, which on passing I observed to be plate. I did not stop to pick it up, but followed him about a hundred yards down the street - he was stopped by another man. As I returned with him Long brought me part of the plate - I had not lost sight of it. Lloyd brought me some more - I delivered the prisoner to him, and took the whole of the plate, gave it to a hair-dresser in the street, who carried it before me into his house.</p>

On the 2d of October, between ten and eleven o'clock, I brought the tea-things from my mistress's breakfast-table, and placed them on a table under the kitchen-window; there is a garden before the house two or three yards long - any one can open the gate - the kitchen-window is even with the ground; a person in the garden can put their hands in at the window. I left the things there, and went up stairs on other business. In about half an hour I heard a noise as if something was at the window, and in consequence of information from

             I went to look, and missed two silver tea-spoons, which were there when I went away. I found the window half open. I am sure I left it shut down close.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fastened - A. No, my Lord, it is a sash-window. I do not know the value of the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner at all - A. No my Lord. Before I missed the spoons I was in the parlour, and saw a man come into the garden with apples in his hand - that was not the prisoner; I saw him go out at the gate, and did not see him do any thing at the window. As soon as I missed the spoons, I went out and saw the prisoner in Pott-street, which is about five minutes walk from our house - he was then with the other man. I had not seen them together before. They turned down at the bottom where there is no thoroughfare. As they returned I collared the other man, and told him to stand still, for he had been robbing; the prisoner heard it and immediately walked away. The other man desired me to let him go; he lifted up his hand to strike me, and I let him go.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner go to - A. He walked up the street, and Lloyd, the officer, took him, but found nothing on him, except some money. My mistress was up in the bed-room at the time; I saw her go up - she could not come down without my seeing or hearing her - she did not go out. I was out of the house about two minutes in pursuit of the men.</p>

            . I live opposite the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner and another young man going along the Bethnal-green-road; I saw the prisoner take four apples out of his pocket. He opened Mr. Timmons's gate, and went through the garden to the kitchen-window - it was the prisoner at the bar; I saw him push the window open. He immediately went out of the garden to the other young man, who was waiting for him; when he got to him he clapped his hands together as a signal, and gave him the four apples. Then the other young man went to the kitchen-window with them, put his hand in, and brought something out, which shone like silver - I immediately went over and told the servant. They both went down Pott-street. The man put the silver into his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear to join him when he came out - A. Yes, they went away together - he was about twenty yards from him when he took the spoons out of the window.</p>

I arose, picked it up, and took it into the shop. I found him at the watch-house in about a quarter of an hour, and knew him - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the magistrate that you could not swear to me, and your master told you that you would get into a hobble if you did not - A. No.</p>

On Saturday, the 24th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I gave her my trunk to take to Mr. Hill's, who is a glover, and lives at No. 8, Cockspur-street, as the Brighton coach was to take me up there. On Monday she returned about six o'clock, and said she had delivered it at the private door of No. 8. I asked her who took it in? She said a young gentleman. The box was directed with my name as a passenger to Brighton; it contained the articles stated in the indictment, which were worth 20 l. at the least. On Monday I went there to go by the coach, and Mr. Hill asked me for the trunk; I said I had sent it on Saturday. I found that it had not taken been there - Mr. Hill's son was the only person in the house. In consequence of this I did not go to Brighton, but went in search of the prisoner; I got a warrant. She was taken on the 15th of October on another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270014"/>charge; I found her at Queen-square office. I have seen my two brooches since in the possession of the pawnbroker - I have recovered nothing else.</p>

On the 14th of October, about a quarter after seven o'clock, I took his chaise to him, and his two coats, which hung over the gig. I was placing the coats right when Mr. Evans came in - I observed the prisoner at the door of a public-house, two doors from Mr. Evans's, smoking his pipe. I got out of the chaise, and went to the horse's head, I then had my back to the great-coats; the horse's head was towards the public-house. The prisoner passed me, and in a moment after I turned my head, and saw the coats were gone. I rang the bell; Mr. Evans scolded me, gave me 6 d., and drove off. I then went round to York-street, which is only two doors from Mr. Evans's. As soon as I got into York-street, I saw the prisoner standing against the News-office, in Brydges-street. While he stood there, a man in a long coat, apparently a coachman, went up to him, and they talked together. At last Brown saw me, and they both went down Brydges-street together. I followed them down into the Strand, through several courts, towards Temple-bar - they came to a court, then the prisoner set off running - I ran after him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have stolen two of my master's coats." He immediately collared me, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, what are you following me for?" and knocked me down in the middle of the road - he struck me on the ear. He set off running as hard as he could; I got up and ran after him, calling Stop thief! he ran down Swan-yard, and went into a house there. I lost him, came back, and a gentleman said he was in the house. I stationed a man at the door, while Racket went with me to Bow-street for an officer, and I gave him the 6 d. which Mr. Evans gave me. I got Holyland, who searched the house, but could not find him. I went for Mr. Corderoy, who went into the house, got a light, and went into the cellar. I saw one of the coats on the floor, at the bottom of the stairs. I went a little farther, found a little door in the cellar, opened it, and found the prisoner there, sitting on the privy, as if he was fast asleep - I found nothing more. As we went out of the house we were surrounded by about twenty girls, who endeavoured to rescue the prisoner from the constable. The prisoner hit the constable with all his force on the nose, and made it bleed. He did not get away.</p>

            . I am in the Coldstream Guards, and live in Swan-yard. I saw the prisoner come into the yard about half-past seven o'clock, with a drab coat hanging over his arm. He knocked at the door, a young woman on the outside had a key and let him in; the door was shut immediately. In about a minute after, I saw White run past the house - I did not speak him to then. He returned, was crying, and said a young man had stolen his master's great-coats. I told him he was gone into that house. I accompanied him to Bow-street, and got a constable. I stood at the door, while they went to search the house. Nobody came in or went out until the prisoner was taken.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Scales. On Saturday morning, the 16th of October, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and take the carcase of a sheep - he <rs id="t18191027-26-deflabel150" type="occupation">occasionally did portering business</rs>

In about three quarters of an hour the man who had bought that sheep came for it. I saw the prisoner a few minutes after, and got an officer, who took him between eight and nine o'clock. My master charged him with taking it, he denied it - I am sure I saw him take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Mr. Scales hung them there, to be sent for by the persons who bought them - A. Yes; the prisoner was employed by persons to load their carts.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Drury often employed the prisoner to fetch carcases for him - A. The prisoner denied taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say Drury sent him for it - A. Yes, but he took two. I apprehended him where he always stands for employment.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and work for Mr. Pool. On Tuesday, the 28th of September, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was working at Lord Hardwick's, went to the privy of Lord Grantham, and saw the loft door over the privy open - I thought I saw something like lead. When I returned from breakfast, I examined the loft, and found it was lead. I took it from there, with the assistance of one of Mr. King's men, and put it into Lord Hardwick's stables. I afterwards, by Mr. King's direction, returned the lead to the place where I found it.</p>

            . I am a plumber, and live in Rupert-street, Haymarket, While I was at work at Lady De Grey's, one of my men informed me that some lead had been found in the loft over Lord Grantham's privy, and been put in Lord Hardwick's stables; I assisted in removing it to the loft, and watched with my man and lad. I set my lad to watch through a small hole; we waited there nearly two hours. About ten minutes after eight o'clock the lad said three men were coming down the mews. I rushed out, and secured Prior; the man and the lad secured Trotter - it was in Badman's-mews. When I rushed upon them they dropped something; we found the lead was gone out of the loft, and two pieces in a sack, and one piece out of the sack on the ground just by them; I compared it with the other lead - it tallied with the water-pipe. I assisted in fixing it at Lady De Grey's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That is false, for we did not go out together.</p>

            . They went out together about three o'clock, and returned to the house again about half-past five; I did not take much notice whether they both came in together or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see them together - A. The first time of my seeing them, was when I opened the door, and saw somebody talking by the stile, which is facing the house. This was about half-past seven o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there one or two persons talking - A. Two; the prisoner was one - his wife stood by the gate; I did not see her when I first came out. The prisoner went across the road, and staid talking by the gate to her, and a man who stood by the side of her - they stood talking there near a quarter of an hour; the prisoner and his wife then came into the house, and the man went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man - A. He is a man, whom the prisoner was jealous of; I think his name is Lawrence. I heard the prisoner say he had caught him with her that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did the prisoner say this - A. When he came in doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what time he caught him with her - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they went in did you hear any thing else pass between the prisoner and his wife - A. I heard him call her a w - h - e, and tell her that she had been with this man. She said he was a liar; they had a few words after they came into the house - he called her a w - h - e, and she called him a liar. He asked her if she would go to bed? and she said, Yes. They both went into the bedroom, and I thought they were going to bed. She went to bed, and he undressed himself to go to bed to her - I was in the next room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms are there in the house - A. Two below stairs, and one above, My Lord - he and his wife sleep in one bed below stairs, the children, and the prisoner's father-in-law sleep in the other room. His father-in-law is a watchman - he was on the watch at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the children - A. A little boy and girl, who are the prisoner's wife's brother and sister. I was in the room, going to sleep that night with the children. The prisoner came out of his wife's room, and sat himself on the bed where the children were; he asked me if I was going to bed? I said I believed I should. He then went into his bed-room, came out, and sat himself on the bed again.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came back the second time, was he dressed or undressed - A. Undressed. He sat himself on the bed, and said are you going to bed to the children? I then heard his wife say,</p>
               <p>"I will get up." He went back into his room, and presently after I heard a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it - A. I thought it was with his fist, by the sound. I got up and went to the door - the little boy, who was in the same room that I was, hallooed out,</p>
               <p>"Murder!" I went to the door, the prisoner came out with an axe in his hand, and said, if the boy hallooed out murder again he would murder him - he went back to the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw him come out with the axe, you heard one or more blows - A. One. He went back into his wife's room, and while he was there, I heard her halloo out, very faintly - I thought she said,</p>
               <p>"Lord have mercy upon me!" I think I heard her say so three times. The prisoner came out, and said he had done for her, and he should be hung. He asked the boy where his father's money was? he said he did not know, The prisoner said he wanted money, and money he would have. He took a chisel out of a box, and broke open his father-in-law's box with it, which stood in the room, and took some money out. After that, he asked me for the pen and ink, and wrote two notes - he got the paper out of the baker's book. I was sitting in a chair by the back-door; he brought the axe, held it up to me, and said if either of us spoke a word we should be dead; he said he would go out at the back-door, and listen if he heard us speaking - he went out with the axe in his hand. I gave the alarm over the way to Colleson, at the Crooked Billet, public-house, as soon as I possibly could. It was a moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. What relation are you to the unfortunate woman - A. None, I merely lodged there. They went out together about a quarter before three o'clock, and said they were going to town together.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that they continued together all the while - A. No. I next saw them about half-past seven o'clock - it was then dark. They were talking with another man on the other side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a cow-house near where you heard them talking - A. Just across the field. A very little way from where I heard them talking; I heard some of the conversation - it was in an angry tone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear enough to know that the prisoner was accusing his wife that he had caught her in the act of wh - edom in this cow-house - Q. Yes. I do not know that he mentioned Lawrence's name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Tell us the words he said - A. My Lord, he said he had caught her in the fact along with this man. The prisoner shoved her into the house angrily.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. After he was in the room with her he came out two or three times; was it not with great agitation of manner - A. He seemed very uneasy, and I heard him say he took her pocket up to see what money was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say she was dragged into the cow-house by the man - A. She said she was carried in. The prisoner said if she would swear a rape against the man, he would take him to Worship-street - she said she would not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not add that she loved that man's little finger better than her husband's whole body - A. I did not hear it. When he came out of the room the second time, she said she would get up.</p>

               <p>Q. Though you could not hear all the conversation, did you hear enough to know it was the continuation of the same angry conversation down to the time the blow was given - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am turned twelve years of age. I am brother to the prisoner's wife, who was killed. I was at home about half-past seven o'clock, when my sister and the prisoner came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Which room was you in - A. In the front room, where I sleep - I was up. I went to bed about a quarter of an hour after they came home. My little sister was in bed with me; Mrs. Surry was in my bed-room. My father was gone out to watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came home, did you hear them say any thing to each other - A. Yes; the prisoner and his wife went into the back-room where they sleep - they said nothing then; they both came out into our bed-room again. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I am going to Newington to buy a pair of shoes;" they then went out together. Before they went out they were playing together, pushing one another, and kissing each other.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been married - A. Three years. I went to bed after they went out; I was asleep when they returned. They were jangling, and awoke me; they were then in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us all that passed - A. He then went out at the back-door, and said to his wife,</p>
               <p>"Don't go to make away with yourself." Mrs. Surry said,</p>
               <p>"No, she won't go to make away with herself" - they were both at the back-door at the time - she went to the door with him. Then my sister came in, and sat by the fire in my room; the prisoner afterwards came in and said,</p>
               <p>"Are not you coming to bed?" she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, and are not you coming and all?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am coming to bed directly" - she then went to bed. He undressed himself; I saw them go into their room - I could see into their room, and saw him undress himself. He did not go into bed, but came out again into my room, he then went and looked all the house three times.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean - A. He went all round the under room, as if to look for the axe; he went to the cupboard under the stairs, where the axe was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing away - A. I did not see; he then came to my bed and sat down.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the axe was there that night - A. My father had used it that night to chop some wood, and put it there. My sister asked the prisoner if he was coming to bed? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I am going to sleep with the children." She said,</p>
               <p>"I shall get up then" - he said,</p>
               <p>"No, no, don't get up, I will come to bed to you." Then he went in and out of my room to her two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q, What next - A. He came out and went in again. I then heard him hit her very hard - then he hit her again; I got out of bed, hallooed out Murder! and saw the axe over his shoulder, as if he was going to hit her again. He then came out to me and said,</p>
               <p>"You d - d young rascal, if you offer to call out Murder again I will serve you the same." He then came into the room where I sleep, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have done for her!"</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else - A. He came to Mrs. Surry and me, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you offer to stir or move I will serve you the same." He then went into the room where the deceased was, put on his stockings and breeches, went out, and said to me,</p>
               <p>"Tom, where is your father's money?" I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't take father's money, because he has got to pay his men." He then said,</p>
               <p>"If you offer to stir or move I'll serve you the same." He sat down on my bed, then went and fetched father's box, in which he keeps his tools, took out a chisel, opened father's box with it, and took out a 1 l. note - he put his hand in again, and took something else out, but I could not see what. He then put on his jacket and shoes, went out at the back-door and said,</p>
               <p>"I will stay out here and listen, and if you stir or move I will be the death of you." He went away. Mrs. Surry and I went into Mr. Twigg's house next door, directly, and gave the alarm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was your sister's name - A. Ann.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. What time did your sister and the prisoner go out first - A. About three o'clock; they had been together all day - he did not go to work as it rained; he was a bricklayer's labourer. They were very good friends before they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they went out to buy the shoes they were kissing and playing together - A. Yes. I was in bed when they returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a violent noise when they came in - A. No; the least thing awakes me. He was scolding her, and was very angry.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard about her going with another man - A. I heard a little about that, but not much. The prisoner went in and out of the bed-room, and from one part of the room to the other. The head of their bed is close against the door; I sleep by the side; the door does not shut close.</p>
               <p>Q. They had words in the bed-room - A. Yes, they were always quarrelling. He once turned her out of doors. They had a few words before he came out of the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself; do not you remember her saying she loved the other man's little finger better than his whole body - A. No, I heard nothing of the kind. She said she would get up if he did not come to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words they had in the bed-room - A. He took her pocket away, and she said,</p>
               <p>"You shan't have the money, it is my father's." I heard nothing about any other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say,</p>
               <p>"I have been the death of her?" - A. No, he said</p>
               <p>"I have done for her."</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did she not desire him to come to bed, and he said he would - A. Yes, they were then quiet with each other.</p>

            . I am a constable. About ten o'clock of the night in question, I remember an alarm being given. I went to the house, Mr. Colleson's servant-boy went with me, but did not go into the house. I found a little girl in bed in the other room; I found Mrs. Surry in the next house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find things in the house - A. When I first opened the door I found two puddles of blood near the door. I turned my eye on the right side, and saw the deceased lying on her back on the bed - she was quite dead. I had a light. On the right side of the bed there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270020"/>was a great deal of congealed blood - there was the mark of her head in it. She was quite naked, except part of her shift being over her breast. The surgeon afterwards saw her. I found an axe in the room, which I produce - it was between the two doors, just over the threshold of the door where the children sleep. There was a great deal of blood on the back part of the head of it - there was none on the edge.</p>

            . I am a surgeon; I saw the deceased. There was a wound on the back part of her head, another on the forehead, near the left eye, and another on the temple. The wound on the back part of the head must have been made with a blunt instrument, there was a violent concussion; the others appeared to have been made by some sharp instrument - I should suppose that on the temple to be made with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your judgment, what was the occasion of her death - A. Evidently the blow on the temple; it perforated quite into the brain. There was a compound fracture of the jaw in two places.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might it have been done with the axe - A. The blow on the back of the head might have been done with the back of it.</p>

            Could the other wounds be made with the edge of it - A. I think it impossible, for the axe is large and thick. The wounds appear to be more a stab than a cut.</p>
               <p>Q. The jaw was fractured in two places - A. I should think that to be done with the axe. I certainly think some sharp instrument besides the axe had been used.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the cut be made with the edge of the axe - A. It could not have been cut that depth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bruises which you think were done with the axe sufficient to cause her death - A. There is no doubt of it; the violence of the blow on the back of the head would break the jaw.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RUTHVEN. I am an officer. I found the prisoner at Sandwich - he was delivered into my custody there; I accompanied him to town.</p>
               <p>Q. On the road, without any promise or threat on your part, did he say any thing on the subject - A. He said, that sometime previous his wife went out for a pail of water; she need not have been gone half a minute, but she was gone half an hour. He suspected something, and in the morning he found some cow-dung on her bonnet. That on the evening of the murder he went out to buy some shoes; she wanted to leave him, and sent him to purchase the shoes - on his return he saw she was not in the house, and went to the public-house, she was not there; he went to a cow-hovel just by, looked in, heard a breathing, and saw something white, he went in, put his left knee on the man, and his left hand on her breast; that the man got from her, and was going along by the stile, she kissed him, and wanted to fondle over him (the prisoner) but he told her to go about her business; but previous to that, he said, when he put his hand on her, she said,</p>
               <p>"Is that you, John?" he said it was, and she said she was forced in there by the man, and he said if she would swear that he would forgive her - they both walked to the stile, she wanted to kiss him, but he told her to go away; that they went home, and she said the man forced her into the cow-house, and he said if she would swear that he would forgive her, but she said No, she would see him d - d first, for that she loved that man's little finger better than his whole body. He was going to strike her, but she said if he did she would send him to prison, and there he might rot; that was too much for him, and he up with the axe and struck her, and she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh you rogue!"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. He had surrendered - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Monday, the day before I saw my wife in the evening, she went out for a pail of water, and had no occasion to be gone above a few minutes, she was gone a long while; when she came back I chastised her for it, knowing she had been guilty of what has been stated. She came back and said,</p>
               <p>"I am going for Rumble's clothes to mangle." I thought to myself that she was going after some of her men, as she had acquaintance with several. She was gone a long while - I went out to the gate, looked towards the left, but did not see her. I suspected she was gone to the cow-hovel - I went that way, and saw Lawrence, (whom I afterwards caught in the act of adultery), I did not then know any thing was between them. She came running from the cow-hovel; I told her she had been after no good, and if I caught her she would not like it. She said I might be d - d, and she would do as she pleased. On the Tuesday morning, being wet, I stopped at home till three or four o'clock. I said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, I am going to town to buy a pair of shoes, and you may as well walk me" - she wanted to pledge some things to get money. I said,</p>
               <p>"You may as well walk with me." She said,</p>
               <p>"Indeed I shall not, I shall ride up with one of the coachmen." (She was very intimate with several of the coachmen, and I believe they did as they liked with her). She started off about half an hour before me, we did not go out together; I was to meet her by Shoreditch church - instead of meeting her there, I wandered about a long while, and met her coming with a girl from towards Bishopsgate church. I asked her why she deceived me so for? I should have gone back for nothing if I had missed her. She said,</p>
               <p>"And if you had, you would only have had your walk for nothing." I said,</p>
               <p>"Will you go with me and buy the shoes?" she said</p>
               <p>"No, you may go where you like, I shall go home." She turned back, and said she would go with me. We went to some shoe-shops - I bought none. I said I must go to a man in Globe-fields, who owed me some money - she went home. I could not get the money, and went straight home. I thought she might have been home full two hours before me, but she did not return until almost dark. I asked her where she had been? she would not satisfy me. I said,</p>
               <p>"It is pretty goings on, for you to gad about, and not let me know where you go; if I was to do it how uneasy you would be." She said she did not care, she should do as she liked. We had tea, and had words all the while. She said, as I had not got my shoes I might as well go to Newington. I said there was none there that would suit; she said there were some that would do for me, and my father-in-law said I might get them near the church. When I got there I found no such shop or place. Her being anxious for me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270021"/>to go arose my suspicion. I made all the haste back I could. On my return I opened the gate gently, looked through a crack in the shutter, and thinking she was not at home, I went to the coach-yard, as she was there almost every evening. I then went to the public-house, to see if she was with one Coulson, the hostler, whom I once caught with her at Edmonton - I then thought of the cow-dung I had found on her bonnet. I then went to the cow-hovel softly, put my ear to the door, and heard a panting for breath - (Here the prisoner minutely described the situation in which he found his wife with

            ). She said,</p>
               <p>"I hope you will forgive me, John, for who can I live with better than my dear husband?" I used several bad expressions, and said I would forgive her. She said the man forced her there. I said to the man,</p>
               <p>"Did you or did you not do so?" he said he did. I said,</p>
               <p>"I will freely forgive you, my dear, if you will swear a rape against him at Worship-street. The man then escaped about twenty yards across the field - we came up to him again. She said to me,</p>
               <p>"You may be d - d, I don't care for you. I love his little finger better than your whole body." The man said it was all his fault, and went away. I got her something to drink, and said she should go home immediately, until I had made up my mind about leaving her - it was all in the heat of passion. I got her some gin and peppermint, and told her the man might go, for I knew where to find him, and would have him up to-morrow. I took her to the gate, and certainly used bad language to her, and said I would forgive her if she would live with him or

            , or who she liked. She said,</p>
               <p>"there is Mr. Pearson going by, and he well knows what I am." I told her to go in doors, she swore she would not - I pushed her in, and told Surry of the adultery - she said she pitied me. After that she got up and cried, and went into the yard very much enraged. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make away with yourself, we will part peaceably." She came in and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't think I am going to make away with myself for such a d - d **** as you." I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't use that language, or you shall feel for it." She went to bed, and asked if I was coming? I said I did not know that I should, for I might as well have a prostitute. She said if I did not come to bed, she would get up, and go to the man she loved. I said I would come to bed if she would appear against the man at Worship-street; she said she would not, for he had treated her well. I went in and out of the room in a great rage; she was exclaiming the bitterest oaths. I went to her, and said I would come to bed if she would not use such language. She said,</p>
               <p>"You may be d - d, for I don't care for you." At last she said,</p>
               <p>"As you have struck me, you shall lay in prison and rot." I said,</p>
               <p>"Say that again!" she said it, the axe laid by, I took it up and struck her once; she said,</p>
               <p>"You *****!" I struck her two or three times. After that was done I put on my clothes, and moved her to the right side of the bed, kissed her, and said,</p>
               <p>"God bless you, my dear; you was once my comfort, I have been the death of you, and you will be the death of me." I came into the room, the boy was crying Murder! I said</p>
               <p>"Say nothing, or I shall be the death of you all." I asked him where his father's money was? for money I must have, in order that I might have time to repent for what I have done. I took the chisel to open the box, it was not locked. I took a 1 l. note out, and asked Surry for a pen and ink; I told her to say nothing, that I might not be detected yet, and I dare say I should soon be caught, for I dearly loved the girl, and should not he happy. I wrote on a piece of paper,</p>

It was however extraordinary, that the window had not been cleaned, and if she intended to do it, her getting on a table would put it out of her power so to do. She had also declared, that the prisoner had nothing to do with it. The Coroner's Jury had, however, found a verdict against him; but he (Mr. Alley), had no evidence to prove that he was ever near the house, or in any way whatever to connect him with the transaction. Under all these circumstances, he deemed it entirely useless to offer any evidence.</p>

I went with others into the house to get the servant out - a gentleman went down the area and opened the street door; I and several others rushed in, and searched every place we safely could. We searched in the back-parlour, but saw no person there, only a bed; we afterwards went there again, and saw the prisoner moving her head from under the bed-clothes in a state of great insensibility; several of us spoke to her, but she made no answer - she had only her shift on; the corner of the bed and bedstead were on fire. We took her to the opposite house, No. 14, returned, and immediately brought her bed over for her to lay on, then went to the house, and assisted in getting the furniture out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the fire come from - A. From the staircase - it burnt downwards. I went over to see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. During the time you was carrying her over, did she return to a state of sensibility - A. I perceived an alteration, but on my return from moving the furniture, which was about two hours, I found a great alteration in her; she talked rationally, but was a little convulsed at times. I asked her if she knew in what way the fire happened? She said she was the person who was guilty, and did not wish for any thing but to suffer. I asked her how she could think of committing such a dreadful crime? She said her friends had all turned their backs upon her, that her character was blasted, and she had no remedy whatever to get rid of her enemies but by being burnt in the flames. I asked her if she had been ill-advised by any one to do it? She said No, she was the person who had done it, and that she did not wish to lay the blame upon any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person come in while this was going forward - A. Yes, a lady whom she had formerly lived with. She exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Oh Jane!" The prisoner wept, and said she was guilty. I asked her which way she set fire to the house? She said by cutting the sheets, and setting fire to them in the back kitchen, that she got up about three o'clock in the morning, and took some laudanum and Holland's out of her master's cellaret, and about five o'clock in the morning she retired to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. You did not at first find her in the bed - A. No, the blankets were rolled over her. She seemed to me to talk rational; she said she set two sheets on fire in the back kitchen, there was no appearance of the fire ascending up - it could not be so for there was no fire below whatever. She had three or four scratches on her throat, as if she had attempted to make away with herself.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at No. 74, Seymour-place; I was called in to attend to the prisoner. I found her in the front parlour of No. 14, wrapped up in a blanket; she was then in convulsions, which subsided in a minute or two. She then became convulsed again, and was in a considerable agitation; I was told that she had been burnt, but I found that was not the case. I examined her throat, and found that she had attempted to cut it - the wounds were comparatively trifling, so that they did not excite my attention particularly - there were two or three scratches on it. I left her, and in the course of two hours went to her again, and found her comparatively tranquil; she was still in a state of agitation, but not convulsed. A man said, in her hearing, that she had confessed every thing. I asked her if it was true that she had set fire to the house? and she said it was. I asked her what could be her inducement to commit such a crime? She replied that her character had been destroyed by a parcel of rubbish - that was her expression. From what I heard, I asked her if a soldier was connected with her? She distinctly and positively answered No; but in the course of the conversation she said she could not speak the truth for fear of ruining people. I gathered from her general insinuations, that she had been ill-treated by her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she account for the wounds in her throat - A. She told me she had attempted to cut her throat with her master's razor; from the nature of the wounds it was evident that they had been inflicted by some sharp instrument - she said she had taken laudanum, and from her description of the quantity, I should suppose it to be about a table-spoonful.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that likely to kill - A. It depends upon the constitution, and whether the person is used to take it. She was moved to the Westminster Infirmary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Her conversation was very incoherent - A. Very. It is impossible for me to form an opinion as to the mind of a person, who had met with such an accident as she had. I certainly should not pronounce her a person of sound mind.</p>

            . I am apothecary to the Marylebone Infirmary. On Sunday the 3d of October the prisoner was brought there. I had a little conversation with her, but her answers were exceedingly inconsistent, and unintelligible.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such effects be produced by strong opiates - A. It might; she was very sick, and vomited, which was of a dark colour; I could not ascertain what it was as it was mixed with bile. She never appeared in a collected state, except on a few points - she talked a great deal of nonsence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about this circumstance - A. She seemed to have an apathy to the conversation, and said she set fire to the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. You had conversation with her several times - A. Yes, at least a dozen. I have no doubt she was insane while she was in the infirmary.</p>
               <p>Q. After the effect of the laudanum was gone off, a person of sane mind would resume her reason - A. Yes, but as the effect went off, the derangement developed itself - it is common for insane persons to know what they have been about. Persons are insane on different points; her conversation throughout was that of an insane person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you judge whether the insanity had continued any time - A. I should judge it had been of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270023"/>long duration; it was a melancholy derangement, which comes on gradually.</p>

               <p>Q. After you heard of this, did you go to her - A. I saw her on the Monday morning after the fire, at the infirmary. She told me that she had set fire to the house, and was uneasy in her mind.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched the house, and found none of the property stolen - A. A fortnight before the fire happened I examined the house - she had confessed to me at the Infirmary that she had made away with some of the property, and mentioned three different shops where she had pawned it. I saw some of the goods there. I found a cream-pot, a bible, and a pair of sugar-tongs at Flint's; she said there were two ten-spoons, and a sheet at Monk-house's, in Chandler-street. I went there; they did not own to me that they had them. I went to another shop in Crawford-street, but found nothing.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 26th of October, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street, near Artillery-lane, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards me; I ran and stopped him - another young man also laid hold of him. The prosecutor came up in about a minute, and said the prisoner had robbed him of his watch. I endeavoured to search him, but he had the watch in his right hand, and held it at a distance from me, with his hand stretched out. I told him to give it to me, but he at first refused; I took it out of his hand, but did not find the seals - part of the ribbon hung to the watch. I took him to the watch-house - he said nothing; I found only a halfpenny on him - I never saw him before. On taking him to the Compter I searched his foraging cap, and found a razor concealed in it - he is a soldier.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor in Houndsditch, and he asked me to go and drink with him. We went to the Nag's Head, public-house, and had a pint of beer and a pint of gin. He went up a court with me, and I asked him the time? - he took his watch out. The wicked thought came to my mind at that moment, to cut the ribbon, and take the watch, which I did. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

When I returned I perceived the child was gone away, and saw a crowd about fifteen yards from the cart - a gentleman told me that a box had been taken from my cart. I found the things taken out of the cart, and the hind part let down, which was not so when I left it. I went to the crowd, and and found the child standing over the box, which I had left in the cart, crying. The prisoner was in custody - he was a stranger. He was charged with stealing the box, and taken to the watch-house. The box is here.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Paul's-alley, Aldersgate-street. I was in Fenchurch-street on Saturday evening, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, and saw three men looking into the prosecutor's cart - a little boy stood by the horse's head; I am certain the prisoner was one of them. I suspected them and went a few yards off to watch - I saw them look into the cart again. I then saw the prisoner go up to the boy at the horse's head and speak to him - he was there about a minute. I then saw the child leave him at the horse's head, and go across the road. I heard the patrol coming, and told him my suspicions; he watched with me. I crossed over, left the patrol on the other side, and saw the prisoner let down the tailboard of the cart - the other two were standing by. I saw the prisoner take the box out of the cart, and when he got about fifteen or twenty yards off with it, I took hold of him; the patrol came up and took him. He said that a gentleman had given him the box to carry for him - that could not be true, as I saw him take it out. I left him with the patrol, and found the child about a dozen yards off, crying. Cropley came up in about two or three minutes, and claimed the box.</p>

            . I am eight years of age. I went to London with Cropley; he went away, leaving me in care of the cart, at the horse's head. Three thieves spoke to me - the prisoner was one of them. He asked me if I would go for a penny roll, and said he would give me a halfpenny for my trouble; he gave me three halfpence. I was to go to the baker's shop over the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to take care of the cart while you went - A. He said he would mind the horses' head, I did not got to the baker's, but kept walking sideways, and saw him take the box out of the cart. I then ran back and hallooed - he was stopped with it.</p>

I was passing through the crowd - the prisoner was coming in another direction, so as to meet me. I felt him hustle against me, which I thought might arise merely from the crowd, but as he was hustling against me, I felt his hand go from my fob. I looked down, and perceived that the ribbon had been cut, and the seals were gone - no other hand was near my fob but the prisoner's. I turned to catch hold of him - he was near me, but in consequence of two ladies being in the way, I could not secure him. I immediately called out Stop thief! and he turned the corner of Charlotte-row. I followed him, and saw him throw the seals down an area, and the scissars also, but the scissars hung on the rail. He was secured within twenty yards of that place, and was never out of my sight. The seals were delivered to me from the area by the gentleman of the house, and on coming back I found the remainder of the ribbon on the pavement, which had been cut off.</p>

On the 15th of October, after dinner, I heard a noise in the kitchen, as if something had fallen down. I went down and found all the dishes and things broken and thrown about, and the prisoner in a state of intoxication. She kept her bed-room door locked, which created my suspicion; I asked her for the key, which she refused. I sent for one of the Marshal's men, who came and found a number of duplicates on her - next day, the articles stated in the indictment were produced at the Mansion House. We went to her bedroom, and in the bed, between the sheets and blankets, were five bottles of wine. We went down to the cellar to see how she could get it, and found the brick-work had been taken away - an iron heater laid by. The lock had been forced back. I had heard her come from the cellar and go to her bed-room three or four times that morning. She came into my service on the 2d of August, without a character.</p>

I came to a crowd before a picture shop, which resisted my progress; I fell, and a person came close against me - my attention was directed to him, and I saw my handkerchief pass from him. I saw the prisoner attempting to conceal it behind him, and saw it drop from him. I immediately seized him, and he said it was not him - I saw another boy near him. I took him to Guildhall myself; he persisted in his innocence till he got halfway to Guildhall, then began crying, and said I had no business to take him. He was very insolent indeed.</p>

            . I am a wholesale clothes salesman, and live in the Minories. I was crossing America-square on the 23d of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, and observed the prisoner with the piece of cloth by a private door, about thirty yards from the prosecutor's. I suspected him, went back, and asked him what he was going to do there? He said he was going to leave the cloth at that house. I asked him if he had knocked at the door? He said he had knocked twice; I then knocked for him. The servant said he had not knocked before. An officer was sent for, who took him into custody.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KINNERSLEY. I took the prisoner and cloth in charge, and found it belonged to the prosecutor. The prisoner said a person gave it to him to carry.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner at the sign of the Bag of Nails, public-house, Pimlico, on the 9th of October, and told him I had taken him for robbing his master; he said he got into bad company, and lost the greatest part of the money that night, and that he was afraid to return. I found only 1 s. on him.</p>

I was all of a sudden stopped and hustled by a gang of fellows; they shoved me up against the palings - there was an immense crowd waiting to see an air-balloon go off. I was not among the crowd, but was surrounded in a moment, and felt a tug at my watch. I then went back to my chaise, which I had left in the road at a little distance, and inquired for a constable, who came. I told him I had lost my watch, which I at first thought I had; soon after I found my watch was left behind, but my chain and seals gone - I have no distinct recollection of any of the men. I gave the officer my address, and a few days after I was sent for to Worship-street Office.</p>
               <p>JAMES M'MURDO. On the 2d of October, between two and three o'clock, I was standing by some palings by the Belvidere, and saw a gang of fellows hustling every gentleman that passed. As soon as the prosecutor got out of his chaise, before he could hardly get on the pavement, the prisoner, Green, gave him a shove. Some more fellows came round him, and I saw Green snatch something from the prosecutor's fob, and go away - I cannot say what it was. The prosecutor thought at that moment that he had lost his watch, and said so; the rest of the gang kept the prosecutor in conversation, and said he was gone that way, but I saw him go the other way. As soon as the prosecutor got from the gang, I got down and said, if I saw the man I should know him again - I went down the road a little way, but could not see him. When I came back to where I was before, I saw the prisoner return to the gang. The officer then came to me, and I went with him to point the prisoners out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the other man - A. I saw him in the gang. Green held up his finger to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here, Bill." I had been on the palings, watching them, for about half an hour, and am sure they are the men - I suppose there were about twenty in the gang. When Green beckoned to Farmer, immediately turned and went to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. There were a great many collected to see the balloon - A. Yes. Green beckoned to Farmer before he took the chain - he stood close to Farmer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he need not have beckoned to him - A. His head was turned another way. It was done in an instant.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of October I and Gleed were in Pentonville-road; the prosecutor was in his chaise - some persons told him we were officers. He then said he had lost his watch-chain and seals. I told him to give me his address, and if I heard any thing of it, I would let him know. Just after that, M'Murdo came up, and said he would show me the two men who had robbed this gentleman. We went about eight or ten yards into the crowd, and he pointed the prisoners out. We took them and searched them, but found nothing on them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their case to their counsel.</p>

            . I am president of the Inland division at the General Post Office. On the 24th of November, 1818, the prisoner was employed in the Post Office as a charger of letters; he was on duty that evening. He was in the Dover division.</p>
               <p>Q. The letters are faced, stamped, charged, and sorted all in one large room - A. Yes, for the whole kingdom. Facing, is turning them on their faces, they then are stamped with the date of the month and year, and then taken to tables, and sorted for different places.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all the persons that are round the room for the purpose of charging go to the sorting table to take their letters - A. Occasionally; there are boxes all round the room where the chargers sit. Messengers take them, or the chargers fetch them from the sorting table.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this a correct plan of the office - A. It is - (looking at it).</p>
               <p>(The plan was then handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in the power of any of the chargers to secrete a letter belonging to his own division, or any other - A. It is in their power. It occasionally happens that a charger finds a letter in his place, which does not belong to his division, and each sorter has what is called a blind box, to put the mis-sorted letters in, and they are then resorted.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter ought to have gone to the Rye division - A. Yes, it could more naturally be mis-sorted to the Dover division than any other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. There are a great many men employed in that room - A. A great many - this letter did not belong to the prisoner's division; he would not have received it into his division if it had been sorted correctly. The charger occasionally goes to the sorting table, and has an opportunity of taking any letter.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner was in attendance that night - A. I refer to the attendance book, which I keep myself, and find that he was in attendance that evening - his name is signed by himself in this book as being in attendance, and countersigned by me. He leaves the office at eight o'clock.</p>

            . In November last I lived at No. 25, in Flint-street, Blackfriars-road, nearly opposite the Magdalen Hospital. I have known the prisoner, unfortunately, four or five years. I did not know his name or residence.</p>
               <p>Q. In November last, did he call on you - A. Yes, on a Wednesday evening, between eight and nine o'clock at night, About half an hour after he came he gave me a 5 l. bank note to change, and told me to buy any thing to drink. I went to Mr. Hicks, who keeps the Bell, public-house, in Friar-street, and applied to

               <p>Q. Did he make any purchase of you that evening - A. Yes, he bought a pug dog of me that evening for 1 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometime after, did a gentleman call upon you from the Bank about the note - A. Yes, with Mr. Hicks - I think it was on the Saturday before Christmas day - I did not then know the prisoner's name or residence. After that I saw him go by the top of Flint-street, and told him that a gentleman from the Bank, had told me to send for Mr. Hicks whenever he came again. He told me he had been extremely ill - he appeared ill, and I told him I thought it might be his death to be taken by surprise for passing a forged note, which I then supposed it to be. He said he was very much obliged to me for not doing it, and that he would behave like a man of honour, and come and pay me the note on Friday week, but he never did. I did not see him again until I saw him at the Post Office on the 9th of August - he was then taken into custody. I was ordered to attend there.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any other persons in the room when you saw him at the Post Office - A. Yes, a number of other gentlemen - about a dozen, I should think. I knew him again. He has called on me a great many times in the course of the last three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen your pug dog since - A. Yes, Vickery shewed it to me. I knew it again, and the dog knew me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You say, unfortunately, you have known the prisoner four years - A. Yes, I often had money from him - he made me a present out of that 5 l. note. Nobody was present when he gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a 5 l. note from any other person about that time - A. No. I have not seen any of the notes that I got in change for it.</p>
               <p>A. Then you know nothing to ascertain that he gave you the note, except your own statement - A. No. I often change notes at that public-house. I have changed 5 l. notes more than once for gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not odd that you should ask money for the dog - A. I told him it was promised, and he asked me how much I was to have for it? I said 1 l., and he gave me a 1 l. note for it - it was quite a pup.</p>

            , ESQ. I am superintendent president at the General Post Office. On the 9th of August the prisoner was employed in the Post Office, as a charger of letters, and had an opportunity of taking any letter brought to the office that night.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of suspicion which arose, was he on the evening of the 9th of August brought into your office - A. He was, and Vickery searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter - A. It was found in his pocket, it was then wafered, and had not been opened; it had the stamp of that night on it, and contained the halves of two 10 l. notes, which it does now - I saw them marked. Mr. Parkins asked him how he became possessed of it? I think he gave no answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It could not have come into his hands in the course of his employment - A. Any letter might come into his hands in the course of his employ; he was a charger of letters. This has not been charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say it came into his possession in the course of his employment - A. No doubt of it. It is stamped, and ought to have been charged. He was brought into my office between seven and eight o'clock. The letters go at eight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The stamping is done before it comes to the charger - A. Yes, my Lord; but the stamping is a proof that it came into the General Post Office - they are stamped in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a person who is skilled in letters, able to tell whether they have bank notes in them - A. It is our duty to look at the letters, to see if bank notes are in them. We have a strong lamp, with a reflector, and by holding a letter under that lamp we can see, without any difficulty, whether they have an inclosure or not - this would be charged a treble letter. It is the duty of the charger to ascertain that.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably, when a charger saw it, he would not be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270030"/>able to tell whether there were one or two notes - A. It requires experience.</p>
               <p>(The notes were then put in and read, Nos. 19002, dated 30th of June, 1819, and 2292 dated 16th of July, 1819.)</p>

On the 1st of October, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in New-lane, Enfield - it was moonlight; he was coming in a direction from his own house. I asked him what he had got? took a shovel from him, and asked him what mark was on in it? He said</p>
               <p>"Robinson;" and asked me not to take it away. I took it from him, and while we were talking I saw a person go by on the other side of the hedge, within eight and nine yards of us - he had something on his head. The field is higher ground than the road; he passed by a low part of the hedge by which means I saw him. I left the prisoner to go after him, expecting to meet him in the gap - I could not find him, but when I got into the field, I saw a sack lying forty or fifty yards from where I saw the man - it contained flesh. I gave it to my comrade, and immediately went in pursuit of the prisoner; I came up with him about a hundred and fifty yards off, going into his own yard. I told him that I had found a sack, and thought he must know something about it, which obliged me to take him into custody. He then threw down a bag, which contained a sheep's pluck and a chisel. I asked him who it was on the other side of the hedge? He said he knew nothing about him. He begged very hard to be let go, and said he had a large family, who were starving.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag that he threw down, the same that he had when you first saw him - Q. Yes, my Lord - I did not take notice whether it was warm or cold. Spencer came up with the bag that was found in the field, and we took it to my house; I found it was the carcase of a sheep, wrapped up in a smock-frock. I afterwards went to Mr. Bottomley, and found a sheep's skin in a wood, in some bushes - it was marked. There was a mark of blood on it, just by where the sheep had been killed, and hung on a tree.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skin shewn to Hackett - A. He was with me when I found it. I saw it compared with the carcase - the trotters were left in the skin; they appeared to correspond - it was slaughtered very well. The shovel, which he said belonged to Robinson, was marked W W. I do not know the other man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the magistrate that you saw two men run away - A. No.</p>

            . I was with Cufley; the prisoner had a shovel and a small bag - he said the shovel belonged to Mr. Robinson. I caught a glimpse of some person on the other side of the hedge, with a sack on his head. We took the shovel from the prisoner, and let him go with the bag. We then went to the field and found a bag containing meat, but I did not particularly notice it then. I was left with it, and came up with Cufley just by the prisoner's door - he had secured him; he begged to be let go. Cufley then had a little bag in his hand; we took both the bags to his house; the bag in the field contained the carcase of a sheep. I then went to the wood, which was three miles from where we found the sack - we found the skin there. I have been a butcher five years; the sheep appeared to have been slaughtered very well. I saw it compared with the skin, and they corresponded. There was a bit of skin left on the carcase, which matched with a hole in the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you compare the pluck - A. That is very difficult. I put it inside, and laid the windpipe to the head, but it is impossible to speak to it. The carcase was hot, and the pluck warm - the pluck would cool sooner than the carcase. The prisoner is not a butcher. I have known him five years.</p>
               <p>Q. None but a butcher could cut up a sheep in that way - A. No, my Lord; we found the bag nearer the prisoner's house than where we met him - he was not coming from it, but going towards it. The other man was going towards the prisoner's house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. William Bottomley, and look after his sheep. On Friday morning, a little before six o'clock, Cufley came to me. I then counted my sheep, missed one, and went to a wood with him, about forty yards from where our sheep are kept, and found the skin. There were marks on it where the sheep had been killed, and hung on a tree to dress; the skin is marked W B, which is my master's mark - it was a ewe; we could not tell how long it had been killed - I took it home - they were all safe at six o'clock the night before. I compared it with the carcase which Cufley shewed me, and every thing appeared to correspond. A bit of skin was left on the carcase, which also matched; I cannot say whether the pluck agreed. New-lane is about two miles from my master's.</p>

On the 16th of September, between eleven and one o'clock in the morning, I lost these handkerchiefs - I was not at home at the time. I went with Furzeman and found the prisoner, Watkins, in custody at the watch-house; he said he did not do it, but he knew who did. In consequence of what he said, I went in search of the boys, but did not then find them. I went to Mrs. Wasman's, in Vine-street, Chandos-street. I went up to the first floor, saw a woman there, and asked leave to search the house? She refused at first, because I had no warrant. I went to Bow-street for one, but the magistrate was gone; I returned and told the officer so. He applied to her a second time, and she said he might search, but we found nothing. About eight o'clock in the evening, the officer and I went to the one shilling gallery of the Cobourg Theatre, and there secured the other two prisoners.</p>

            . One Wednesday in September I was crossing from Drury-lane to Museum-street, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, opposite Mr. Manning's, and saw a little boy, standing with his back against a post, opposite his house - it rained very hard; he had no hat on. I walked a little further, and saw the prisoner, Watkins; he gave a whistle, and the little boy ran up to him - they both stood before me. Watkins said something to him, which I did not hear; the child said to him,</p>
               <p>"They have not been out." Watkins told the child to keep his post, and then the child went back to the post. Watkins kept a few paces before me, and whistled again, two boys, apparently of a height, came up to him. I left them talking together, went back to see what it all meant, and saw them round Mr. Manning's shop; I went in and told the shopman of it. The boys' backs were towards me - I do not know the other prisoners.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Manning. On Thursday morning, about half-past eleven o'clock, the last witness came to the shop, and gave me information. She went to the door, and pointed to Watkins, who was smoking a pipe and leaning on a post. She said our house was beset by that man, and some boys. I went into the shop, and asked Cheesewright, the shopman, if we had lost any thing? He immediately went to the window, and found a pane of glass cut out, and lying in the window as if it had been pushed in, and six silk handkerchiefs gone. The glass was safe when I opened the shop at seven o'clock in the morning - the handkerchiefs were of a chocolate colour.</p>
               <p>JAMES CHEESEWRIGHT. I am shopman to the prosecutor. On the 16th of September I was in the adjoining shop when the information was given that the window was cut. I was called in, and found a piece of silk handkerchiefs gone, which I had put there that morning, exactly opposite the pane which was cut and pushed in - the glass had been newly put in; the handkerchiefs were not put two inches from the glass. I then went out, and observed Watkins at the opposite corner. His noticing us made me suspect him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 16th of September, I took Watkins about one o'clock, at Seven Dials, and asked him where he was at half-past eleven? he made no reply. I then asked him what he was doing at the corner of Museum-street? he said he was there - I took him to the watch-house. I fetched Mr. Manning to the watch-house, and in consequence of information which I had received from Watkins, I went in search of Collis and Margett. About a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon Cook came up to me, and in consequence of his information, Manning, myself, and him went to an iron-shop kept by Mrs. Wasman, and asked her if she had bought any handkerchiefs that morning? she said, No. I said,</p>

               <p>"Have the goodness to let me search, I have no warrant." - she refused. I sent Mr. Manning for a warrant, he returned in a quarter of an hour, she then let me search. I found nothing, nor did I expect it, for I had left her husband down stairs all the while. I then went to the Cobourg Theatre, and took the two other prisoners.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Rose-court, Crown-street, Soho - I know Collis and Margett. On Thursday morning, the 16th of September, about ten o'clock, or a little after, I was in Seven Dials with others; Collis and Margett came up with some things in a blue apron - they called two or three more lads away. Margett had something in a blue apron under his arm. He spoke to one of the young lads who stood there, and said he had seen Long Jerry (there is a constable whom they call by that name) - that Jerry was coming by them, looked very hard at them, and that he (Margett) said,</p>
               <p>"I must go and put this on, or my father will blow me up." They then went off to get breakfast, as they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what was in the apron - A. Not then. I met them in Compton-street about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, they asked me where I was going? I said I was going home. They asked me to go with them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270032"/>Chandos-street. They went up Long-acre into Angel-alley, and there shewed me the handkerchiefs - they took me into a necessary to shew them to me; there were five in one piece, and one by itself - they were chocolate-colour, and about a yard and a quarter square. They then began to run, and told me to run too, as they were in a hurry. They then went to Vine-street - Margett took them into an old iron-shop, kept by Mrs. Wasman. He staid there near a quarter of an hour, then came down, and said the lady only offered him 16 s. for the six. Collis said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it! we must not take that - we can get more by pledging them." Margett said,</p>
               <p>"We had better take it, or we shall get caught with them." He went up, and remained there about five minutes; he then came down and said she had given him 17 s. for the handkerchiefs, and one for himself to do what he liked with.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the money - A. Margett gave 8 s. 6 d. to Collis, who gave me 2 d.. I suspected they had stolen the handkerchiefs, and asked them if they had done so? they would not tell me for a long while, at last they said they had taken them out of a linen-draper's window, but did not say where - Margett then gave me 2 d. also. He went to a shop and got dinner, and Collis went and bought a hat in Broad-street, St. Giles's; they then left him, and Margett bought a pair of boots in Monmouth-street; he then went and bought two laces for his boots. A woman came up to Collis, and told him not to come near Seven Dials, for Watkins was taken - they then went away. Collis said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, that is right! - Watkins is taken up for us, and we shall get through it." One

On the 7th of October I was called from dinner, and found the prisoner handling a coat on a clothes-horse inside the shop - he went towards the door. Supposing him a customer I tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him what he wanted? I brought him into the middle of the shop, my young man charged him with having a waistcoat under his jacket - it was found on him. I asked him why he took it? he said it was pretty, and he thought he should like it. He had left the shop without my knowing he had it. I spoke English to him, he understood me perfectly well.</p>

            . I live at Cambridge. On the morning of the 2d of September, between three and four o'clock, I went into a public-house at the corner of Cow-lane, Smithfield - the business was just beginning. I then had 203 l. 1 s. in notes - there were ten 10 l. and twenty 5 l. Cambridge Bank; two 1 l. Cambridge Old Bank, and a guinea note of the Newmarket Bank.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner before - A. She was standing in the public-house when I went in. I had not been in more than two minutes before she accosted me, and asked for something to drink. I found from her talk that she was Irish - I refused to give her any, telling her she had better ask her countryman, Captain O'Connor, who was with me - I believe he gave her a glass, if not two; then he and I, and Mr. Warburton, left the house together. Bryan was sitting on a seat behind the prisoner, among the drovers of the market - she appeared to be a woman of the town. The prisoner followed us out; it was getting daylight.

I felt her feeling about my person - my notes were in a canvas purse in my left-hand breeches-pocket. She took me up a small court on the right side of the lane; my companions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270033"/>stopped at the end of the court. We stopped there not more than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you - A. She felt about my person several times. We came all the way down Cow-lane together, and were together about ten minutes after we left the house. She left me at the bottom of Holborn-hill; I there met a person whom I knew, got into conversation with him, and she disappeared. I saw no more of her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your notes - A. In about half an hour after. I walked back with the person to Cow-lane again, without suspecting any thing. I had been in communication with nobody but that person and the prisoner, until I missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way had you known that person - A. I had met him before. I am positive I had my notes when I was in the public-house. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You was not acquainted with her before - A. Never till that morning. I am a married man. I met no other woman but her - there was nobody in company with her at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you went to see the fair proclaimed - A. I intended to see it. I did not take the numbers of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. No, I had not taken a bottle of wine from dinner-time till then. I had not been to bed, I had been to Astley's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in a little row before this - A. There was a dispute between two gentlemen and a coachman two hours before. We went in a coach from the White Horse - two other gentlemen came in another coach. The other coachman wanted 6 s., there was a scuffle between them; the gentleman was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not pretend that you was a special constable, and would take care of the man; then take him to the end of the street and let him go - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man escape - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the watch-house - A. They took Mr. Candler to the watch-house. He resisted, and we persuaded him to go.</p>
               <p>Q. The notes made a large bundle - A. Yes; they were in my left-hand breeches pocket; thirty were in a roll, and the other three by the side of them - they were all in the bag, and the bag rolled round. I did not feel them taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you and she together - A. I went into a little court on the right-hand side of Cow-lane, as you go to Fleet-market. She followed me out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You and she separated from them - A. Yes, they stood at the end of the court. I met no other girls before I missed my money. The bag was never found.</p>
               <p>Q. You advertised the property as lost - A. Yes. It is impossible that I could have dropped it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure the bundle of notes were in your pocket when you entered the public-house - A. It was, my Lord. The dispute with the coachman was two hours before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in your pocket when you left the public-house - A. Nobody touched me in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, when she left you, ask for any money - A. No. She left without taking leave of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive her feel about your person after you left the court - A. No, my Lord.</p>

            . On the 2d of September last, at night, I went to Smithfield with the prosecutor; there was a row in the street about a hackney-coach. I did not hear him represent himself as a special constable. I went to the public-house in Cow-lane with him, and remained there about ten minutes; I observed the prisoner there, and am sure of her person;

             was there also. I, the prosecutor, and O'Connor all three came away together. I saw the prisoner take hold of Mr. Browning's arm in Cow-lane, we went on. I saw them turn up a passage by themselves. The prosecutor was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been with him all the evening - A. I met him after he came from Astley's. I do not recollect whether I dined him with that day; we did not sup together.</p>
               <p>Q. After you left Astley's, where did you go - A. To the White Horse, and from thence to Smithfield. The prosecutor was not at all drunk. We talked with no girls; we went in a coach to the fair.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is the passage from the public-house - A. Perhaps fifty yards. We stopped a few minutes for the prosecutor, and then went away; he did not overtake us.</p>
               <p>HANNAH EAGLETON. I have gone by the name of Bryant and Manley. I and a man named Manley lived at No. 4, Pitt's-place, Drury-lane - the prisoner also lived there with her daughter, who is fifteen or sixteen years old. I have known the prisoner three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 2d of September did you and she go out together - A. We went to see Lady Holland's mob; we were about there until two or three o'clock in the morning, then went to a public-house at the top of Cow-lane, and saw Mr. Browning there with three or four more friends, and a gentleman with one arm.</p>

             (in contination). The prisoner asked the prosecutor to treat her, he referred her to the Captain. They staid no great while; she followed them out - I came out directly after her, and followed; she went up the first turning on the right in Cow-lane with Mr. Browning.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner went with him did she say any thing to you - A. She desired me to stay at the top of the court till she came back - I staid there for twenty minutes or half an hour; she came out of the court then, and the gentleman went over the road. She said,</p>
               <p>"I have picked his pocket!" and shewed me a bundle in a bag, and two half-crowns. She said,</p>
               <p>"You b - g - r, if you don't run we shall both be hung!" We ran through courts and places until daylight; we went to the bottom of Holborn, by the church, and she there stripped the bag of the notes, put them into her pocket, and threw the bag down in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270034"/>street in Shoe-lane. She shewed me one of the notes in particular, it was a Newmarket guinea note, with the number torn off at the bottom - I told her it was of no use. She said she had plenty more in her possession, enough to support us for five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you then go - A. We walked about; it rained very hard; we went about till near six o'clock, and then went to a wine vaults at the end of Gray's Inn-lane, in Holborn; I should know the landlord if I saw him; we went in with a man whom I do not know - he was not in our company, he only went in at the same time. The landlord served us; the prisoner said she wished to pay him 9 s. or 10 s. which she owed him. The stranger treated me with a glass of liquor, and she had something to drink. I did not see the money she paid the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time your left your house what had you to drink - 
               <persName id="t18191027-60-person635">A. </persName>

               <p>Q. What reward was offered - A. I do not know. I did not give this information for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reward - A. Fifty pounds, I believe; but I did not lay the information; I never saw the handbills. I did not know there was a reward, until after I was taken. A woman laid the information. I told the officer the truth - I had mentioned it before. I did not know of the reward until she was taken to Guildhall. I was taken to Hatton-garden twice with her before that, about it. I was never out with her before that night.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Before you was taken up about killing a man unknown, had you been before the magistrate about the prisoner - A. Yes, Manley is the man I am charged with stabbing; he is here.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the morning of the 3d of September - A. Yes, I saw my wife and the prisoner together at the Black Dog, public-house, Drury-lane, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - in my opinion they were both drunk. The prisoner's daughter lived with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did her daughter say any thing to you in the presence of the prisoner - A. Yes, her daughter shewed me a Newmarket guinea note. I said it was a bad one, because there was no number on it - it was torn where the number should be. The prisoner told me to hold my noise, for she had plenty more - this was the same day. I saw it again next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That was the day they were drunk - A. Yes, I do not exactly know what time I got up that morning. To the best of my opinion I went to look for her at the public-house between eight and nine o'clock.</p>

The first day I saw it in her daughter's hand in my room, next day I saw it in the prisoner's room, in her daughter's hand - it was the same that I had seen before,; to the best of my opinion it was torn in the same place - one guinea was written on it. It was torn at the corner.</p>

            . I am brother to the last witness. On the 14th of September I was with him; the prisoner said her name was Horgan Bridget - I am sure she is the person. To the best of my recollection, the man who was with her took the notes from the prisoner's handkerchief, counted them out, put them on the desk, and I took them. I paid the notes to Edward Cuell, with other notes, which were very trifling. I remember there was a 50 l. note, and some 10 l. among the notes, but how many I cannot tell.</p>

Bank notes on her, Nos. 73687 and 73675, dated August 17, 1819. I produce them, also a Bank stock receipt for 100 l., which I found in a drawer in the front room on the first floor.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent. I have a great deal of money from gentlemen.

I can prove that I had had the clothes a month before; I have had money in the stocks several times. The stock-broker could not spell my name right.

            . I am watchman of St. Sepulchre. On the 3d of September I had been calling the hour of one, when a chariot came to the Bull's Head, public-house, with two gentlemen; the coachman let them out, and charged them 6 s. 6 d. or 8 s. 6 d. for driving them from Fetter-lane, and waiting for them. The gentlemen said if he did not like to take 18 d. he might go and be b - g - d. He said he would take them to the Compter, and they said they would go. He opened the coach-door for them, but they refused to go in. Another coach drove up with Browning and others. The coachman called for an officer; Browning ran up, took hold of the man with his left arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am an officer, I take him in charge." He took him to Long-lane, and then shoved him adrift. The coachman said he gave me charge of him; I followed the man up Duke-street, and there laid hold of him. Browning tried to stop me from taking him; I sprang my rattle, assistance came, and I took him to the watch-house. Browning followed us to the watch-house with a man named O'Connor. I told the coachman to state his charge, which he did - he was rather in liquor. The gentleman, whom the coachman gave in charge, pulled out a handful of notes, and gave the constable of the night a 1 l. note to pay the fare. I desired the constable of the night to take Browning in charge for acting as an officer. Browning was in liquor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear Browning was in liquor - A. I do, and after a long time the man wanted to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270036"/>give charge of him for threatening him, and pushing him about - they were turned out of the watch-house. I went to Smithfield-bars to take the number of the chariot. I said I should report the constable of the night to somebody else, for not taking charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner - A. No, but when I sprang my rattle there was a crowd. I do not know how far Browning went.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to find you out - A. I happened to be at Guildhall at the time of the examination.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you lodged with him - A. At different times, for several years. I reside there when I am in the country, but I am frequently in London.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business in London - A. My own pleasure. I sometimes stay longer and sometimes shorter.</p>

               <p>Q, Where do you live in London - A. At the British coffee-house, Castle-court, Strand. I have known the prisoner two years. She lived in Compton-street when I first knew her, but lately in Pitt's-place; I visited her there, and have been in her company when I have had serious sums of money, and never lost any. On the night of the 2d of September, or rather on the morning of the 3d, between two and three o'clock, I was in her company in the neighbourhood of Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you join her - A. I met her in Fleet-market, between two and three o'clock - we walked up Cow-lane, to Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave her - A. In fact I did not leave her. I did not go into the public-house with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave her - A. At the top of Cow-lane; in fact, she left me, for a dirty sort of a woman came up to her, and I declined going into the public-house with her. I should know the woman again.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had seen her living in the same house with her - A. No.</p>
               <p>(Eagleton was ordered to stand up.)</p>
               <p>Q Is that the woman you mean - A. Yes; but she was much dirtier than she is now, and was very tipsy - very drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remonstrate with the prisoner for joining company with her - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go - A. I waited outside the house; she come out to me, and I walked up Holborn with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she was not in company with any one - A. Not except myself and the woman. I walked away with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you was the person who went into the wine vaults with her - A. No; the woman joined us in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you wandering about all night with her - A. Yes; I did not see Mr. Browing or Warburton (looks at them) - I did not see them.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did the woman remain in the public-house before she joined you again - A. Not more than ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, excepting the time she was in the public-house, you was always in her company - A. I was always in her company until near seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she could not have been with Browning or Warburton - A. Not without my seeing them - I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to swear that this woman was not in company with Browning or Warburton, after she came out of the public-house - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Here are three witnesses who have positively sworn it, and I put you on your guard; where did you go with her all this time - A. Walked in different parts of the street.</p>

               <p>Q. From three till seven o'clock - A. Yes, we did not go into any house.</p>
               <p>Q, What time did the drunken woman join you again - A. I should think between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any notes with her - A. She asked me for some money, when I first saw her going up Cow-lane. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you about you at that time - A. Probably 10 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not tell me probably, do you mean to say you had 10 l. - A. Yes; it was in country and Bank notes. That day I had received three Cambridge 1 l. bank notes from

               <p>Q. What did you give the prisoner - A. She asked me for some money, and I gave her a 1 l. Cambridge Bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. And only one - A. Only one; she then told me she owed a small sum, and that was not sufficient; I then gave her a 1 l. Bank of England note. She said she had no money then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left her at six o'clock in the morning, as far as you learnt from her, she had only these two notes which you gave her - A. She had not.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of you afterwards; have you been at the British Coffee-house ever since - A. Yes. I have retired from business; I was a grocer at Nottingham. I did not set up in trade - I was an apprentice. I had a fortune left me by my uncle, whose name was Williams. I have lived on that fortune ever since. I am twenty-six years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the banker's in Lothbury - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Bank with the prisoner, and purchase stock - A. I did not; she did not shew me the stock receipt. I have not been to see her since the 3d of September.</p>

I first saw him one day at the latter end of August, he brought a bottle, and asked for half a pint of rum - I drew it; he said he must have change for a 1 l. note, or he could not pay me. He gave me quite a new note, as if it had just come from the Bank. I gave him 18 s. 6 d. and 4 d. in halfpence. He took the silver and rum, and went away as quick as possible, leaving the 4 d. on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask who he was - A. Yes, before I changed the note I asked his name and residence? he said his name was Johnson, and he lived at No. 12, Pitt-street, which is by Charlotte-street, about 200 yards from my house. He said,</p>
               <p>"Pitt-street, close by" - I wrote it on the front of the note, in his presence. This is the note - (looking at it). - His going away in that manner, and leaving the 4 d. behind, gave me a suspicion that the note was a bad one, and I wrote the name and address again on the back of it, to be sure of it. It was paid away, and afterwards returned to me from the Bank, stamped forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again - A. On the 30th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, he came again, and called for half a pint of rum, he had a bottle. I began to draw it, and he observed to me that he could not pay for it unless I gave him change for a 1 l. note, I told him I could not, and on looking at him, I recognized him to be the man who brought me the first note I just spoke of - it had been returned then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you then do - A. I put my hand in my pocket, pulled out some silver, and said I could give him change. I asked him for the note, he produced and gave it to me - I looked at it, and saw it was one of the same sort he gave me before - it was quite new. I asked him his name and address? he told me it was Jones, No. 4, Charlotte-court; I gave him a pen and ink, laid the note on my book, and asked him to write his name and address on it, he did so, this is it - (looking at it) - it has</p>
               <p>"R. Jones, 4, Charlotte-court;" he wrote it. There is such a place about a hundred yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. This note looks newer than the other - A. They were both alike with regard to newness when I took them. The first went into circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. On his writing his name and address what happened - A. I told him it was a forged note - he said I need not take it without I liked. I sent my brother-in-law,

            , to inquire if there was such a person at No. 4, Charlotte-court; the prisoner said he would go with him, and shew him the house; I said</p>
               <p>"No, I shall detain you until my brother-in-law returns." My brother went, came back, and said in his presence, there was no such person. It was dark; I had lit the gas. I sent my brother for a watchman, the watch was not on. I sent him for a constable, he could not find one; we then agreed to take him ourselves to the watch-house. I went out first, the prisoner followed; I laid hold of his left arm, some others followed behind. He had not got many paces before he threw his arm up, got away, and ran away. I followed, calling Stop thief! the others followed; he ran as far as Newman-street, and ran into the arms of the watchman, who stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bottle - A. I heard it break.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. More than a month elapsed between his first and second coming - A. It might be a little more than a month. I do not do a great deal of business; I see many persons. I observed his countenance the first time. I gave the note to my wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270038"/>Q. I suppose people often go into a public-house and leave their change - A. Mistakes may occur.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came on the 30th of September did you not ask him to write on the note the person's name whom he took it of - A. No such thing; I asked him to write his own name and address.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no part of the name of Stubbs wrote on it - A. There is an S. which is scratched out. It appears as if he began to write Charlotte with an S.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. - Never having been in so awful a situation before, I am incapable of making such a defence as the nature of my case requires. I request you will hear the following statement of the fact: - On this evening I admit being at the prosecutor's and tendering the note, but as to the guilty knowledge of its being forged, I solemnly deny. I took it in the regular way of business of a person who gave me his address -</p>
               <p>"R. Jones, No. 4, Charlotte-court;" for making a coat. This, I trust, will account for my calling at the prosecutor's house, so far from home, as I knew they might send for Jones if the note was not genuine. I had met the man in Holborn on the Friday before I went to Smith's, and appointed to meet him this night, at his lodgings. I did not intend to defraud Smith, although I am arraigned on this scandalous charge. Looking at the back of the note, and preceding the C you will find S. I had began to write my own name, but it occurred to me that the person had not endorsed it, but he told me to put that name on it. The hasty conduct of the landlord prevented my putting my own name on it, for when he took it from me, he held it before the candle, and asked me to write on it. I asked if I was to write my own name, or the person's whom I took it of; he gave me a pen, and I wrote the name of the person I had it of, and intended also to write my own. I asked him for some ink, but he took the note and pen up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Jones! this note is bad!" I said,</p>
               <p>"Then do not take it." He sent to see if the address was correct; I told him it was the person I took it of, and that I would go and see if the man was there, he detained me. The man returned, and said there was no such person. While the man was gone for the watchman and constable, the prosecutor told me he had taken two notes of me before, had passed them, and that one was come back. I must leave it to the Jury to say if they think me a man who supports himself in this way. I am wrongfully brought here. The prosecutor says he refused the second note, why did he not detain me then? He gave a statement on a piece of paper, and the attorney, or somebody, has corrected him when they thought him wrong - I hope you will conclude that his statement is groundless. He has said nothing about the middle note here, but it will be found in his deposition. As to my attempting to escape, I must appeal to you, who are husband and fathers as well as me, when a man is charged with what he is certain is false, would you not attempt to escape? I would sooner lose 10 l. than lay in prison one night. I have a wife and four children, and endeavoured to live honestly. I am a tailor, and work being slack, I tried to get jobs for myself. I made no false pretences with the note, nor did I intend to defraud the prosecutor. I know nothing of the first note, and was never in his house before. To see a man's life sworn away is shocking. He never asked me to write my own name, but I intended so to do.</p>

On Tuesday, the 12th of October, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270039"/>came to my master's shop between two and three o'clock, and said he wanted some calico to repair a shirt or shirts; he shewed me the shirt he had on. I found a piece which measured two yards. He said he would not mind taking a remnant if I put it low - I agreed for 1 s. 9 d. He took out a 1 l. Bank note, I examined it, and thought it looked like a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing written on it - A. I saw W. B. on the back in large letters, and I thought the signature of Draper to the note was more scrawling than he in general writes. Mr. Senier and Mr. Denbigh were at dinner; I knocked at the wainscot, Mr. Denbigh came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he came down had you said any thing to the prisoner - A. I asked his name? he gave me a short name of one syllable, which began with a B - it sounded to me like Blain.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not M'Dermot - A. Quite sure. Mr. Denbigh came down; I told him, in the hearing of the prisoner, that he had given me the note. I presented the note to Mr. Denbigh, and said I believed it to be bad - Mr. Denbigh also said he thought it to be bad; he took it up to Mr. Senier. I was left below with the prisoner. While Mr. Denbigh was gone, I asked him where he had taken it? he said, at No. 47, Harley-street, that Lady Page Turner owed him 1 l., and he had received it of her servant an hour before. Mr. Denbigh and Mr. Senier came down - Mr. Senier had the note in his hand, said he thought it bad, and asked him if he knew where he had taken it? he said he had taken it at No. 47, Harley-street, at Lady Page Turner's. Mr. Senier said,</p>
               <p>"If you have taken it of Lady Page Turner, of course you will get another for it if it is bad." Mr. Senier asked him his name? he gave it as before, in a mumbling manner, but it was the same sound, though he did not speak so distinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Senier told him Lady Page Turner would give him another, what then - A. Mr. Senier said,</p>
               <p>"My young man (meaning me) had better go with you, to see if you have taken it there." He said</p>
               <p>"Very well." Mr. Senier gave me the note, and I put it into my waistcoat pocket - I had no other. He and I went to 47, Harley-street. When we got to Harley-street he asked me for the note - he had asked me for it several times before he came to the door - he said it was his, and he would have it; I refused to give it up - we were then at 49, within two doors of 47. He stopped, and asked me if I was going to give it up? I told him if it was a good one he should have it. I then laid hold of his arm, and walked up to the door of 47 - he himself rang the bell. The man-servant came to the door, I asked him if Lady Page Turner lived there? he said No. I then told him the circumstance in the prisoner's hearing - the prisoner never asked for any one there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the servant say - A. The servant said that he had not been there, and he knew nothing of him. I then turned to him, and asked him how he could tell such falsities? He then said he did not tell me he had taken it No. 47, Harley-street. I said that could not be denied, because he had said it in the presence of Mr. Senier, Mr. Denbigh, and myself. We left - he then kept demanding the note until we came to Cavendish-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his saying any thing about a letter - A. When I asked him how he could tell such falsities, he said he had not told me he took it there, but that he had received it in a letter from Lady Page Turner, and that it said,</p>
               <p>"47, Harley-street." When he got to Cavendish-square, he said he would not go back with me, for he owed Mr. Senier nothing, that he had done him no injury, and there was no occasion for him to return. Instead of going on the pavement he went out towards the rails, I went with him towards Oxford-street, he then stopped, and said he would go no further, and that he would have the note. He then collared me - I told him from his conduct I believed he knew the note to be forged when he offered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any answer - A. He said he would be d - d if he would not make me give it up. I laid hold of him by the arm, and said I would neither let him nor the note go. When he collared me I was afraid he was going to strike me, and called for help - no person was passing. He seemed frightened, walked a few paces towards Mortimer-street, and before we got out of the square he stopped again, and swore he would go no further. I then interrupted a gentleman who was passing, told him the circumstance, and shewed him the note; he said he thought it a bad one. I told him to mind that the prisoner did not snatch it. The gentleman said he must return with me. Several persons came round - the gentleman returned me the note - it was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You got home at last - A. Yes. I gave the note to Mr. Denbigh, and told him in the prisoner's presence what had passed. I called Mr. Senier down, he proposed that the prisoner should go with me and Mr. Denbigh to the Bank - the prisoner said he was obliged to be home by appointment by four o'clock, and could not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where his home was - A. He said somewhere about Grosvenor-square - he had told me on the road that he lived in Grosvenor-street. Mr. Senier proposed his going to Marlborough-street. The prisoner had before said that he was a respectable man, and well known in that neighbourhood - Mr. Senier said if it was so it would not detain him long at Marlborough-street. He then seemed much disturbed, and said he would satisfy Mr. Senier in any way if he would set him at liberty. Mr. Senier went to Marlborough-street and got Plank.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Harley-street what did you learn about Lady Page Turner, in the prisoner's hearing - A. The man said she had not lived there for two years, but I understood that she had formerly lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark the note - A. When the officer came he asked me if I had marked it? I said No, but I knew it by W. B. being on it. I then marked it - (looks at one) - this it. When the officer came, he said he had taken it of a man named Paterson, over Westminster Bridge. The officer asked him if he knew the name of the street? he said No, he should know the house if he saw it.</p>

I took it up to Mr. Senier, who was at dinner; he came down with me, having the note in his hand. He asked the prisoner where he had taken it? he said he took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270040"/>it at No. 47, Harley-street, of Lady Page Turner, that day - he said he took it of her servant. Mr. Senier said if he took it there, and it was bad, she would give him another, and proposed Bullock's going to 47, Harley-street, to inquire. They went together - the note was given to Bullock. As soon as they returned, Bullock related to me that Lady Page Turner had not lived there for two years, and that the prisoner had demanded the note to be given up to him - that the prisoner had collared him in Cavendish-square, and insisted on its being given up - that he wanted to get from him, and Bullock laid hold of him, calling out for help; the prisoner then seemed afraid, came on a few paces, then stopped and would go no further; that a gentleman who was passing by came to assist him; he shewed the gentleman the note, who said it was bad, that several persons came round, and they brought the prisoner back.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had stated this had you any conversation with the prisoner - A. Mr. Senier then proposed his going to the Bank with me; he said he had an engagement at four o'clock, and should not he back in time. It was then proposed to go to Marlborough-street. Mr. Senier then fetched an officer unknown to him. Bullock gave the note up to me. I took it and put it in my pocket; in a short time I took it out, got a pen and ink, and asked the prisoner his name he said, as there had been so much to do about it he should not tell me. Plank came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner tell him where he took the note - A. Plank asked him where he had taken it? He said he took it of Paterson, over Westminster Bridge. Plank made a memorandum of it. This is the note (looks at one).</p>

Denbigh had shewn me the note up stairs, and given it to me. I came down, and gave the same note to Bullock, told the prisoner I suspected it to be forged, and inquired where he took it. I believe he said,</p>
               <p>"I took it of Lady Page Turner." I took very little notice, not expecting to be called here. He said he took it in Harley-street; I proposed that Bullock should go there to ascertain if he took it there. They went, and returned. Bullock related what passed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pay the prisoner a 1 l. note for Lady Page Turner, your master, or yourself - A. Never. I never saw him before to my knowledge. I heard Bullock give his evidence - it is correct.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner say you was not the servant, but some other was - A. No, my Lord; I do not remember his speaking to me. We have another man servant, but he was out on that day. I said I had not paid him the note - he made no answer.</p>

I asked him where he lived, he said, at No. 4, Reeve's-mews, Grosvenor-square.

I asked him his address? he said,</p>
               <p>"Harrison, Cockspur-street." I asked him what number? and he said No. 5. I thought the note did not look like a good one, and took it to my husband, who was at dinner in the back room; he gave his opinion on it, and then took it to a neighbour - I had written the name and address on it before I gave it to him; I am sure he said No. 5, Cockspur-street. I told him I had sent out for change, but he said he was rather in a hurry, and wanted to go to Portland-place, and that he would call for the change as he returned. I refused to let him take the handkerchief, as I said I thought it might not be good; he left the handkerchief and went away, but was brought back by my husband and Mr. Savage, in about ten minutes - he offered to give me another note, but I refused to take it. Savage told him it was a bad note. Then he said I had taken the wrong address, for it was No. 1, Cannon-street - I do not recollect that he said where Cannon-street was. I told him that I understood him No. 5, Cockspur-street - he denied telling me so.</p>

On the 9th of October she gave me the note, and I took it to a neighbour to see if it was good; the prisoner was in the shop when I went out - I did not hear the conversation between him and my wife; when I returned he was gone. I went after him with Savage, whom I had taken the note to. I overtook him in Norton-street, shewed him the note, and asked him if he had paid it. Savage held it, and told him that he had put the address on it, Harrison, No. 5, Cockspur-street. He said that was wrong, for he had not given that address, but had given No. 1, Cannon-street. We said he had better go back to the shop, which he did, and insisted that he had given No. 1, Cannon-street; I believe he requested us to go there with him. I asked him if he knew any person in the neighbourhood? He said he knew a Mr. Emerson - I knew Emerson - he is a coal-merchant. I said if he would go over to the public-house, I would fetch him. I then got a constable, who went with me to the prisoner in the tap-room. Emerson came, and I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he looked at him for a moment, and then said,</p>

            . I am a baker. I accompanied Mr. Bolding to follow the prisoner, and stopped him. I shewed him the note, and said it was not a good one - he said he would give another for it. He went back with us to the shop, and then denied giving the address that was on the note. Mr. Bolding's son was in the shop, and said what his mother put on the note was true. The prisoner said he gave No. 1, Cannon-street - the boy said,</p>
               <p>"No, you did not, it was No. 5, Cockspur-street." The prisoner denied it, and insisted that he said No. 1, Cannon-street; the boy is about twelve years of age. The prisoner wanted us to go with him, but we said we could not, and it would be better to send for a constable; we sent for one, who took him. Previous to that, Bolding had sent for Emerson to the public-house. He told the prisoner his name was Payne, and said,</p>
               <p>"You rascal, you ought to be ashamed to send for me;" some altercation took place between them. He offered to satisfy us for going home with him - I refused.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I lived with General Harrison, he was in the habit of giving me old clothes; a man whom I had several times sold clothes to, was coming by a public-house near where I live, and I sold him a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons for 17 s.; he gave me a 1 l. note. As I was going to Portland-place, I went in and bought this handkerchief. I waited above half an hour for change, then took the handkerchief from my pocket, and said I would call as I returned. When I got a little distance from the house two men came up, and asked me about the note - they said it was a bad one. I said I had got another, and perhaps that was bad too; I shewed it to them - they said it was a good one, and returned it to me. I told them where I lived, and asked them to go home with me - they took me to Marlborough-street office. They have since been where I said, and found that I did live there - I am innocent. I sent for my brother-in-law, but he does not like me, and would hang me if he could - it is him that has brought me here.</p>

            . The last witness is my apprentice; he brought me the note. I thought it was bad, ran into the shop, and asked the prisoner if he had got another? He said, No; he said he took it in the way of trade. I said,</p>
               <p>"If so, I suppose you know of whom you took it." He said he should know the man if he saw him again, but he did not know where to find him - he said he sold the man some glass beads for it. I told him I suspected it was a bad one, and should detain it until he brought me good money for the things. He went away, and I went to No. 9, Ironmonger-row, which is at least a mile and a half from my house, but found that no such person lived there. I inquired at several houses in the neighbourhood, but could find no such person. I then went to No. 9 Ironmonger-street, which is just by there, but could find nobody who knew him - I had left orders at home to detain him if he should come again. On my return I found him in the shop - he said I have brought you the money for the goods. I said, Let me see, where did you say you lived? He said, I lived over at Walworth. I said, that is not the address which you gave on the note. He said, No, I work at No. 9, Ironmonger-row, and am to be found there every day. I said I believe Ironmonger-row is only a short street; he said it was. I then said, I presume there is only one No. 9? he said there was not. I said, what sort of a house - is it a shop? He said it was a private house, and he had worked there eighteen months on his own account. I said, I suppose the person you took the note of came to your manufactory to purchase the goods? He said, No, he did not. I said, I suppose you took the goods to him, and know where he lives? He said, No, I met him accidentally at a house in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who kept the house in Ironmonger-row - A. I asked him - he said, Robins. I said, I now suspect that what you have told me is all false. He said, No, it is not; I will go to Ironmonger-row with you, if you like. I said, he need not do that for I had just come from making inquiry there, and the house you describe as No. 9, and a private house, is a shoemaker's shop, and the person's name who keeps it, is Baker. He had said he worked on the first floor. I sent for an officer, and gave him in charge. I told him he had given a false address. He said his reason for giving a false address, was, that he was a glass bead maker, and was obliged to pay the Excise duties, and he could not get a living by it if he did.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 9, Ironmonger-row; I have lived there fourteen months. I never saw the prisoner before; there is no glass bead maker there. About four months ago one lived in the garret, his name was Matthews, or Matthias. My name is not over the door, nor Baker. I believe a shoemaker had it before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bead maker employ any men - A. He had a lad or two sometimes, about twelve or fourteen years of age.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Three parts of what West has said is false. I took the note between Whitechapel church and Petticoat-lane, of a Jew pedlar, and sold him twelve dozen beads for a guinea. He said he should return to the Jolly Gardeners in about three weeks, and should want more. I told West that I lived at No. 9, Ironmonger-row, but gave him no name. He took the note into another shop to ask a gentleman's opinion; the gentleman came over with West, and said he thought it was a bad one, but if I brought the money I should have the note. I returned with the money, and waited until the boy fetched West. I said I must acknowledge giving a false address, for I was a poor man, and under the Excise laws. I said I lived at Dailey's, No. 5, Prior's-place, East-lane, Walworth.</p>

We went to the Blue Lion, Gray's Inn-lane, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I placed myself in the house, and Coates went up Guildford-street. I saw the prisoner come down Guildford-street, and go into the field near Bagnigge Wells, when he got near the middle of the field I callared him, and told him I wanted him; and seeing he had a brown paper parcel in his right hand, I told Coates to lay hold of it - he immediately threw it away. I kept hold of him - Coates also collared him, and we led him to the parcel, and picked it up; he exclaimed</p>

On the 1st October, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, I was attending there; she asked to look at some gold seals - she stood at the counter, and had a white handkerchief in her hand. I shewed her a great number of seals in a tray, she examined many of them, and said they were too high a price - they were from a guinea and a half to three guineas; there was a great number at all prices - I believe the lowest she asked the price of was a guinea and a half. She said she was sorry for having given me so much trouble, and declined purchasing - she was going away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect her - A. From the manner in which she pulled the seals about I suspected she had one in her handkerchief, which was still in her hand. I went between her and the door, shut the door, opened her hand, and discovered three gold seals in her handkerchief, which were my husband's property. Before I opened her hand she asked me why I stopped her? I said, because she had got my property. I opened her hand, and found them; she then begged of me to let her go; I refused, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Your counter is made with a glass upon it, so as to leave but a small place to put goods on - A. It is. I rather think her handkerchief was on the counter, but I cannot say. I shewed her a good many seals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the seal hang from the handkerchief - A. I saw a small part of it out of the handkerchief.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was called upon to take the prisoner into custody at Mr. Davis's shop. Mrs. Davis said, in her hearing, that she had stolen three fine gold seals, and that she had taken them out of her handkerchief. I took her into custody, searched her, and found half a crown and 1 s. on her, in a chain purse. Mrs. Davis gave me the seals, which I produce.</p>
               <p>MRS. DAVIS re-examined. These are them; they are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270044"/>worth five or six guineas. Nobody was in the shop but myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent. I do not know how the seals came into my handkerchief - I cannot account for it. I merely went in to ask the price, not intending to buy, as I had not sufficient money.</p>

Meeke was my <rs id="t18191027-67-viclabel366" type="occupation">coachman</rs>. In September last my family were at Peckham - only myself and two maid-servants were left in town. I generally went to Peckham every evening, and the coachman went with me. My iron safe is under the kitchen-stairs; I keep my plate there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you information that your house was to be attacked - A. Yes. On the 28th of September I was informed of it by Sellers, applied to the Lord Mayor, and had officers put in the house. I left town about seven o'clock, Meeke drove me. The house was not attacked that night. The officers came again next day, and Meeke drove me to Peckham about seven o'clock that evening also.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. On the morning of the 28th of Sellers mentioned it to you - A. Yes, about twelve o'clock. Meeke drove me out of town that evening - he was not employed that day until then - he drove me to town about ten o'clock next morning. I believe he then drove the carriage to Islington to fetch my daughters; they came about one o'clock, and he drove me to Peckham about seven.</p>

            . I have been a gentleman's servant; my last master was Major 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person755">Overshall</persName>
             - we used to travel; this was five or six months ago. Since that I have lived in Pancras-road.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first left your master where did you live - A. At Loughton, with a farmer, who is an acquaintance of mine. I then returned to the New-road, St. Pancras, and lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you become acquainted with the prisoners - A. About three or four months ago. I first met Meeke and Turnley at the Lion in the Wood, public-house, near Mr. Fox's; they were drinking with a man named Moore *, whom I knew before. Moore and I began drinking together. Turnley and Meeke were in the same parlour. Moore asked me, in their presence, if I would be in a good thing? I said I must know what it was. He said Meeke, Mr. Fox's coachman, had agreed with Turnley to rob his master's premises; then Meeke said he had taken Turnley into the premises, to look at the iron chest that stood under the stairs, to take the dimensions of the key-hole, to see if he could open it without a key, and if not, to make one to it. Moore said Turnley was a smith. They appointed for Meeke to take the key of Turnley which he was to make, at ten o'clock in the morning, after he returned from Peckham, to see if it would fit, and return it to Turnley in the afternoon. Meeke told me he expected there were 600 l. or 700 l. in value in the chest, and that he had given them directions where to find the plate and wearing apparel, and other valuable things, after they had been to the chest.</p>

               <p>* See No. 1442.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the key - A. Yes, when we met at different places - it was a flat iron key, and was waxed over at different times, when it was given to the coachman to make a mark of the wards. Meeke told Turnley at one time that he thought the key would nearly fit, and he wished to take Turnley in to try it himself. After that Turnley was out of the way, which prevented it. I did not see either of the prisoners again until the 27th of September, I then met Meeke by chance in Bridge-street, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning; he said he heard Turnley was at liberty, and asked me to meet him at the King's Head, in Thames-street, at twelve o'clock that day, and Turnley also, if I should see him. I met him by himself; he said he had heard from Meeke, and was to meet him at the Crown and Sugar-loaf, in Fleet-street, at four o'clock. He said the family were coming home in a few days, and the job must be done if I meant to be in it - I said I would consider further about it, and meet them at four o'clock. I went at four to the Crown and Sugar-loaf, and saw Turnley and Meeke there. Meeke said he had lost his friend Moore, and there must be another one, and a good one. Turnley said he had got another, named 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person756">
                  Charles

            , who was a good one, and he was at the door. Meeke said somebody should keep the servant-girls quiet - Turnley said they should be muzzled. Meeke said they must be muzzled, or murdered, rather<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270045"/>than allow them to give the alarm, and he would find out whether they both slept together. They appointed to meet again at the same house on Tuesday, at three or four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Crowder that day - A. I saw him and Turnley walking together; he was not called in. I went and informed Sellers that it was fixed to be the next night - they were to fix the hour when they met again. I met them about four o'clock next day in the tap room - it was on the 28th.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the conversation managed - A. A good deal of conversation took place in the yard, and we walked in the street, as other people came into the room. I first saw them at the Crown and Sugar-loaf; Crowder and Turnley came first, and Meeke after them. They wanted me to go into the premises with the coachman, and to open the hatch-door at eleven o'clock that night, while they went to fetch their things. I refused, until I had made myself better acquainted whether I should be safe or not. I did not see them again till the Wednesday, which was the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, did you make yourself acquainted whether you should be safe - A. Yes, I applied to Sellers. I saw them again on the Wednesday, at the Cross Keys, near Blackfriars Bridge. Turnley and Meeke were in the house, Crowder stood outside. Only a few words passed then; they came into the street, and wanted to know if I would go inside and undo the hatch-door, and if not somebody else would. I agreed to it, and we all four walked to the Glazier's Arms, in Water-lane - we went together, but as Crowder arranged the business with Turnley, he kept a little behind. We drank a pot of porter, and I agreed to go to the stable with the coachman, it was then five o'clock - we parted. Turnley and Crowder went off, and told me they should go for their tools. I and the coachman went to Mr. Fox's stables; the back of the premises open into a small street. Meeke told me to lay down in the hay-stall, I did so, and he shook the hay over me with a fork, and begged me not to disappoint in letting Turnley and Crowder in. He said I should hear the carriage go out in the course of a few minutes, and then I should hear the servant girl fasten the back gate after him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the back gate between the stable and the house - A. The gate was outside; it completely shut me in. I think it was about a quarter or twenty minutes after five o'clock when I heard the carriage go out - the servant girls were to fasten the gate. One of them wished the coachman good night and pleasant dreams, and in coming through the stable one of them said,</p>
               <p>"The hay seems to lay high here, as if some one might be under" - they passed on, and took no further notice. I laid there till I heard the watchman call eleven, and then heard a knock against the hatch-door - I got up and opened it - the key was in. Turnley and Crowder came in, and went up to the loft. I heard a door unbolt, which let them down by steps into the yard. I heard Turnley go down the yard and undo the stable-door, which goes from the stable into the yard - this was the door the girls had fastened. Crowder then went out of the stable into the yard to Turnley - it is only about three steps from the stable. I stood outside the door, and saw them lift up the kitchen window - they found the shutter bolted, which Meeke had told them was very seldom bolted. Crowder took the steps from the loft, and set them against the back parlour window, Turnley went up the steps, and lifted up the window; it appeared to lift very easy. He got his head and shoulders in, felt round with his hand, put his head out again, and asked for the darkey, which meant the dark-lanthorn; Crowder handed it to him, and he put the lanthorn in. His head was in, but not so far as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blind to the window - A. I saw none. He perceived somebody, as he called out</p>
               <p>"Oh!" and sprang from the steps - he and Crowder both ran off together; I also left the premises directly. The officers knew I was in the stable, and Sellers told me they were to be in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you run away - A. I thought I had no right to stop by myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How came you to run away - A. Because they should not suspect that I gave the information. I went before the magistrate directly they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not a fortnight after - A. No. I did not know where they lived. I did not intend the house should be robbed. Moore told me their names, and I told Sellers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you live with before you went to Major 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person757">Overshall</persName>
             - A. I lived at home in a public-house for three years, in a public-house at Harwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not get into trouble at Bury St. Edmonds - A. No, I was not in prison there.</p>
               <p>Q. What address did you give the magistrate where to find you - A. No. 26, Pancras-road. I had lived there five or six months. I believe Sellers was by at the time; I do not know whether he heard it. I have been living on money saved from servitude.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever gone by any other name - A. I never denied my name. I have been called other names, but never gave myself any other. I believe I told Sellers I lived in Pancras-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you known Sellers - A. Five or six months. I first saw him at a public-house next to Marylebone watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get acquainted with him - 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person758">A. </persName>
            By drinking over a pot of porter. It was before this affair was talked of. I had no other business with him than this.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not introduced to him by a gentleman - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Fector, of Dover - A. I have seen him - he did not introduce me to Sellers I had some business with Mr. Fector, but Sellers was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Fector and Sellers together - A. Yes, at Mr. Fector's house in the Adelphi. What he was I did not know. I had seen Sellers before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person759">Moore</persName>
             an acquaintance of yours - A. I had spoken to him; we were not intimate. I had seen Meeke with Moore before they proposed the burglary. I defy any one to prove dishonesty against me. It went off while Moore was in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. In all this time did you mention it to Mr. Fox or Sellers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270046"/>- No, I considered it useless, until the time was appointed. I spoke of it three days before the 29th.</p>
               <p>Q. You met Moore by accident, and it was proposed that Crowder should be one of the party - A. Yes, that afternoon, I saw Sellers at the New Inn, in the Old Bailey, and told him what was going to happen, for him to tell Mr. Fox. I knew the officers were in the room, but did not know who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to stop either of them, but ran off yourself - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go to the magistrate, and tell their names - A. I was not asked to go. I told Sellers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever live in Johnson's-court or place - A- I do not know such a place. I might tell Sellers Johnson's-place, near Johnson-street; I told him I was going to live there about a week ago, after I had given the information, as I thought it best to move.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him so in April - A. No, for I did not live there.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you go before the Lord Mayor before you were sent for - A. No, it was in the hands of the officer. I only saw Sellers once at Mr. Fector's.</p>

            . On the 29th of September I lived servant with Mr. Fox On the morning of that day, I saw Meeke in the kitchen; after putting his horses up he came and sat in a chair as usual, and said he did not know what was the matter with him, but he had got a pain in his side; he went into the yard, and said nothing more to me, but came in and out frequently. In the afternoon I went up to my master's bed room - he came up; he had nothing to do there, and never came there before. I went into the next room, which is the childrens' bed room; he came in and asked me if my fellow-servant and I slept together there? - When he slept in town he slept in the room over it. I told him we were going to sleep together that night. He asked me if we were going to sleep up stairs? I said Yes - that was the room adjoining his. He went up stairs, and I saw him come down stairs with a bed winch in his hand - he took it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. I was sitting at tea about five o'clock - he was at dinner at the same table. He said I seemed sleepy, and had not slept well that night - I said I had not slept very well, and my fellow-servant said she had not, for she had had the headach. He said that was because we sat up so late, and as we had not slept well we had better go to bed at ten o'clock; he went to get his horses ready about six o'clock - the carriage went away about half-past six o'clock. My fellow-servant and I went to lock the gate, she wished him a good night, and pleasant dreams. I staid by the stable-door, while she fastened the coach-house-door - we go through the stable to the house; some hay laid in the stable. I said to my fellow-servant,</p>
               <p>"Suppose he should be here" - it seemed as if some person was lying underneath; I had heard that the house was to be robbed. I fastened the door between the stable and the house, then went into the workshop to see if anybody was there, but found nobody; I went into the house, and fastened the kitchen-door; my fellow-servant fastened the kitchen-window; I saw next morning that it was fast, which is not usual. We both went to bed about half-past ten o'clock - the officers came before that. I heard a noise about ten o'clock when we were at supper. It came from the back-kitchen, and was like a window opening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived there - A. Nine months; I once saw Moore with Meeke at the back of the house, about a fortnight or three weeks before Moore was taken up - Meeke told me Moore was taken up.</p>

I and Fraser locked the yard gate; I wished Meeke a good night and pleasant dreams. As we returned through the stable, Clara said the hay was very high, and looked as if some one was underneath - I kicked it, and it seemed as if some one was underneath; we fastened the gate between the stable and the house. I went into the kitchen, let my master out, and fastened the house up; I fastened the kitchen shutters, which are not generally fastened - the officers came about nine o'clock; we went to bed just before eleven.

            . I am a City officer. On the 28th of September, by direction of Mr. Wontner, I attended with Drinkwater and Forrester at Mr. Fox's house; we watched there, but nobody came that night. On the 29th, about nine o'clock at night, we three went again, with Brown, and placed ourselves in the back-parlour. About half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve o'clock, we heard a noise as if some one was in the house, and saw a man come down the back steps, leading from the loft into the yard adjoining the house, then heard a noise like a window being let down - the kitchen window was let down and pulled up again; we then heard something go like a bolt. A very little time after that, the window of the room we were in was raised up, and the person who was at the window raised the Venetian blind up - it was a man. Nearly all his body was then put in; he leaned on the table under the window, and looked round the room - we had no light; it was not a dark night - I could see his form; he had a dark coat on, gilt buttons, and light breeches. I lost him for a moment as he drew back, but he returned in a moment with a dark lanthorn. He came up the ladder again, put the light into the room, and the moment he drew his hand back, Brown cut at him with a cutlass; he cried out,</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord!" and dropped from the ladder. I ran out at the front door to go round and secure them, but they had escaped - the doors were all open behind. I apprehended Meeke next morning in the stable, took him to his master, and then before the Lord Mayor. After he had been examined the second time, he said if the Lord Mayor would let him have an hour's conversation with me, he would tell me more than ever I knew. I said I did not wish to hear any thing he had to say - he said he particularly wished it. I said if he made any disclosure to me, it should be before a witness, for I would not hear it without - he agreed to that. I took him to Drinkwater, and we went into a private room in a public-house at the corner of Huggin-lane - we neither threatened or promised<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270047"/>him. He said he had had dealings with a man, named Moore, who asked him if he did not want money? He said he did, and Moore said it might easily be had, for it would be a good thing to rob his master's house, that he should be in it, and whack along with the others - he said he agreed for it to be done. He then burst into tears, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh good God? what a dilemma I have placed myself in - I will tell you no more." We took him to the Compter, and as we went up stairs to the lockup-room, he said if I would go in, he would tell me the whole particulars. I went into his room - his wife was there crying, and he burst out crying. I left him, returned and said,</p>
               <p>"If you have any thing to say, say it." He leaned over the bed, and said,</p>
               <p>"I'll be d - d if I split, I'll be hung first."</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the man better when he brought the lanthorn - A. No, not so well - it was a man exactly like Turnley, but I should not like to swear to him. I saw him the morning he was apprehended, when he was dressed apparently as the man was at the window. We found the loft ladder placed under the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When were Crowder and Turnley taken - A. I think about the 6th of October - I did not wish to get information from him. I asked the Lord Mayor if it was right to hear what he said? The Lord Mayor said if he wished to disclose his mind, I might hear it, but he did not like to hear any thing from him.</p>

            . I attended at the prosecutor's house with my brother officers, on the 28th of September - we went the following night about nine o'clock. About a quarter before twelve o'clock we heard the back kitchen window go up, and then down. I heard voices of more than one person, but could not hear what they said. Then a man pushed up the window where we sat - most all his body came into the room; he appeared to be dressed in a blue coat, yellow buttons, a dark waistcoat, and light breeches; he was a tall slim man - he leaned across the table, withdrew himself, went back, and produced a lanthorn; he held it in the room, looked round, and withdrew himself directly. Brown made a cut at him - he made some exclamation, and disappeared in a moment. My brother officers ran round, and found he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he got up - A. By a ladder from the stable. When Turnley was apprehended he was dressed like the man. Crowder was taken the same night. I was present with Meeke and Dyer, at a public-house at the corner of Huggin-lane. He said he had some dealings with Moore, and that he was a smuggler. This man asked him if he did not want money? and said he knew of a good thing, and that was to rob his master, and he should be in it, and have his whack of it. He then burst out crying, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have I done! I'll say no more."</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 6th of October I apprehended Crowder at the Rose and Crown public-house, in Goswell-street, and apprehended Turnley at his lodgings in Clerkenwell. I found a skeleton key in his coat-pocket, and on the mantle-shelf I found a key with wax on it.</p>
               <p>MR. FOX re-examined. The key does not correspond with my iron chest at all - the hole would not go on the pipe.</p>

               <p>The prisoners all declared their innocence.</p>

On the 10th of October I left my ship, which laid at Millwall, went ashore, and went up Ratcliff-highway, about seven o'clock in the evening, to pay some money to a man. I went into a public-house with him and my shipmate, and staid there about three-quarters of an hour; I was not in liquor. I could not drink any thing as I had got the toothache. I went out, and sat on a step opposite the house, holding my face; a woman came up, who asked me if I was ill, and if she could help me? I said it was no business of her's, and she went away - it was then near ten o'clock; we were close to a gas lamp. I looked at her, she came back again to me, and said my shipmate wanted me - I had left him in the house. I stood up, and supposing I might have missed him, I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is he?" She said,</p>
               <p>"Come along," and laid hold of my right arm; we walked a little way. I said,</p>
               <p>"I don't see him, I dare say he is in the house." She said,</p>
               <p>"Come along, and you will soon see him." We did not walk much farther before she laid hold of my watch-chain, pulled my watch out, and ran away with it as fast as she could. I sung out,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief! she has robbed me of my watch." I had hardly sung out, before I received a severe blow on the left side of my head, from a stick behind me. I twisted round, and received another on my shoulder, which broke my collar-bone - I have been in the hospital ever since. I fell down, rose again, and received another blow on the left side of my ribs; I fell again, and could not sing out or draw my breath. Two or three men came up, pulled my pocket-book out of my waistcoat-pocket, took all the silver I had, and dragged me round the corner of Old Gravel-lane - only the men were there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the woman who robbed you of your watch - A. Yes, my Lord, I have no doubt of it - I did know her before. There were a 5 l. and five 1 l. notes in my pocket-book, which I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear that you was not tipsy - A. I was not - she forced my watch out. It was not with my consent that she took hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PAXMAN. I am a watchman of New Gravel-lane. On Sunday evening, the 10th of October, I was turning from Elbow-lane to New Gravel-lane, and heard the cry of,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief! I have lost my watch." I went towards the cry, and found the prosecutor lying in the middle of the road. I saw two men run away, sprang my rattle, and the watchman on the next beat stopped one of the men; we took him to the top of the lane, and the prosecutor said a woman had taken his watch - the prisoner was then standing at the top of the lane. I took hold of the man, and the other watchman took her; we took both to the watch-house, but found nothing on them. There was a third person, whom we did not catch.</p>

            . I am a watchman in the neighbourhood. I heard the cry of of Stop thief! and saw the man, Strickbury, close at my elbows. He saw my lanthorn, and tried to pass me. I caught him, and gave him to Paxman; a boy pointed the prisoner out to me, and I took her.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH M'CARTHY. I am near thirteen years of age, and live in King-street, Gravel-lane. On Sunday night, about ten o'clock, I was sitting at my mother's door, heard this man cry Stop thief! and saw the prisoner pass the door; she stopped on the other side of the way. I saw her give a watch into a man's hand. and heard her say,</p>
               <p>"Don't cry, dont say any thing;" the man went down the lane, and she remained there - this was after the watchman had sprung his rattle. I saw Stevens, and told him what I had seen; he took her to the watch-house. I am sure she is the woman who gave the watch to the man, for I saw her face.</p>

            . I saw the prosecutor sitting on the step of a door, and saw the prisoner speak to him - I am certain it was her; I took particular notice of her - I thought she was his wife. I saw him after he had been robbed, and the side of his head was bloody. I saw her take hold of his arm, and persuade him to go with her; the streets are lit with gas. I am sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the prosecutor drunk - A. He was leaning on his hand. I at first thought he was drunk, but afterwards found he had the toothache.</p>

I was returning from the Fox and Grapes, public-house, saw the prosecutor sitting on a step, very sick, and the watchman told him to go on, but I persuaded him to take a coach. Several men came up, and said if I did not go away they would knock my brains out.</p>

            , banker, of Dover - he has no partner. I am the filling-up clerk, and the only one. We make our notes payable to Pembroke, and draw on Messrs. Smith, Payne and Smith - we number the notes. That uttered to Anderson is forged in every respect; it is not Mr. Fector's signature - the filling-up is not my writing. Boyton is the entering clerk, it is not his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any note of that number issued that day - A. There is such a number of that date, that is a 20 l. note, but no 10 l. of that date. The other notes are also forged in all their parts. I write the word Pembroke on the notes, it is not printed - the engraver leaves no tracing for it.</p>

I enter the particulars of every note myself; such a note as this was never issued - the other three are forged, they are not off the plate of the house. The word Pembroke is engraved in these notes, in ours it is written. In all these notes there are tracing lines for the names, which is not the case in ours.</p>

             a long time; she occasionally comes to my house on a visit. On the evening of the 27th of October I answered the prisoner's knock at the door - she informed me that she had engaged with my wife to become her servant - I let her in and questioned her. She said my wife had had a very good character with her. I said, as my wife was not in the way, it would be necessary that I should have some character of her; she said I should have one in the morning. I shewed her the kitchen, and told her she might remain that night, and if her character suited she might remain as our servant. In the course of half an hour I requested her to attend to the fire on the second floor, and sent my brother William to No. 17, Queen-street, Soho-square, to

On the evening of the 27th of October his brother came for me, I got there about nine o'clock; I went into his shop, sat there about five minutes, and then went to the second floor by his brother's desire. My gold watch was in a pair of slippers, which were in my basket. I put the basket on the left side of the fire-place, on the ground, in the second floor. As the prisoner was coming up stairs with the candles Mr. Smith called me down; she had not got into the room before he called me - I was down stairs five or six minutes with him. I met the prisoner at the foot of the stairs as I went up - I am sure she did not come into the room while I was there. Mr. Smith went up with me, and in about five minutes I missed my watch - the slippers remained. Smith told me to go home and look for it, I did so, and told him not to permit her to leave until I returned. I found I had brought it, returned, and found the prisoner in the shop. I asked her for the watch, she said she had not got it. A constable was sent for - it was found about two hours afterwards. I was in the kitchen when it was found.</p>

I set off, and when I came to the Lamb, public-house, about a quarter of a mile off, there was a disturbance and a fight; I found my horse and cart in the crowd - my great-coat was gone out of the cart; I claimed the cart. I saw the prisoner seven days afterwards at Wansted. I have not found the coat. When I found the cart, a man said the person who drove it, had driven against a gentleman's horse, and killed it.

On the 14th of September, about twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, I was on horseback in Kingsland-road, and saw the prisoner gallopping with the cart and gelding, about two hundred yards on this side the turnpike - I will not swear it was the prisoner. I called to the man to keep on the right side of the road. The cart ran against my horse, and ran the shafts into it. I laid hold of the horse, and wished to take the number of the cart, the man objected. I drew it to the light, the prisoner got out and said he would fetch the owner.

On the 16th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, two men, named Joyce and Emmett, were employed to take 500 cases of soap in the Castlereagh lighter - the prisoner had the care of the lighter while they were taking it in; he had brought up a barge of tallow to Hawes's wharf before I left. I left him in charge of the soap; they were to get it from the wharf that day if the tide would serve, but it would not. I saw the prisoner again between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, in my counting-house, in Clink-street, Bankside. I then paid him his wages, and gave him a document. I told him to take charge of the lighter, and go the next day to the West India Docks. I told him Emmett and Callaghan would assist him. I ordered the prisoner to go into the Docks, and not quit the lighter, day or night, to make the delivery good, and bring the receipt to me. Callaghan was to keep charge until Monday morning, the 18th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the 500 cases put on board the barge - A. No, I saw twenty-nine put on board - they were all brought there; each parcel was made up in boxes, and tape tied round them, and sealed with the Excise seal. Each case contained 56 lbs,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The prisoner was to conduct the lighter from where she received her cargo, till he delivered the goods - A. Yes, he took charge of her at two o'clock in the morning; till that time Mr. Hawes's watchman had the care of her. He was to deliver the cargo on board the New Felix, at the West India Docks.</p>

We got to the Docks gate between four and five o'clock in the morning, it was Sunday; we made her fast there, and about six o'clock the prisoner and Emmett went away together, and left me on board. My master had ordered me to come home at daylight on Monday morning. Foot had promised to come at twelve o'clock to take her into the Docks - he did not, and I conveyed her into the Docks, made her fast, and stopped there till Monday morning, then locked the cabin, and went home. I left nobody with her. I took the key of the hatches to Mr. Raymond's clerk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No harm could come to the soap in her passage - A. No, it was under lock and key; the prisoner had not the key, he left it with me when he went on shore. There was no soap in the cabin. I did not see them take any soap.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you go ashore on Sunday - A. Not at all. I took my provision in a basket. I did not go out of sight of the barge.</p>

I said I came from Barbadoes. He asked me to go to a public-house with him, and have a glass of beer? I went, and he called for a pot of beer. The prisoner came in, and asked him if any one was in the room? He said he had given somebody a 5 l. note, and the person had ran away with it, but he did not mind that, for he had got plenty more. He pulled out a pocket-book, and wished me to play a game with him for one guinea - I said I had no money. He asked me what I had got to sell? I told him I had got some sweetmeats to sell, and he said he would buy them. I left him in the house, went home, and fetched two jars of sweetmeats and a shell - when the prisoner first came into the house he pretended to be tipsy. I left the things on the table, and the prisoner in the house, while the other man went to shew me where he lived. I went about a dozen yards, came back again, and the prisoner was gone off with them; I did not see him again until I met him in Fleet-street; I caught hold of him, and asked him for his address? He knocked my hand from him, and another man who was with him, gave me an address, No. 13, Shire-lane, Temple-bar - I could not find him there. I afterwards saw him in custody.</p>

            . My husband keeps the public-house. On the 10th of September, a friend of the prosecutor's came into the house with him - the prisoner went into the parlour, and pretended to be in liquor. The young man asked the prosecutor if he would leave his jars with the prisoner while he went and shewed him where he lived - the prosecutor went out with him. I was coming down stairs, and saw the prisoner go out with the jars in his hand; I tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him for a paper of mine, which he had taken that morning - he seemed agitated, and said he knew nothing of it. I told him I always thought him a suspicious character, and wished he would not come to my house. In about five minutes the prosecutor returned and missed his jars; he did not know the man, but the other man had accosted him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270054"/>in the street, saying, that he knew him. I told him to leave his address, and when I saw the prisoner again I would send for him. About three weeks after, the man brought the prisoner in very much in liquor; I was at the door, and saw the prosecutor looking for him - I charged him with stealing the jars. I am sure he is the man - I saw him take them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know whose jars they were - A. No, or I should not have let him go - he was always bringing drunken men to my house, and when company were there, he would never stop.</p>

On the 19th of October, about four o'clock in the morning, I was on the top of Muswell-hill, with Izard and Brooks, leading to Finchley-common, and saw the three prisoners coming along the road. A few yards before I got up to them, I saw two of their hands move, and something go from them - Brooks and I went to the ditch. I found two small pigeons in a small bag, in the ditch, and Brooks found one pigeon - we secured the prisoners; Izard pulled a pair of pigeons out of Neeland's pocket, who said he was going to fly them home to Essex as soon as he got work; they said they were going to Winchmore-hill. The ducks were found next morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the person must be acquainted with your shop, and know the manner of speaking - A. I should suppose so. A second application was made about an hour after in the same manner; I then sent Walker down to say they should be sent directly, as they were not quite ready. I sent Brooks home with the whole of them about a quarter of an hour after. I have never recovered them.</p>

I was sent down to tell him Mr. Kidder's things were not quite done, but that they should be done and sent directly - I told him so. He said he had come from Mr. Kidder, he then went away. I was with him a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. About half-past three o'clock; I saw him in Castle-street, Leicester-fields, I was taking the things home to Mr. Kidder's. He came rather behind me, and asked if I had got those things of Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270057"/>Kidder's? I recollected him to be the person who came to the shop; I am quite sure the prisoner is that person - I have no doubt of it at all. He said he had just been again to my master's for them, and if I would give them to him he would take them. I gave them to him, and he turned up Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a contrary direction to the Strand - A. Yes; I asked him where he was going to take them to? he said,</p>
               <p>"Why, to Mr. Kidder's, but I must call first in St. Martin's-lane." I thought then that I had done wrong in parting with them, as I had never seen him at Kidder's. He had a long brown coat on, black handkerchief, and Hessian boots. I let him go, thinking he might be some one in the trade - I did not suspect he was a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see him - A. On the Sunday afternoon, at Mr. Crow's curds-and-whey house in the Park, he was in custody there. I was sent for to see if he was the person; I knew him directly, I am quite sure of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You first saw him in the passage, is that a light place - A. It is light enough to see who a person is. The pipe is in the passage. He said he had come for Mr. Kidder's things - he did not say what was to be engraved upon them. I left him instantly, and saw the same person afterwards in the street. I had the things in leather and in a paper parcel, in a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you know a tradesman of your own by the manner of his carrying the bag - A. We carry them on our shoulder, and so did he.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you give a description of his person - A. Yes, my Lord, I immediately described him at Bow-street.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Leslie. I first saw the prisoner at our house on Wednesday, the 6th of October, between two and three o'clock. I went down to answer the pipe, and found him in the passage; I asked him which order of Kidder's he wanted? he seemed confused, and did not appear to know what order we had. He asked for those things of Mr. Kidder's, and desired they might be sent down directly. I asked him what order? he said the order that was most forward was to be sent, and said,</p>
               <p>"You know." The forks were the forwardest order. He said he would tell Mr. Kidder, and if they were not sent Kidder would come himself in ten minutes for them, for Kidder was very angry that they were not sent, and that he would tell him he saw the boy out of the door coming with them. He was about two minutes with me - the things were sent directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man who spoke to you in the passage - A. I am. I saw him on the Saturday morning in the Park, and watched him into the Strand. I ran home for Brooks to identify him, leaving a young man to watch him. I found Brooks was not at home, returned, and saw him farther down, near the New Church; he stopped at Mr. Foster's, a silversmith, in the Strand, looking in at the window, and another young man with him. I thought he knew he was being watched. As soon as our eyes were off him, he ran up a court in the Strand, nearly opposite Somerset House - he was walking gently until he came to Foster's, he then ran, his companion remained. I told Jackson to watch him, while I went in pursuit of the prisoner, but could not find him. I went into the Park on the Sunday morning, a little after ten o'clock, with another young man, followed the soldiers to Knightsbridge, saw the prisoner at the barracks, and took him into custody; we lodged him at Crow's, by the Stable-yard gate. He asked what we took him for? I would not tell him. I fetched Brooks to him. I have no doubt whatever of his being the man, nor never had any.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first time he was with you was only a minute or two - A. Yes; I never saw him before. I think he saw me in the Park on Saturday.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Leslie. On Wednesday, the 6th of October, I saw the prisoner at my master's house a little after one o'clock. He rang the bell, and I opened the door to him. I am sure he is the man I saw there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the door to him the second time - A. Yes, it was him both times. I saw him in custody on the Monday; as soon as I saw him I was sure he was the man - I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You only saw him as you opened the door - A. I saw him call up the pipe - he went to the pipe of his own accord.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier, and live at Stretton-ground; I work with Mr. Cobbet, of Bedford-street, Covent-garden. I know the prisoner and his mother, we have been brought up children together. He has been an attorney's clerk in Air-street - he was never in the silversmith business.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Wednesday before he was taken up do you know any thing of him - A. Yes, I met him between twelve and one o'clock in New Tothil-street; we had a pint of beer together at the Wheatsheaf, and staid there until one, I then went within a stone's throw of Stretton-ground with him, where he lives.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where were you at work at that time - A. At the Horse Guards. I go to dinner at twelve o'clock, and return at one. I had been working there about six weeks. I generally get refreshments near to where I work.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen that on that Wednesday you should go all the way to Stretton-ground - A. I was not very well, and was persuaded to get bled.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you were bled within that hour - A. No; I went to Mr. Mount, a doctor, his shop-man persuaded me not to be bled. I dined at the public-house where we went.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever know Mount bleed any one - A. I do not know. I was persuaded to go to him. I had been to his shop to get salts before.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was you ever bled in your life - A. Never. I heard the prisoner was apprehended on the Sunday - I was not in the Strand with him on Saturday. I did not see him on the Saturday until after seven o'clock in the evening, I then saw him at his own house; I had left work at half-past five o'clock. I was with him on Sunday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270058"/>when he was taken. I saw Watkins at the milk-house. I went to the watch-house with him, and heard the charge made against him - I attended before the magistrate next day; I did not give this account there - I believe I did not go into the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When the charge was made against him at the watch-house, I suppose you told the young man you was in his company at the time, and that it could not be - A. Yes, I did. I think it was this young man, but will not be sure.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether Mount is in the practice of bleeding you do not know - A. No; I think I attended at the Justice's three times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he was in the employ of an attorney in Air-street; was he out of employ at the time - A. Yes, my Lord, he has been out of employ twelve months - that is the last place he was in.</p>

            . I go out washing and ironing, and lodge with the prisoner's mother, at No. 27, Stretton-ground, Westminster - I have lodged there seven years.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the Wednesday before the Sunday that he was taken up - A. Yes, I remember meeting him, about one o'clock, at the corner of the street where his mother lives - I believe it had not struck one; he had turned into the street, I supposed he was going home to dinner; I was also going home, but did not go the way he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards - A. I heard him, but did not see him. His mother keeps the lower parlours and the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get in before you - A. Yes. I had an errand, which kept me out ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. I heard his voice in the garden, towards the back-door. They dine about one; he generally dines with her. I was up stairs. I do not remember hearing him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How does he get his livelihood - A. He has been an attorney's clerk three or four years ago. I do not think he has done any thing since, except keeping his mother's books. I do not think I spoke when I met him. I live in the first floor - the dining-room is just below me.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard his voice, what was he talking about - A. His mother has a favourite dog; he was either scolding or coaxing it.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw him a little before one o'clock going towards the house, and about ten minutes after heard him speaking to the dog - A. Yes. His mother does a good deal of business; she generally keeps six women.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's business was to set the linen down and put the price to it - A. That is all.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the Wednesday before the Sunday that the prisoner was taken up. - A. Yes; I cooked his dinner, and he eat it at his mother's house. I cooked his dinner between twelve and one o'clock; to the best of my recollection, he came home about twenty minutes after one - he dined with his mother. He was at dinner till about two, I think, and remained at home till half-past four o'clock, to the best of my knowledge - he was never out of doors all this time. His mother and I had tea together, but whether he had tea with us or not I do not recollect. He went out at half-past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed there all day - A. From eleven o'clock. I attended three times at Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the reason you were not examined at Marlborough-street, that the prosecutor's attorney told you the magistrate would not hear his witnesses - A. I heard nothing of the kind. We were told so at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his mother fond of cats - A. She keeps none; there are several in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his making a noise at a cat, if he had, would the last witness have heard it - A. She might; I do not remember the circumstance. I do not recollect any noise being made.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not come home until twenty minutes past one o'clock - A. No, I am quite positive of that.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you positive - A. One of the women went out to work; I asked her the time, she said it was twenty minutes past one.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was impossible he could have come home at one - A. He might, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understood you to say it was twenty minutes after one o'clock when he did come - A. He might have been in another room, that was the time he came into his mother's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not positively swear you was sure that was the time he came home - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you remember his making a noise at a cat there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any noise with a cat, or any other animal, you would have heard it - A. I cannot say; I did not dine with them. I live less than a quarter of a mile off.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you get your dinner - A. I had none; it is seldom I have any. I sometimes have nothing from breakfast till tea. I left the house about ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you drink any spirits or porter at all - A. No, neither, that day. I fetched them a pot of porter that day in an earthen jug, from the Two Brewers, opposite his mother's. There were two women washing down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you neither drank beer nor spirits, nor eat any thing that day - A. I suppose I drank a glass of spirits between five and six o'clock. I had a glass between five and six.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they for dinner - A. Stewed eels. His mother does not like cooking, and so I cook for her frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any ironing going on that day - A. No, none at all; we were starching the linen, and did nothing else. I am constantly employed by the prisoner's mother in ironing and starching. I am not there every day.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure there was no noise that could be heard up stairs - A. None that I heard.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you derive your knowledge of him only from what the woman told you when she came in - A. Only from that - we have no clock.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270059"/>Q. Does the prisoner's mother keep a dog - A. She does. I do not remember the prisoner either scolding or coaxing it - if it had been so, Garnham might have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you starching - A. In his mother's apartment. I do both ironing and starching - starching is part of the preparation for ironing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was the prisoner employed - A. After dinner he was reading to himself - his mother only keeps one dog, which is a little brown one - I drank tea with her about four o'clock; I think he did not drink tea with us, but he was at home at tea-time - he sometimes takes milk instead of tea. He was reading the fourth volume of the Children of the Abbey, which I had brought him to read from my daughter, three or four days before; his mother knew I had brought it there.</p>
               <p>Q. How was his mother employed between dinner and tea - A. Washing down below with the women - I was up stairs; I am quite sure of that. I cooked the dinner in the same room where they eat it.</p>
               <p>A. And in the same room you were starching the linen - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he dine at home then - A. Please to let me recollect - (hesitaling) - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cook the dinner on Saturday - A. I did not, nor on Friday, Thursday, Tuesday, or Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to cook it on Wednesday - A. His mother was busy in helping the women at work.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there is a great deal to be done on Monday and Tuesday - A. On Monday we go into the City, and on Tuesday I have to go to Oxford-road for linen; we begin working on Monday night. The linen is not ready to be starched until Wednesday. If the weather is dull, we dry the linen in the house - Wednesday was a dull day.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of weather was Monday and Tuesday - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you recollect Wednesday was dull - A. I was ill, and wanted to take some medicine, but it being cold I put it off - and in fact I have not taken it yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home or out on Saturday - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How late did you stay at his mother's on Saturday - A. It was eleven o'clock - I cannot say whether he was at home on Saturday or not; I did not leave before eleven o'clock. I am positive I did not see Burry on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember cooking the dinner on Wednesday as you frequently did it - A. Because my mistress said she was glad I had come, as she had got eels for dinner and did not like to clean them. I had dressed eels for her before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that anybody spoke to you about the prisoner being at home on the Wednesday - A. On the Sunday he was taken, his mother sent for me, and told me that she had heard her son was in trouble - she did not then tell me what it was about.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she tell you - A. About nine o'clock at night - we went to the watch-house together; she saw her son and spoke to him. I did not hear the discourse between them, but as we were going home, she told me that her son had been impeached for getting articles - I did not hear what they were. We went to Marlborough-street on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first mentioned Wednesday to you - A. I will recollect a little - I think it was Mr. Price, the solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he first mentioned Wednesday to you - A. Whether it was Monday or Thursday I cannot tell. I heard him mention to the prisoner's mother that it was on Wednesday that this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first mention that you knew he was at home - A. On the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear that he was taken up for any thing done on Wednesday - A. On Monday - I believe his mother told me, and it being such a short time from the Wednesday to the Monday, I remembered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell his mother that you remembered it, or did she say you did - A. I do not recollect.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. He lived with Mr. Pike, in Air-street, two years - Mr. Pike is now dead; he has been out of his employ two years, since which he has assisted me - I am a laundress, and work for families in Parliament-street, Oxford-street, and the City. My son assisted me with his pen and in carrying out linen - he was taken up on Sunday; I saw him that evening at St. James's watch-house at nine o'clock. Greenfield went with me - she assisted me in ironing.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that include any thing besides merely passing the iron backward and forward - A. Merely that. She comes to me every Wednesday to iron - she irons and plaits shirts. I always starch them myself ready for her to iron.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Wednesday before the Sunday your son was apprehended, was she employed by you - A. She was, she came about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a dog - A. No, but there is one in the house, which is

            's. It is a large rough dog - brown and white.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your son out on Wednesday - A. He was out a little while in the morning; he came home about one o'clock - he came home by himself. Greenfield was with me - my son dined with me; we had stewed eels, nothing else. Greenfield cooked them in the front parlour, which is the same room where we dined and worked - she did not dine with us; it might be about a quarter past one o'clock - we were about half an hour at dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your son do after dinner - A. He sat down, reading a book, the best part of the afternoon; he went out about half-past four o'clock, and returned about ten o'clock at night - he drank tea with me before he went out. Greenfield drank tea with us. I went to the justice on Monday with Greenfield, Garnham, and Burry; I was in the room, but nothing was said to me - the others were not in the room. My son was never in the employ of a silversmith or engraver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Greenfield comes only on Wednesday - A. That is the first day of the week she comes - she stays all the rest of the week if I have sufficient work for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270060"/>her. I do the starching in the room where she irons - I allow my son eighteen pence a week for pocket-money.</p>
               <p>Q. He carries out the linen and fetches it - A. Yes, if it is not too heavy. I have a man to fetch it, and my son assists.</p>
               <p>Q. If he cannot bring it all, who do you send for it - A. I have a horse and cart, which a man drives - Greenfield had none of our dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go home to dinner that day - A. Yes, about twelve o'clock, and returned at half-past twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any women washing that day - A. Yes, two below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Greenfield never brought any novels to your house - A. Not that I know of - my son read to himself. I believe he cut his own bread and butter at tea.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say you employ a horse and cart, and a man, and your son assists in getting the linen; does any one else fetch it - A. Sometimes a woman - Greenfield has fetched it at different times. I do not recollect that she fetched any that week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where does your son get books - A. There are books about the house, which I have had in former days. I believe Greenfield has once or twice brought him books - I do not know what book he was reading.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion have you for a horse and cart - A. To fetch the linen from the City. I employ women to fetch it nearer home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Burry with your son on the Wednesday - A. When he came home he said that he had seen him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say that he had drank with him - A. No, he was not at my house that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at your house between the Wednesday and Sunday - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get your beer from at dinner - A. From the Two Brewers, public-house, in our street; I sent a little boy to order it - I am sure of it - he ordered them to bring it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it to you - A. I suppose the pot-boy did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not send Greenfield for it - A. She often fetched it - I cannot be positive, but I think I sent for it that day; I suppose I took it at the door myself. Greenfield cooked the dinner, because I was busy in starching the linen, and preparing it for ironing. I was attending to the washing and drying all that day - I did not wash myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Greenfield employed before dinner - A. In cleaning the eels and making up the fire; she did nothing else before dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she do any thing else but iron after dinner - A. No. I starched and prepared it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where your son was on Saturday - A. He was out and in, and chiefly about the house. I believe he went out about eleven o'clock in the morning, and came home between eleven and twelve, for I had something for him to do. He did not go out again till between four and five o'clock - not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Greenfield go to the watch-house with you - A. Yes, she was present, and heard the conversation between us.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Mr. Price on this business - A. On the Wednesday after the Sunday. He went to Marlborough-street on Thursday with me, but he was not there on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Greenfield that your son was charged with doing this on Wednesday - A. I think I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Does she cook for you more frequent than you do yourself - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How is your son generally dressed - A. As he is now. He has an old brown great coat, but no boots - he never wore them.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 11th of October, I went round the cottage, every thing was then safe.

            . I am an officer. On the 13th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was near Fitzroy-square, and saw Bullard going along Clipstone-street, very heavily laden; I followed him round to Chalton-street, into an old iron-shop. Immediately he went in he put down this basket, with the lead in a bag; I went up to him and found it was lead - I handcuffed him. The woman of the shop exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Why do you bring your lead here, to get me into trouble?" - this was before it was opened. While I was handcuffing him, Turner came by with another quantity of lead. Seeing me there, he made the best of his way down the street as fast as he could - he knew me. I left a man in charge with Bullard in the shop, followed, and came up with him. I said,</p>
               <p>"What. Turner! are you in it again? you know my handcuffs will fit you." He said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Davis, I found this." I called a coach, and took them both to the office with the lead. It was afterwards compared, and fitted nail by nail to the building. I found a pair of silver spoons on Turner; he said he brought them from sea with him - they have been claimed.</p>

            , I was a gentleman's servant, but have been out of place a long time. French was going by the shop, and said it was a good speck, and he would have a piece of beef; I was with them; there were four of us together. I said I would have no concern in it. French immediately took the beef, and gave it to the boy who is not taken.</p>

               <p>"D - n you, go on!" He tried to get from them. His jacket flew open, the prisoner put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and took his pocket-book out. I went up and told him he had lost something, he missed his pocket-book. I told him I knew the man quite well by his lurking about Rosemary-lane. I went down Rosemary-lane with the prosecutor to look for him, but could not find him until the following Saturday, when I saw him in Rosemary-lane, and followed him into Bishopsgate-street; I there met Forrester, who took him. I am sure he is the man.</p>

Mr. Hagger, of Oxford-street, owed us 7 l. 13 s. I sent Norman, my shopman, round with some unpaid bills. About twenty days after the 22d of August, I inquired if the prisoner had received this debt? he said he had. He should have accounted for it on the Saturday after he received it, he never did account for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You told him if he would confess and give security, nothing should happen - A. No. I spoke to him on the Friday following about it. He enters in a book what he receives - I have his book here, Hagger's name is not in it; he paid me no money after the 27th. On the Friday, when he came, I asked him if he had received it? he said,</p>
               <p>"I did." I said,</p>
               <p>"Why did you not account for it?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I will explain it;" he said he would write it down. I handed him a pen and ink, he did not write. I told him I was going round to the customers, and should be sorry to apply for money which had been received; he said he wished to go with me. We went out together - I said,</p>
               <p>"Now explain it;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Don't you recollect my losing my pocketbook?" I said that was in February last. He said that in that pocket-book he lost 59 l., which he had received. I said,</p>
               <p>"Of whom did you receive it?" he said he had it down in a book. He went home and brought me a book, which had several sums of money in it, but not this. He said he received one person's money, and paid for it by another, but that could not be the case.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did he remain in your service - A. Not an hour; I suffered him to go about his business, to clear himself if he could, not to procure security. He was at large three weeks, during which time I requested<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270063"/>him to come to me, but he would not, and I had him secured.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum had he received - A. Sixty or seventy pounds. If I had found he had received the money, and lost it, I should have considered him unfortunate.</p>

Two officers came in with a woman named Brown - the shilling she offered me fell down from the counter, and they picked it up.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 22d of October I was in Aldersgate-street, and saw the prisoner within two doors of Spooner's shop, the cheesemonger - a woman named Brown was in his shop; Mr. Spooner was rubbing a shilling on marble. I went in, and had some conversation with him; the prisoner was walking backwards and forwards, and looking towards the window. Brown came out, and joined the prisoner immediately. I followed them to St. Martin's le Grand; they stopped, and looked in at several shops. I met Allen; we followed them to Warwick-lane; they stopped in a dark place there, and had some conversation together. Brown went into a baker's shop, and bought a penny roll, the prisoner waited for her about twenty yards off; they joined again, and I followed them to Broadway, Blackfriars - they stopped at the corner of Shoemaker-row, opposite Hawkes's shop, the prisoner went in, Allen followed her, and I seized Brown by both hands, and took her into the shop. In crossing the road I felt a bag in her left hand - she threw something from her right hand, which sounded like bad coin. I found a bad shilling in her pocket, and three good shillings, and three sixpences concealed in a bag - the good shillings were separate. I then searched the prisoner, and found 1 s. 1 d. in copper on her. I also found a bad shilling where I heard the money drop; I think more fell. I found about a quarter of a pound of soap on her, which had never been used. The bill was thrown out against Brown.</p>

            . I lodge at Whitechapel. In July last I came to town from Scotland. On the 23d of September I was walking with Richardson, and saw the prisoner at the Obelisk in the Borough. Richardson went over, spoke to him, and in about five minutes he beckoned me over - I went, and Richardson said, this gentleman, Mr. Stoney, thought he had interest to get me a place in the Customs; I said I should be much obliged to him if he would. We all three walked together along Blackfriars-road, and went into a public-house. He said he should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270064"/>go to the Custom House and see his friend, and that we were to meet him again at the Twelve Bells, public-house, Bride-lane, at twelve o'clock. We went, and he came soon after, said he had seen his friend at the Custom House, and there were two vacancies as tide-waiters, and if I would pay 35 l., I might have one of them; I said I was agreeable. He said 5 l. was to be advanced immediately for stamps, and 10 l. was to be paid when I was sworn in. I said it would be more convenient to pay the whole 30 l. by instalments - he said he would see if his friend would do that; we all three walked together to the Custom House, parted there, and appointed to meet at half-past two o'clock, in Miles-lane, Cannon-street, at a public-house, to give him the 5 l. - I went in the mean time to Whitechapel to procure the 5 l,; we met in Miles-lane. I had only got 3 l. 12 s. - it was three 1 l. notes, and the rest in silver; he said his friend agreed to take it by instalments. I said I was sorry I could not get all the 5 l.; he said if it could not be advanced I should lose the situation, as the vacancy must be filled up. I proposed to pledge my watch, which I did for two guineas - I got two 1 l. notes and 2 s.; the prisoner waited outside until I came out, we then went to Miles-lane, and he said it would be necessary to have a certificate, stating my age and where I was born, and said he should fetch me a written agreement from the Secretary of the Customs, and then I should give him the 5 l. He went away and returned in about a quarter of an hour with the agreement - this is it - (looking at it). On receiving this, I gave him three 1 l. notes and 2 l. in silver; he went away, saying, he was going to the Custom House to pay the money. He returned and said he had received half a crown for his trouble - he shewed it to me, and said we should have some dinner with it. We went to a cook-shop, and dined there, then went to a public-house, where I treated, and we parted.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you to meet him again - A. Yes, next day, at eleven o'clock in the morning, in Miles-lane, and he was then to introduce me to his friend at the Custom House. I met him there, and he said he had been to the Custom House, that the Secretary was busy with the Commissioners, and I could not see him. We met there again, at one o'clock, he said he had seen his friend, and that it was all right. We was not to meet again until the Tuesday, for me to be sworn into office, at eleven o'clock - we met then. He left us there, and went to the Custom House to see if all was ready; he returned in about twenty minutes, and said my certificate was not come up from Dunbar, but to a certainty it would be settled on the Thursday following - we were to meet on Thursday. We went, but received a note from the prisoner - (looks at it) - this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. He met you on Friday in consequence of the letter - A. Yes, and asked if we had received his note? I said, Yes, we had - we all three went to the Custom House together; we waited in the hall while he went up. In about ten minutes he returned, saying, the Secretary, Mr. Delavaud, was busy, and could not be seen, but we should should see him in half an hour; we waited half an hour. The prisoner then went to the Custom House again, came out again in about twenty minutes, with a letter in his hand, and said he was to carry it to the Lords of the Treasury Office, Westminster, to see if my warrant was signed. As we were walking towards the Treasury, he opened the letter, and read it in a low tone. It signified that if the warrant was ready, to give it to the bearer, and was signed J. Delavaud. Richardson and I waited at a public-house while he went to deliver the letter. He returned in about half an hour, and said he saw the warrant lying before them, but it was not signed, that some of the Lords were expected that morning, and it would then be sent down to the Custom House signed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go then - A. To the Custom House - he said he should go and tell his friend what had passed, and we parted; we met on Saturday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, in Miles-lane. He went to the Custom House to see if the warrant was come, returned, and said it was not, but Mr. Delavaud was going to the Treasury, and would bring it down in his pocket that afternoon - we parted. I received a note from him on Saturday evening, saying, that he wished to see us at nine o'clock on Sunday morning in Miles-lane. I went by myself, and asked him if he had seen his friend? He said he had, and that my warrant was come down, and that I should be sworn in on the Tuesday following, which was the 5th of October; I was to meet him then in Miles-lane. I went, but he did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. At all these meetings you had something to eat and drink - A. Generally, and all at my expence. Finding he did not come, I went and inquired for Mr. Rentor, and found that he had not been to the Custom House for a fortnight - I never got my appointment. I accidentally met the prisoner in Little East Cheap on the Thursday following. He said if I would wait at Miles-lane, he would run to the Custom House and see if it was ready - I said I would go with him. I saw him go into the messenger's room; he returned in about five minutes, and said as sure as his name was Stoney, I should be sworn in in half an hour. I got two officers, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am clerk in the Secretary of the Customs Office, and have been so eleven years. The appointment of tide-waiters pass through our office; no person, named Campbell, was appointed this year - no fee is given to officers for appointments. The prisoner is quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As the parties have stated, I accidentally met Richardson; he said he had a job I could make a few pounds of, as he knew I could get situations if I liked. I said I would inquire of a person who I thought was in the Custom House, and could get those things which I had tried for myself, but for the want of money I could not. I applied to him, and he told me what to do - I told them as he instructed me; I had no interest in it. I spent ten days in going backwards and forwards; the man kept amusing me, and would not see them. He ordered me to meet him in the long-room, and I was going there when I was apprehended. I paid him the 5 l., and he gave me the memorandum.</p>

I am sure he is the person, because he presented the parcel of notes. I counted them, and asked him the amount - he said 65 l. I counted them a second time, and made them 70 l. again. I asked him where he brought them from? I think he said from a person in St. John-street. I said I made them 70 l., and gave them to him to count; he said again he made them only 65 l. I handed them over to my fellow-cashier, he made them 70 l., and I paid him. This fixed my attention to him, and I am certain he is the man. He was dressed like an hostler.</p>

I took him into the Crown, public-house, and told him I came from town to apprehend him, for that parcel. I asked him to give me what notes he had got - he gave me eight 1 l. Bank notes from his pocket, a silver watch, and a gold key. He said a chap of the name of Handsome Billy had taken him to Oxford, and robbed him of 34 l.; that the watch was bought with part of the money, and as soon as I got to town I should pull Handsome Billy, for he was with him when he got the parcel. I asked him what he had done with the 20 l. bill, he said he had thrown it away, I know Handsome Billy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not make me intoxicated before I said any thing - A. No, he was quite sober, we gave him nothing till afterwards. I only gave him a glass of rum as he got on the coach to come to town.</p>

Last Friday was a week, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, my boy cried out that two men had run away with my fowls; he said he knew one of the men. I dressed myself, went in pursuit, and found the prisoner in company with five others, at the corner of Worship-street - the boy said he was the man. I went up, and asked him how he could rob me? he called me a bad name, and said he would knock my head off. I collared him, he tried to get away - he then said he would pay me for the fowls. I said if he had robbed me, I dare say he had some grits in his pocket; he immediately pulled some grits out, and threw them all about the watch-house. The officer found one of my fowls in his breeches.</p>

I returned to the chambers on the 23d of September, and the woman told me my nephew had been there. I was very sorry to hear it, knowing him to be a bad character; I suspected he had robbed the premises. The prisoner is my nephew. Next day on examining, I missed several books. I went immediately and found him at his mother's, I charged him with stealing them, he could not deny it. He said he had taken them, and took me to the pawnbroker's where he had pledged them. I found four books there.</p>

On the 23d of September, about one o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and purchased some calico of my shopman, which came to 4 1/2 d. She then looked at some lace, which was shewn to her from the window, and asked the young man if he could not shew her some out of a box? he got the box up so to do. I then attempted to serve her myself, and shewed her a number of pieces; when we came to the one in question she took it out of the box herself, folded it in its present form, and laid it on the counter by the side of the box; then took another piece out, asked the price, and how much it measured; she said it was too much for her, and she would decline taking any, and said if I would put the calico in paper, she would pay for it. I stooped to get a piece of paper from under the counter, and then rose and missed the lace. I made no observation about it then, but endeavoured to persuade her to buy a piece of lace - she declined it, as she thought she could purchase some cheaper, which would suit her purpose. I suffered her to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270067"/>go near the shop door, and then said to her,</p>
               <p>"I will thank you to let me look in your hand, I think you have something which does not belong to you." She opened her hand, and the lace now produced was in it. I talked to her for sometime on the nature of her offence, and gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before - A. She was in my shop the evening previous.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. She had a bundle in her hand - A. She had. She could not have took the lace up with the bundle. There were a number of loose pieces on the counter, she must have reached over to get this, her parcel did not lay near it. I found she had a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not want 40 l. to make it up - A. No, 40,000 l. should never move me from a principal of justice.</p>

On the 5th of October, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was sent for to the Roebuck, and saw the prisoner with these things before him, offering them for sale; he would not satisfy me how he came by them, and I took him into custody. Next morning I went to him, he said he took them from the front of a postchaise. The prosecutor claimed them. I took him to the office, he then said another man took them out of the bar, and gave them to him to sell.</p>

He first shook his waistcoat-pocket, then forced his hand into his breeches-pocket, drew something out, and put it into his breast; Windred laid himself along the settle to prevent my seeing - Nail went over to his companions again, and they ran out of the house.

               <p>"Good night." We instantly went after him, and secured him in an old iron shop, where he had sold the lead for 9 1/2 d. It was safe when he came, and missed immediately after he went.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was set to watch the place, saw the prisoner go in, and come out again; they said he had got it. I lost him, and went another way to an old iron shop in Bridgewater-gardens, and found him there; he had just received 9 1/2 d. for the lead, which was in the scale - the woman refused to produce it. I found a knife on him, with which he said he cut the lead, and that he did it through distress - the money was in his hand. I told him to give the lead up, but the woman said I should not have it.</p>

A coach came by, and she said there was a coach - I told her to go about her business. The moment the coach passed she ran against me, and took the watch out of my fob - I was suspicious of her; I had known her seven years. I pursued her immediately, but she escaped. Next day I went to look for her, and found that she lodged at No. 5, Cowheel-alley, Whitecross-street. I charged her with stealing my watch, but she denied it. I said,</p>
               <p>"You know you took it in a moment." She said,</p>
               <p>"Well I did take it in a moment, for if I have business to do I don't take half an hour to do it." The mistress of the house said,</p>
               <p>"Give the old man his watch" - she said she had not got it; she would not tell me where she had pawned it. I fetched an officer, returned, and she was gone. I was not able to find her until the 12th of October, when she was taken.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 3d of August, I found that we had lost between 20 and 30 lbs. of silk - some raw and some boiled; it was taken from a closet in our skeining-room. On examination, I found that the premises had been entered by the churchyard-wall, which joins the back of them - they must have entered our loft to go to the skeining-room door, which was in the dye-house; they had endeavoured to force the door open - the key of this door had usually been hung up at a distant part of the dye-house, which the prisoner knew, but it was not there that night. After failing in their attempt to open the door, it appears that they must have returned up stairs and taken out some four inch brick-work, which made an opening into a room over the skeining-room, where there is a flap-door communicating with it, which is not always locked; the key of the closet was in the foreman's desk in the skeining-room. This desk was wrenched open, the key of the closet taken out, and opened with it - the closet was not forced open, but all this silk was taken out of it. Next morning, when the people came to work, they discovered the loss, and on looking round, one of them found an old coat of the prisoner's in the lower part of the premises, where the door had first been attempted. I have never found the silk.</p>

            . I am a patrol of the Strand. About ten or eleven o'clock on the 20th of August I heard a noise up Swan-yard, and found Kenny and another man had been quarrelling; Kenny was at his door, I requested him to go in, which he did. In the morning I heard the same noise again, went up, and found Kenny and Davis quarrelling. I said,</p>

               <p>"Why it is not long ago since I separated you, and you are at it again! I shall take you to the watch-house as disorderly," which I did. Davis laid hold of Kenny, and said he would not let him go until he had got his money back, for he had robbed him of a pocketbook and 21 l., which was in Kenny's house. Kenny wished me to go in and search, I did not - they had both been drinking. Davis knew what he was about, but Kenny was rather more in liquor. I told Davis to be careful of what he said, for it was a serious thing to charge a man with robbing him - he still persisted in it, and I took them both to the watch-house, where he gave charge to that effect. On Saturday morning I took Kenny to Bow-street, the Magistrate asked Davis if he charged Kenny with robbing him? he said he was in liquor, and could not say whether it was him or not, but he had been robbed of it. The Magistrate discharged the complaint.</p>

She told him she was going for some bread and cheese - he said,</p>
               <p>"Now you had better let me go and do the trick." She said,</p>
               <p>"No, it is a man I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270071"/>have known many years, and I will not have it done." When she came back he said,</p>
               <p>"You might as well have let me done it;" she said No, and went up stairs. I saw no more of her. About two o'clock in the morning Kenny and Davis were fighting. It was the night of the robbery.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Williams, who keeps the Swan, in Swan-yard. On the night of the 20th of August I went out to get some gin, and on coming back I saw Davis and Kenny standing under the lamp, counting some money. I heard Davis say there was 21 l. He had a pocket-book and the notes in his hand - this was between eleven and twelve o'clock - I saw them again at one o'clock; Davis had then changed coats with Kenny; they were drinking together at the top of Swan-yard with several girls. Between three and four o'clock I saw them fighting in Swan-yard. Davis charged Kenny with robbing him of a pocket-book and 21 l. I believe they went to the watch-house.</p>

I was in the yard ten minutes before five o'clock, the door was bolted, and the things safe; in a few minutes a young man told me I had been robbed of my linen. I went into the yard, found the door open, and my linen gone out of a basket, and one shirt was taken off the line, which I had pinned on. The lad took me to a field-gate, and I saw the prisoner running; Blain followed and secured him at Bagnigge Wells; he was brought back to my yard, I opened his apron, and took the linen out.</p>

            . I am headborough of Whitechapel. Burrell described the man to me; the prisoner came in at the door, I thought he answered the description, and said</p>
               <p>"Look at this man;" he came out, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." I secured him, and said I must search you, for this man has been robbed of his watch. He resisted terribly. After a great deal of resistance I searched him, and found the watch in his right-hand breeches-pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking in the house, a man came in in a hurry, put the watch into my hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"Hold this a few minutes, for I am going to fight." I left the house to get shaved, when I returned the officer asked the potboy if I was the man? he said, Yes. He asked me if had a watch? I said I have, but it is not mine, I have come back to give it to the man who gave it to me. I pulled it out, and he took it. I did not resist.</p>

As I stood against the post, Henley struck me over the head with a stick, which cut my hat through with the blow - my head was cut in two places; my hat came over my eyes. They jumped out of the cart, pulled me about, and almost choked me; some of them tried to get my watch out, but could not, because my fob was twisted. I had about 322 l. in my pocket-book, and put my hand on it to secure it, then the prisoner and Griffiths came up to me, one of them cut my finger, which was on my pocket-book - they must have had a knife; I think they meant to cut my pocket. I hallooed out for assistance. I could neither move nor stir, I was confined so close against the post - assistance came, they were overpowered, jumped into the cart, and went off. It was broad daylight. As they were going off, one of them said,</p>
               <p>"You b - gg - r, you shall never live to transport another man for stealing iron." I had prosecuted a man for stealing iron, who was transported. I have not the least doubt of the prisoner being one of them. I knew him before, he lived near me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. He must have known that you knew him - A. I think so. I know two or three more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, at the office, or somewhere else, you said to him.</p>
               <p>"I know nothing of you, I cannot say you was one of them." - A. Never.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you never see him from that time till he was taken - A. Never. I did not know where he lived then. The day after the 27th, I was going to the gate, as before, saw him in the road, and ran after him - he got away. I seized Griffiths, and he also got away. The prisoner was taken three weeks ago.</p>

On the 28th of September, about eight or nine o'clock in the morning, I sent Ellington to fetch a chest of tea from the East-India warehouse, Crutched-friars, and to take it to Mr. Chadwell, who lives in Sloane-street, as I had sold it to him. He said he could not take it to Mr. Chadwell before six o'clock in the evening, but that he would be sure to take it by that time - he was to take it there from the warehouse. About eleven o'clock that night two officers came and informed me that it had been stolen. I saw it next morning at Worship-street; the tea had then been emptied into a bag, and weighed 5 lbs. short. The number of the chest was the same I ordered him to fetch; the permit was with it. Mr. Moffatt was my broker.</p>

               <p>"You had better step up to the broker, and see if he has cleared the chest." He went out of the yard, returned in about five or six minutes with a piece of paper, with the number of the chest on it - it was the proper paper. He said,</p>
               <p>"Is this number down for delivery?" I found one of that number, and delivered it to him, and he took it out of the yard on his knot - he was alone. I saw the same chest next day at the office, where both the prisoners were in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any chest of tea - A. No, my Lord; Dunn asked me to lend him 1 l., which I did in silver. He then shewed me a sample of tea, which he said he had to sell - Ellington was not then present; I had known him to have coffee, but never knew him to have tea to sell before, He asked me if I could assist him in the sale of it? and said he had 80 lbs. I said I would have nothing to do with it - this was about three or four o'clock; they both went out, but I do not know whether they both left exactly together. I afterwards went to look for Dunn, and found him at No. 1, Crown-court, Grub-street - Ellington was not with him; Dunn quarelled with me, and I left him. When I returned I found Ellington at my house; Dunn came in very much in liquor - they were both in liquor, and I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you allow them to run up a score at your house for eating and drinking - A. About 8 s. I lent Dunn 1 l. before the tea was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not advance it on tea or coffee - A. No, they talked about the tea.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you calculate what the whole would come to - A. No; I said something about 17 l. I informed the officers myself about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not complain of an assault - A. I might. I told the officers I suspected they had stolen the tea, and shewed them where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know where it was - A. I heard them say it was in the house in Crown-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say what you thought the tea worth - A. I do not recollect - A. I might have said it was worth 3 s. or 4 s., 10 s. 6 d., or a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the officer had got sound of it, and say,</p>
               <p>"Now, as I have not got a bargain, I'll sell you like a bullock" - A. I do not know; I might have said so.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. On the 28th of September Molloy came and gave me information about the tea; I found the prisoners at his house between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and took them to the watch-house. On Ellington I found a permit for the tea, the same number as that on the chest; on Dunn I found about half an ounce of tea, which appeared to be the same sort as that in the chest. Next morning I and Bee went to No. 1, Crown-court, in consequence of information from Molloy, and there found 80 lbs. of tea sewed up in a sack in the one-pair room - I found the chest broken up in different parts of the room; I put it together; it was not quite entire, but the number was perfect, and corresponded with the permit - it was No. 13,804. Lane keeps the house. The prisoners were both drunk, particularly Ellington.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 1, Crown-court, in the first floor; I have known Dunn many years. On the 28th of September, between one and two o'clock, he brought a chest of tea covered over with a sack, Ellington was with him - it was in the shape of a chest; they put it in the sack. The constable fetched it away next morning. The prisoners had half a pint of gin, I had a glass with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Molloy did not come to the lodging, and have a glass himself - A. Yes, and paid for it himself - I do not know that he saw the tea. Ellington had sewed it up in a sack before he came.</p>
               <p>ELLINGTON'S Defence. Molloy told the Magistrate that I pitched the chest on a block, went to get a pint of beer, and in the mean time it was stolen. I was very tipsey, and could not carry it. He advanced me 1 l., and said,</p>
               <p>"That is for the chest."</p>
               <p>DUNN'S Defence. The men called on me in the morning; Molloy called me, I got up and let them both in - I afterwards found Ellington in the tap-room, and he went to the warehouse for the chest. I met him in Moorfields, he said he must trouble me to carry it, I assisted him with it to Crown-court; we both went to Molloy, he agreed to give 17 l. 5 s. for the tea, and 1 l. was paid to Ellington towards it; I had no dealings with it. As to the sample which was found on me, I bought it in Holborn on the Saturday before.</p>

On the 23d of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, my master was cleaning the windows inside, a pair of breeches was taken from the outside of the window - he sent me out, and I caught the prisoner at the window with them inside his coat - he said he did not take them. My master desired me to fetch a constable, the prisoner immediately escaped across the way, I followed and caught him about 200 yards off, he was running; I never lost sight of him.</p>

On the 22d of October, about one o'clock, the crupper hung in the back-room leading from the wharf to the counting-house. I missed it about three o'clock, and asked him if he had seen it? he said he had not. Between six and seven Judd came and desired me to attend next day at the Thames Police Office, which I did, and found the prisoner in custody, with the crupper and two horse-boots, which were mine, He was our servant, and worked three years with us at 24 s. per week. I had not seen the boots for some time.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 22d of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was with Beech and two others, and saw the prisoner go up Church-street, with something concealed under his greatcoat; I asked him what he had got? he said a piece of harness, and that he worked for Briant. While we were examining it Beech said it was a crupper - the prisoner immediately ran away as hard as he could. I pursued and secured him, without losing sight of him. As he ran he tried to pull his great-coat off.</p>

The beginning of October being our holiday-time, my mother brought down a quantity of her best spoons; after tea I told the prisoner to be careful and wash them, and bring them up with the tea-things - I thought she brought them all up, but did not count them. A day or two afterwards we missed two common ones - one was engraved, that was my husband's; I could not find it, told the prisoner I had missed them, and asked what she had done with them? she said,</p>
               <p>"I hope you don't think I have taken them" - I said they must be in the house, she immediately ran out of the house. I put on my bonnet, ran out, and overtook her near her own house, which is on Dock-hill - she only chaired for us. I told her it was plain she had taken them, and asked her what she had done with them? She took me to Fleming's, where I found my father's spoon, but not ours.</p>

In the course of the day the brought me an old shilling; next day I bought a spoon of her. On the Thursday following, which was the 7th of October, she brought another; I gave her 1 s. 3 d. for each of them. Mrs. Levi and the prisoner came afterwards, and I shewed her one. I had sent the first off with other old silver. I do not know whether it was engraved with a cypher, it was engraved round the edges.</p>

Two persons asked me to pursue with them; I ran to Gould's-green, and caught sight of the prisoners and another man, who were walking - I ran after them; they went on about half a mile farther before I overtook them. When I got within twenty yards of them, they saw me; two of them turned over the heath, and I caught the other, which was Sullivan; he had about 28 lbs. of lead - it appeared to be the piece of a cistern. I asked him where he got it from? He said from the building beyond, pointing behind him - I had passed no buildings. I secured him, and took him to the watch-house with the lead - he did not resist; he said he wanted victuals. I know Sheen was with him, for I saw him only twenty yards before me. I think I should know the third man, but he was rather before Sheen.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and work at Hampstead. On the 7th of October, I was going to work at Mr. Gamble's, who is a baker, and lives at the top of Hampstead, and was informed that a man desired me to cross the common after some men, who had robbed somebody - I could see nobody, but he pointed where I was to go to; I pursued, and caught sight of Sheen, who was running about a quarter of a mile off; I overtook him near Kentish-town - he ran all the way; several others were in pursuit. I took him to Hampstead watch-house, and there found Sullivan and the last witness.</p>

            . I am rentor of Hampstead Heath. On the 7th of October, as I was crossing the heath, a man came up and pointed two men out to me; while he was speaking, I saw them both stoop down. and each take up a parcel of something very heavy - they were about a hundred and fifty yards off - I could not tell what it was. They walked off, and I walked with the man about a hundred and fifty yards; they saw us following them, and both set off running - they ran about two hundred yards with the lead, which was wrapped up in haybands. I heard the people cry out that they had thrown the lead into the ditch; I had then lost sight of them, and did not see them again. I called to my men to pursue them, returned, and found two parcels of lead in the ditch, wrapped up in hay-bands - I cannot say they were the same that I saw the men with - I do not know either of the men. In the afternoon I found about 6 lbs. of lead on the spot they had passed - I did not see them by the ditch, but they must have passed it. I afterwards saw the prisoner's at the watch-house, and sent the man to Maddock's with the lead.</p>

            . I live at Stanmore Park. I lost a leaden cistern, which stood under my water-cock in the yard; it was between two and three feet long - this is the same size and shape. It was safe on the 5th of October, and all gone on the 6th; I missed it about seven o'clock in the morning. I live about five miles from Hendon. The cistern was in a wooden case; it fits the holes where it was nailed.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 5th of October I stopped the prisoner near Limehouse Quay, in a boat with two oars; he had a bag; containing eight sheets, and other articles - he was wearing Doeg's things. I hailed the boat, and told him to stop - nobody but him was in it. He left the boat, and ran over three barges; but I followed, and secured him without losing sight of him. I have found an owner for the sheets.</p>

On the 16th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Green's shopman came in with two pieces of ribbon, and asked if they were ours? I said, Yes, I knew them. I went with him to his shop, and saw the prisoner; I recollected immediately that she had been to our shop a few minutes before - she knew me, and began to cry. I claimed the ribbons. She had bought some ribbon of us, which came to 5 d., and changed half a crown.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Green, who is a haberdasher, and lives in Marylebone-street, Golden-square - Titchborne-street runs in a line with it. The prisoner came into the shop between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for some ribbon; I put the drawer before her, and she chose one, which was 4 d. per yard, and had 1 1/4 yard cut, then chose another at 5 d. yard, and had 1 1/4 yard of that. While I was cutting it, I thought I saw her take a piece out of the drawer, and asked her if there was any thing else? She seemed confused, which made me suspect her. She then said she wanted a yard of two-penny galloon. I spoke to my fellow-shopmen, we secured her, and found a piece under her shawl. I went round the counter, felt her pocket, and found it was nearly full. We got the servant-maid to search her, who found seven pieces of ribbon in her pocket, five of which were ours. Mr. Collier claimed the other two.</p>

On the 16th of October, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was going over Friar's-mount, and met the prisoner with the pump on his shoulders, in company with another young chap. As soon as the other saw me he ran away. I caught hold of the prisoner with the pump; he said he found it in Crabtree-row, which is close to the prosecutor's.</p>

On Friday evening, the 8th of October, I locked up the manufactory door myself, and left the lead hanging on a wooden rail; there is one part of the manufactory which I occasionally leave open to chrystalize saltpetre - in that part the lead hung. In the morning when I got up I found a lead light forced completely out of the window, leaving an aperture sufficiently large to admit a good sized boy; he could then unbolt the back door, and get to the wash-house, from where I lost a cane basket, and an old coat. On looking round I perceived a pane of glass broken directly under the fastening of the counting-house window, which was not so when I went to bed - it appeared they had endeavoured to undo the fastening, but the brass work was corroded, and they could not. On further examination, I found they had entered the cellar. I missed the brass cock of the cyder cask. I gave an alarm about the neighbourhood, and on Saturday found the prisoner in custody with the property.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Saturday morning, the 9th of October, between three and four o'clock, I was on a back wharf at the back of the prosecutor's premises, and saw the two prisoners running with a basket; I stopped them, and asked them what they had got? one said they did not know, for they found it on London Bridge, and were going to Haggerstone; the other said, No, we are going to Blackfriars-road. I took them both to the watch-house. One had hold of each handle of the basket; it contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I knew nothing of the robbery at the time it was committed. I met a man coming out of the house, persuaded him, to put the things back, but he would not, so I took them from him; but finding the box was broken open, I thought it would be useless, and I should be suspected, therefore not being able to put the things in their proper places I assisted in disposing of them. It was through distress - I had not even the necessaries of life. My father has banished me and my mother from his house, and allows me 5 s. 6 d. per week. He wishes me to be sent out of the country, and refuses to give me a character.</p>

            . I am a market gardener, and live at Brentford, in the parish of Isleworth. On the 17th of August, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was going by Gunnersbury-lane, and saw Smith and Wilson, (who were convicted last Session), in a cart with the prisoner. I am sure of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak with certainty - A. I have not the least doubt of his being the man - they were in a green open chaise cart, in the main road, about one hundred yards on the London side of Gunnersbury-lane - I noticed them in the cart; Smith and Wilson jumped out, and one got on each side of the cart; I, myself, was in a cart at the time, and saw a large bundle in their cart, in a large bag. They appeared to get out to do something to the harness - the horse's head was towards London; the prisoner remained in the cart; I stopped just opposite the cart, and noticed them; one of them came round to me, and I touched my horse to go on, but still observed them. I went on to Mr. Streams, and spoke to him; when they saw me stop there, they got up into the cart, turned round, and went up Gunnersbury-lane, towards, Hanger-hill - they turned to the right instead of going over the hill, still keeping their pace. They turned to the right, down a place where there was no thoroughfare, but finding they could go no farther, two of them got out, and took the large bag with them. The prisoner remained in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing before they took the bag - A. As they went along I saw them cut a little frail-basket, and throw it into a ditch, in the lane; I had not called out to them, but only pursued them. I saw Smith and Wilson return from the field with the bag, and get into the cart again - I stood at a distance in the lane. I was afraid to go up to them by myself, as Wilson and Smith had threatened to murder me if I came near them. They got up into the cart, turned, and came towards me to the top of a bye lane; four or five of us tried to stop them, but could not - a young man with a reaping-hook tried to stop them, but they struck him with a stick, and cut his cheek, which made the blood run very much. They then went over Hanger-hill, and I followed them by myself, for two or three others would go no farther. I followed them up the hill, then Smith and Wilson got out, and came after me, swore they would murder me, and said so to several others - I went over the hill after them. Three or four reapers at the top of the hill, followed with their hooks in their hands; we pursued, and secured Smith and Wilson, but the prisoner remained in the cart, went on a few yards, and then stopped; Smith made use of very bad language. I sent for Streams, who said the man was dangerously hurt, and they were fearful that he would not live.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. He went on with the cart, turned round, passed us, and kept before us until we came to the Ealing Arms - we left him there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him - A. We did not then know any thing had taken place, but their having done mischief to a man - we did not then know any thing was stolen. The prisoners were in my sight near an hour and a half - I have not the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you observe the things that were taken in the field - A. I described the bag to Piper, and saw it nine days afterwards. I saw the frail-basket about eight days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. In this Court, when Smith and Wilson were tried. I then recollected him, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You was passing in the road, going to market - A. Yes, I heard they had assaulted a man, and pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe the prisoner to be the man, and, perhaps, will die with that belief in your mind - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Since he has been committed, have you not said it was a hard thing to swear to a man, and you should be sorry to swear to him - A. I told Mr. Burgess, when he came to me, that I should be sorry to swear to the young man. Burgess said I had sworn to an innocent man, and was to go and see another man, named Ingram, to see if he was not the man. I did not go, because I had no occasion so to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270079"/>Q. The man you took to be the prisoner sat the greatest part of the time in this Court - A. Yes. He was dressed in a fustian jacket. The Bell, public-house, at Ealing, is near half a mile from where I pursued the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You refused to go to see Ingram, believing you was correct in the man you spoke to - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>

In a few minutes I heard some blows; I got up, left my house, and went towards Brentford, and back again, before I could find the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of them - A. I do not think he was - I cannot positively swear to him. I took the man in the cart to be smaller than him - I think the prisoner is not the man. I did not pursue the cart. Tyler brought Smith and Wilson to my house; I had pursued them up Gunnersbury-lane - the cart drove very fast. Smith and Wilson were taken before I got up to them; I had seen them come out of the lane. People attempted to stop them but could not - they struck a person on the cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were taken, did you see the man in the cart - A. Yes; I had been in sight twenty minutes. I believe the prisoner is not the man; I thought the man considerably taller. I did not see him on the ground - I was on horseback.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you afterwards see the third man at the Bell, at Ealing - A. No, I was not in Court when the prisoner was taken, nor did I see him at the office - I did not see him until yesterday.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How many carts come that way you cannot tell; all that you know is, that the man who stopped at your house was not the prisoner - A. That is all.</p>

I stopped at the White Horse, at Hounslow, about twelve o'clock on Monday night, for about ten minutes, the bag was then safe, it was about the middle of the waggon - I missed it between Hounslow and Smallborough-green gate - a hole was cut in the tilt of the waggon, and the bag stolen. I had a driver with me and a woman passenger.</p>

I went across the garden, and saw the prisoner and Bolton there - I knew them before; I saw them drop off Richardson's wall. As soon as Bolton dropped, I saw him pick up a sheet of copper, and run up my father's garden with it, (which joins Mr. Richardson's premises), and the prisoner went away with the ladder that they had used to get over the wall with, which is about fourteen feet high. I ran after him, but he dropped the ladder, and got from me - he had nothing but the ladder. I followed Bolton so close, that he dropped the copper, and got away. I continued watching, but saw no traces of them.</p>

I endeavoured to find him at his parents' - he was coming from there when I took him. I asked him if his name was Dormer? He said it was not - he had some victuals in his apron. I asked him if he knew any thing of this concern? he denied it - Salter delivered me the copper. I had often passed his street - he was there. I cannot find Bolton.</p>

On the 14th of October, about a quarter past three o'clock, I saw him sitting on a chair under the timepiece. I went into the yard, returned in about ten minutes, the prisoner was then gone. I missed the timepiece about twenty minutes past four o'clock; I found it at Shadwell Office on the 16th,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270081"/>and knew it - he was in custody. Before this I went to him, and told him if he had pledged it, he had better give me the ticket - he strongly denied it several times; I gave him in charge, and he was taken to Poplar watch-house. I saw him searched, and the duplicate found in the lining of his hat, pledged at Castles's, Ratcliff-highway.</p>

            . On the 26th of October, about a quarter after five o'clock in the afternoon, as I stood at the door, I saw the prisoner look at the warming-pan, which hung at the door post - he took it down deliberately, and walked away with it. I was looking at him, but as several things hung at the door. I went out to see what he had taken. I told the young man he had taken something - we went after him, and he was brought back. I saw him put the warming-pan down.</p>

On the 2d of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the back parlour, looking over some papers, at a chest of drawers, which stood rather behind the parlour door. I am quite sure the street door was quite closed - I rent the house. I was standing very still, and heard a little noise like the hustling of clothes; I turned a little aside to see what it was. I heard no more, saw nothing, and returned to look over my papers. In about a minute I heard the same noise again; I then stood so as to see the passage, and saw a gown drawn from the table in the room where I was, into the passage. I went to the parlour door, and saw the prisoner in the passage, with the gown on his arm; he had got about half way along the passage. I ran forward and laid hold of him, he dropped the gown, and struck me several times with great violence to prevent my holding him. I was extremely hurt; it was with difficulty I could move my arm for several days afterwards - he struck me with his fist, and dragged me towards the street door in trying to get out - it was then pushed too, but not fast; it opens by a small key from without. I screamed out Murder! several times. There are only a widow lady (who is a lodger), my daughter, and a female servant in the house. The widow has the first floor; she was in the garret at the time - my daughter was in the kitchen with the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. In the situation in which you were, if any of the inhabitants of the house had opened the door must you have heard them - A. I must. Two minutes before that, I came out of the kitchen myself, and if the door had not then been shut I must have observed it. The kitchen stairs are close to the street door. My screams brought my daughter and the servant up; the prisoner had by this time dragged me to the step of the door; but before that, as I was screaming and struggling with him, a young man pushed the door open, came into the passage, and asked what was the matter? - I knew nothing of him. I told him the prisoner had attempted to rob the house, and I supposed he was come to assist him, as I thought he was an accomplice - he said no more, but instantly left, leaving the street door open about half way. The prisoner turned himself round towards the door, gave a violent pull, and pulled me out of doors across the street - he continued striking me all the while; I still kept my hold.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270082"/>When he had got me on the step of the door, my daughter and the servant came up and rose an alarm, A young man came up, and secured him before I let him go. I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you lost - A. The handkerchief was pinned to the gown, and were taken together. The gown was worth 10 s., and the handkerchief 6 d. It was not dark, I had not lit my candle.</p>

Mrs. Marer lodged in the house; neither she nor the servant had been out all the afternoon - she was in the garret at the time of the alarm. I heard my mother scream Murder! several times. I ran up, and saw the prisoner, who had hold of her, on the step of the street door, she was standing still then; he immediately pulled her across the street. Assistance came, who secured him. I saw him strike her several times - I had never seen him before. The gown had been dropped in the passage when I came up. I was at the watch-house when he was searched, nothing was found on him. Before he got to the watch-house, two men came up, said they were constables, and would take him to the watch-house. When they came to the top of Wardour-street they let him go, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go it!" - I should know one of them. The prisoner was never out of my sight until he was secured again, and taken to the watch-house.</p>

I was standing at my door about six o'clock on the evening of the robbery, and saw Mrs. Holder and the prisoner come from her door, scuffling together, into the middle of the road; she kept hold of him, and called Murder and Stop thief! I ran and broke her from him, as he was beating her all the time over the shoulders. I collared him, and he knocked me down. He is a very strong man, and struck me with very great violence; he struck me several times afterwards. While I had hold of him two young men came up - one said he was an officer, he was well dressed, the other had an apron on; they both laid hold of him, pretending to be officers.; I laid hold of his collar too, and pushed him along as well as I could, he tried to get away. When he got to the bottom of Berner-street, opposite Wardour-street, they said</p>
               <p>"Go it!" he got away, and the two men absconded directly - I should know one of them again. I laid hold of the prisoner again myself, without losing sight of him. I saw him searched at the watch-house. A knife, 8 s. 6 d., and some lancets were found on him.</p>

I found 8 s. 6 d., six surgeon's lancets, and a knife on him. He was in a great perspiration, as if he had been struggling a good deal. He was brought in by several persons, one of whom he kicked a great deal, and scratched him so as to draw blood. He had no hat on when he was brought in - one was produced, which he denied being his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, I had been to Lisson-grove with two pairs of boots, and had received 11 s. for repairing them; a man who lives next door to me went with me. I spent 2 s. 6 d., and as we came through this street, being both tipsey, he said,</p>

               <p>"Here is a brothel, come in, and we will have a lark." The hall door was open about three inches; I went into the front parlour, saw nobody there or in the back parlour; I said,</p>
               <p>"Let us go away" - he said</p>
               <p>"No, we will have a lark; I was robbed here last Saturday night of 13 s." The lady came out and caught me in the hall; I had no gown or any thing else at the time.</p>

In consequence of information which I received, I directed Smith, the watchman, to notice him; from the information which he gave me, on the 18th of October I examined two fire-places, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and discovered a bag containing about 6 lbs. of indigo in one fire-place, and in the other two pieces of cream of tartar, about half a pound each, worth 9 d., and a piece of soap. The indigo was of considerable value - they were concealed there. I marked the soap and cream of tartar, and replaced them there. Next day, when the prisoner was leaving work, Armstrong searched him in my presence; he was asked if he had any thing about him belonging to his master? he said, No, twice over. Armstrong found the two pieces of marked tartar on him, but not the soap. He begged for mercy, and said it was the first he had ever taken. I went to the bag of indigo, and found near half of it gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You found it in the fire-place on the 18th - A. Yes, and found it on him on the 19th - it was worth 5 d. He afterwards said he took it as a medicine for his son. I did not know his son was ill. He had no business to take it without leave.</p>

            . I am a watchman, employed by the prosecutor. On the 18th of October, about ten minutes after six o'clock in the evening, I was on the premises; I went into the back shop, heard the prisoner overhead, called to him twice, but received no answer. I then returned from the further end of the shop, and at the top of the ladder, which leads into the drying room, I saw the prisoner; before I could speak to him, he said he wanted to see me concerning his blue vat.</p>
               <p>Q, Were the men allowed to be in that part of the premises at that time of night - A. No; I followed him into the dyehouse - he had a dark coloured bag in his hand, with something in it. When he was in the woollen dye-house he attempted to put it down on the left hand side; he then took the bag up, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will go and see if the fire is out;" in about three minutes he returned without the bag, and went away. I told my master. I went with my master and the clerk to the stokehole, where the prisoner had been, and found the cream of tartar and soap - I brought it up to my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever know a man stop after that time - A. Certainly.</p>

I went into the yard, and saw some crumbs of bread thrown from the privy to entice them in; at last one fowl went into the privy, and the prisoner shut the door. Soon after, he came out of the privy, and I went after him, brought him back, and Francis took the fowl out of his breeches.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of October I was in the New-road, and saw the prisoner with a sack on his back; Maynard, who was with him, told him I was coming, and he dropped the lead.

As we were going towards them there was a fight in the field, which continued about twenty minutes - my friend parted with me. After that was over he came to me, and said he had lost his handkerchief. I felt my pocket, and said mine was safe; I felt farther, and missed my snuff-box - I found a hole cut in my waistcoat-pocket, and the box gone. Soon after that I heard they were taking up a great many pickpockets, went to the mob, and informed the officer - my snuff-box was produced; they took the prisoner to the Belvidere. It had a cut in it, which proves that it was cut from my pocket.</p>
