I live at 39, Radnor Street, St. Luke's, and am agent to the Mint—on 8th April, in consequence of information I went to 21, Dudley Street, between 1 and 2 o'clock, with Inspector Brannan and several other officers—we went to the second floor front room and saw the three prisoners—Reardon was partly undressed, and I said to him, "Well, Mr. Barlow, I need not tell you who I am, I have called to pay you another visit. You are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession. We come here with a search warrant"—at that time Hinds handed me this packet, partly open, wrapped up in this piece of carpet—I opened it—it contained three separate packets, containing six crowns, 200 half-crowns and shillings, all counterfeit—I said to Reardon, "You will have to account for the possession of these"—he said, "I am very sorry for it, but not here"—they were all in tissue paper, with paper lapped between them in ten piece packets—Evans then said, "This is what I have got by serving others"—Hurley said, "I only came here for a little washing"—I have</p>

Landseer, and I published the engraving in 1866—I bought the copyright of Mr. Flatow—I never purchased the picture—Mr. Flatow bought it of Sir E. Landseer—I am sorry to say that these pirated photographs are made in too many places.</p>

I am chief clerk and cashier to Higgins, Eagle &amp; Co.—I keep the books of the firm, and have them all here—the course of business is to enter the goods supplied to customers in the journal, and the goods so supplied and entered are posted to the debit of the customer in the ledger—when goods were paid for in cash it was the duty of the person</p>

               <p>holding the prisoner's position to debit himself in the cash-book with that amount, which would be posted to the credit of the customer's account in the ledger—in ordinary transactions goods were supplied and money paid, but in cases where acceptances are given the course is that the acceptances shall be entered to the debit of the customer the same as cash—that item so entered to the debit would be carried to the credit of the customer's account in the ledger, the same as cash, and a folio would be entered intimating that it had been carried into the cash-book—whether the prisoner would keep those acceptances in his cash-box or pay them into the bank, would vary according to circumstances—if the acceptance was discounted before it came to maturity, it would sometimes be taken up by a cheque of the firm, but not always—where it was taken up by a cheque of the firm a credit entry for the amount would appear on the credit side of the cash-book, and where the customer's cheque or money is received to take up the acceptance, it would appear on the debit side—where an acceptance is taken up by a cheque of the firm, there would be a credit entry in the cash-book, and a debit entry of the money received from the customers—it is our practice to put what we term exchange folios, a folio opposite the debit, indicating where the credit is made, and a folio opposite the credit, intimating where the debit is made—this would not be a ledger transaction—in the case where an acceptance is dishonoured, a cheque would be drawn by the firm, and entered on the credit side of the cash-book—where the bill is dishonored, the credit would be carried to the customer's account, which would be charged with it—the credit entry would have the folio of the ledger, and the entry in the ledger would have, the folio of the cash-book credit—when the customer paid the money it would appear on the debit side of the cash-book, and would be posted on the credit side of the ledger to the customer's credit, whose account would then be square, and the transaction in the cash-book would appear, the prisoner debiting himself with the acceptance, and crediting himself with the cheque or money to take up the acceptance—in McDarby's account here is a debit of 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for goods supplied between September 19th and October 19th inclusive—the cash-book containing the entry of McDarby's acceptances is missing—I last saw it in the autumn of 1867, in the prisoner's possession, but have not been able to find it since—McDarby's account is credited in the ledger with this acceptance, and bean a folio referring to the missing cash-book—McDarby's account stands debited with goods and credited by the acceptance which had been dis<lb/>counted—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is drawn in the prisoner's writing, and I find that be credits himself with it in March, 1866—it is the cheque given by the firm to pay McDarby's acceptance, and therefore that item appears to the credit of the prisoner's account—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), given by McDarby to take up his acceptance, is not debited in the prisoner's account—it nowhere appears to his debit—I find on the credit side the exchange folio 29, but at folio 29 on the debit side there is no entry—that folio 29 is a fictitious entry—in the course of writing, the figures indicating the folio would be made after the corresponding debit entry; it would not be made till he had made the entry on the debit side—this cheque of McDarby's did go through the prosecutor's bank—the prisoner's cash balance would be made up of the money in the bank, plus the money in the cash-box, and the amount of the cash balance would appear according to the debits in the cash-book—if any sum was not entered to the debit the cash balance would be so much less, and although the cheque might be carried to the cash</p>

               <p>nothing to do with the accounts—the stock in hand remaining unsold in 1867 was about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and at the end of 1866 it was about the same—we do not value it at invoice prices, we put an actual value, according to the state of the market—if goods have increased in value, we take the increased value, and if lessened, the lesser value—the value is what the firm would have to give if ther went into the market and bought it on that day; the market price—a deficiency of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not the correct term, it is not a de<lb/>ficiency on the transactions of the year's business, but it is a discrepancy, which is not accounted for by comparing the sales and profit on the sales with the expenses and outgoings—we arrived at it by comparing Mr. Edwards' books with Mr. Tester's, and therefore, there was a check so far as those books were concerned, in comparing the profit with the expenses-book, there is a discrepancy of about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; not a deficiency on the year's trading, but debiting the expenses, there is something wrong in the result—that discrepancy would not be at all affected by the variation of the market—this is the definite result, it has nothing to do with the diminished value of the goods—a balance sheet was struck at the end of 1866—that shows a deficiency, in the same manner as 1867, of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance sheet con<lb/>sists of the entire transactions of one year—we have premises in the Curtain Road—I will pledge my oath that in that balance sheet for 1866 a deficiency is shown—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the balance sheet for 1867; but it will not show the amount; it shows a loss, in 1867, of 446<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that re<lb/>presents the amount unaccounted for between profits and expenses—we took the bad debts at a valuation.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Temple Street, Birmingham—in April, 1866, I carried on business in Birmingham, under the style of H. Powis &amp; Co.—I had an acceptance coming due on 14th April, 1866, drawn by Higgins, Eagle &amp; Hutchinson, for goods supplied—I cannot tell you where the acceptance was payable—I was in the habit of accepting bills drawn by Messrs. Higgins, payable, I think, at the Joint Stock Bank—the date of this cheque is 12th April, 1866—I sent it by my clerk—he omitted to send it before bank hours, and I sent it by post to the prose<lb/>cutor—it is for 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am debited with it in my bankers' book, which I have with me—the cheque is crossed to the City Bank, and is payable to Higgins, Eagle &amp; Hutchinson, or order—it is endorsed, "Higgins, Eagle &amp; Hutchinson."</p>

I am the wife of William Goodfellow, and live at 93, Norfolk Road, Essex Road—on Saturday evening, 24th April, I went out at 10.45 to meet my son—I returned at two or three minutes past 11, with my son, and when I got near my gate, I saw the prisoner jump out at the window—I went after him, caught hold of him, and asked what business he had in my room—he said he had not been in the room—he pulled his coat open, and said, "You see, I have got nothing about me"—I said, "No, but you were in my room with intention to rob me"—he said, "I have not been in the room; go back to the house and see, and let your son stand by me;" but I stood by him myself, and sent my son back—a policeman came up, and I gave him in custody—the policeman went into the house—when I went out I had left the house fastened securely—the window was shut, and the doors all shut and fastened.</p>

I am a clerk in the London and County Bank, Lombard Street—it is part of my duty, after the notes have been entered in the waste-book, to take charge of them when they are put in the tray, and to make out a list in the Bank list register—the prisoner shared that duty with me—I was at the bank on the 25th March—about 2 o'clock that day he said, "Shall you want me this afternoon?—I said, "I shall, the notes are rather heavy"—he said, "All right, I shall be back soon"—he went out, at least he left me—I saw him again about 3 o'clock—I said to him, "You have been rather long," looking at the clock—he replied, "Yes, I have, just an hour"—I entered in the bank list register all the notes I took charge of that day from the trays—at the end of the day I went through the list to see whether the notes were all right—I balanced them with our books, and found we were 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—it might have been two notes or more—I examined the whole of the waste-books, and tried my balances twice—I could not say whether it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, or ✗ several 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I ascertained, by working up the register, that it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I examined the waste-book—I knew the note, 00892, was missing—I found that out about two or three days afterwards, when I worked up the balances—that is a very long job, it takes us four hours to work up the notes and check them—we send the notes to the bank once a day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you send the notes on next morning that have been taken in the day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—after finding the deficiency of 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I I still sent on those notes to the Bank of England, with the list I had—in the register the number and date of each note is entered, likewise in the I waste-books, and, consequently, we are enabled to work or check one against the other—the clerks go to their dinner or lunch from about 12 to 3, at various times—there are a great number of clerks—they could not all go together, they go as their duties will allow them—they are allowed to be absent three-quarters of an hour—I can't say whether the prisoner had been to luncheon—he left me with that intention, as I understood, not to go for the day—he would still be required in the bank to assist me—he was only a quarter of an hour beyond his proper time—it was not an unusual time for him to go to his lunch—he assisted me for the remainder of the afternoon in registering the notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the issue department, Bank of England—on 25th March this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was brought to me there to cash over the counter—I know the date by referring to my book, it was some time between 2 and 3.15—I asked the person presenting it what name—this, "George Brad, 25, Philpot Lane," was on the note when it was pre<lb/>sented—I asked the name, because I thought he had possibly left out the termination, and that it was Bradley, or Bradford, or something of that</p>

               <p>sort—he told me it was George Brad, 25, Philpot Lane—on 31st March I went to the London and County Bank—I was shown into a room there—there might have been ten or twelve, or perhaps fifteen persons in the room—the prisoner was among them—I can't swear positively that he is the person who presented the note; but it is my firm impression he is the man; he very much resembles the man—I can't swear positively, it would be im<lb/>possible—I said he resembled the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am general manager of the London and County Bank, at the chief office, Lombard Street—the prisoner was one of the clerks there—on Wednesday morning, 31st March, I called the prisoner into my room—I had this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my possession—I asked him whether he was aware that a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note had been missing—he said he was—I said, "Can you tell me anything about it?—he said, "No"—I said, "You had leave of absence yesterday, at 3 o'clock, to meet a friend who was coming from Dover by train; did you meet your friend 1"—he said, "No"—I said, "Why did you not return to your duty, then?"—he said he did not think he should have anything to do if he returned—I said, "What did you do with yourself?—he said he went home—I said, "Where do you live f"—he said, "Peckham"—I said, "Then you left your friend, did you?" he having mentioned that his friend was a sick volunteer—he said, "No, I came back to meet a train that they told me would be coming in soon after I 5 o'clock, but in the meantime I went down to Woolwich, to see the friend I who had asked me to go and see this other friend"—I then said, "Do you know a person of the name of Brad?"—he said, "No, I don't"—I repeated the question—he said, "No, I don't know the name at all"—I then pro<lb/>duced the note to him, and said, "Do you know that writing?"—he said, "No, I don't"—I said, "You don't know any person of the name of Brad, living at 25, Philpot Lane?"—he said, "I know a person who lived at, I think, 25, Philpot Lane, but I don't know his name"—I said, "It is rather strange you should know a person living at that place, and not know his name; Mr. Brad knows you"—he said he did not know; he had been once to Philpot Lane, to see a person there who owed him some money for a bet, but he did not know hie name—I said, "I will ask Mr. Brad to come and see you;" and Mr. Brad came later in the day, and the prisoner recognized him—he said, "I know you"—I said, "This is Mr. Brad"—he said, "I never knew your name"—Mr. Brad replied, "Well, that is strange, because I have dined with you"—he said, "I never knew your name; I never heard your name before"—when he said he went to Philpot Lane to see the person, he said he met him coming out of his doorway, otherwise he should not have known for whom to ask—later in the day, Mr. Deane came to the bank—I told the prisoner the purpose for which I should require him to go into another room, that he might be seen—there were some ten or twelve other clerks—Mr. Deane passed through the room—I only know the pri<lb/>soner's handwriting by comparison—I have not referred to the bank books;</p>

               <p>I referred to letters that I had of his; I referred to his original application—I believe the "Geo. Brad, 25, Philpot Lane," on this note, to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Raven's Row, Spitalfields, where I carry on the business of a grocer—the prisoners were my servants, Whimper as nurse and Toohey as her assistant—there was another servant, named Martha Bradley, who was my cook—on the afternoon of Sunday, 11th April, I and my wife went from home, and we did not return till about 11.30 at night—when we left, Toohey was gone to a Sunday school, and Bradley was to leave about 6 o'clock—everything was perfectly safe up to 3.45—on my return I found the police and firemen in charge of my house—ray bedroom on the second floor had been very extensively burnt—a chest of drawers</p>

               <p>were nearly consumed—the partition between the room and the adjoining one was burnt through—the part destroyed was not near the drawers, but in another part of the room—the paint on the wall was blistered—the bed-room on the third floor, which was occupied by the assistants, had been in flames all round—the mattress of the bed had been out open, and the straw pulled out on both sides, and it had been burnt, as also the bed-clothes, though they were not entirely destroyed—in this room the fire had not extended to the walls—in the room adjoining, the servant's room, the bed had been fired—the mattress on one side had been cut open, and the straw pulled out, and part of it had been consumed—the bed-clothes were also burnt—the walk were not injured—in the dressing-room adjoining my own room on the second floor, was a chest of drawers—a fireman opened one of the drawers, and called my attention to the burnt condition of some of my shirts there—on the Sunday night we questioned each of the servants as to how the fire had happened—Toohey made a statement to me and the inspector of the Fire Brigade—she said that at 10.30 she went up stairs with the candles and slop pail, to prepare her mistress's room for the night; that when she went to her mistress's bed-room door, a cloud of smoke came from the top of the house; that she placed the candlestick on the drawers and called loudly for help, and the other servant came up—I questioned Whimper the same night, and she told me she could give no information as to how the fire bad originated.</p>

I am a cook in the service of Mr. Barham—they call me Mary—on Sunday, April 11th, I went out about 6 o'clock in the evening, and returned about 8.20—Toohey and Whimper were in the house then, and master's three young children, Percy, Louisa, and Cor<lb/>nelius—I went into the kitchen and lit the gas, and then I accompanied Toohey to the nursery—Whimper was in the night nursery, getting the baby to bed—we had our supper in the nursery, and after that I went up stain with Toohey, for the purpose of taking my clothes into my own bed-room, at the top of the house—this was about 9 o'clock—she lit the candle on the landing, and then set it down on the table in my bed-room, and left—there was nothing the matter with my bed at that time—after I had put my things away, I came down into my mistress's bed-room, and all appeared to be right there—then I went into the right nursery, and next into the kitchen, and there I saw Whimper and Toohey—it was now about 9.20—we then went into the dining-room and played the piano, and there we remained about a quarter of an hour—Whimper then went up stairs, and Toohey remained with me in the dining-room—whilst Whimper was up stairs we heard a noise at the door, and I and Toohey went to see what it was—we found that some boys were at play; we ordered them away, and remained at the door for about five or ten minutes—then we returned to the dining-room, and it was about 9.55 then—Whimper had come down stairs again, I then went into the night nursery, looked at the baby, and returned to the dining room, where I had left Whimper and Toohey—in a short time Whimper asked Toohey to go up stairs, as she thought she heard the baby cry—Toohey was away about five or ten minutes, and when she came down she said the reason she had been so long was that the baby was awake, and that she had been lying down because she had a very bad headache—we remained in the dining-room for a short time longer, when Toohey asked Whimper to fetch down a piece of music which Whimper possessed, and she replied she did not know where it was—Toohey said it was the third piece from the bottom, in the night nursery, and she would go herself—I said that master and mistress would soon be at home, and that we had better go to our right places—this was about 10.20—Whimper then took the music, and went up stairs, and was followed by Toohey; but Toohey came down again, and fetched the</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi> H.) I went to Mr. Barbam's about 11 o'clock on the Sunday night—I saw the prisoners in the drawing-room afterwards, and spoke to them—Toohey said, that at 10.30 she took a slop<lb/>pail and a candle to go and empty the slops in her mistress's bed-room, and that when she got on the landing on the second floor she saw smoke descend<lb/>ing, and gave the alarm; everything appeared to be safe in her mistress's bed-room at the time she went in; they rescued the children, the firemen were fetched, and soon the fire was extinguished—I took down a statement in writing, on the day they were taken into custody—I charged Toohey, first with stealing the money from the drawer, and then with wilfully setting fire to the house—this is the statement—Toohey said, "After Mary went out at 6 o'clock, we sat down against the window in the kitchen till 10.30, and then we put Percy to bed We then went into master's bed-room; Whimper had the keys, and looked into the dressing-room drawers; she opened a little box, which was inside, and locked it again. We then went up stairs to Mr. Airton's bed-room, and she undid the box—the lock broke whilst she was undoing the back screws with a small hammer. I said, 'That is a judgment on us;' she said, 'I don't know what to do, I shall murder Mr. Airton in the middle of the night;' I said, 'Don't do that.' We then came down stairs, and she said, 'I will set the house on fire;' then we put the baby to bed and Mary came in; we all three then had our supper in the nursery. Mary and I then went up stairs to our bed-room to take her things off. I came down first and she followed, and then we went into the kitchen and washed up the tea-things. We all three then proceeded to the dining-room and played the piano. This was about 9.30. Whimper sat in the arm chair a little while, and then went up stairs for about five minutes, then came down and played the piano for about ten minutes; she next went up stairs to fetch her music. When she came back she said, 'I can't find the keys of mistress's drawers; you go.' I said, 'I shall not.' She said, again, 'Go, your life depends on it.' Mary was present when this was said, but did not hear it. I refused to go; she then gave me the keys, and told me to go up stairs to mistress's drawers. Whimper went with me. I unlocked the dressing-room, and Whimper took the money out of the drawer, and put it into her bosom; she then said, whilst on the stairs, 'Don't it smell; Mary will smell it in a minute.' I then came down, and Whimper stayed up stairs. I washed my hands, and in five or ten minutes I went up stairs again with the slop pail and candle. I said, 'Look at the smoke, nurse; I shall call Mary.' She said, 'No,' but I did call her, and we all three took the children out of bed and saved them. Whimper has told me that she put lucifers into her mistress's drawers. This was said while she and I were making the young mens' bed that same night, after the fire was extinguished; she also told me she put the money and purse into the coal-cellar, and the keys under the sofa in the dining-room."—I saw both keys and money put into the coal-cellar by the nurse, the money about 10 o'clock in the morning, and the keys on Tuesday—I had seen Whimper a short time previous to this take the keys from a crevice in the night<lb/>nursery—on</p>

               <p>Tuesday Whimper said to Mary, "I will take poison rather than go to prison"—I fetched the money from the coal-cellar, and gave it to Mr. Bourne, of the Salvage Corps.</p>

This being a case where the firm discounted Whitton's acceptance on Mr. Bromhall, the prisoner would discharge himself of that sum by a cheque—I find an entry of a cheque to his credit—he ought to have charged himself with the acceptance, but has not done so any<lb/>where—opposite the entry of the cheque is "Fo 241;"That means that at page 241, of the cash-book, the acceptance will be found entered; I have re<lb/>ferred to page 241, and he does not charge himself with the acceptance—that acceptance was paid in with others, and carried to his credit, with the amount at the bank; so that he has credit for the amount with the bank, and does not charge himself with it with the firm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Higgins, Eagle, &amp; Co.—a suggestion was made at the end of 1867, that Mr. Hutchinson should go through the accounts, and the prisoner said that it would be showing a want of confidence in him—the prisoner left the firm in March, 1868, and after he left these entries were pointed out to me, and I examined each separately—we afterwards saw Tester, told him what we had found out, and asked him if be would give any explanation of a particular entry omitted—I think it was the one referring to Mrs. Barrow—I asked him if he could give any explanation of it—he said he could not, but it was an error which he could not account for—one or two of these items were pointed out to him, and he gave the same reply to each—this was before we took any criminal steps against him—about a month afterwards we directed that he should be given in custody, and during the whole of that time no explanation was afforded to us—he was taken before Sir Benjamin Phillips, these charges were made against him on several remands, and he was committed for trial—we were prepared with all our witnesses to go into the case at the last Sessions—I was present when Serjeant Parry applied for the case to stand over to these Sessions, that the prisoner might have an opportunity of inquiring into the charges which had been before the Magistrate—that adjournment was granted, and I gave directions that the prisoner should be furnished with any of the books of the firm which he might require, and they were sent to him—the cash-book of 1866 is missing, and the payment books into the bank—the prisoner had the custody of them—it was his duty to give them up to me when he went away, but he did not do so, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>the Saturday he expressed himself as wholly disappointed in regard to the cash and dock warrants, and said that the Lichfield mortgagor could not attend to business on account of his domestic afflictions—he said Mr. Dobree was the London agent of the Lich field lawyer, and a telegraph came to him, supposed to have been sent by Mr. Dobree—he mentioned more than once, that he had 2500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out on mortgage, and when I pressed for a deposit, he said he had made several loans lately—he mentioned two or three times about not reducing his balance below 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that it was at the Whitechapel Branch of the London and Westminster Bank—I was induced to believe that, because his father's business used to be there—he said that his wife had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, which she drew quarterly—that was confirmed by her signing two of the bills—he showed me some telegrams, but took them away again; two of them were on the day the furniture was valued—one he said came from Mr. Dobree, and the other from Lichfield—I saw them—I employed Messrs. Cowdell &amp; Grundy, solicitors, 21, Abchurch Lane, they have now removed to Budge Row—October 1st was fixed for the settlement of the Bow concern—I went to Cowdell &amp; Grundy on that day, and the prisoner met me in Abchurch Lane, and began to tell me of his disappointments—on 3rd October I met the prisoner at Messrs. Sheppard &amp; Riley's—Mr. Sheppard discounted 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills, and the prisoner gave me an undertaking to retire the rest of the bills on the follow<lb/>ing Tuesday, amounting to 1150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the consideration for that was 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for furniture and fixtures, and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., premium for the lease of the premises, at a low rental for twenty-one years—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the undertaking the prisoner signed about retiring the bills—430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be in cash; you have the statement there—he did not produce any cash on the 3rd October him<lb/>self, but Sheppard and Riley discounted both of my bills, which produced nearly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and on the previous Saturday Mr. Sheppard had discounted 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my bills, making 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I made an allowance of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making altogether 1150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be given to me on, the Saturday—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the produce of the discount of the bills, was applied to the payment of running accounts—the bills were afterwards dishonoured, and the property is still liable—nearly 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. came into my hands on my own bills, but nothing from the prisoner whatever—I shall have to take them up, I am liable for them—I executed the assignment to Sheppard &amp; Riley, on 3rd October, and signed one lease for twenty-one years; but the other had to be sent into the country to the solicitor—possession of both colleges was given to the prisoner on the same day, and all the furniture was given up to him on the 3rd October—he made almost daily appointments after 3rd October with me—one day he wrote eight letters, three to me and the rest to my creditors—these are the bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are eleven of them—the three largest are, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 620<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that represents the balance of the purchase-money—that was the money obtained on the discounts—the other bills were given to me from time to time, when he put me off with a most positive assurance that he was going to pay a compensation for the legal expenses I was incurring—he gave me eight bills, each for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as a com<lb/>pensation for the loss I sustained by delay, and for legal expenses—I did not make use of them—two of them were discounted by Mr. Brewer—during the whole of this time the defendant was taking the school fees, so that he had nearly the whole value of the bills—the 19th October was the last date that any bill was given—he was then taking the school fees at both places—about 13th October he said something about expecting a</p>

               <p>South Hackney, for the sisters of the boys at the boys' school—the South Hackney school I sold on 15th September to an assistant, who has been with me five years—I had four schools on 15th September—the prisoner came to me as an assistant in August; I had six schools then—the sixth was at Burgess Hill, Finchley Road, and I had a ladies' school at Bow—I was principal of all those establishments—I describe myself as A. C. P., Associate of the College of Preceptors, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and F.S.A., here are the three diplomas—I was certificated at the head of the College at Chelsea, and had a full certificate for five subjects in drawing at the Science and Art Department, South Kensington, and a medal for suc<lb/>cessful teaching and drawing—the actual assistant at the East London College in August, 1868, was William Cook—he was first-class master, Mr. Dare was second or third-class, I do not remember which—Mr. Vignon was the French master—the prisoner was also a master, and Mr. Stacey—this prospectus was issued in 1868; that means December, 1867—it is the last book prospectus—it is true that I put forward to the public that Mr. Holt was the vice-principal at South Hackney, he has bought it of me since—I did not give these prospectuses to the prisoner as part of the proof of the re<lb/>spectability of my position; he may have taken them—I told the printer to make me a few more prospectuses—he did it right as far as the headings went but left the first page as it is for the list of masters—I can prove that my cus<lb/>tom was to tearthat leaf out before issuing the prospectuses—the last was made in December, 1867—it is true that Mr. Holt was vice-principal, he fully repre<lb/>sented me in my absence—this is a prospectus of 1867—Mr. Hall was a resident master at South Hackney, in 1867, as far as I can go, but I can show you a list of twenty masters, I cannot recollect all—Mr. Hind was a resident master, but not at South Hackney, nor was Mr. Prior—Mr. Plum<lb/>stead was at East London, and Mr. Coakley; Mr. Shone was at East London, not at South Hackney, but the two schools are within a mile and a half of each other—Professor Noirit visited both places—you will find him as a non-resident—he was French master at East London College—M. Vignon was with me between five and six years, and M. Noirit was dismissed and taken on again—there were over twenty assistants at one time at the different schools—when the prisoner came to me in August, I was only in debt for my current accounts—I believe they amounted to as near 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as possible, and by my cash-book I can show you that my current expenses were 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—besides that, I had raised money on mortgage very largely—the total value of my property was nearly 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the mortgages largely 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debts is exclusive of the money borrowed on mortgage—the whole amount is 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., subject to some of it being secured—the 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not secured, but there is the balance value of the property—I have no other property but the goodwill of my schools—the one in Finchley Road is valued at 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I am not aware that the gentleman who has valued the East London school has reported that the goodwill, and other things, are worth nothing, or recommended that it should not be bought—I did not ask the prisoner to raise money for me almost immediately after he came as master—he came, I think, between the 1st and 6th August—I did not, as early as 28th August, give him what was the commencement of a bill, in my writing, and ask him to get money on it—this is my writing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but it was never given to him; it is a bill which he must have purloined out of my desk—I cannot account for his doing so, any more than I can see any</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "Everything is very doubtful; do not part with your money; although he is a very industrious man, he is resting upon a thread.")—That report is so false, that Mr. Love was going to sue me in the County Court, though he had only cashed a bill for me a few days before; I dare say he is here to prove it—I did not get the prisoner to discount any bills for me before the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he was to take to the London and Westminster Bank—I cannot tell you the exact date, but not before the 12th September; that was the first time he spoke to me—on 19th September, he gave me these two bills, cashed by Mr. Shep<lb/>pard—I had given him the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill about the 14th or 15th; it was the Monday or Tuesday; I said the 13th—he tore it up because he said it must be in two separate bills of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—he did not say, "It is no use giving me this bill, the bills ought to be smaller, and you must make it appear that they are trade bills, given in payment"—I do not know whether I sent this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with those two bills—it has the appearance of my writing, and I said that it was, at the Police Court, but I know nothing whatever about it, and I should say that it is not my writing—the only hesitation I have is that he may have so influenced me as to write something which was misinterpreted—I mean, on my oath, to swear that it is not my writing—I distinctly swear that it cannot be, that it is not; I had no transaction of that kind; it is not mine—I know that there was a second mistake, and that Police Court was most cruel torture and degradation to me—I distinctly swear that this is not my writing—it was shown to me at the Police Court, and I was asked, "Is that your writing?" I said, quickly, "Yes," and was going to say something else, but was immediately stopped—I swore that I did not enclose two bills with it; you may refer to my deposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you swear this: "The letter produced, of 19th September, is in my hand; the bills produced were enclosed in the letter?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The latter part, I believe not; the former part, I unfortunately did—the whole thing was a mockery, from beginning to end—I believe I swore that the two bills did not go in the letter—they certainly did not go in the letter to the prisoner; they went by hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear they went by hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot go so far as that, they may have been enclosed in a note, and sent by hand—I had not before said "It is no use giving me bills without giving me something to show that they are trade bills," I would not be guilty of such a trick—this, "Will you</p>

               <p>kindly take the enclosed acceptance in payment," was not written by me—I can only say the way I was treated, I neither know what I said or did—when he came to me his wife was appointed head governess at the Poplar school—I gave both him and his wife cheques for their salary—those cheques have not been paid at all—they were given to them on the day they bear my signature, I think it was October 2nd or 3rd—they were not pre<lb/>sented till the day before his bankruptcy, 10th November—they were dis<lb/>honoured—they were not presented till I had disposed of two schools out of three—one cheque was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I mean to represent that the prisoner, who could not pay me, and who was trying to defraud me, kept those two cheques from 3rd October till 10th November—I had told him not to pay them in till after the 6th, the day of the undertaking to retire a large sum of money—I did ask him to hold them over till the 6th, three days—I did not swear at the Police Court, "I did not ask the prisoner not to use them, as I had no balance; "The question was only partly put down in the Court—I did not ask him to hold them over till the 10th November.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "I had a balance at my banker's to meet the cheques, I did not ask the prisoner not to use them," is that so or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After that ought to have been put, "Till November; he was only asked to hold them over till he paid me—I did ask him to hold them over till the 6th—the deposition is not correct—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition stated</hi>, "I did not ask the prisoner not to use them, as I had no balance; I told him to hold them over till the day he should pay me ")—my words were, "I did not ask the prisoner not to use them, "That is, not to pay them to his cheesemonger, or anybody—I had a master named Dare—I gave him a cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the London and County Bank, for his salary—that was about the same time; it was dishonoured—it was not presented till 17th October, after I had been de<lb/>prived of my income—Mr. Dare paid it to his upholsterer; but the prisoner took the rent of one of my houses, which he put against it—the prisoner, I believe, paid Mr. Dare's cheque for me; he wrote to me, and said that he had paid it—I know that he has paid it—I gave Mr. Cook a bill for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think—the prisoner did not put his name to that bill at my request, I did not see him—that bill has not been paid by me, but it is no fault of mine—I gave a bill to Alcock, and the prisoner put his name to that, too—Mr. Alcock did not refuse to take the bill without Mr. Haysman's name—that bill has not been paid, it fell due during my embarrassment—I never asked any of the other masters to get bills discounted for me—I offered the prisoner 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get bills discounted for me, because he would not pay a deposit, and I had thrown away other partners to get him—I paid Sheppar &amp; Riley for discounting bills for me, with a distinct under<lb/>standing from the defendant that he would repay me the money—I had an execution at Finchley, at the end of November or December, long after all these disappointments—there was not an execution at Finchley, in September, from the brewer and the baker—I cannot give you the date—they did not come in separately, but almost together, because they saw how things were going—I had a son of the prisoner's at my school for two years and a half, up to Midsummer, 1867—his bills were paid as regularly as possible by his grandfather—I knew nothing of his father—there was a very small profit, if any, upon the East London College when I sold it—there was about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year profit on the Finchley Road school—I had to borrow money when I built the premises—I had nearly 100 scholars at East Lon<lb/>don</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Sheppard &amp; Riley—I have known the defendant since September last, when he came to us about this matter—this letter of 16th September is signed by me, and I have no doubt I wrote it by the prisoner's direction—(<hi rend="italic">The first letter informed Mr. Haysman that having completed their inqutries, they could not sanction Mr. Brooke proceeding further with regard to a parnerthip, and requesting a reply as to his granting a lease for twenty-one years. The second stated that Mr. Brooke would purchase of Mr. Haysman the good-will of both schools, for</hi> 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and take the fixtures at a valuation, Mr. Haysman agreeing not to set up a school within three miles.

The third was dated October 28th, from the tame to the same, stating that it was settled that Mr. Sheppard was to go down to Brighton with him to settle the matter, and that he would authorize Mr. Sheppard to settle with them on Mr. Baxter's behalf, and requesting them to allow the matter to remain till Saturday evening, the</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>)—I remained at Brighton four days, but saw nothing of the Rev.

I am Vicar of Cheveley, in Berkshire—I know the prisoner, he became my National School master in January, 1868—he remained in my neighbourhood six months, up to July—I afterwards heard that he was performing the duties of a clergyman, but not in my parish, both preaching and performing service—he had said at the com<lb/>mencement of our interview that clergymen were sometimes schoolmasters—I said that I should object to that, at any rate it would not do in my parish—when I called his attention to what I had heard, he said that he had been ordained by Bishop Cotton, of Calcutta, who was drowned—I afterwards communicated with the Bishop of Oxford, and have a letter from him.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The copied letters from the prisoner to Mr. Haysman were her put in, one dated East London College, September 14th stated the conditions upon which he was willing to enter into partnership with Mr. Haystman, both then and at Finchley Road, the terms being</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l for Finchley Road, and</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">. for East London College. Another was dated Stains by College, September</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th stating that his solictors were making the necessary inquiries, and he would state on Saturday on what day he should be prepared to give a cheque for a deposit instalment. Another letter, dated September</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th stated that as soon as Mr. Sheppard was satis<lb/>fied with the securities, he, Brooke, would give a cheque for the purchase money. Another letter, dated Bayswater, September</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th declined a partnerthip, at his solicitors had the power, and refuted to allow if; but inquired upon what terms Mr. Haysman would tell the Bow business, requesting an answer at once, at the money wot ready, and he did not with it to lie idle. Another Utter was dated Charing Crott Station, September 25th, stating that Mr. Haysman being late at Bow yeserday, had thrown out all hit, Brooke's, arrangements for the discount matter, at Mr. Dobree had left town, and he was going to Northfeet to set him. Another letter, dated September 28th, requested Mr. Haysman to furnish him, Brooke, at once with a list of the college fees received in advance, and the name and address of everybody in the college.</hi>

I live at 11, Shaftesbury Street, Walwerth, and am porter to Mr. Arding—on the morning of 20th April Dennis came to me, about 6 o'clock, with a sack, and I put in the mixture which the officer found—it was food which the horse would not eat—I got it from another sack, and put it into Dennis's sack—Dennis said that Wykes told him to come down for the rough food, and I gave it to him—I had given it to him once before—Wykes gave me directions to give it him then—that was about ten days before—I had no directions to give this particular stuff—Wykes came that morning with Mr. Arding's horse, and brought some provision for the horse with him—he took part away and left the other part.</p>

I cautioned you about this, that you should never want it from her name again; that you would never have dominion over it"—he seemed to be very surprised; he hesitated for some time—I was in a hurry at the time, and just as I was about going away, he stopped me, and said, "Well, but could not someone else do it for Mrs. Chandler"—I said, "Yes, certainly, if you will get her to sign a power of attorney"—that ended the interview—I had business, and I was obliged to run over to the bank—I saw him again on 17th October, 1867, when this slip (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was prepared—the body of it is in my writing—I prepared it at Chamberlain's dictation or request—by</p>

What do you want? will you have the dividends?"—I said, "Yes, give me the dividends"—he then opened a drawer, and took out 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and four Egyptian bonds for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—he said, "Well, now, you take those; you won't take me"—I said, "I shall take both"—he said, "I shan't go unless you send round to Miss Chandler; I will tell you what I will do, if you like: I win transfer all the stock back again standing in the Bank of England, and then you won't take me"—he said, "I have sent round to Miss Chandler a letter offering her marriage"—at that time a woman came into the room with a letter in her hand—Chamberlain took it from her hand, and gave it to me, and said that was the letter he had sent round to Miss Chandler (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Mary.

(<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>) On 20th April I went with Mr. Pittard to 103, Hare Street, Bethnal Green, where I found Hutchinson—I told her the nature of the charge—she said she had done it to oblige Mr. Chamberlain, she had known him a number of years, she did not think there was anything wrong about it, if there was, she wished he had got somebody else to have done their dirty work—she produced this letter, and said that Mrs. Judd's son had brought it.

Have ready a lot of paper boxes by Wednesday, as my brother and I shall be in London, and shall want you to go with us early on Wednesday morning; the old woman would come herself, but is too ill.

I am sixty-three years of age—I have lived with the prisoner Chamberlain for twenty-three years—I lived at St. Andrew Street, Hertford, with him for a long period—I came to London with him in October 1866, and went to Mr. Hewkley's and had the stock transferred to me—I did not receive any of the dividends upon it after that—I never authorized anyone to receive them on my behalf—I know Judd; she is Chamberlain's sister—I don't know that Hutchinson is any relation of theirs—I know they were acquainted—no application was made to me by Judd or Chamberlain to attend to transfer this stock back to any other name; the matter was never mentioned to me at all—I am certain of that—it was never mentioned to me that I should go and transfer it—I never authorized anyone to go and make the transfer in my name—no one ever asked me for my authority to do so—I did not go to the Bank of England in April last, or direct anyone to go—I never was at the Bank of England to do any business—I believe on that day in April I was very ill in bed—I know Mr. Prance—I did not accompany him there, only after the forgery was com<lb/>mitted; I went with him about the stock very lately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 7, Old Kent Road—the prisoner was in my employment for about five months—I slept in the top room, and the prisoner in the room underneath—on 4th April, I and my wife went to bed at the usual hour, a little before 11 o'clock—I left the prisoner in his room previous to my going up stairs—somewhere about 4 o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by a blow at the side of the head—I was not sensible; I could not move—I heard my wife screaming that we were being murdered—she had not left the bed then—I did not see the prisoner—I was bleeding—I lay there till I came to my senses a little, and when I got out of bed my wife was at the window, calling, "Police!" and "Murder!"—there was no light—there was a chair, which I always place at my bedside, with my watch and the candlestick on it; that got turned over—I was feeling about the floor for the candle, and I laid my hand upon the poker, which was on the floor—my wife called to me to keep to the door, and she was calling, "Police!"—it was not many seconds before the police came, and broke the shop door open—I did not see the prisoner at all, I was too much stunned—I was not aware that I was bleeding till I got out of bed—the policeman came up to our room, and brought the prisoner up with him—that must have been a few minutes after the occur<lb/>rence—the policeman said, "This is you that has done this"—I believe he said he knew nothing about it; that was all he said—he was taken into custody—I saw this carving-knife found outside my bedroom door, on the landing—it had been used at supper the night before—the prisoner had</p>

               <p>supper with us—there was blood upon the knife when found—I found this hammer just outside the back door, on the ground—it had been kept in the out-house since I used it last; that was on Good Friday, about a fortnight before—the prisoner had been to that out-house the night before this occurrence, at the time he was coming in, just before going to bed, a few minutes before 11 o'clock—I met him at he was coming from the out-house, he was at one door, and I at the other—I did not see whether he had anything in his hand—he had gone near the place where I afterwards found the hammer—about six weeks before this, I had accused the prisoner of something, rightly; but after some discussion about the matter, I consented to forgive him, and that matter passed away—on the night of 3rd April, the very night before this happened, I said to him, "Frank you will either hare to write or go to your father, and tell him to give you a suit of clothes, for the clothes you are wearing are not fit for you to wear, and I consider your father ought to do his duty by you, for the way in which he sent you here, was not a be<lb/>coming way at all for a father to send a lad out to any employment—do you think he will give you a suit of of clothes?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Well, you can tell him that if he does not, I shall have to send you away"—he made no answer—that was somewhere about 10 o'clock; he had had his supper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Except those two small matters, you had no quarrel or dispute with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my wife and I live very happily, we do not quarrel—I know inspector Turpin—my wife and I used to quarrel, but we do not now; we did before Christmas, we have exchanged blows—I have broken the crockery—on Christmas day I sent the plum pudding into the fire, and part of a cheese after it—I have been violent when I have been in drink, but I have not taken drink since Christmas, thank God—I used occa<lb/>sionally to drink too much, but I was never a drunkard, it used to effect me—my wife has left my house more than once, and gone for protection elsewhere, to her mother's—that'has not been since Christmas—at Christmas, she went to her mother's, and stayed a day or two, but not since—I have not been drunk since Christmas—I took a pledge.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife—on 4th April we went to bed about 11 o'clock—I was disturbed at 4 o'clock in the morning with a stab on my chin—I put up my hand, and I received another on my finger, and that roused me up—I saw somebody near the bed, it was the prisoner, I think, at least, I am sure—it was just breaking day when I rote up in the bed—I screamed, "Murder!"—I looked down, and saw my husband was bleeding from a wound in his head—the person who was in the room was near the bed; he was standing over me, aiming blows at me—I did not see with what—I threw out my arms, and that was how it was I received the blows on my hands and arms—the prisoner then left the room—I am not able to say positively that it was the prisoner—I then jumped out of bed, flew to the window, and called to the police—my husband jumped out of bed just as I rushed to the window—a policeman came, not many minutes afterwards—he broke a panel in the door, and got into the house, and came up to our bed-room—the person in the room did nut say anything—he had his trowsers and shirt on.</p>

On 4th April, at a few minutes to 4 o'clock, I heard cries of "Police!" and saw Mrs. Nicholls looking out of the window of 7, Old Kent Road—I knocked in the panel of the shop door, and got into the house—as I went up stairs, I observed that the windows were securely fastened—I went into the first-floor bed-room, and there found the prisoner—he was in the act of taking off his trowsers—I asked who he was, and what he wanted there—he said he lived there—I then went up to the second floor, and there saw Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls, both bleeding—Mr. Nicholls was bleeding from the right temple, and Mrs. Nicholls from the chin and hand—I found this knife in the lobby, outside the bed-room door—there was blood upon it—all the things in the room confused and knocked about, and tumbled down; chairs and tables and all were knocked down—the watch was lying outside on the landing, and the chain under the door—I told the prisoner I should have to take him into custody for feloniously wounding and attempting to murder Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I found the doors of the house, back and front, all securely fastened—I went round, and tried all the windows and doors, and found them all fastened.</p>
