In consequence of a letter we received from a tallow chandler, we suspected that we were robbed of fat to some amount. On the 19th of last month I saw the prisoner take out a quantity of fat in a bag; I went after him and saw him selling this fat in Mr. Briant's shop, a tallow chandler in Greek street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same fat. - A. I am sure. I followed him and the fat; I have no doubt but the fat I saw him take was the fat I saw him selling.</p>

               <p>Witness. As he passed me, he said you see it looks very brown; I saw it was brown at the top; I took no further notice of it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BRIANT. Q. You are a tallow chandler. A. Yes. On Saturday I bought the fat of the prisoner, I gave him eight shillings for it; the top of the fat was what was allowed them, the refuse of the skins; at the bottom of that was suet; I gave him three pence a-pound for it. If I had seen the bottom I should have allowed him sixpence a pound.</p>

               <p>Q. I understand you have a dove cote in your yard under which is your coach house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 17th of February was your dove cote perfectly safe when you and your family retired to rest. - A. It was. In the morning when I got up I discovered one of the windows of the pigeon house had been broken open; in consequence of that I went to Mr. Fox's, the Old Hat, as I very well knew a great many pigeons were shot at there.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is that from your house. - A. About seven miles from my house in the road to London. I saw Mr. Fox, I enquired of him whether he had bought any pigeons that morning; he acknowledged that he had, about six o'clock; I think he said five dozen and four; in consequence of that I sent Laban, my man, there immediately to identify them.</p>
               <p>- LABAN. Q. You are a servant to Mr. Pope. A. Yes. On the morning of the 18th of February, about a quarter before seven in the morning I discovered my master's dove cote had been broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many pigeons there were on the over night. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more than five dozen. - A. Yes, a good many more.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any body have got to the window. - A. Not without a long ladder; there was a ladder in the rick yard.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean the ladder in the rick yard would have reached that window if it had been set up against it. - A. Yes. When I got in the pigeon house there were several pigeons in the pigeon house; the top of it was stuffed with hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it so stuffed of a night. - A. No; only as the thieves this night stopped them for the convenience of taking them; I informed Mr. Pope that the dove house had been broken open; I went to the Old Hat, I enquired for 
               <persName id="t18080406-2-person65">Thomas</persName>
             the ostler; he shewed me some pigeons in a basket, they were alive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your pigeons all wild, or some tame and some wild. - A. Some tame and some wild; they were a mixed breed; by that reason I knew them. There were two pigeons that I knew, I found them at the Old Hat, they were a lead colour, and feathered nearly down to the toe; I had missed those as a part that were taken. I turned two of the pigeons out, and one was shot at.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever get any back. - A. No.</p>

On the Saturday afternoon I found Griffin at Hounslow, I told him for what I apprehended him; his wife said that she knew that he was not with them when the pigeons were sold at the Old Hat. Griffin lodged in Norris's house.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Norris. - A. It is a small shop, with a few things in the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Pope call on you on the morning of the 18th of February. - A. Yes. On that morning a little after six, I bought five dozen and four pigeons of the prisoner Neale; I gave him fourteen shillings a dozen. I said to him I have heard of a number of depredations, I hoped there were nothing of this kind, he fell a laughing and said you may depend these came from about thirty miles up the country; Mr. Pope's man brought two out that he knew to be his master's pigeons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Neale before. - A. Yes, I had bought pigeons of him before, at various times.</p>

Yes, both of them; they were in company together, they came in I believe about three o'clock in the afternoon; they staid about an hour and a half, there were four of them two of the four went out, Griffin and another went out, and staid more than an hour. Neale staid in my house and another man; Griffin came back after they were gone, and asked where his partners were; I said they were both gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the two prisoners at the bar were two of the four that where at your house on that day. - A. Yes.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. What are you. - A. I am a labourer, I live at Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company of the two prisoners, and a man of the name of Jakeman. - A. Yes, we started from Hounslow at one o'clock in the day; we all went together to Hillingdon, we there stopped at the Vine, and had some victuals and drink, afterwards Samuel Norris and I went out, and we passed the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prosecutor's house before. - A. No, we passed by there to see whether there was a dove house or not; we returned to the Vine, then Jakeman and I came out, and left Neale and Norris, to pay the reckoning; Jakeman and I passed by the prosecutor's house, and gave another look, we expecting the two prisoners were following of us, they were not, we went back to the Vine, they were not there; we found them at the Adam and Eve; we all stopped at the Adam and Eve till the landlord told us it was time to shut the house up.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was that. - A. Between ten and eleven; we then left the house and went to Hayes to a dove cote up a lane opposite the Adam and Eve; not finding a ladder to that dove cote we went back to Hillingdon, it was then about one o'clock; there was a light in the prosecutor's house, we went into the prosecutor's yard, we got some hay and laid down in the waggon till two o'clock, then we took the ladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the ladder. - A. I think Jakeman and Neale. I took the hay; we then set the ladder to the dove cote; Neale took the hay up to stuff the holes of the dove cote, then we shifted the ladder to the other side of the prosecutor's house that we might not be seen, I went up the ladder first and pulled some tiles off, I found I could not get in by reason of some rafters. Neale pulled out some laths from the window and got in; he then handed me out at different times five dozen and five pigeons; one pigeon was smothered before he got to the bottom of the ladder, then there were five dozen and four.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you with the dead pigeon. - A. I carried it home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live yourself. - A. I lodged at Samuel Norris's at Hounslow. We put the pigeons in three bags and two baskets that we had with us and came on the road to Windmill hill near Hanwell. Norris and I then delivered the pigeons to Jakeman and Neale.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How were these pidgeons to be disposed of. - A. They were to be taken to Mr. Fox at the Old Hat. I received the share of my money; Jakeman paid me. I asked Neale if Mr. Fox knew how we got the pigeons, he said yes, he did not care how we got them; he said he had described to him where the dove cotes were.</p>

               <p>Court. What pieces were they. - A. Two half crowns; I went up stairs to bed, and found they were gone; I saw her mark them and put them in her pocket just before going up to bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You went to bed. On the next day what did you do. - A. In the morning I got Mr. Mason the officer; I told him the circumstance; we went up stairs and knocked at the prisoner's door, she opened the door; I told her that I had lost money from time to time, and I had suspicion that she had taken it. Mr. Mason asked her whether she had any objection to shew what she had got in her pocket; she pulled out some money, a knife, and a key from her pocket; then she hesitated about pulling out any more; Mr. Mason told her he must search her; then she pulled out a purse; Mason took the money from the purse, he took out the two half crowns; I immediately knew them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Were these half crowns that were taken out of the parse the half crowns that you had so marked and put into the pocket of your wife. - A. Yes, I am sure of it; upon their being found, the prisoner said it was her own money; I desired Mason to search further, I was sure there was more money; he went to search a box, which the niece said was her's; the prosecutor, when she found Mr. Mason was going to open it, said it was her's; in the box was a little red trunk, containing a quantity of silver, and a one pound note in a paper box; in a silk glove was a large quantity of guineas and some notes; there were two of the notes with my initials on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is not pretended that these notes were lost at the same time, the only loss that evening was two half crowns; it is not affected to be said that any thing else was lost at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. When you searched the house did you miss any of the goods. - A. I went up stairs, I missed two beds, two bolsters, two pillows, six blankets, three counterpanes, two white and one coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the two beds. - A. I dare say I could not buy them for fifteen pounds; the counterpanes are worth three guineas; one was quite new, it never had been on the bed nor wetted.</p>

I was going down the street; passing her house towards Russel square (it was about half past six in the evening), I saw two men coming out of her street door, with large bundles on their backs, they appeared white, as if they had counterpanes over them; each man had a large bundle; one man was a taller man than the other; I think the tallest man came out first; Bradey was the shortest man. They went up King street, toward Holborn; I passed the short man, he throwed the bed down in King street, I passed him; the tallest man passed on; I pursued him, he was about two hundred yards before me, he was going as I conceived towards Holborn; I went down King street, the way I thought he went, however I lost him. I returned to the house No. 39, and saw the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of looking at the tall man, so as to know his person. - A. I did not look at his person; from what I saw of him I believe he is much about the same size as the tall man.</p>

I did, I saw a boy coming out with a bundle wrapped up in a shirt; I stopped him and took him into the parlour where he had come from; Bradey was in that parlour he was getting out of bed. I examined the bundle, I found it contained a crow and three double Skeleton keys.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called no witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon the evidence of Mrs. Kindsey there can be no doubt but what a burglary was committed in her house by some persons after she had left it locked, by stealing in it two feather beds and other articles; you find that she proves most distinctly that she locked up the house between five and six, when she returned between seven and eight she found it broken open. The question for you is whether you are satisfied the prisoner was or was not, the other man that was concerned in this burglary.</p>

I turned round, I saw the prisoner close to my back, he ran off immediately, and I followed him; a gentleman of the name of Rogers was walking along with me, he joined in the pursuit and caught him. I asked him for my handkerchief, he denied having it. I have never seen the handkerchief since.</p>
               <p>MR. ROGERS. I was walking along with Mr. Hutchinson in the City road; he turned round sharp he said he had lost his handkerchief. Mr. Radford stopped him; he got away from his hands; I pursued him and took him. I was present when he was searched; nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the handkerchief go from the person of Mr. Hutchison did you. - A. No.</p>

             turned round, looked at me, and ran away. Brown was on the left hand side of me, and Harcourt on the right. I followed Harcourt till he got a little way down the street, I took hold of his collar, he dropped these two pieces; Rice was behind me, he picked them up. Harcourt then squatted down on the ground; I called him by name, I said it is of no use, you must go to the office, he said he would be d - d if he would; he then wrenched himself from me, and ran three or four yards from me, I caught him again; as soon as I caught him the second time I heard something drop on the stones, that I picked up the next morning, Rice came up and catched hold of him by the other side, we took him into the public house secured him and searched him; in his pockets I found a small key and a knife; after he was searched I borrowed a candle and lanthorn of the landlord of the public house, to see if I could find what I heard drop, I could not find any thing that night; I went early the next morning; in the channel in the mud I found this skeleton key; I took it to Mr. Humphries' shop, which is not fifty yards from the place. I gave the key to Mason; he tried the lock of the door, it unlocked it very easy.</p>

            . I was of the opposite side of the way to what they were, I ran over the way seeing a bustle; I saw Brown in the hands of Valentine. I tried the picklock key the next morning, it unlocked the door with a great deal of ease.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. They are above the value of forty shillings. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their counsel, called no witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>COURT. There are two things for your consideration, if the crime of stealing to the amount of forty shillings is made out; or whether this was his dwelling house, and whether it was a house in which people slept; he tells you he employed these men, and directed them to sleep there, neither of these servants are here: another thing for your consideration, is, whether they were taken at that time of night so as to constitute it a burglary. At what period of time, between ten in the morning and seven at night these goods were taken from his dwelling house is not stated. Harcourt after he is taken, is found throwing something away; in the morning the officer told you he found this skeleton key, which being applied, it was capable of opening the outward door at that time of night: this key was thrown away about fifty yards from the shop; you are to form your conclusion, that it took place at that time of night. Night had commenced when these men were taken; it is left for you to say whether it was taken after dark; it is left in a state for you to infer, that if they were but fifty yards from the place that it was recently committed. The next question for your consideration, supposing these circumstances to be so, it would be, whether these goods to the amount of forty shillings were stolen in the dwelling house. In the dwelling they were at ten o'clock in the morning; if you give credit to this person, he has told you he saw all his linen there, and in proper order; and in the evening when he came again, he says he saw they had been disturbed, his attention having been drawn to it. And he has said upon this linen being shewed to him, two of which being shewed to him which dropped from Harcourt, and the other two by Brown, which the officers have produced; and told you were concealed under their clothes, and the prisoners they were endeavouring to rescue themselves from the custody in which they were. Mr. Humphries has said they have his marks upon them, and that they are above the value of forty shillings; so then there is no doubt but they were the identical things that were in his shop: upon their being taken, one of them dropped a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060009"/>skeleton key, would unlock the door; the other is at that time assisting in carrying part of the property, which had been stolen away, through the probable means of that key. If you are not satisfied, the next question for your ultimate consideration will be, whether they were stolen by them at all; we have no evidence before us how they got in, unless they got in through the means of that false key into the dwelling house. If you should be of opinion that they got into the house by means of the false key, you will find them guilty of stealing in the dwelling house. On the other hand, if you are not satisfied, and are of opinion that this house of the prosecutor's has not been sufficiently proved to be his dwelling house, you will in that case find them guilty of simple larceny.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About eight o'clock at night I left my mother, she gave me four shillings to buy tea, sugar, and so forth; this boy said if I would give him change for half a crown he would give me something to drink; then he asked me to change a seven shilling piece; I told him I could not; then he said he had lost a seven shilling piece; I said go and find it. He came all that way for me to go and get a candle for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. In order to constitute this a highway robbery, it is necessary that violence should be used, that the money, or whatever it was, must be taken by violence; the lad has told you that his hand was forced open by the prisoner, she being too strong for him.</p>

I and Pim walked down to see what they were after: we saw the prisoner at the bar run across the road with that cask across his shoulder, he ran across into New rents.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he that cask on his shoulder when he went into Mr. Hall's. - A. That I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any cask when he was looking into the shoemaker's shop. - A. No, he ran up New rents. I stopped him in the court that leads into Mouldmaker's row; when he saw I followed him he instantly threw it down and with a great struggle we secured him; we took him to the counter; I had the cask, it was full of liquor containing peppermint; while I went in with the prisoner to Newgate some person unknown opened the off door of the coach and threw the cask down and broke in one of the staves of the head, and spilled about five gallons of the liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. You say while you were handing the prisoner out of the coach into Newgate, some person threw the cask of peppermint out. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot accuse him of that. - A. I said some person unknown</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him come out. - A. Yes, they staid in a few minutes, how long I cannot say; they came out together and went across the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to them. - A. About thirty or forty yards; when they crossed the way we went down, knowing them to be people of bad character; when we went down we saw the prisoner run across the way with a cask upon his shoulder; we followed him took him, and the cask to the counter; the cask was full.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. How do you know it was full. - A. Because it was so heavy, and by its sound it appeared to be quite full, and I know a great deal ran out by Newgate door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. That might be and yet the cask not full.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do. In the month of August he told me to make a bedstead for him; it was made, and my man carried it home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner after it was carried home. - A. Yes, I saw him at his house in St. Catherine's lane, Wapping; he then said I have a quantity of sacking, it has been brought by a relation for me to dispose of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060012"/>Prisoner. I deny that.</p>
               <p>Court. I know you deny it because you say you are not guilty, you deny the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Witness. He said if I had no objection, he knew they would suit me, to take them in exchange for the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. What was the amount of the bedstead; your charge. - A. About five pound six shillings; I never saw him before he applied to me for the bedstead; when the first bedstead went home, he ordered another, he said I have some new sacking; and I will look them out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was to be the amount of the second bedstead. - A. Three pounds ten shillings; I told him I had no objection to the sacking, and my man took part of the sacking.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you receive them of him. - A. Yes, I was there and he was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. What quantity of sacking did you receive. - A. Here is his receipt I received; in the whole thirteen pound one shilling, is the amount of the whole of the sacking; when I had the sacking first there was nothing suspicious, but when the second parcel came home they were much out of the common size; it was such as I imagined a person would not send to him to dispose of, because they were things that were used perhaps once in a twelvemonth; when my business led me into the city I called upon Mr. North. I called several times, I did not see him till the latter part of the year. I knew I should see him at the latter part of the year; he is a customer to me, and I am to him; not having an opportunity of seeing Mr. North, I wrote him a letter giving him information that I believed a person in his employ was not honest.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you finally do with the second part of the sacking. - A. Part I used and part I sent to Mr. North by my porter. The prisoner told me he worked for Mr. North.</p>

Yes, on the 17th of March; when the prisoner was brought there three sackings were there, and Mr. Frith, Mr. North's partner was there; Mr. Frith, myself and the constable, were together in the accompting house; Mr. Frith desired the prisoner might be sent in; when the prisoner entered, Mr. Frith said, Mr. Prosser, I have sent for you on a business which I do not understand, and which I am unwilling to believe; pray where did you get this sacking, pointing to the sacking, it lay before us; the prisoner hesitated, and at length said they were brought to him; but said Mr. Frith they have our own marks on them; you sold them to Mr. Wiltshire, he suspected that you could not get them honestly; he informed us and sent them home; Mr. Barker can swear to our marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Barker. - A. Mr. North's apprentice; and I would rather have suspected any man than you, who have been in the house so long, we may have been robbed this twenty years; while Mr. Frith was addressing the prisoner, the latter cast his eyes over the sacking as if disappointed, on discovering the marks, his countenance altered, he stammered out I confess; then says the constable (Murphy) stepping forward, you must go along with me; I saw the prisoner, accompanied by the constable, leave the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any one behind you. - A. I do not know; I found myself very much entangled with the prisoner at the bar, in the front of me; I immediately clapped my hand upon my pocket, and missed my pocket book; I seized him by the collar immediately, I said I had lost my pocket book, I told him he had got it; I immediately saw the pocket book fly from his hand, into the street, under the horses; at that moment another man rushed in between us and broke my hold of him; I never lost sight of him till he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running away. - A. He was stopped about two yards off; the coachman of the Clapton coach assisted in getting the papers up, and the pocket book was given into the constable's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. With whom were you walking with at the time. - A. A young woman of the name of Stevens. I have very little knowledge of her, she had hold of my arm.</p>

               <p>HANNAH STEVENS. As I was crossing Fenchurch street a man knocked me on my bosom; he immediately said, I have lost my pocket book; I saw the pocket book; I saw the pocket book under the horses feet; the pocket book was picked up by a little boy, it was given to the captain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Who was it struck you. - A. The prisoner struck me with his left hand; it nearly shoved me down.</p>

The prisoner came in the mill house, and stopped there a good bit by the post; when I fetched a bit of hay for the mill horse, he went away; there were nobody in the mill house but me and the prisoner.</p>

I do not look to him to make up any loss. If I get a thousand pounds at the close of the year I give him fifty pounds, besides the salary; his name is put on the bills to those customers that he used to deal with alone; that is to induce them to deal with me.</p>

             public house. - A. I only stopped there to drink a pint of beer with the landlord; coming out I met James Burke, I gave him something to drink; I drank part of a glass of gin with him, and I tasted part of a glass of brandy and shrub at a chandler's shop, along with some old customer's of mine; then I went down Fleet market with the prisoner into Fleet street; we stopped at the Angel, I drank a glass of gin and peppermint, and throwed the other in the saveall; I drank there only one glass, I paid for two; then I went up Fleet street, I called at Mr. Radley's the brandy merchant, to order some goods; I cannot say whether I drank any thing at Mr. Radley's or not; I tasted some shrub and water. We then went up to Wych street, we had a glass of mulled wine in the new mulled wine shop; from there I went to Mr. Kendrick's in Drury lane; we had there two shillingsworth of rum and water between five of us, then I went to the Black Dog.</p>

               <p>Q. What had you there. - A. Two small glasses of brandy and some cold water; after that I treated the prisoner with another glass at the Compasses; I had none there.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you were pretty drunk. - A. No, I was not, I was in liquor certainly; I was merry, I could walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not reckon any body drunk that can walk. - A. Yes I do; when I came out of the Compasses I was going home; the prisoner was about two paces behind me, he catched hold of this arm, I felt him put his hand into my waistcoat pocket; as soon as he felt me endeavouring to put my hand into my waistcoat pocket, he put his elbow against me, and with his other hand he shoved me down in the middle of the street, and then he ran away. When I got up I put my hand in my pocket, I found I had lost my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you missed. - A. I cannot tell exactly; I had two guineas, six or seven half guineas, about six, seven, or nine seven shilling pieces; I had felt this money at the Black Dog, I saw it there when I was paying for the liquor.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 29th of February; I found none of the property on him that the prosecutor could speak to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, my poverty prevents me from having counsel to defend me. I have every reliance upon your lordship's humanity to ask these questions of the prosecutor, which I have no doubt will state my innocence.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. The house that you went to first in Drury lane was the Compasses, Kendrick's house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Kendrick when he desired you to have some more rum and water; that you had no money. - A. I do not recollect; I might say so in a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you apply to the prisoner to lend you a shilling at the George. - A. I did; he lent me a shilling for the purpose of paying for the rum and water; I did not pay it with his money, I borrowed a shilling out of a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand how you will force in that - I ask you now, upon your oath, whether upon the man applying to you for more rum and water, you did not tell them you had no more money, and whether you did not borrow a shilling of him to pay for the rum and water. - A. I believe I did.</p>

            . On the 27th of September the prisoner came to my father's shop in the name of Mr. Wild of Enfield; he said he wanted fifteen pound of pickled pork.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pork taken from you. - A. Yes, my father cut him fifteen pound of pickled pork; he told my father that I was to take it along with him into Bishopsgate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father consent that you should take it to Bishopsgate street. - A. Yes, I took it in the tray; he said my father should give change for a pound note; the price of the pork came to twelve shillings and sixpence; the change was seven shillings and sixpence; he said the cook should pay me; he took me into a shop and gave me a twopenny bologna sausage; then he went on further to a public house and called for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060016"/>quartern of anniseed; he gave me one glass, then he went into Shoreditch and up a court, and told me to wait till he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at that time taken the pork from you. - A. He was taking the pork from my shoulder, I told him he must not take it, I must go with him; he said he must take it or else they would think he was drunk; he took it from me, carried it up the court, I followed him, he let it fall in the mud, then I took it again; he took me further up some other courts and down a street, and came into Shoreditch again; then he went down a court with bushes in it; I held him and cried.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the pork from you. - A. Yes, in this court. I asked him to go into a public house and buy a penny candle; I got him into the public house and then he took the pork away again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never lost it. - A. No, I got the pork again; I took it off his shoulder when he was standing in the public house to get the candle; I went out of doors, he wanted to swindle me out of the pork and the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer you the one pound note or the change. - A. No. I cried outside of the door, and at last a gentleman came up to me. I told him what was the matter; a watchman was going by, I gave charge of him. He never offered me the seven and sixpence; he told my father he bought the pork for his master.</p>
               <p>- HILLIARD. On the 27th of February, I was coming home, near one in the morning. Going along Bethnall green road, where I live this boy, was standing just by the turnpike, he was crying. I asked him what was the matter, the boy told me this man had been buying some meat of his father, and he had got seven shillings and sixpence change; the boy got the meat, and he said he could not get the change from him, and he said he must not go home without the change; when I saw how the business was, I said you had better give charge of Elam. The only complaint that he made was not paying the one pound note, or returning him the change; he did not charge him with stealing the meat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live in White's gardens, Bethnall green road; I brought the lad there with the meat, I asked his father to give him the change, not to give it to me; he said it made no odds which of us had it; when he came to this place it was dark, he did not like to go down; I had no intention of taking it from him; I sent in no name; he asked me if I knew Mr. Wild of Enfield, I said I did.</p>

On the day before this transaction happened, I had three five pound notes in my pocket book. On that day I went to London, I returned between eleven and twelve at night; I unlocked my door and went into my own room, and directly I went into my own room the prisoner called me. I went into the prisoner's room to get a light, I sat down and she asked me if I would sleep with her; I thought as it was very cold and her bed was warm, I would; she got out of bed and untied my things; I went to bed. The prisoner untied my pockets and put them in the chair, she went across the room and shut my door; in the course of the night I awoke, I might have been asleep two hours; I always put my pockets under my head. I felt for my pockets and missing them, I asked her where she had put them; the prisoner said they were very safe, they were in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say for what purpose you wanted your pockets. - A. Not then, afterwards I said I would get a little water, or a little tea; I had a bad cold and sore throat; she said I should not get out of bed she should get it herself; she got out of bed and gave me a little water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make tea for you. - A. Yes; after that I asked her to get an apple out of my pockets with an intent to get my pockets; she said I should not have the apple it would hurt me, she would get up and make me a cup of tea. I desired her not, but she would she lit the fire made tea and gave me two or three cups of tea; after that she came to bed again. I did not sleep at all afterwards, I said I would get up and go into my own bed, on purpose to get my pockets; the pockets were then on the chair by her bedside where she had put them, she told me to compose myself and go to sleep.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not say any thing about your pockets. - A. Not then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Q. Did you go to your own bed. - A. No, I said I had got a very sore throat, I would have half a pint of raisin wine; she laid a bit and said I will have coffee for breakfast, she said she would get me the raisin wine; a little after seven o'clock in the morning she got up; I said I would get up too, then I asked her to give me my pockets; as she sat by the side of the bed she gave me my pockets. I put my hand in my pocket, I found I had lost my book and three five pound notes; she got off the bed and catched her own pockets and put them on, she said do not make yourself uneasy you will find them again. I had them in my pockets when I come here; then she pulled the clothes off the bed with a pretence to look for the notes. I told her they could not come there out of my pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in your pocket book or were they loose. - A. In a small pocket book; I went into my own room, the prisoner came in after me, she took a half pint bottle from the shelf, she went to the oil shop at Islington, opposite of my house, for some raisin wine; she came out from there and went to the grocers shop; I watched her out of my window, she went to the oil shop again and brought home the raisin wine, and two ounces of coffee; she made breakfast and drank two cups of coffee. A gentleman came out of the country, I told him I was very uneasy, I had lost three five pound notes; the gentleman was going to take the number of the notes, he thought I recollected the number of the notes, I did not; it frightened the prisoner, she went out; I sent for a constable, I followed her with the constable and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060017"/>he apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was apprehended what did she say. A. She had not got them; I was present when she was searched, there was five pounds fifteen shillings found upon her; I asked her as we were going down the street to our home, how she could say she did not take them, when she had changed one at the grocer's shop; she told me, if I would say nothing to any body she would tell me all about it; she begged to me in my own room; I said tell me what you have got to say; I sent to the grocer's, I found she had changed one five pound note at the grocer's shop; she told me she had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the number of that note. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot distinguish that note to be your own. - A. I cannot; she told me she had taken the liberty of taking my notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you come home very much intoxicated in liquor, you said you had been with a gentleman in a coach. - A. I did not; I came home with my sister.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your shop at any time. - A. Yes, on the 10th of March, near eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live. - A. I live nearly opposite of the prosecutrix in High street, Islington; the prisoner was served by the young man, with sugar and coffee to the amount of four shillings and four pence; I was out of doors, I was called in the shop to change a five pound note; she gave me the note; I asked her what name I was to put on it; she said Roberts, over the way; I put down Mrs. Roberts High street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the shop for two ounces of coffee, I gave him the five pound note; he asked me the name, I said Roberts. Mrs. Roberts came home about half past twelve at night; I heard her come up stairs, I said is that you Mrs. Roberts; she said yes; I said here is a light; when she came in my room, she said she would have something to drink; I said I have nothing to give you to drink; she said I have had such a sprig. I wish you had been with me, she had been to the Circus with a gentleman, but there is no harm; I sat upright in bed and helped off her peliffe; I said Mrs. Roberts will you go in your own bed or will you lay down here; she said I will come to bed with you; she took her pockets off, wound the strings round, and laid them in the chair; she said her husband always knew when she was in that state because she talked so much; she said she could not go to sleep; at half after one I gave her some cold water; she laid down again, then she said she had a pain in her stomach; I asked her if she would have some tea; no, she said there is an apple in my pocket I will have that; I said you have the stomach ache, do not have that; I got up, made a cup of tea, and gave it her; she laid down again, she said she wished it was time to get up, she would have a little raisin wine; I said when you get up a cup of coffee will do you good; when we got up she said I have lost my pocket book; I said surely the person you was with last night has not taken it from you in a joke; no, she said he was too much of a gentleman; she laid down sixpence and I got the wine, and I made breakfast for her, and before we had done breakfast a gentleman came in; she asked if I was going to town; I said I was going to Wormwood street. I went to town and on my return Mr. Lack met me,</p>

            They were dressed in brown clothes; I heard the knocker of Mr. Hill's door go once, which caused me to pay attention. I heard it lock and unlock several times afterwards. I went down the alley ten or fifteen yards and saw two more who were talking together, one of them had a drab coat, and the other a light drab; they crossed the way and came up towards Mr. Hill's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where they went to. - A. I did not, I did not stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the other two went, who were standing at the door. - A. I did not; I went strait up to my own shop. I sent Mr. Skinner to acquaint Mr. Hill.</p>

               <p>Q. Then did you and Mr. Hill and William Hall come up together to the house. - A. We did, Sir; when we came up to the door William Hall, Mr. Hill's servant, unlocked the door and found it fast on the inside, it was bolted; we were there a minute, or hardly that; we heard some people running down stairs. I suppose in putting the key in the door some noise was made, of course we knew it was two or three by the footsteps, they made a great noise by running down; they wanted to be out very quick; the door at the top was opened big enough to get my arm in, or another man's arm through; the top inside bolt was forced; Mr. Hill's young man turned the lock at the same time, or else I believe they would have pushed out; they ran down stairs for the purpose.</p>

               <p>Skinner. The young man turned the key at that moment; you may depend upon it they would all have got away if they had not been prevented.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have let them if you could have helped it. - A. Truly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send Mr. Hill then for assistance. - A. I believe a person there did.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Hill was gone what then. - A. We entered the house; we forced the door open, there were a great number of people, we thought we were strong enough, we forced the door open and got in; I was the second person that got in, William Hall was the first; when I got in I laid hold of Moore; I found him standing against the door, I never left him after I found him, till I left him in St. Sepulchre's watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe. - A. I observed him shifting very much; I thought he wanted to pull out a pistol, he could do nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing drop from him. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by shifting. - A. He was feeling in his breeches and waistcoat pockets. I thought he had a pistol there, and I thought it my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060021"/>duty to take care of that; I thought myself in an awkward situation, I kept hold of him till I delivered him in the watchhouse.</p>

I am a grocer; I was passing down George street, Hanover square, I observed the prisoner come out of Dr. Pearson's house with this knife box before him, his great coat covering part of it; from his apparent agitation I supposed he had stolen it; I told the woman servant of it at the top of the area steps, that I thought he had stole it from their house; she informed the butler, he went up into the dining room and found it was gone; the next witness came up, he ran down Maddox street, and saw the prisoner; he came back, and informed me; we pursued the prisoner and brought him back to Dr. Pearson's, with the knife box.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Walters; I was coming down George street, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock on Saturday the 20th of February; I met the prisoner with this knife case before him, about twenty yards from Dr. Pearson's door; seeing the last witness look after him, I particularly suspected him.</p>
               <p>Q. You took such particular notice of him that you are certain he is the man. - A. I am certain he is the man; when I came up to the last witness, having suspicion, I asked him; he said he saw him come out of the door; I pursued the prisoner, I catched him in Bruton street, I asked him where he got the knife case; he said he picked up the knife case at a door in Bruton street; I took the knife case from him; Mr. Prosser came up; we took him back to Dr. Pearson's; that is the same case I took from him.</p>

Yes, she was larger than general, I thought she was pregnant. On Thursday, about five o'clock, to the best of my recollection, she ate her dinner and complained of a pain in her stomach; her mistress and the family went out that evening and left three of my mistress's servants in the house; the prisoner wished to go to bed early, being very poorly; she went up stairs about eight o'clock; my fellow servant

            , she went up; in about five minutes I went up again; I was alarmed, I sent for my mistress home, she complained of a pain in her stomach; my mistress came home immediately, and Mr. Smith the doctor was sent for; we all thought she had a child; the doctor came, he asked Mrs. Birkett if she was a married woman. After the doctor was gone Mrs. Birkett asked her, she denied it; I remained with her all night.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when Mr. Peelvin made a search. - A. Yes, that was on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any pockets. - A. Yes; I found the pockets on the Thursday on the counterpane, at the top of the bed, near the pillow; I tied them up and placed them under her pillow that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. How were they before you tied them up. - A. They laid loose on the bed. On Saturday when Mr. Peelvin was there, I took the pockets from under the pillow, I found a pair of scissars in them, with a little blood on them; I gave the scissars to Mr. Peelvin, he is the churchwarden; there was a penknife there, but there was no blood on it. I searched under the bed; I found a little black trunk under the bed with a female child in it, wrapped up in a gown which I have seen the prisoner wear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What was the appearance about the person of the child. - A. Its throat was cut with a bad edged instrument, or a pair of scissars; I said to Mrs. Birkett who was standing by, I had found the child, and that its throat was cut; the prisoner was laying then in the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you speak loud enough for the prisoner to hear you, when you mentioned the appearance of the child - when you first found it. - A. I suppose she must hear.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said the child's throat was cut. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner upon that make any observations. - A. She did not speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You said you took the infant out of the gown, what did you do with the infant. - A. I laid it on the boards till Mr. Smith came; he came about three quarters of an hour afterwards; he saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You say, what you said to Mrs. Birkett, the prisoner must have heard you. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she in that exhausted state that she might not hear. - A. She lay with her eyes shut.</p>

               <p>Q. This was a very large child. - A. A very large child.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a married woman, but common sense tells you it must have been a very hard labour. - A. Most likely.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you examined the box, in which you found a child. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find another box in which apparently there were things for the child

Yes; the prisoner was a person that I highly valued; I had no suspicion of her pregnancy; on the 3d of March we dined about six o'clock: the prisoner ate a very hearty dinner; after she had done she went up stairs, she complained that she was ill in her bowels - she came down stairs about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came down stairs. - A. The prisoner; she was confined up stairs with the infant, she only came down upon occasions; she came down about eight o'clock to provide for Mrs. Hewitson's child's supper, and for the night; she complained again of her being ill in her bowels, she apparently looked very well in the face; I smiled at her for saying the fish she ate for her dinner disagreed with her, I thought it was so simple a thing to make her ill; I asked her to take a cup of tea with me, she refused; about half past eight I went up stairs to dress myself; I asked her to have a little brandy, she said no; she was then sitting on the chair by the side of the bed, with her gown unpinned; she had a very nice colour, she put her hand to her stomach and apparently was in great pain; I then said what is the matter, are you very ill; yes, she said, I am very ill in my bowels; by her looking so well I did not think any thing of it. I then went out of the room and left her. About nine o'clock I went into her room again, she was then in bed with the cap on she had worn in day; I then asked her why she went to bed with her cap on; she spoke apparently confused, and rather smiled, said she should be up by and by; I concluded that she had fed the child; I asked her if she would have tea, she refused; I went down stairs and made tea; I took it her up, and staid with her till she hand drank part, I asked her how she did, she said she was better; I poured her out the remainder, she refused my staying with her; I then went out, it may have been three quarters of an hour before I returned; it was about a quarter after nine when I went out, and I returned to her about ten o'clock;

               <p>Q. Did you examine the bed at any time. - A. I searched the bed after the doctor left the room. On Thursday night I saw nothing of the child, only a great discharge of blood; Mrs. Birkett then said she was as much in that situation as ever she was (meaning having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060026"/>had a child or something of that sort), the prisoner replied no such thing madam. I searched under the bed, I saw this trunk; I moved it of one side, it was under the bed, I could see nothing; I never thought of looking into the trunk, nor did I see the child till it was laid on the floor, on Saturday night the 5th of March, between one and two o'clock; the child was wrapped up in a gown that the prisoner always wore, while she was at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about the child. - A. The child's throat was cut with an instrument that did not cut well, it was not cut strait; it was scolloped in and out, it appeared to me to be cut with scissars; it was a very fine child as ever I saw.</p>
               <p>MRS. BIRKETT. Q. We understand that you live at Clapton Terrace. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This prisoner was with her mistress, your daughter, she was on a visit at your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner. - A. Very near three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she was a married woman or a single woman. - A. I have no reason to suppose that she ever was married.</p>
               <p>Q. Your daughter brought an infant to your house. - A. Yes, the prisoner had the care of it; she was servant to the child.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand that you were out this Thursday evening. - A. Yes, I was out drinking tea and all the family; I returned home about a quarter before eleven. I went up immediately to the room where the prisoner was; I found her in a state which gave me suspicion that she had been brought a bed; she was in bed, I asked her what was the matter with her, she said nothing particular, she could hardly, make any reply; I believe she fainted away shortly after I came into the room. I said to her I thought appearances were very much against her; I did not know what to make of her situation. I did not exactly suppose that she might be brought a bed, I thought it might have been a bad miscarriage.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you were aware from what was found on the floor what had happened, you were told of it. - A. Yes. I went up and down several times till two o'clock in the morning, then I left the two servants with her, and told them if they observed any thing to let me know; there were no further appearances, I said to her the next morning that I had hurt her feelings by saying what I did last night; but appearances were so, that gave me suspicion, but I hoped it was not so; she said oh dear madam, it is not so, indeed; she was attended during the day by the family; Mr. Smith came again the next morning, she was then laying in a stupid kind of a way. He had strong suspicions of her; I told Mr. Smith I did not think she was capable of deceiving us so much; I could not believe it was so On the Saturday morning Mr. Smith insisted upon there being a child; he begged I would search immediately; I took

             up with me; there was a small black trunk under the bed; she pulled it from under the bed; opened it, there were a few small muslin things on the top inside of the trunk and under it a bundle tied up in a handkerchief, we opened the handkerchief the child was found wrapped up in a gown, which was in the handkerchief; it was a fine full grown female child; it appeared to have some injury upon the throat. I was not near enough to examine it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That child that was so found was afterwards shewn to Mr. Smith. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This poor woman had behaved very well, you had a high opinion of her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover any child bed linen. - A. There was some found, I understand; it was not brought to me, she only came to my house for a few days; her box was at her master's at Tower hill.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time that you made the discovery of the box and the child in it, did you talk so loud that she could hear. - A. Yes, she appeared to be in a stupid state; she hardly appeared to be alive. I hope my lord the whole was more the effect of accident than design.</p>
               <p>Mr. SMITH. You are a surgeon living at Stoke Newington. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday evening the 3d of March, were you sent for to Mrs. Birkett's at Clapton. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there see the prisoner. - A. I did, I was desired to go up stairs, where I found the prisoner in bed; I was told by her attendant that she had lost a great quantity of blood; the prisoner at that time was very faint and languid; she could give very little account; upon my going down stairs to Mrs. Birkett, I expressed my suspicions, I did not give any directions that night because my suspicions were not very great. Upon my seeing her the next day I then discovered a disagreeable stench about the bed; which I knew from my experience could only be the placenta, or after birth; I then requested Mrs. Birkett to give directions to have the bed searched, and if she found any thing to send for me, for my inspection. On the Saturday morning about eleven o'clock I called again; I was shewn part of a mature placenta; I then told Mrs. Birkett that my suspicions were quite confirmed, that such an appearance could not be without there having been a child. I then proposed to Mrs. Birkett to have the room searched. In a few hours afterwards I received a note from Mrs. Birkett that she had discovered the child. I returned to Mrs. Birkett about three o'clock in the afternoon; I was then shewn a female infant, of full mature growth, with its throat cut.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cut was it. - A. An incised wound cut by scissars and notched, extending along the whole course of the neck to the jaw, where the would was long and deep; it was very deep near the jaw, and where the windpipe received the injury.</p>
               <p>Q. What injury had the windpipe received. - A. It was divided.</p>
               <p>Court. Would that require a considerable effort to cut the windpipe with these scissars. - A. It must require great labour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. When you talk of the windpipe being divided you do not mean separated. - A. No, it was an incision, a deep cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had an opportunity of observing in the course of your practice, that the naval string will twine itself round the child's neck, so that it is necessary to apply the scissars to cut the navel string.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060027"/>A. It is necessary to cut the navel string always.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen that the navel string will twine itself round the child's neck. - A. Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it would choak the child. - A. No, it would break before it could produce suffocation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think that a poor wretched woman in attempting to assist nature might have done that injury. - A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you that the wound went upwards. - A. Yes, along the whole course of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. That notching that was done at several times could that be to assist the separation of the navel string. - A. It is possible that it might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear that it would be a mode to separate the naval string from the neck, if the navel string was there. - A. I think not; the scissars appear to have had a forcible thrust of a considerable depth; I dare say more than an inch; the navel string is extremely easy, cut it is like cutting a piece of tape.</p>
               <p>Q. Would there require any effort at all necessary for the purpose of separating the naval string, which might be cut as easy as a piece of tape. - A. None at all; it would have required no such force.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen the scissars. - A. I saw them before the coroner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they competent to produce the effect on the child. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated the appearance of the child, can you form a judgment of its being born alive. - A. Certainly; I think it was; but not being present, I cannot say, but taking all the circumstances together, the placenta and from the wound, it does not alter my opinion at all about it, but that it was born alive.</p>

               <p>Q. On Sunday the 6th of March had you any conversation with the prisoner. - A. I asked her whether she recollected the time that she was connected with any one; she told me about the beginning of June; I then asked her the reason why she did not leave me, knowing herself to be in that situation; she said, she did not know it would have happened so soon, she meaned to go to the parish; she had been asking leave to go to town, saying she wanted to see her mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine any box of hers. - A. No, I merely locked it up, and set it to her.</p>
               <p>Court, to Dr. Smith. You say the wound was a competent, and a valid cause to produce death. - A. Quite so, I saw no other cause whatever.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are a surgeon, and have had an extensive practice of midwifery. - A. I have, a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard of the accident of the navel string twining round the child's neck. - A. It certainly occurs very frequent.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you sir, from the opportunity that you have had of observing women in labour - is it not a thing likely to occur that a woman assisting herself, being totally ignorant, might have made an incision in the same way as described. - A. It is possible that she might by applying the scissars to extricate herself; if the navel string is round the childs neck as there is but a short distance from that and the uterus even for a practioner to cut the string; supposing the scissars had been both points sharp, one is obtuse, which makes it more difficult; in the agony of mind had they both been sharp pointed, she might have forced the scissars without any intent to commit murder; I should certainly have untwisted the string; there is a difficulty in getting the scissars under the string.</p>
               <p>Q. You say sir in the situation described it, would be necessary to use some force to get the string. - A. I do say so, and it might be so, that there would be room enough to put the scissars under; it could not hardly be done by an ignorant person, and in fact hardly is ever done by a practitioner, without untwisting the string before they apply the scissars.</p>
               <p>Court, to Smith. What was the depth of the wound, describe where the wound commenced. - A. In the inferior part of the neck, and stretched up to the jaw; it was about three inches in length.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form how many cuttings there might have been. - A. Three distinct ones. The navel string was round the neck of the child, I left it there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the incision made by the scissars could have been done by the person in the agony of labour to relieve herself from that. - A. It might happen.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see any circumstance to enable you to say whether it did happen so or not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In conversation with the prisoner, did she suggest to you any thing of that sort. - A. I had no conversation with her, I only asked her how she did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master has given me bits of chains several times; they are not worth a halfpenny to any body, they are of no use but as strings to put keys upon.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never gave him a piece so long.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

About ten o'clock the same night Mr. Powell found some things in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the goods afterwards when they were brought by the pawnbroker's man. - A. Yes; some part of them. I recognised them to be part of the goods that were taken away from the shop.</p>

               <persName id="t18080406-38-person394">Lawrence</persName>
             that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060029"/>I must search her; she said very well; I was going to put my hands into her pockets, she said I will take out what I have got in my pockets; she took several things out, and one broach, among the rest. I produce the broach.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Powell. Is that your broach. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Adkins. I then asked the prisoner Lawrence what she had done with the duplicate of a pearl sprig she had pawned, she said she had destroyed it. I asked her how she came by the pearl sprig, she was going to answer, but Mrs. Dolphin stopped her and said I will tell you how she came by it. I said I have nothing to do with you; I only asked Mrs. Lawrence. Mrs. Dolphin would not let Mrs. Lawrence speak but would answer herself; then I said I will hear what you have got to say; she said she and her daughter were walking in Oxford street on Monday evening the 22d of February, between six and seven o'clock, and her daughter picked up the sprig. I asked her if she had picked up any thing else with it, she said she did not, that was the sprig she had pawned with Bland; he has not shewn it. I took notice of the broach at that time, she laid it on the drawers near to where she was standing, after that I said Mrs. Lawrence, I shall wish you to give an account how you came by the sprig; she said what her mother had told me was true; that she had picked it up in Oxford street; I then desired her to recollect herself, because what she told me then I should tell in another place. I then called in the pawnbroker Bland, that he should hear what they had to say; he came in, when they repeated what they had said again; they both said they found the sprig, and that only in Oxford street; when the pawnbroker came in, she said I beg your pardon there was the earring that I sold to you this morning, I found that with it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bland. Was any earring sold to you. - A. Yes, that was on the 24th when the sprig was pledged.</p>
               <p>Adkins. I took up the broach that she took out of her pocket from the drawer; I asked her if that belonged to her, she said it did. I said I should put it in my pocket and take it for the present; she then said I forgot to mention that I found that with the sprig; I then asked them both many times if they found any thing else besides the earring, the sprig, and the broach that I had; they both said they did not; I knew Lawrence had pledged other articles. I searched the place and took them to the office.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Dolphin left her defence to her counsel.</p>
               <p>Lawrence's Defence. These things which I pledged I received from my mother.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called seven witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 19th of February last I was going up Holborn, near six o'clock in the evening on the 19th of February last; the prisoner at the bar was running very fast near to the end of Chancery lane; I looked after her, and underneath her bedgown I saw the fag end of something hanging out; I ran after her and laid hold of her, I asked her what she had got, she said what was that to me, she had nothing but what was her own; I said I am sure it is not your own, I will endeavour to find an owner for it. I went into Mr. Powdich's, and he and one of his shopmen said that was the piece of shawls that hung on the roller a few minutes before. I then unwrapped it from around her body, where it had been.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these shawls, do you know whose property they are. - A. They are Mr. Powdich's, I know them from a private mark; I had seen them about half an hour before, they were hanging on a bar, found the door inside of the shop; the door opens inwards, it is a circular door, the whole of the property was within the shop; I put out the shawls myself,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060030"/>they were not so far out as the door post, they were as far as a foot from the door post.</p>
               <p>Q. Who served in the shop besides you. - A. There were two more, they are not here; I had not seen this woman nor missed the things before they were brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prime cost. - A. Fifteen shillings.</p>

At nine o'clock, the usual time of shutting up the shop, I expected the men would come out; I procured a constable and placed him on one side of Newgate street, and I stood at the corner of Panyer alley, just against my own door;

               <p>Q. At about what time did this woman come in. A. About three o'clock; I was there employed as a weekly porter, to assist whatever might be wanted, sometimes to carry out parcels. The moment the prisoner came in she went to the counter, about two yards from the shop door; she remained there a short time I observed her roll up a piece of buff print: I saw her roll it up with her left hand at the same time with her right hand, pulling other prints apparently over it, to cover it from the shopman; as soon as she had rolled it up, she put it under her arm; she had a shawl on; she immediately walked backwards from the counter, and others came in before her next the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she buy any thing. - A. She did not at that time; she turned round and went quickly across the shop to go into the passage, to go out of the private door; I followed her and asked her what she had got under her arm; she said what she had got was her own, she had seven yards of print and had paid half a guinea for it; I took the print from under her arm; I asked Mr. Latham when I got her in the shop if he had shewed her that piece of print; he said it was the moment before on the counter; I then took her back into the accompting house, and sent for an officer. There is twenty yards of print; that is what I saw her take from the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I did not understand you particularly, in what capacity are you employed. - A. As porter.</p>
               <p>Q. A porter's place and a constable is two things, do you stand there to serve customers, or to watch the customers. - A. I stand there to serve the customers, and carry out parcels; I never go behind the counter; sometimes when the shopmen are up at dinner I cut off goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop did she go in to purchase. -

               <p>Q.

No such a thing; she said she had bought seven yards of print and paid half a guinea for it.</p>

On Saturday night the 5th of March, the prisoner came in the shop, while I was engaged, accompanied by a man; I knowing her to be a suspicious character asked her what she wanted; she then pointed to a piece of print that laid on the counter, and asked the price of it; I told her eighteen pence; the man who was with her told her it was too dear; I knowing the situation that I had left the goods at the door, I went to bring some of them in; on my return I saw the prisoner taking a piece of ell wide print from off the counter, and concealing it under her coats; I asked her what she had got under her coats; the man who was with her, ran off immediately. I put my hand up her coats, found the piece of print concealed above her knees; gave charge of her to the officer who was standing at the door.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met with a woman that owed me some money, she had a man with her at the corner of Field lane; she was a widow woman when I served her with milk; I asked her for the money she owed me; she wondered at my not serving her with milk as usual; I told her I had been in the hospital with a bad leg five months; she treated me and persuaded me to go in this shop with her, she would buy a gown, and change a pound note, and then she would pay me; I went in with her, this piece of print, whether it fell off his arm or from the counter I cannot say, however it dropped; he then said do you want to theive this; I said what do you mean by that. I gave him a short answer for suspecting me; the others went away, they were glad of the excuse for not paying me the money; I know no more of the cotton as I am a sinner to night than any of you, if I do I wish my hands may never close to night.</p>
               <p>Witness. It was a tall man six foot high that came in with her; as soon as I took her the man ran away.</p>

               <p>JOHN DOWDING. Q. You are a servant of the prosecutor. - A. Yes. On the 19th of February Mr. Devey came to our shop, he shewed me this brass; I knew it, it is my own invention; I do not believe there is any similar to it in London. Mr. Devey delivered the brass to me. I know that is my master's property.</p>

               <p>MR. WADSWORTH. Q. Did you sell any brass to Mr. Devey. - A. I did, I sold him three hundred weight; I cannot swear to that, my wife bought it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them taken. - A. No, I went of my errand about ten doors farther in the street, and before I returned the man was taken.</p>

            . Q. You are the landlord of the public house. - A. Yes. Mr. Johnson when he came back enquired for the parcel he had left; I then enquired who had left the tap room; my wife said an old man that was drinking along with the shoemaker; I suspected it was the prisoner. I went for a constable and brought him to find the prisoner, and Mr. Johnson and the constable were sitting in the parlour; this man came in as if he had not done any thing. I charged him with it, he made slight of it, and said he did not mean to keep it; I took him into the parlour and searched him; I told him it would be best to tell me where the bundle was, and I would endeavour to make it up with Mr. Johnson and him. He took me to his room, and there was the parcel; I brought him back to Mr. Johnson, and the constable took charge of him.</p>

A person came in and bought something that came to three pence, and gave him a shilling; he took out three pence from the till, then he threw the shilling into the till, he put his hand into the till to get a sixpence; he had his hand in the till a considerable time; I thought he was taking money, he took the sixpence between his forefinger and thumb, and when he took his hand out of the till I very plainly could see that he had something under his back fingers and the palm of his hand; I was in the staircase that leads from the shop to the cellar; there was a cavity that I had a view of the till and the greater part of the shop. When the woman went away he began cleaning my boots, he took the brush in his hand, and then I perceived he did not open his back fingers; I pushed the door open, I said, Philip, what have you got in your hand, he said nothing; I took the brush out of his hand; he opened his hand and then said I have got two shillings; I told him he was a pretty fellow, his wages was not enough, he must rob me every opportunity; he denied it, said he was a going to put it in the till, and behaved insolent; I went for an officer; he searched him and found a shilling on him that I had marked; I thought he did not come honestly by the money, because I had not paid him any wages since he had been with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the money that was marked. - A. In the till. The next morning the officer brought him to my house; in his way to Worship street, the prisoner said he hoped I would forgive him, he would give up all his wages.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How many shillings had you marked. - A. Twenty, I dare say, in the same way with a cross.</p>

               <p>Q. Who sleeps in the lodging rooms. - A. The ostler and two bookkeepers, and the waggoners when they stop all night.</p>
               <p>Q. What communication is there, and is there any between your dwelling house and this place for the servants. - A. There is a kitchen and a small paved wash-house that goes from the kitchen; in the washhouse there is a door that leads into the accompting house, and over the accompting house are these rooms situated.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that plan, and tell me whether that is the situation of your premises. - A. Yes, I can understand it perfectly well; this is the kitchen door, there is a way from the kitchen to the washhouse; the gable end of the house runs right through the washhouse into this accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar in your service. - A. Yes, as ostler.</p>

               <p>Court. What day was this. - A. I think it was the 14th of March I received it, and on the 15th I heard it was lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Upon hearing it was lost what did you do. - A. I made every enquiry I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry of the prisoner. - A. I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the enquiry that you made elsewhere, what did you do. - A. I was not determined about taking the prisoner up till about eight o'clock in the evening. I went to Hatton garden office; Trott came down with Eklesoe and me, and we took the prisoner up in St. John street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Trott searched him. - A. No, not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Trott produce any thing to you. - A. Trott brought the prisoner up stairs and produced three one pound notes and two papers, a bill of parcels and a receipt, and there was a new watch likewise produced in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you state any thing what the prisoner told you, tell me whether you said it would be better or worse for him if he did not confess. - A. Nothing was said to the prisoner at that time; we were occupied about looking at the notes and the watch; I gave my opinion the watch was new, that it could not be wore one day in my service, and that the bill of parcels had been found which was in the parcel that was stole, because it was a bill of parcels for goods paid for, and was enclosed in this parcel; the prisoner said that the papers did not concern any body, they were picked up in the street; I sent my young man to Rogers to enquire if that bill of parcels came with the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Trott search him a second time. - A. Yes, Trott searched him a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner then. - 
               <persName id="t18080406-54-person518">A. </persName>
            Yes; When Trott was searching him the second time I told him I would prosecute him; I wished him to say where the property was.</p>
               <p>Court. At what place was this. - A. This was up stairs at the public house. Trott told him he had better tell us where the property was; he would say nothing at that time; Trott desired him and me to go up to one end of the room; he told me he would go into another room; in consequence of that we went into another room. When we got there I told him it was very evident<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060037"/>that he had taken this parcel, as the papers that was enclosed in it were found upon him; he must know where the property was; I would make no promise, his objection was that I had threatened him I would prosecute him; he then told me that the watch he had bought in St. John street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Wykes, I am sure you do not mean to say any thing but what is the truth, of that I am quite satisfied; did not you make use of this expression, George, if you will confess, I will do what I can for you. - A. No such a thing; he told me that he paid for the watch a ten pound note and received the change, and I should find a good deal more money at his lodgings up two pair of stairs, No. 13, Northampton street; I should find the money in a box near to his door, it was in his jacket pocket, either on the top of his box or just withinside of his box; I went with Trott up to the pawnbroker's first, and left him at the Pewter Platter public house with the other officer; we went from the pawnbrokers to his lodgings, he had given us the key of his box; we went into the first room the door was open; we turned a little to the right to a door that went into the next room; his wife answered us, and opened the door; we found nothing in that room particular; Trott went back with the key of the box to the room where we went first into, he unlocked the box that was standing at the door; he brought out a jacket, holding it in this manner, hanging down, with the notes half out; Trott took them out to the amount of fifty seven pounds; we searched a little about, we found nothing else there as I recollect; we went to the Pewter Platter; the officer had taken him to prison. When I told him he had better tell me where the property was; he told me he had bought this watch with the ten pound note; he said there was a five pound note his wife. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. We must not hear what his wife told you.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp This parcel was entrusted with you, and was booked for the Wellingborough coach, you are answerable for that property. - A. I do not conceive myself as answerable, because it was only booked as a parcel.</p>

               <p>Q. However it was put in your office to go by the Wellingborough coach. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partners. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the usual way to go into this accompting house to go into the bed rooms over it. - A. You must go into the yard to go to the bed rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in order to go to these bed rooms you must go through the yard and then up a staircase. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of this that you made no promise to him namely, saying George, if you will confess I will forgive you. - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not retire from Trott the officer for the purpose of getting from him what he had done with the property. - A. I thought he would tell me though he would not tell them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You found the property however in consequence of what he said. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you find. - A. The first thing I found was a watch; I asked him how he came by it; he said he had it by him three years; on his saying that I looked at it, I said it could not have been long purchased; there was a mark inside of the silk so fresh and plain, I thought he could not have had it three years; my brother officer was searching his jacket pockets; while I was searching his small clothes he pulled out papers doubled up together, and threw them down to me to examine; among the papers is a bill and receipt, and a one pound note, doubled up of a heap, as if it was a piece of dirty paper; he was not searched before Mr. Wykes; then after that I took him up stairs to a private room, where Mr. Wykes was sitting; I then cautioned Mr. Wykes not to make him any promise, threat, or any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say this in the presence of the prisoner. - A. I did a great many times. He then begged to go with Mr. Wykes into a private room; I suffered them to go, Mr. Wykes said he would be answerable: they were there some time together, what passed I cannot answer for. I went in at last, they were so long, I said I could not wait any longer. When I went in he was then shedding of tears, he said he was sorry for what he had done, and he hoped his master would forgive him. (I forgot one thing; that was a key that I found upon him of his box, which I found before he went up to his master.) He said he was a guilty man, and part of the money he had stole was either on the box at home, or in the box, and that was the key that I had taken from him belonging to the box; I had learned before where he lodged; he then confessed that he had purchased this watch, and he would shew us where in St. John street, at a pawnbrokers, he would point out the shop; I went there and found he had changed a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the pawnbroker's name. - A. Newton is the servant's name; and the five pound note he had received in change, he had given to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that five pound note. - A. I found it at his wife's sister's her name is Kitty Payne; I had this note from her. I proceeded to his lodging; I found fifty seven pounds in his box, this key unlocked his box. There is one ten, two fives, seven two's, and twenty three one's; what makes the difference is the change of the notes, they are not the same notes.</p>

               <p>Johnson's Defence. These young women and me were coming down. Piccadilly; we met the prosecutor and three other men; they stopped us and took us into the Running Horse, Piccadilly, they gave us a great deal of liquor; as we came out of the house they asked us to go with them, they offered us too little money; they said why should they treat such as us and have nothing in return; they knocked this woman down and used us ill. We found this bundle in the street, and we pledged them. The prosecutor came down to us, he asked us if we had such a thing; we said we had pledged them; we were short of money, and we had laid the money out. He took us in custody, because we could not take them out again.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is this true, that there was a quarrel between you and one of them was knocked down. A. No, they left me in the public house.</p>

               <p>Q. What state was you in. - A. I had been drinking. I was not tipsey, it was late, I was sleepy.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain of this, that they went out of the public house before you. - A. Yes, I did not see them afterwards that night.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a customer of the name of Edward Bramwell. - A. Yes, he lived in Oxford street; the prisoner had a book to set down the bread he delivered, and the money he received; in that book he states 11th of February one half quartern loaf, and on the 12th a half quartern loaf, that is elevenpence halfpenny.</p>

On the 16th of March I lost six shillings, four sixpences, and five shillings in copper, a till, and a wooden bowl that I keep the farthings in; the bowl and the money were in the till; the prisoner had lived in the upper part of the house for about three months;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060041"/>On the day I lost my property the prisoner removed her goods away by one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her afterwards. - A. Yes, between the hours of one and two o'clock she returned again; she went up stairs to the person in the first floor; the woman in the first floor goes out to work, which gave me suspicion that she was after no good; she remained on the person's premises the best part of the afternoon, on the one pair of stairs; then I saw the prisoner go out of the house with a bundle in her apron; she returned about dusk, she came into my shop and asked for a half pennyworth of small beer; after she had the beer she went up stairs; in about an hour afterwards she went down and enquired if her little girl bad been. About ten minutes the child came in with two white cloths in her hand; the child went up stairs. There is a passage between the shop and the back room. When I set in the back room I cannot see any body that goes into the shop. Some little time after I heard a noise on the stairs, I came into the shop, I saw nothing of Mary Ayres and the child but on the stairs; when she saw me she removed up another pair of stairs higher. In a little time after I heard the same noise again. When I came out again and saw her, she then removed higher up the stairs. In about a quarter of an hour after a person came in the shop for a quarter loaf, she gave me a shilling for the loaf; I went to the till to give her a penny, I missed the till; I gave an alarm and sent for a neighbour; when I gave the alarm I heard something fall out of the window into the yard, which I thought was the till; this was about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the till. - A. Yes, it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house besides the prisoner. - A. One woman lodger on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What window was the till thrown out of. - A. The two pair of stairs, the room that the prisoner had occupied.</p>

            . About eight o'clock on the 16th of March I was called out of my house; I went to Mrs. Hetherington upon being informed a person had taken her till. While Mrs. Hetherington was relating her story to me, there was a noise of something dropping in the yard, I went up stairs, I saw the prisoner and her child picking up five or six pennyworth of halfpence on the landing place of the two pair of stairs; I took her down stairs. Mr. Hetherington came home and sent for an officer; an officer was gone for. I took a candle and looked over the yard, and over a shed that leaned to the back part of the house I discovered the till laying about the middle of it on the tiles; it must have come from the prisoner's window, the other window of the one pair was below it. The officer searched the prisoner, he found on her four shillings and nine pence three farthings, one shilling, and two sixpences. A small bowl was found on the stairs. We got the key of the shed, as the tiles were broke, to see whether she had throwed out any of the money in a hurry with the till; we only found two farthings in the shed.</p>

I was brought to the prisoner, whom I found in the apartment which she had lately occupied; on her denying having had the till I proceeded to search her - on her I found in copper four shillings and nine pence three farthings - silver, one shilling and two sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Could the till have been thrown out of the other lodger's room. - A. No, it was of the other side of the house; the till is mine and the bowl; I can speak to two of the halfpence that was found on the prisoner, I had taken them the same day, there is a mark across the middle of them.</p>

My master that I work for is in the habit of lending us money twice a week, which is Tuesday and Thursday; he lent me two shillings on Tuesday and five shillings on the Thursday; this good lady said she lost her till and money; she swore at the justices of losing eight shillings in silver, which was six shillings and four sixpences, and the rest of the money she said was in halfpence; when I was searched all that was found on me was one shilling and two sixpences in silver; I never was out of the place; there were other lodgers in the house besides me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him take any thing from the cart. - A. I did not; I went in about my business; I passed him and went on about two hundred yards, when he passed me with the truss on his shoulder, just at the end of St. Ann's lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he was the same man that you had seen in the cart. - A. I was quite sure he was the same man by his dress, he had a brown coat on; when he passed me some person called out Joe do not run; there is no person calling to you; that gave me suspicion; he went on a little further, he put the truss down at a door, I passed him and looked at him; I turned back almost immediately, I run back to the Bull and Mouth to enquire if he had stole the truss; I found the carman enquiring after it; I told the carman if he would follow me I would shew him where it was.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer; - on the 29th of March, as I was coming up Foster lane I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw the prisoner running in a direction toward me, he turned as if he was going into Wood street, then he altered his course on seeing me come towards him; I followed him and took him in Little Love lane; I asked him what made him run, he said he did not run; he did run, because I run pretty sharp after him; I asked him whole coat it was he had under his arm, he said his own, he put it on; immediately a person came up and told me he had stole a parcel out of a cart in Bull and Mouth street; the prisoner denied it. I asked him to go along with me, then I should see whether he was guilty or not; he refused going with me and struck me. I catched hold of him by the collar and told him I should use him very rough if he served me so any more; I brought him back to the Bull and Mouth, they said they knew him. Oily charged him with being the man that robbed the cart.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - the crime that is alledged against me I am totally ignorant of, and I have no doubt but the discernment of this honourable court and jury will acquit me of this charge; I never saw the witness Oily before I was brought to Bull and Mouth street; the witness Oily admitted that he saw a man in the cart before the magistrate, but he could not identify me to be the person. On the evening laid in the indictment I was coming along Wood street, there were several people quickened their paces; a man before me turned round and seized hold of me and gave me in charge immediately; I did not know why that man stopped me, I have never seen him since, and when I was brought into Bull and Mouth street I was astonished at what they charged me with. I am a watch gilder by trade; - there were many turnings in the street - and if such a thing as conviction should take place it would be dangerous for a man to walk in the street; - is it possible that I can be convicted, as the man who first stopped me never appeared against me; therefore I make no doubt of a verdict of acquittal, as he never appeared against me before the justice where I was examined.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the officers of the Thames police. - A. I am. On the 4th of April, about half after four in the afternoon, I was passing by Leadenhall street in company with my brother officer; the prisoner was in the act of shutting a gate, No. 98; Dalby and I suspected him; we followed him till he came to Bell lane, Spital fields; when he got there we asked him where he came from, and what he was going to do with this parcel; I said I know where you came from, and I shall make your master acquainted with it; he said he should not give us any account. We found indigo in the bag; we took him custody; he went in the custody of Dalby, and I went to Messrs. Wilsons and acquainted them of the circumstance. I have had the indigo ever since it was in the bag, as it now is.</p>
               <p>- DALBY. Q. I suppose you know no more than the last witness. - A. I saw him come out of the same gateway; I know no more than him.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of these women. - A. On the 1st of April, about a quarter past seven o'clock, Dalton came in for a bottle of wine, accompanied by Fitzgerald; they asked for a bottle of wine; I did not like the appearance of them, and it being not the practice of the house to send wine out of the house I refused serving them. Dalton said she had had it frequently for the same gentleman that she came from; I told her she could not have it for that gentleman unless he was a subscriber and a friend; she then said he frequented the house, his name was Mr. Dalton, of Cheapside. I did not know the name, but in all probability I thought he being a respectable gentleman, and not knowing but he used the house, I went into the bar and tendered her a bottle of wine; she tendered me a guinea; I gave her half a guinea, five shillings, and two pence, which made the wine and bottles five shillings and fourpence; she disputed the price of the bottle of wine, and said she never gave more than four shillings and ninepence for a bottle of wine in her life there before; this was Dalton, the other said nothing. I told Dalton she could not get it for less; she refused having it except I would let her have it for four shillings and nine pence; I took the wine into the bar; she said give me my guinea and I'll give you the change; I held out my left hand to receive the change and tendered her the guinea with my right hand; Dalton had got the guinea; they both walked towards the door; I opened my hand, I found I had get only two pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they put something in your hand. - A. Yes, which I thought was the whole change; I called out to them to stop, they had not given me the right change; Dalton cried out she had. They both returned; Dalton insisted upon it she had given me the change, I insisted upon it I never received it; Dalton was riotous, Fitzgerald desired her to be quiet. I went for my master, he found Dalton in a riotous situation, he sent for a constable; she was taken to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain that she played this trick upon you, and gave you no more than two pence. - A. I am certain of that.</p>

               <p>- SHIRVIN. I am an officer. I searched Dalton first at the counter; in her right hand pocket I found a new guinea and a penny piece. Fitzgerald had nothing about her except a farthing or a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Dalton's Defence. This young woman came to see me on the 1st of April, she lived in Ratcliffe highway. I told her I would go and see her home; my mother was very ill, I thought I might as well go in that place and get the wine.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald's Defence. I went to see Mrs. Dalton, she came to see me part of the way home; she said her mother was very poorly; she went in to buy a bottle of wine for her; I went in with her; what past after I do not know.</p>

Yes; the waiter took them into the kitchen where she attended about her business; after missing of them I told the servants they must all take their oath, they all said they would,; I sent a servant to the pawnbrokers; she went to Mr. Hillier's and they were produced.</p>
               <p>MR. HILLIER. I am a pawnbroker, No. 12, Smithfield bars. On the 31st of March, between four and five, in the afternoon; I took in half a dozen silver spoons of the prisoner. I am sure as to her person; I advanced her eight shillings on them, she said they were her own she lived in Gray's Inn home: she pledged them in the name of Stewart. Mrs. Ward has the spoons.</p>
               <p>MRS. WARD. These are the spoons; I valued them at eighteen shillings; she confessed to me that she had taken them; when I asked her first if she know any thing of the spoons she said she did not, she would take her oath of it. I said I can tell you this, I have the spoons in my possession, it is in vain for you to deny it; she then told me that she did it to buy a gown; she lived with me about a fortnight last Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this coat, waistcoat, and shirt. - A. On the 23d of March, the prisoner at the bar came to my house and said he wanted a ship; I asked him if ever he had been to sea, he said no; I told him I could do nothing with him; he said he was in great distress; seeing him a decent young man, I said to him you shall be in my house, I will give you victtuals and drink until you can get a situation; on the Friday following I was informed we had been robbed; I asked the prisoner, and he acknowledged he had stole the things. I promised him forgiveness, and do not wish to hurt him now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell me any thing he said, after you had this conversation with the lad; did you go with him any where. - A. Yes, he pointed out the place where he took them; I found every thing. I think he did it through necessity.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you permitted him to wear them. - A. I told him he might put any thing on.</p>

               <p>Q. You left this property there on the evening of the 20th. - A. Yes.

               <p>Q. Before he ran was any thing said to him. - A. Not a word. This was the 9th of March; he ran for about a mile and a quarter; there was a man a hedging; I cried stop him, he attempted to stop him, he could not; I asked the hedger for his bill, he gave it to me, we ran about a mile and a half farther, then I got up to him, when he got over a hedge. I said surrender; he stopped and held up his fist, I said I will strike you with the bill if you do not surrender. He knocked me down and put his knees on my throat and attempted to choak me; I gave him several cuts with the bill; he bled and got weak; I throwed him off, I said come surrender; he walked on and we took him.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of Worship street office. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of a warrant that you had from the magistrate, did you go on the 26th of March to a house <placeName id="t18080406-70-crimeloc373">No. 12, King street, St. James's, Clerkenwell</placeName>

Yes, in company with Vickery and Bishop, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; I sent Vickery to ring the bell, I was standing outside of the door, young Buckley opened the door to us. I told him I had a warrant to search; we all three of us went in, we shut the outer door; we went through a passage where the door opened, that presented a washhouse or a back kitchen. On the side of that washhouse was a place which I thought was an accompting house adjoined to it; we went into it; I returned out of that; went into a yard; it crossed that washhouse to a privy; and in a shed (I went along with Vickery there), there were two stamps then fixed.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of stamps. - A. A pair of dies in one, and only one die in the other, the bottom die. We had Buckley with us at the time. We came back into this accompting house; there upon a counter was a scale fixed to a beam; at the further<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060047"/>end of that counter was a writing desk; I lifted up the top of that desk I found a paper, which when I opened, was a quantity of this coin, which I now produce, it appeared very fresh. In a drawer under the counter were some blanks in a paper which were not struck, but were edged; there was adjoining to that a stone place (it formerly had been used in a silver manufactory) and a cutter, which stood in the corner, with a quantity of this sissel of copper; in that place there was a a pan with some pickle then standing in it; in a box in the accompting house, close by the side where this money was found, I found this pan and another box, with a composition of something which will produce the colour of silver. In the same place was a quantity of saw dust, some clean and some dirty, and on the counter was a card of shirt buttons. We went down into the kitchen below stairs, there was a quantity of watch seals in paper; then we returned up to a shop which has two stair cases for the workmen to go out of the shop without going through the house; that is over the back kitchen and the accompting house; there was what is called an edging tool fixed there, with two lathes, but nobody at work; in the accompting house there was a great quantity of other money that we have in bags; this was on the box, stuffed with saw dust. There was two bags full of small money in the same accompting house; the apparatus was all brought away by the officers. I and Vickrey took young Buckley in Spital fields; I left Mason and Bishop behind me; we took these things on the Saturday. On the Sunday we went there to take the apparatus down.</p>
               <p>Q. All this apparatus, the composition and the pickles, are they such things as coiners make use of. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And they were all complete for work. - A. Yes, the large dies were then set.</p>
               <p>COURT. What do you call sissell. - A. It is the waste copper out of which the blanks are cut; pickle will produce on the surface the silver out of the metal; it is made of aqua fortis and cream of tartar. The composition I believe is silver dissolved.</p>
               <p>Q. Then every thing seems to be complete. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN FREEMAN. Q. You are acquainted with Prussia. - A. Yes, I am a Prussian.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any coin in Prussia similar to these. - A. There is; the large piece is called a golden, and the smaller piece a groschen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear to be made as the foreign Prussian coin. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These are not the coin of Prussia, but counterfeits. - A. They do resemble it, but not so as to be deceived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do they resemble so as one would be taken for the other. - A. The large coin, if it came to my inspection, I certainly should not take it for the real coin.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not because it is worn out, as some of our shillings are. - A. No, the real Prussian coin has a remarkable likeness of the king; this face is not like the king's face at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a coin of silver mixed with copper. - A. I cannot tell; no coin in Prussia is considered as silver but the rix dollar; I suppose they are mixed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the grosschen, the proper name of that is gute grosschen. - A. Yes; but in the provinces where these are done, it goes by the name of grosschen; in the kingdom it goes by the name of gute grosschen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this coin is struck at Berlin or at Brandenburgh. - A. I cannot answer it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different mints are there in the Prussian state. - A. The mints in the different provinces are for the smaller money; I know only of one, at Koeningsberg.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not employed in the mint of Prussia. A. No; it is four years ago since I was in Prussia.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not the coins change. - A. About four years ago, when I went home, I did not find any difference in the coin.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer. - A. I am; I went in with the other officers; the house is situated, in the way Mr. Armstrong has described. I passed through the washhouse into the yard; at the further end of the yard was a shed; within that shed was fixed two stamping engines, the dies were both set in the engine for the large piece of coin; in the small stamping engine was one die fixed in the bottom; the reverse die was out; - in a box close to the left hand of the large engine, I found several pieces of large coin, that exactly matched with the large die; I read the inscription on the die and on one of the pieces, and they were exactly alike, letter for letter; there was a little wooden box, which is now out of doors in the cart with the other heavy and large instruments; the press was worked by means of the foot; there was a hole dug in the ground two feet and a half deep, and when the bed of the die was fixed it came to their hands; it was worked by the foot in this manner [witness describing it], the dies being close to their middle; they could work without stopping to it. In this box was another die, it appears to be the top die in the small press; to this little shed was a small window; the stamps were between the men that worked and the light, it threw a light down upon the bed of the work; they stood with their faces to the press, and the light was on the opposite side of them; there was a curtain to prevent any body from looking in; in this same drawer there were several pieces of coin which I have here, with the dies; these were found in this box, where the die out of the small press was found.</p>
               <p>Court. What is that. - A. Pieces of coin resembling these large and small; the principal part is large - that there was found in the drawer; some of them are perfect and some appear to have been struck twice to see whether the dye would take the effect. These are the dies that were in the large stamping engine; this die was fixed in the bed of the small stamping engine; these dies were left in this box; these three were left to all that was there, the officers all saw it; we then went to the accompting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060048"/>house, there was a counter fixed in the accompting house with several dies on it; there were some dies on it; there were some drawers standing on the top of it, and there were two or three cards of sleeve buttons on it, as if for the purpose of shewing to gentlemen that they dealt in buttons. At the further part of this accompting house was a desk; I saw Armstrong take out a large paper of this coin; I produce the edging tool; I saw a cutting engine standing at the right hand corner coming in; I saw the pickle and the silvery composition; there were two laths up stairs, there were several other working tools that did not appear to this business, therefore they were not brought away; the dies and small articles were taken away on Saturday night; on Sunday we went again for the purpose of taking away the stamping engine; after we had taken away the top part there was a large iron bed which weighs near three hundred pounds weight; it was fixed in a block; in doing that I found coming out of the ground this piece of coin, it is completely fresh; in moving the small die we found two or three pieces of coin. Old Buckley and Hartcup was taken in custody, while we were gone to search Hartcup's house at Kilburn; when we came back a taylor came and said he had two suits of clothes; he was asked if he would leave them; be said no, he took them away afterwards Homer came, he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not come in the house. - A. I believe Bishop went out and took him in the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Homer merely came to the door and you took him in custody. - A. I do not think he was in the house till he was brought in.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you were left in the house by Armstrong what did you find. - A. On searching an iron safe in the kitchen below stairs, I found thirteen dies for small coin.</p>
               <p>Q. Of the grosschen. - A. Yes, likewise a box of small coin all completed. I was left in the care of the house, and about dusk I heard the key put in the street door on the outside. I placed myself behind the door, when the prisoner Hartcup came in, and under his arms he had some bags similar to these, and some brown paper, one large bag and two small ones; the larger bag corresponded with the bag which holds the small coin; immediately he came in, I asked him if his name was Hartcup; he said it was; I took him into custody. I asked him if the premises belonged to him; he said they did, and that he paid seventy five pounds a year for it to a Mr. Carpenter; I saw the agreement of the lease in his pocket; these are two bills for blanks bought of Messrs. Bett's and sons; in a few minutes the bell rung, I placed myself behind the door and opened the door, when the elder Mr. Buckley came in; he said he wanted to see a Mr. Nixon; I let him into the parlour, I told him what we were there for. I took him in custody; about nine o'clock the bell rung again, I opened the door and stood behind it; no person coming in I went across the yard to the iron gate, when Homer was standing at the gate with a bundle under his arm, which turned out afterwards to be a shoulder of mutton; the moment he saw me he turned away; I said walk in; he said he knew nothing about it; I told him we had not said any thing about it what it was; we took him in custody. In the shed where this press was found, I found this small coin, which corresponds with a pair of dies that I have here.</p>
               <p>Q. How many dies did you find altogether. - A. Thirteen.</p>
               <p>MR. MARSH. Q. You are a publican in the neighbourhood - look at the prisoners and see if you know them. - A. I know the three shortest, the other I do not remember seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak to all but Hartcup. - A. Yes, them three I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they live from your house. - A. About a hundred and fifty yards; I have seen them more than once or twice, each of them; they have been to my house to order beer to be carried to that place; I have frequently called for the pots, and each of them have given me the pots; they have just opened the door and the pot was handed out to me; I think for more than three months I served them, during which time I had an opportunity of seeing them.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON. Q. You are an officer - tell me my good fellow what you found. - A. Here is an aqua fortis bottle I found there, and here is another with oil of vitriol, and a curtain that was hanging at the shop door, a couple of cloths that have been whitening of them; there was a large pan with pickle. I took this vial full out; this pickle came from the same pan that Mr. Armstrong has described.</p>

               <p>Court. In the first article there is twelve square, you think there is an addition of one to the article and to the price. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And with regard to the twenty six squares in lead there is an addition of one to the price, is that right. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What should that be. - A. Three pence a square.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That would be six shillings and sixpence. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is one pound added. - A. Yes, it appears so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect what sum it was you received. - A. No, I cannot recollect no more than I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you did not receive the one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. I never recollect any thing at all about it; I never think of them things; when I receive it I mark it off and do not mind it.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not you keep a book. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you got your book here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you do not recollect whether you received the one pound more than you ought to have done. A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you recollect at this moment whether you ought to have received twelve shillings and sixpence or one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. I have not kept it in my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Your book is not here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Without your book have you any recollection upon the subject at all. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Without your book do you know whether it would be six shillings for the sash squares, or sixteen shillings for the sash squares. - A. Not without my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it should be twelve or two, from your own recollection do you recollect it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or whether it should be six shillings or sixteen shillings you do not recollect. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No more can you tell me whether the sum this receipt was uttered for, was twelve shillings and sixpence, or one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the twenty six squares of lead, are not these figures yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are both yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court The twenty six lead squares should be six shilling and sixpence. - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Can you swear that the one before the figure is not yours. - A. Yes, I can; you mean in the first article, that is not my figure.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be sure of it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the one before the two - now can you recollect positively that that is not your hand writing. - It appears very much like my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Beecher, you say that the one before the two is very much like one of your figures - does not the one before the six look very much like one of your figures. - A. Yes; both these one's look very much like my figures.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you venture to swear positively that they are not your figures. - A. No, I would not positively swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. No, you would not - I dare say you would not - could you venture to swear that either the one before the two and the one before the six is not your hand writing - you told me the first one looked very much like your hand writing - can you venture to swear that either of these ones is not your hand writing. - A. Both the ones look like my figures.</p>
               <p>Q. And the one in the sum total does that look very much like it. - A. Yes, both of them do.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would not venture to swear positively considering the life of a fellow creature is at stake upon your evidence that they are not your figures. A. I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have already told me that you do not know from your own recollection whether the sum you received was twelve shillings and sixpence, or one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. I do not recollect any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Does the one to the sum one pound twelve shillings and sixpence appear to have been an alteration since or not. - A. I do not know, it is like the other ones, and they are very much like my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the price of the twenty six squares of lead. - A. It entirely depends upon the size.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you recollect the size. - A. No, there are several different sizes in the chapel; my man brings the size home to me, and I put it on the slate. I take it from that short, I have hardly any recollection about it.</p>
               <p>Court. These two sash squares, what would be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060051"/>the price of them. - A. I do not know the size of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You know the size of them at the chapel. - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are they as big as these (pointing to the windows behind the bench.) - A. Some is and some not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell me what the price of these two sash squares should be. - A. No more than I can tell you when I am going to die. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the twenty six squares of lead, what would be the price of that. - A. They vary much in size.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no recollection what the real value of them is. - A. Some of them would be nine pence, some sixpence, and some fourpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right the twenty six squares in lead might come to sixteen shilling and sixpence. - A. They might come to more.</p>
               <p>Q. And the one's you believe them to be yours. - A. I believe them to be mine.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it. - A. About half after six o'clock in the evening. I was by myself in a chaise cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you stopped. - A. I was met by four men. One man ran up to the horse's head and cut the reins; then that same man that cut the reins came up to the right hand of me, to the step of the chaise cart; the prisoner at the bar came to the left side of me. One man was at the horse's head, and the other stood at the right hand of the shafts on the ground. The prisoner at the bar then unbuttoned my left hand breeches pocket, and the other my right hand breeches pocket; the right hand man took forty shillings from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to you. - A. They told me to stop, they must have my money; I do not know which of them it was; they surrounded me so momently, I could not distinguish who told me to stop. The man on the right hand took out of my breeches pocket, forty shillings in silver, besides a dollar, one of the old dollars, with this king's head upon it; he took every thing out of my right waistcoat pocket; a pencil case, and a few halfpence that were in it. I had two great coats over this; they unbuttoned all my coats, then they saw my watch-chain; the prisoner at the bar says what have you got here, I must have it in a moment; he took hold of the chain, snatched it out; it was a silver watch, there was a chain, seal, and key to it; the seal had my initials on it; from this coat pocket the prisoner took a handkerchief, the fellow to this, and a snuff box; then he asked me what I had got there. I had a silk handkerchief round my neck, I wear it when I am about home, he took it off my neck; one of them said we must have your coat, they pulled my great coat off. Then the prisoner says if he has money it is in the seat, they desired him to search the seat; there was a bundle of empty sacks on the left hand of me, the prisoner says d - n them, let us have them out, he pulled them out on the ground; then he said sir, you must come out. I said be easy I will get out; so I jumped out; the man on the right hand opened the lid of the seat and took a hand basket up, wherein there was a pound of sausages, and half a pound of tea; they took all the things contained in the basket; the same right hand man searched about the straw, he found no money, then he said I am satisfied, and away they went.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of these men any arms. - A. The one on the right hand side of the cart he had a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw any more of them. - A. No, when I was down I asked them if they would help me with the sacks up, they said I might put them up myself. I went to the horse's head, I found the bearing reins, and the long reins all four cut in two. I fastened them up and got on as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing again. - A. Yes, there was something found but not immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You said one man stood on your right hand and the prisoner stood on your left hand; what makes you say it was the prisoner. - A. I could see him while he was robbing of me; I looked under his hat two or three times, he lived with me about eight year and a half ago; he told me he had lived with me at Bow street. I have got a name of Shepherd in my book, I did not know that he had lived with me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you take such observations of him as to know the man. - A. I did. I was as recollected as I am now, I never was more recollected.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive clear in your own mind. - A. Yes, I am that he is the man, as I am of my own existence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not from any circumstance that has happened since, that you believe he is the man. - A. No, when I came down Harlington, I said three of the men I should know again if I saw them, I took such observation of them so as to know three out of the four.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was it that you saw this man. - A. About a fortnight afterwards I was sent for by Mr. Read, the chief magistrate of Bow street, to see if I knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he was the man. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sure he was the man when you saw him about a fortnight afterwards. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman said that he did not know that I lived with him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not know that he had lived with we then; when I was at Bow street he told me he had lived with me, and when I went home I saw the name of

               <p>Q. Are you sure Shepherd is one of them. - A. Yes, and they stopped there about a couple of hours and a half, and the other men stopped there during the day, while they were gone to Uxbridge, except a few minutes that they went to a gentleman's house in Hillingdon; they told me if I saw any one come after them, I was to say they were to come back in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes to the farthest; Hooper and Shepherd came back, and went out again; I asked them if they wanted them gentlemen that were with them, they said yes; I said they would be back almost directly; they all four came back, and went away about five o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is one of those four. - A. Yes; that is the same man that went to Uxbridge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the property or of the robbery; there was no property found on me.</p>

On the 17th of March Mr. Robins sent me to the bankers; about a quarter after five o'clock, coming from the bankers, I called into the house, which I did when I came near the house to see if it was safe; when I left the house that day I double locked it; when I called to see if it was safe it was only on the spring lock, somebody must have picked the lock. Upon going in I did not find any thing particular, I did not look about; I staid in the parlour about ten minutes, I neither heard nor saw any body at all, I double locked the door and went away; I returned about ten minutes past eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure the second time you double locked it again. - A. Yes; and when I came there at a quarter after eight I found it on the single lock again; that struck my mind somebody must be there again; on my opening the door, and going into the house to get a light, I run against a copper in the passage that had been affixed in the back kitchen below; I halloaed out who is there, I heard somebody run up stairs, I pulled the door to and locked it again, and went to the next house but one, a public house, to get a light, and gave an alarm; coming back I saw the prisoner getting out of the parlour window, the sash was up, he was getting over the rails; I laid hold of the prisoner, he ran away, he broke from me, dropped his hat, and crossed the street; I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him. - A. No, I was near him all the way, he only ran to Sidney's alley; I called out Stop, he was stopped, and I was close to him when he was stopped by three or four people; it was in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was stopped was he without his hat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he was the same man that came out of the window. - A. Yes, I hit him two or three times, I hit his nose, or he hit himself against the rails because his nose was bleeding on the top of it. I secured him, and brought him back, when I got into the house I found the copper was removed from the back kitchen into the passage; the lead was inside of it, and going into the parlour, I found the bed which had been removed from the front kitchen, it was in a bureau bedstead; when I left it the bed was worth forty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060053"/>shillings, the copper and the lead about two guineas.</p>

I jumped out of the window.</p>

The pantaloons were found at the pawnbrokers; I had given him them a few days before to give to my taylor to be altered, instead of taking them to the taylors he took them to the pawnbrokers. The boots were at the bootmakers for the purpose of getting a pair made by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent them with him to the boot makers. - A. Yes. The handkerchief was in my room. On the 9th I desired him to produce the things he had of me that I might discharge him; instead of bringing them he offered me a great deal of abuse; he told me that if I paid him his wages I should have my things; if I did not I should have none of them; this was on the eleventh; I owed him for five weeks wages at five shillings a week; I told him he should have his wages as soon as he brought my things, and I was ready to discharge him; the next morning he came with the same abuse as he did before; in consequence of his telling me that the pantaloons were at the taylors, I sent there and found they had not got them; I then caused him to be taken up.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Martin's in the fields. On the 12th of March I was sent to take the prisoner in custody; the prisoner wanted me to let him go; he said he had got nothing of Mr. Vaughn's. I took him to the watchhouse; I found the pantaloons at the pawnbroker's; he said he had sold the boots, as I was taking him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You said you owed him five weeks wages; at the time of this discovery had he made any application to you for wages. - A. Yes, about a week or ten days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then three weeks must be due to him, that is fifteen shillings; how came you not to pay him. - A. I declined paying his wages till he brought them home; I told him so at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, this is a most cruel prosecution that ever was instituted against any man; I am indicted for robbing the prosecutor of a pair of boots and a pair of pantaloons; at the same time he has been owing me a sum of money which he means to deprive me of. I have had the honour of living with his royal highness the duke of Kent, and never was in custody upon the smallest matter before this unfortunate transaction; I have always endeavoured through life to live by my industry; and should have continued so, had not I entered into this house of Mr. Vaughn's, who had nothing to recommend him but poverty and want; I have been his greatest benefactor, and that he well knows; he could not have made the gentleman like appearance he did unless I had made influence with the tradesmen whom I knew, to serve him; and what he has done is to destroy me and deprive me of my wages; I will first of all explain to you how I came in possession of these articles; first of all he gave me a pair of boots which were fitted with clogs for himself. In a few days afterwards I found myself in want of money; I asked him for money; he answered, he had none, he was going to the pay office to get some, he then offered me the pantaloons, I offered to sell them in the house, the servants not buying them and I being in want of money, I pledged them for ten shillings and sixpence; with part of this money I bought breakfast for himself for four days afterwards; I told the prosecutor it was impossible for me to live unless he paid me my wages; he put himself in a passion and swore he would kick me down stairs; I informed him I would no longer remain in his service; finding me determined of quitting his service, he swore he would get me a situation himself if I did not bring him back the pantaloons; he immediately called for a servant, sent him for an officer and he swore at the public office that I had robbed him of a pair of boots and a pair of pantaloons; unfortunately I had no witness to prove that he had given them me; but God is my witness, he did; this matter is only brought on to ruin me for ever.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What are you. - A. I am a lieutenant in the 28th regiment of foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of buying any small articles of you. - A. No. Some boot top liquid he bought which is one shilling; I paid him for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, if you will please to look at that, you will see that he had not a halfpenny in the world. (The prisoner handed a paper to the court.)</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How long had he lived with you. - A. Five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember having this bill presented to you. - A. No, I never saw this before; he bought milk for me six days at sixpence per day; for which I paid him three shillings; Mr. Robinson has been in the habit of finding me breakfast; Mr. Robinson has an account against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that this man has made a claim as being furnished by him. - A. I never received a bill or claim from him but what I paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear it claimed by him till he was taken up. - A. Not a sentence of it. At Bow-street he made a claim for going of messages as well as being a servant, but never before. I agreed to give him five shillings a week, which was adequate to what he did for me; that bill never was presented to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him you would pay him but you must go to the agency office first. - A. I never did assign any reason of that kind.</p>

On the 13th of February the prisoner was finishing the last floor, I said, Davey, you have got boards enough to finish this floor, he said he should want one; there was nobody employed in finishing the floor but him. I found boards put away in a private place; I marked four of them, they remained in the place till the 27th; I found them gone in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we must only enquire about them - on the afternoon of the 27th you found four boards gone away - what is the worth of the four boards. - A. About three shillings and six pence; I went with the constable to the prisoner's room, there I found the boards which I had put the private mark on, they were in the fire place; the prisoner said he had had the boards a long time before he came to work for me; I saw the private mark on them; he had planed them over, but not so as to take out the private mark.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I can take my oath to the man at the bar; I only lost sight of him for a moment when he turned the corner.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday the 19th of February I attended with the search warrant; Mr. Champion and Miss Champion were present; I went to No. 6. Tabernacle walk; they had a shop and a little back room. I read the warrant; then I asked if she had any property in her possession belonging to Mr. Champion; she said none at all; there was a piece of carpet mentioned among other things, I saw it lay on the floor of the back room; Miss Champion believed it to be theirs; a copper was standing on the fire in the back room. Miss Champion believed that to be their property, they had lost such a one. Bishop took a blanket and sheet out of the bed. Miss Champion knew that the prisoner seemed confused, I did not think it prudent to ask her any more questions. In the two rooms the prisoner occupied I found all the articles.</p>

            . - Mr. Bolland. You are assistant elder in the East India Company's warehouse. - A. Yes, I had the care of all the pepper belonging to the company at Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any pepper that had been brought to you by the Lord Nelson. - A. Yes, I had between two and three thousand bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of the pepper that had been brought by the Lord Nelson, been sent to the kiln. - A. Yes, I caused one hundred and twenty damaged bags to be put in parcels of five each.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I suppose you know only from your books, you have no recollection of the circumstance. - A. Yes, I know it from my own memory. On the next morning the 23d of February, one of the East-India company's caravans came to be loaded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. How many bags were put into the caravan. - A. Sixty to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pepper to be sent to the kiln to be dryed for the purpose of using it. - A. Yes, the kiln is in Cutler's street, Honnsditch, in Mr. Barnjum's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoners. - A. I have seen them often with the East India company's caravans. Mr. Barnjum is a master carman; he employed them. I received a note back signifying that five were lost; when I received information that there had been but fifty five delivered instead of sixty, I went to Spitalfields watchhouse, there I examined a sack of pepper.</p>
               <p>COURT. How many sacks did you find there. - A. One; it had been a corn sack, it contained pepper; being out of the company's sack, I could not tell what it weighed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you ascertain who that belonged to. - A. I should suppose the East-India company; because I do not know any other merchants that import pepper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pepper damaged. - A. Yes, the company do not sell pepper in that state; there were certain things found in the pepper that corresponded with the pepper found in the Lord Nelson. In the first place it was damaged pepper, there was paddy and gram, which is something of the tea kind that grows in India, and there were some small stones and some coals, it appeared to me to be in the same state as the pepper I sent brought by the Lord Nelson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I take it for granted that you have a variety of pepper that is damaged. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the sack that you found this pepper in was not the company's sack. - A. No, the company's sacks are marked.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060057"/>Q. If the pepper had been put in the caravan to be taken to the kiln, they were in sacks that belonged to the company - therefore if any pepper was taken away it was taken out of the caravan in the company's bags - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the order given to the carman is that he do not stop on the road, the caravan has two locks on it, one is the companys lock and the other is the King's lock - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not an open cart it is such a cart in which you may see them carry wild beasts about - A. Exactly so; the carman is not entrusted with the key of these locks.</p>

            . I have the care of the kiln in Cutler's street, Hounsditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the caravan arriving at the East India warehouse - A. Yes. On the 23rd of February last; this kiln and warehouse is in Mr. Barnjum's yard; it belongs to the East India company.</p>
               <p>Q. On the unloading was there any deficiency - A. There were fifty five, there were five deficient; I have seen the pepper that was taken from the prisoners; I knew it immediately, it was damaged pepper, there was paddy and gram amongst it; I have no doubt but it was the property of the East India company. It was in a sack marked I. Matravers and co. I knew the prisoners, they were employed as carmen by Mr. Barnjum.</p>
               <p>Court. You know the bags in which the company imports - A. Yes; the pepper bag is larger than the corn sack; the pepper bag contains a hundred pounds neat weight when we send it to the kiln.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity of pepper found at the watchhouse - A. I did not see it weighed; I guess it to be about a hundred and twenty five pounds in my own mind.</p>

            . Q. What are you - A. I am headborough of the parish of Spitalfields. On the 28th of February, about two o'clock in the morning, I was proceeding from the watchhouse with the patrol, our beadle, and the watchhouse keeper; we came into Wentworth street, which is in the middle of Petticoat lane; we came to the corner of the India warehouse; I heard a whispering noise down Harrow alley, upon which I let go Harts arm; he said I will cross over the way and try if he could hear what is going forward; I waited at the corner of the India warehouse half a minute, when a jew man of the name of Levi, came round the corner and ran against me; I had some knowledge of this man and he of me. Levi keeps a house in Petticoat lane; upon which I observed him have his hat on his head, and a man's hat in his hand; I thought things was not right, I crossed over the way; when I first spoke to him he seemed perfectly sober, but when I went on with him to his house about midway he appeared to be perfectly drunk; we followed him to his own steps, he went in; I desired Mr. Hart to wait with me at the corner; we had not waited one moment before the two prisoners came up with the bag of pepper; Levi's house is situated at the corner of Frying Pan alley, and they had just turned the corner of the front of the house; I ran and seized Crozier. Hart took the other with the bag of pepper; we conveyed them to the watchhouse after a deal of trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed at the time of the apprehension - A. They were asked where they got these things; they said somebody asked them to carry it, they did not know who it was nor where they were going to; there were five or six fellows at the moment we took them came with intent as I thought to rescue them; they said d - n your eyes what have you got there, what are you going to do here; the three patrols at that time were about fifty yards off with the two prisoners; Hart fell at that moment with the pepper; with a deal of difficulty I kept them off; in the end I secured the two prisoners and one other man besides, which the magistrate thought fit to let go; the prisoners behaved in an orderly manner themselves.</p>

            . Q. You are beadle and headborough of Christ church parish, Spitalfields - A. Yes; I was with the last witness on duty in Petticoat lane; close by Mr. Levi's house we saw these two men come up; Boot had the pepper on his back, Crozier was close to him; I asked Boot what he had got there; he said he did not know; I catched hold of it, he chucked it off his shoulders; I asked him where he brought it from; he said from Whitechapel end of Petticoat lane; he was carrying it for somebody, he did not know who nor where he was going with it. At the watchhouse I untied the sack and found it was pepper; on the sack was Matravers and co. That is the sack I took from Boot, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rider. The pepper is changed now being in the sack at the time I saw it at the watchhouse; I had no doubt but what it was the same pepper that came with the Lord Nelson, and belonged to the East India company.</p>

I returned to the accompting house and waited about five minutes, I then saw Ingram Wood drive his cart up to his shop door, he got down and was in discourse with his brother Robert; he returned to the cart again and drove the cart to Mr. Hoare's stable putting the tail of the cart to the stable door. I then passed again to the wharf and returned in about three minutes afterwards; and I observed the tail board of the cart being up. I looked in and saw two sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any of the prisoners before you saw the cart. - A. No, I observed M'Quyenny, Nichols, and Groute, at the stable door. Ingram Wood was at the tail of the cart, pulling some straw forward from the hind part of the cart to the forepart; when I returned I saw two sacks, they were full of something. I called M'Yuyenny.

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners. - A. The whole of them. On Tuesday the 29th of March, in consequence of a search warrant, I went to Ingram Wood's stable situated on Frier's hill, Great Hermitage street, accompanied with Gillmer the officer; and Ingram Wood was with us. He gave the officer the key of the stable, and Gillmer opened the door. There I saw a sack and part of another standing on the ground, direct in front of the door from the appearance of these sacks I had no doubt they were the sacks that were taken from the wharf. I asked Ingram Wood if they were the sacks he brought away the night before from the stable, on the wharf in the hearing of the officer; he said they were, and in the same state they then stood. I looked into each sack, one of which contained oats, and the other a mixture of beans; on taking a handful of the beans, I knew them to be the property of Mr. Hoare.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your little girl in the room at the time. - A. Yes, and my wife; I saw a tin box, I asked her if that belonged to her; she said it did, it laid on the top of the bed. I searched that bed I found nothing there; I searched a turnup bed in the same room there I found the copper on the top of it, in a dirty handkerchief, apparently thrown just thrown in.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in copper. - A. Six shillings and fivepence three farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner claim that handkerchief. - A. She did not claim it; she did not deny taking the copper money; after I found it I asked her if she was not ashamed of taking it, and how she could say she had not taken it when the child was looking at her; she made no answer to that; I asked the prisoner to give me leave to search her lodgings; the officer brought some things.</p>
               <p>Q. We cannot enter into that business because they were taken at a different time - you said the drawer was full of halfpence, what sized drawer was it. - A. It was a large wide drawer full of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not tell whether the bulk was less or not. - A. We could not because there were so many in it.</p>

In consequence of information from the prosecutor I went to Mrs. Callam's, King street, Wapping; I saw the prisoner sitting by the fire side; the prosecutor told me that was the man he was in search of. I asked him what he had done with the great coat and the other articles belonging to this man; he at first denied all knowledge of the things. Mrs. Callam knowing me, she told me she would tell the truth - she told me she had sent the great coat by Mrs. Hayes to pawn in Anchor and Hope alley, Wapping. I took the prisoner in custody. On searching him at the office I found three shirts on him, a red flannel one and two check cotton shirts, and a waistcoat; one of these shirts and waistcoat the prosecutor said were his; the landlady gave me the duplicate of the coat. The pawnbroker produced the coat at the office.</p>

I was not a minute after her; I brought the candle down stairs and found she was gone. I asked the people of the house whether she was there, they said no, she was just gone out of the house. I went towards Whitechapel to see if I could find her, I went about a hundred yards farther, I found my money was all gone, it was in a canvas bag, to the amount of eight guineas in gold and silver of different coins, and amongst it was a crown piece that I had taken for a cask of beer of Mrs. Buzzard. I went back to the people of the house and told them that I had been robbed of my money; they said they were very sorry, but they did not know the person. I took the candle and went up to see if it was on the bed; it was not. I went there in about half an hour afterwards, and asked if the person that I had been with was there, they said no; I went about the streets two hours to see if I could see her any where, but could not see her. I went to Lambeth street office the next morning, I met with Mr. Griffiths, I told him I had been robbed of my money in George yard; he went with me to the house and asked the people if they knew the person I was with last night, they said they did not know; we met with her in Crown court, Wentworth street. In searching her we found to the amount of eight pounds three shillings; and amongst it was the crown piece that I had taken that day.</p>

I went to this house in George yard on on the 26th of February, and from there I went to No. 5, Crown court, Wentworth street; there I found the prisoner and another young woman in the room; I asked the prosecutor which was the woman that he complained had robbed him; he pointed out the prisoner. I asked her if she knew any thing about this man's money, she said no; I searched her, found in her pocket two guineas, three half guineas, seven seven shilling pieces, one dollar, called a crown piece, thirty four shillings and three sixpences. I told her I expected that to be the man's money that she had robbed him of; she said no, it was her own money I searched her room I found some duplicates, eight or nine, and one of the duplicates is on the day the robbery was committed; that day she had pledged a gown for twelve shillings; I told her it was very odd she should pledge a gown for twelve shillings when she had got eight pound odd about her; she made an excuse that she did not like the pattern; I desired the prosecutor to look at the money; he did; he pointed out this dollar to be one he had taken on that day; he told me he could take me to the lady that paid it him in Jewry street; I went with him to the lady and shewed her the dollar; the lady said she had paid him the dollar; he described to me that he had lost two guineas, he could not account for the half guineas or the seven shilling pieces; he said in different gold and silver, but he did not account what the pieces were that were taken on that day; there is in the whole eight pounds three shillings; the prosecutor said he had lost in the whole eight guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 6th of April did you lose two pair of stockings from your shop - A. Yes; about half past seven o'clock in the evening, both the prisoners came in, they asked for a pair of black stockings at about two shillings, or half a crown; I shewed them the two shilling ones first; they did not approve of them; I then shewed them two pair of half crown ones, they told me they would not do, they could buy cheaper away they went; scarce a second after they were gone I missed two pair of stockings, that I had in paper and that I shewed them, of the finest sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what value were they - A. Two shillings and sixpence a pair; Mr. Fisher watched them when they were in my shop he came into my shop; he watched them to a pawnbrokers, they offered to pawn them for eighteen pence a pair; I knew the stockings again.</p>
               <p>MR. FISHER. I am a linen draper, 87, Shadwell. On the 6th of April, about half past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners were in my shop; in consequence of suspicion I followed them to Mrs. Norris' shop; I saw them come out. I went in and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060062"/>communicated my suspicion to Mrs. Norris; I saw the prisoner Wezer go into a pawnbroker's shop, about twelve or fourteen doors off; I stood at the pawnbroker's window; I saw Wezer take a pair of black worsted stockings from her right hand pocket and lay them on the counter to pawn; I immediately went to Mrs. Norris, told her the circumstance: she told me she had missed two pair of stockings; I applied to an officer; he and I went together; we detected the prisoners as the pawnbroker was making out the duplicate for the two pair of stockings;

               <p>Q. In the month of April, 1805, and down till lately was the prisoner your clerk. - A. He was; and before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In that character was he entrusted and empowered to receive money on your account. - A. He was; it was part of his business to go out and receive small bills of our customers.</p>
               <p>Q. When he so went out did he carry with him any book. - A. Not generally.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came home what was of course his duty. A. To have paid the money and to have it entered in a day book; and when he paid it in, the first letter of his name, C. was always inserted; he generally accounted to me or Mr. Paulain, junior.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand writing is the bill. - A. The bill and receipt, the whole of the writing part I take to be Mr. Cook's.</p>
               <p>"The amount of the bill is four pound fifteen shillings. Received, April the 26th, 1805, four pound fifteen shillings;" the bill delivered up to lady day last in the day receiving book. On that day he accounted with Mr. Paulain, Junior.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness, sir, to look at the entry, 26th of April, 1805; do you find that he accounted with you for the sum of four pound fifteen shillings as received from Mr. Tipcap. - A. He did not.</p>

            , JUNIOR. Q. I ask you, sir, whether on the 26th of April the prisoner accounted to you for the sum of four pound fifteen shillings, as received from Mr. Tipcap. - A. He never accounted to me for that sum of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness, sir, to refer to your ledger, to Mr. Tipcap's account; do you find any entry there of January 12th, cash - two pound five shillings. - A. Yes. and June 1st, cash two pound ten shillings; both 1805.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these two entries your hand writing, - A. They are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they like yours. - A. At first sight; not when I come to look at them; the two first are not mine.</p>

            Independent of the two, who are the persons that made the entries in that book. - A. I was one, and Mr. Levasque the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cook use to make any entries in that book - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at these two entries, at the hand writing; are you able to form any belief whether they are or are not written by the prisoner - A. I have very little doubt but they are written by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are to tell us from the character of the hand writing; from the mode in which you have observed the prisoner to write, not from any suspicion you have, but merely from the characters of the hand writing, abstracted from all other circumstances. Do you believe that is his his hand writing - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Lavesque. Look at these two entries, you are not to contract into your consideration any thing of your suspicion from the appearance of the hand writing; whose hand writing do you believe it to be - A. I believe it to be the hand writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. This book in which these two entries are made is your ledger - A. Yes, and that ledger is copied from the day book; we never make any original entries in the ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any entry in the day book upon which this entry was copied - 
               <persName id="t18080406-89-person858">A. </persName>
            There is none.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you balance your accounts - A. Once a year.</p>
               <p>Q. This offence is stated to be three years ago; you must have had three postings of your annual accounts and never brought the charge against him till now - A. No; not till we found it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not your customers complained that money which they have paid has been again charged to them, and whether on examination Mr. Paulain, junior, has received the money of your servant and has not accounted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060063"/>it by mistake - A. Such a thing has happened.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, have you not had a complaint made by your customers of a sum of money being charged a second time which has never been accounted for by Mr. Paulain Jun. when it has turned out to be paid to Mr. Paulain - A. I never knew such an instance but once; that was more than two years ago; that was to the best of my belief the sum of three pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not found fault with the slovenly manner in which Mr. Paulain Jun. kept his accounts - A. I have done it several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that book, is that entry the handwriting of the prisoner - A. I believe it to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you from that belief upon the handwriting of the figures - A. I form it upon this opinion, that no person with us could have written it but Mr. Cook, except Mr. King, who can write that hand.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all I want. Had not Mr. Paulain an opportunity of looking at the book every day and every night, when he settled your accounts - A. He had.</p>

               <p>Q. You have your table beer of Mr. Levasque; did you make any payment for beer on the 6th of October last - A. Yes, I paid it to the prisoner, he gave me that receipt for the ten shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. LEVASQUE. Q. Was the prisoner in your employ as <rs id="t18080406-91-deflabel519" type="occupation">drayman</rs>

               <p>Q. Have the goodness to look at that receipt and tell me whether that is his handwriting - A. I have no doubt of it, (the receipt read.)</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner carried out beer on the dray, when he came home at night he was either to account with you for the beer or bringing the money A. By bringing the account where he left the beer, or by bringing the money; this is the book that we keep for the purpose; in this book there is an entry of beer delivered to Mr. Owen, not paid the book is all in his hand writing; when he comes home at night; that book is the account he renders.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that sum of ten shillings ever paid - A. No. On the 15th of March, I informed him of this charge; he at first denied it. I shewed him his book and the receipt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Has it not happened repeatedly in your business, the men have omitted to render the exact account, and on some future day has it not been rectified - A. Such a circumstance has happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not happened with the prisoner that he has made a mistake with one customer for another; and on a subsequent day he has rectified that mistake - A. It has not been so in that case.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, sir; you must tell me upon your oath - A. He has done so.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had accounted with your partner, Mr. Paulin jun. that would have been an answer to your complaint, are your books here which contain the entry's of different payments, to this man that have been accounted - A. I have the books here.</p>
               <p>Q. In that book that young gentleman who has been examined he has made entry's of money paid as well as you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PAULIN, JUN. - Mr. Gurney. You have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060064"/>looked at the entry in that book - A. Yes, the prisoner's book. He did not account any thing with me for that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. All that you can say according to your recollection; the man has not accounted to you - A No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They make a great many mistakes I can prove it clearly they have made mistakes in the book and have scratched it out themselves. Mr. Levasque has said he never saw books kept like these, for they was always scratching and altering them; if I did not pay Mr. Levasque, I paid Mr. Paulain, or Mr. Cook. Mr. Thompson in Giltspur street, it was down paid, they sent the bill in again and I could recollect forty places. I never kept a sixpence belonging to them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q Is there any account of money received - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever apply to you on any subsequent period to rectify any mistake on that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Must he either bring back the beer or account to you of the several customers he has delivered beer to - A. He must.</p>
               <p>Q. If he takes out thirty barrels and delivers twenty he is to deliver an entery of the persons he has delivered to - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Mr. Cook was authorised to receive money as well as you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether he received it is impossible for you to tell - A. It is not, in that book the book is filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not had that book in your hands ever since it has been filled up - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other gentleman that has been examined, he also received money occasionally - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you charged this ten shillings to Mr. Cook - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Has not Mr. Owen been a ready money customer - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Knowing that Mr. Owen paid you regular, why did not you ask for that money when he had the beer - A. We have many customers that pay regular; omit one and pay two the next time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Whether the prisoner accounted to you or young Mr. Paulain, or Mr. Cook, it would be entered at the bottom of the book - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it would be corrected in that book if any error was made - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The book comes down to almost the end of the year, therefore he had the opportunity of referring back to this entry - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any alteration been made in that entry, the entry in question of Mr Owen - A None.</p>
               <p>Court. After the book is full and delivered up to you, supposing the man had said, I find I have made a mistake, I ought to have mentioned ten shillings, would it have been entred in that book. - A. No; it would have been entred in a subsequent book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever make any application to you. - 
               <persName id="t18080406-92-person892">A. </persName>

On the 15th March, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with this axletree and a wrench; I asked him where he was going with it; he said what was that to me; he was going to mend it; I clapped my hand against it, I told him I thought it did not want mending.

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at your master's house - A. Yes; about a quarter after two o'clock in the morning on the 5th of April I found him in the pantry, it adjoins the kitchen, under the stone steps of the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in the pantry at that time - A. The housemaid got up at that time to washing, she came and alarmed me. On opening the kitchen door I found him laying fast asleep. I did not wake him; he was searched in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken from his person - A. I saw about a pound and a half of beef laying by the side of him, on the floor. I desired the watchman to come in and take him; the watchman asked him what he came there for; he said he came to take a nap. The watchman locked him up in a room and went to get further assistance, he broke out of the room where he was locked up and made to the hall; I secured him in the hall after a violent scuffle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This poor fellow broke out after you locked him up in the cupboard - A. Yes; I dare say I should have done the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he partly drunk - A. He was partly so. There were some eggs in the pantry, he had them in his pocket, they were broke. He must have got in over the iron rails of the area.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no damage done; I believe you have taken pains since to find that this poor creature is of reputable connections - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Yesterday week I was going my beat, I met this servant at the corner of the street, with a poker in his hand, he told me there was a man in the pantry; I went with him to the house, the servant opened the pantry, there I saw the prisoner; he was just on his feet, hustling about as if he was half asleep; I asked him what he was doing there; he hum'd and ah'd a good while, at last he said he was taking a snooze; by the side of him was about a pound and a half of beef; the flour was scattered about the area; the servant said there were eggs in the flour tub; I found them in one of his pockets and butter in the other; I locked him up in a little room under the kitchen stairs while I went out and got the patrol; he took the butter and eggs into this little room; there was nothing at that time taken from him; at the time I was out he escaped from that little room and got into the hall; the house was searched by the patrol; we did not find any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060066"/>broke; he had a pair of boots that he brought with him; he could give very little account how he got them we found no picklock key nor iron crow upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you as if he was drunk - A. I dare say he was; he was drowsy.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WEBB. I am a shoemaker; I live in Marchment-place, Little Coram-street; I was passing along Great Coram-street; I heard the alarm of thieves being in the house, by the servant maid out of a two pair of stairs window; I knocked at the door, I said if they wanted any assistance there was some at the door. The footman opened the door with the prisoner in one hand; I collared him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be drunk - A. He did not appear to me to be altogether drunk, he seemed confused; he was bleeding freely from a blow that he received from the footman.</p>

            . I am a boot maker, I live in Apollo court, Fleet street; I was going by Mr. Foulkes shop on the 24th of March, between two and five o'clock, I saw two men engaged in taking away this baize from the door post,; I did not suspect them taking the property until they got to the corner of the gateway, which gave me me suspicion; then they ran hastily.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the piece of baize secured - A. It was under a chain; one end fastened in the shop and the other end at the door post, there was some difficulty in getting it away; he was half a minute in getting it from under the chain. I am certain the prisoner is one of the men that assisted in getting it out, and he was the man that ran away with it, I informed Mr. Foulkes's people of it. I pursued the prisoner; he heard the boy cry stop thief; he dropped the baize in Stewards rents; I passed the baize and caught him before he got to the bottom of the court. I assisted in bringing him back to the shop.</p>

On the 26th of February, on my return home at nine in the evening, I was informed by my family that my son, who had returned about a quarter of an hour before, had detected the woman prisoner. In consequence of that I heard he was in the prisoner's house waiting till my return; I went to the prisoner's house and found him there. When I got in the woman prisoner was in the lower room; she asked me what business I had there; I told her I wanted to go up stairs; she violently resisted, she told me she would stab me, I had no business there without a search warrant, if I attempted to go up stairs she would swear a robbery against me. My son, as I suppose, on hearing my voice, called down stairs for me to go up; I went up in the two pair of stairs room, where I found my son; there was a saw and small hatchet, and staves split to pieces, a great quantity of it there.</p>

            's Defence. I am a poor distressed man with four small children; I have lived in the prosecutor's house five years, he is the only person in the neighbourhood that wishes me not well; he has since I have been here turned my children out of doors; my neighbours have taken them in till they know the event of my trial. My wife told me she bought the canvas of the prosecutor's wife for a bed tick; she told me she bought the staves of a labouring man, and the flannel of the prosecutor's daughter.</p>

Yes; I rung it on the table, it was a good one; she afterwards brought me a different one; it did not ring; the first rung as well as any seven shilling piece could; the second sounded like lead; I then came out and asked the prisoner how she could offer a bad seven shilling piece; she said it was a good one; I told her the changes had been attempted to be rung on me; it would not do now, it was the fourth time; she then said it was a good one to the best of her knowledge, she would go with me to where she took it. I refused going till the constable came; when he came I told her I would go any where with her: she attempted to get it out of my fingers; she got it between her fingers but not so as to get possession of it.

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to you. - A. Yes, on the 15th of February, near two o'clock in the day, she told me she came by the order of Miss Sarah Lisley, of High Wickham, Buckinghamshire; she was to look out some handkerchiefs and lace; about two years since I had seen the prisoner at Miss Lisley's. I had no doubt but what it was right, she said she wanted them on Miss Lisley's account; I shewed her some silk handkerchiefs. I gave full credit to her story.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was Miss Lisley a customer of yours. - A. She was, and is now. She looked at eight pieces of bandana silk handkerchiefs, six pair of silk stockings, and some lace.</p>
               <p>Q. How many silk handkerchiefs altogether. - 
               <persName id="t18080406-102-person965">A. </persName>

               <p>Q. How many yards of lace. - A. One hundred and nine value thirty five pound, six shillings and one penny. After they was looked out, she told me she must take them with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060068"/>her, to go down by the coach that runs through High Wickham, as some officers who were customers of Miss Lisley would be disappointed if Miss Lisley had not the handkerchiefs after the parcel was entered and tied up; I went down to the Bull and Mouth, put the parcel into the seat of the coach, and assisted the prisoner to get into the coach, then I parted with her. I made Miss Lisley debtor for it in my books.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see miss Bumstead. - A. She ordered a piece of black silk handkerchief to be sent down to Miss Lisley; that is the way I discovered the fraud.</p>
