                  </hi>. I am sub-postmaster at Shepherdess Walk, City Road—in consequence of communications made to me and specimens of handwriting, I watched for someone to present a postal order—on 9th May I had cashed a postal order for 5s. to a person representing himself as George Miller, who signed the order in my presence—the writing on that order corresponded with certain writing shown to me—on that day a Post Office official came to me, and in consequence of what he said I took notice of the prisoner when he came on the 13th and pre<lb/>sented a blank postal order for 5s., issued from Dunn's, Berwick-on-Tweed—I recognised him as the same man who had cashed the order on the 9th—I said, "Fill up the order"—he filled it up in the name of G. Davis, Shepherdess Walk—he signed the receipt for it, and I gave him the money, and he went away—I gave my wife certain instructions—an order would not be paid unless the name at the bottom was the same as that at the top—if he had written "Davies, p. p. George Miller", he would have had to state his connection, and we should have made inquiries—my wife followed Miller when he left, and in consequence of what she com<lb/>municated to me I wrote on the back of the orders the address where she traced him to, 3, Radnor Street, St. Luke's—I afterwards saw Miller in custody, and identified him; I have no doubt about him.</p>

               <p>Department of the Post Office—in consequence of information I searched the postmen's address book, and found that Andrews lived at 3, Radnor Street—I sent Moxam there, where Miller was staying with his brother-in-law, Andrews—Moxam brought Miller to the Police-station—I showed him the order signed "G. Miller", and asked him what he knew about it—he said, "It was sent to Mrs. Andrews by her sister, a Mrs. Birch, who was a servant at Westgate-on-Sea; I filled it up and signed it at the post-office in Shepherdess Walk"—I produced to him the other order for 5s. issued by Dunn at Berwick-on-Tweed, and said, "This order has been cashed at the Shepherdess Walk Post-office this morning by a person answering your description; what do you know about it? The hand<lb/>writing on it is similar to the writing on the order you have admitted cashing"—he said, "I have not cashed an order at the Shepherdess Walk office this morning"—before I had my conversation with Miller I had had a conversation with Andrews—he had not been given into custody; he was still in the office—between the examinations of Andrews and Miller there was sufficient time for the officer to go to Radnor Street and bring Miller—I afterwards confronted Miller with Andrews—I said to Miller, "Your brother-in-law, Andrews, says he stole that order out of a letter and gave it to you to cash?"—he said, "Yes, I did it"—I said, "What have you done with the 5s.?"—he said, "Spent it in <hi rend="italic">booze "</hi>—I asked him to write his name on a piece of paper, and he wrote this, "G.

I am the wife of John Smith, of 12, Ware Street, Kingsland Road—on 14th May, about one in the morning, I was in Great Eastern Street—I was stopped by a female with a baby in her arms—the prisoner was on the opposite side of the road with another man; he came across, pushing his cap over his eyes and staggering as if he was drunk—he took two shillings and sixpence out of my hand, struck me on the head with his fist, and ran across the road and gave the money to the other man; and he said to me, "If you follow me I will rip you up"—he ran down a street; I followed, calling, "Stop thief!" and he was stopped—I went to the station with him, and he said he would not let me go out of there alive, he would be revenged on me that night.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 2, Clairville, Hanwell—on 14th he came home about 3. 30 p. m., and I opened the door to him—he came in and I asked him to come to dinner—he called me a bad name, and went upstairs to our bedroom and called me up—I did not go up—he then came to the middle of the stairs, about half way down, and I noticed that he had a revolver and was pointing it at his head—he said, "Come and say good-bye"—I saw his hand move, and immediately went into the dining-room, and the revolver went off and struck the wall two or three yards from me—I went out of the house and called a neighbour in—on my return the prisoner was in my bedroom, standing by the door, and taking his hand from a tin box in the room—he did not say anything—I again asked him to come to dinner—I informed the police the same day between four and five o'clock—after I returned with the neighbour, Mr. Halker, the prisoner went out at a little after four o'clock and came back alone in half an hour—I opened the door to him; he swore at me—he was the worse for liquor, he had been <hi rend="italic">so</hi> all the time, and I thought for my safety and his I had better go for the police, and left the house—he said in his excitement that he would blow my brains out—he had nothing in his hand then, but I saw that he had the revolver in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire—at 12. 15 a. m. on 19th May I left the House of Commons and was going along Parliament Street towards the Grand Hotel, Charing Cross, where I was staying, when I met six or eight men coming in the opposite direction, who caused a slight stoppage in the street—in passing through them one of the party put his hand on my arm, and with the other hand wrenched open my waistcoat and tore away my watchchain, and rushed across Parliament Street, dodging between some cabs and vehicles passing—he escaped—some of the other men walked straight on—the prisoners were all of the party—they were all collected round me—I did not observe the prisoners' faces before my chain was snatched—I am sure they are three of the men—on losing my chain I found myself surrounded by the men, amongst whom I recognised the prisoners—after the man ran across the road the prisoners walked on together towards the House of Commons—I stopped, and the police came up and followed them, and stopped them when they had gone about twenty yards, and they were taken to the station—I followed the constable—I think the other men had disappeared then—the men surrounded me and pressed round me, and gave an opportunity for the man who stole my chain to seize hold of me—the chain was worth £10—I found the watch afterwards in my pocket.</p>

I was on the opposite side to the Red Lion on this morning, and saw nine or ten men walking by, and appa<lb/>rently larking—I heard a man call out, "That man has got my watch"—the prosecutor was standing with his coat and vest undone, and his umbrella raised as if to strike the three prisoners, who were walking rapidly away together—I saw a man run behind a cab, and other men running back towards Charing Cross—I ran across the road, and seized Bartlett by the collar from behind; as I did so Piggott <hi rend="italic">ducked</hi>, but I seized him, and took them to the station—in answer to the charge Keeble and Bartlett said they were innocent—Piggott made no answer.</p>

On the way to the station Piggott said, "I am innocent; I was not with Keeble"—he said he was with Bartlett, and they were going home—he gave me a correct address at the station—he told me at the station he had worked at Messrs. Cassell's—I went there and found he had worked as a casual labourer since May 4th—he worked there at night time; he would go at night and be taken on when he was wanted, and come back when he was not wanted—I found he joined the Printers' Labourers' Union on 1st May—I found out nothing against his character.</p>

I am very often in the West<lb/>minster Bridge Road—I think Piggott is a little more than nineteen; I have known him since he was quite a lad—I have been looking for him since he was gazetted last August—I knew it was no use going to his father's house, because if you inquire they say that he lives there, but he never does—I made inquiries and found he had moved from Joiner Street; no one knows where he lives—I went to Joiner Street once and found his brother with two prostitutes in the room, and Piggott had got out the back way—he has four brothers—I have not been to Holloway Prison for a month or more—it is the duty of detective officers to go there to see if they can identify prisoners, if they are not engaged otherwise—the police<lb/>man in this case told me in the Court that he had made inquiries about Piggott—I have only told him since he gave evidence what I know about Piggott—I came into this Court when the tot constable was giving evidence—my colleague was here when I came into Court—I told the policeman when he came out of the box that something was known against Piggott—Piggott has been twice convicted at Southwark Police-court in my presence, once for assault and once for failing to make his annual training in the militia—that was last spring.</p>

About one a. m. on Sunday, 23rd April, I was standing at the corner of Greenfield Street—I followed an old gentleman and a woman to Whitehall Court, in Greenfield Street—I saw two men and a woman come up Guildford Street—as they went through the court about two minutes afterwards I heard someone crying for help—I ran up Greenfield Street and saw two women and a man pass—looking down Guildford Street I saw two men kicking the man who was lying in the road—as the prisoner passed me I caught him by his handkerchief and said, "What's the matter?"—he said, "Nothing; you have made a mistake"—I said, "Let us see what mistake is made", and took him up to the old man who appeared unconscious, but immediately he saw the prisoner he said, "That's him, hold him"—I saw the prisoner through the court kick the prosecutor—he was the last to run down Guild<lb/>ford Street—the prosecutor was taken to the station, and I took the prisoner to the station, where he was charged with robbing the old gentle<lb/>man of £7 and a scarf-pin—he made no answer.</p>

I am a commercial traveller, of 7, Parade, Cardiff—I was present on 29th September, 1880, when the prisoner was married to Ruth Sanders at Christchurch, Burton—she was my mother's sister—in the autumn of 1881 they left England for South Africa—the prisoner afterwards returned to England, leaving his wife out there—in 1890 I saw the prisoner on several occasions at Burton-on-Trent—we frequently spoke of his wife—she sent me money for him, and we discussed about their rejoining—I know my aunt's writing quite well—this letter of June 24th, 1890, is her writing—it begins "My darling Monte", is addressed to the prisoner, and was sent to me by him enclosed in this letter of July 19th, 1890—I also produce a bundle of letters marked and received from 1890 to 27th November, 1892, by me from my aunt, and I have received one since—I received this letter in May, 1891, from the prisoner, in which he alludes to his wife as alive, and says he has no intention of deserting her.</p>

On Wednesday night, 26th April, I was. on special duty at the tack of Mr. Gladstone's house in Downing Street—my beat extended from Treasury Passage round to the Downing Street steps—Treasury Passage goes under some of the houses in Downing Street from the Horse Guards Parade; it is closed at ten at night, and the gates at the top of the steps are closed at ten—about ten minutes to twelve I was standing in the shade at the angle of the wall—I saw a man come across the Horse Guards Parade from the direction of Carlton House Terrace—he passed where I was, and walked towards Downing Street steps—as far as I could see he did not notice me—when he had gone some eight or nine yards I called out to him; he stopped when I</p>

               <p>called out, just underneath the lamp, about fifty yards this side, of the steps—I called out, "You can't go that way, the gate is looked", and immediately he turned round towards me, and fired one shot from the revolver—I stepped back and peeped from the corner, so as to be under cover, to get out of his way; as I aid that I noticed him coming towards me—I stepped from the corner to a small tree about five yards from where I was standing first, and as he was just getting on to the corner I saw him put his hand underneath the right-hand tail of his jacket; thinking that he had put the revolver away, I made a small circle round to get at the right-hand side of him—I was walking rather quick so as not to excite his attention—I did not know whether he could see me or not, and when I got to the right-hand side of him I threw his right arm over his left shoulder and clasped him round the body, and felt the revolver in his pocket—he said, "It's all right; I don't want to shoot you, policeman"—asked him what he was doing with it—he said, "I was only just having a look at it and putting it straight; I generally carry one when I come across a place like this"—I told him I should take him into custody for firing this revolver off—he said, "I hope you won't say I tried to shoot you, policeman"—I blew my whistle, another constable came, and we all hree went to the King Street Station together—on the way he kept on saying, "It was an accident"—he was charged at the station with wan tonly firing the revolver—he said, "Not wantonly, accidentally"—the revolver is a five-chambered one; one chamber was empty; five had been loaded and one was discharged—at the station I searched him, and took from his pocket this memorandum-book; he took it out of my hand and handed it to the Inspector, saying, "You might as well keep this".</p>

Say something about it in the House to-night, I am going away to the country. You gave me such a shock yesterday, looking so cheerful and happy—such a look of my own father. A quiet day with Nature will quiet my nerves. I had never seen you before. Tour appearance compelled me to raise my hat in respect. I had been waiting for you since morning. After reading the news on Saturday, I left my home, wife, and little ones. If you are removed, 'the bill is dead as Queen Anne. 'Was in Brighton on Sunday, expecting to find you there. If it had not been for my sudden revulsion of feeling, nothing could have saved either of us yesterday. I could have fired six shots before anyone could have had a hand on me. This is to give you another chance. I have such a high opinion of your cleverness that I firmly believe that if you so will it that Bill will become law in spite of Salis bury, Balfour, Chamberlain, and the Lords. But it shan't, if by taking one life or two (yours and mine), I can save the lives of hundreds, perhaps thousands of loyal Ulstermen. Surely that is a sufficient justification.

Yesterday I watched the entrance from a seat opposite nearly the whole day, which I wasted through being afraid of raising suspicions by making inquiries. I must not do so again. A few inquiries save a lot of time, but I must keep cool. This strain on my mind is terrible. Poor Emma, I wonder how she is to I hope that I shall get it over quickly, then she will know the worst. The revolver sticks a bit. I must manage with five cartridges; surely that will be sufficient for us both I cannot draw back now; I must do my duty. Tell Mr. Liversedge that I have served him faithfully. I am now in a hansom waiting for the.—" "12. 30 p. m.—There is no sign yet; I have waited for more than an hour." "Tuesday, April 25th.—I hung round Downing Street nearly the whole of yesterday. I saw an old gentleman in uniform come out of No. 10, but I took very little notice of him, although I learned afterwards that it was really him. About 4. 30 p. m. a private carriage drove up, and an old gentleman drove away in it. That was him, too. I was close to him when he got in, within eight yards, and very few people were about; but I was so surprised at his appearance that it gave me quite a shock. He seemed so happy and cheerful, and had such a look of my own father that, instead of doing as I had intended, I felt com pelled to raise my hat in respect to his cheerful nod and smile. I then hurried away into Hyde Park, and, dropping into a chair, I never moved for two solid hours, indulging in a silent weep to relieve my nerves." "Wednesday, April 26th.—There is no sign of an answer to my note. I expect that they would not allow him to see it, or else he puts me down as a mad Orangeman, and of no account; but we shall see".</p>

I live at 173, Thelwall Road, Sheffield—I am the prisoner's brother—my father is very ill, and unable to attend—the pri soner is thirty-six years of age—he left school at the age of sixteen—he was then apprenticed to Messrs. Turner, Taylor and Marples, of Sheffield—he got on well there, also at school—he was a boy of intelligence, and passed several examinations with credit and honour—in the spring of 1877 he suddenly left his employment and enlisted as a soldier—after four or five months he was eventually bought out, and he returned to Messrs. Turner's—next year he married his cousin, Emma Townsend—I believe he lived happily with her—I never knew or heard of any quarrel between them—between that time and 1882 everything went on quietly—in March, 1882, he suddenly left home, leaving a letter saying that he was going to South America—he gave no reason for it—he left no provision for his wife and children—he did not in fact go to South America—he turned up in Sydney, South Australia—we heard of him there about two months after he left home—he sent a telegram to his wife, with the single word "Hope", no name or address—he afterwards wrote to the effect that he had obtained a good situation with a firm in Sydney—in December, 1882, he returned to England—in the following February he went out to Sydney again, taking his wife and children with him—we heard nothing except what was satisfactory for some time, he had obtained the situation,—while in Australia he disappeared several times—eventually he dis appeared again, leaving his wife and children unprovided for in Australia, and in July, 1888, she returned to England with her children, and without him—she did not know where he was—I don't think he used to write to her—she went to live at Kenilworth—I next saw the prisoner in October, 1889, at my father's house at Brentwood—he was then in a very poor condition as regards clothes and appearance—my father supplied him with money, and he tried to obtain a situation—a few days afterwards my father received a letter from him; I saw the letter—it was in my brother's handwri ting; the purport of it was that he had lost all his money, and he was going to take a walk through the Endcliff Woods in Sheffield, which we construed to mean that he was going to commit suicide—there are several dams of water in those woods—he saw his wife for one night at Kenilworth—he went to Pontefract and slept in the workhouse while there—he afterwards reappeared at my father's house in a much poorer condition than before—my father took him in, and in the course of a few weeks he entered the employ of Mr. Liversedge—he attended to his business there with regularity, and in April, 1891, he disappeared from there without any warning—he sent a letter to my father—I took it out of the letter-box and opened it; it was in my brother's writing—I have not got the original, it is lost; I took a copy of it at the time, this is it: "April 27th, 1891,—Dear father, old John knows nothing about your visit last night. However did you manage to get in? When I awoke and found you at my bedside I was astonished, but understood everything you said, as well as your wishes. Although he may have escaped in a court of law, however will he manage to get away without being seen? I will follow him from Birkenhead side; he shall not escape. You must explain my absence to the boys: better say Emma is ill, and I have had to go to her. I will be very careful; I</p>

I live at Sheffield—I have known the prisoner's family between eighteen and twenty years—I have attended his father for that time—I have had opportunities of observing the character and conduct of the prisoner—I can quite corroborate the history of his life as related by his brother; I have known him all the time since his first lapse—in October, 1889, and at other times his father consulted me with regard to him—in consequence of that I examined him with regard to his mental condition—he was then at his father's factory; he is a jet ornament manufacturer—he had suddenly arrived from Australia, at eleven at night, at his father's house, dressed like a tramp; and I saw him next day at his father's request, at the factory—I had a general conversation with him—he did not appear to be at all alive to the seriousness of having left his wife and family in Australia totally unprovided for—he did not appear as if he could assign any reason—I knew of his delusion with regard to his cousin—from my examination of him I could find nothing definite to act upon; to fix upon to control him—we all hoped for the best—I did not consider that he was a person of clear intellect, and have never done so for a good many years—I should say he has a brain of very great instability, and that, for the time being, he had become temporarily insane—there is a form of insanity which is called "recurrent moral mania", which comes on in fits, leaving the patient with impaired intellect, rendering him, whilst the fit is on him, absolutely unaccountable for his actions—at other times he would be able to act like other men to a certain extent—when the fit is over he would be likely to forget what had passed—a sudden interruption of the mania would have a tendency to pull him together, but I think he would scarcely remember what he had been doing—the fact of the prisoner's grandmother and uncle having died insane would lead one to expect to find such symptoms—I attended his mother in March, 1884, for brain irritation, congestion, and coma; not what I should call insanity, pressure of fluid on the brain—I think she would have had softening of the brain had she got better of that attack; it leads to softening of the brain—</p>

I am a scalesman to George Richard May and others, trading as Gee and May, at 80, Central Meat Market—on 5th May Mr. Jones, a customer, purchased three lambs, and agreed to give £4 1s. 4d. for them—I then pinned a piece of paper, with his name, on to them—shortly after, George Shaw, a porter in the market, came into our shop and applied for three lambs in the name of Jones—as he was a licensed porter I took his application to be genuine, and gave him the lambs, and he carried them away, turning to the right on leaving the shop.</p>

I was a licensed meat porter at the Central Meat Market for about three months—I am twenty-one years old—I had known the prisoner before 5th May for about nine months as a salesman in a shop in Charterhouse Street—I had fetched meat out of the market for him, which he had sent me for—on the morning of 5th May I was working with Arthur Garrett in the market—we finished work about half-past ten, and then we went for a walk round the market—I saw the prisoner outside his shop about twelve o'clock, and said, "Will you have anything if I bring it to you?"—he said, "Yes"—I then went round the market, and Garrett went into Gee and May's shop and had a look round and came out, and told me there were three lambs for Jones—there was a piece of paper on the lambs with the name: Jones—I went in and asked for the three lambs in the name of Jones, and they let me take them away—I took them straight away to the prisoner's shop, and left them there with the scalesman; the prisoner was not there then—Garrett was with me—we then went home—after we had been home a considerable time my father came for me and told me I was. wanted down in the market—I went to Gee and May's, and was there given into custody and taken to the Police-station—I was discharged—about half-past four I saw the prisoner in his shop; he motioned me to go into the public-house near (I don't know the name)—I went in—I saw the prisoner there; he asked me what I wanted for the lambs—I said, "£3"—he said, "No, I will give you £2"—he gave me two sovereigns, which I took—the following week I was arrested again on a warrant—before that the meat market inspector had seen me, and I had made a statement to him—after being arrested on the warrant I was brought up at the Guildhall—I pleaded guilty to stealing the lambs, and was sentenced to twenty-one days' hard labour—I am now undergoing that sentence.</p>

Last Friday week he brought three lambs, and he said, 'I have to bring you three lambs to be sold.' He said, 'You had two sheep yesterday,' I was at Cambridge the day previous. He said, 'When they are sold I will come for the account of them; you must book them in the name of Mr. Shaw, and place the sheep in the same account. When they are sold I will take the money for them. 'I was to sell them for a Mr. Shaw. I did not know the prisoner's name was Shaw. I did not take Mr. Shaw's address. I did not know what the prisoner's name was. I did not ask his name or address or Mr. Shaw's. There was no other conversation; he left the lambs there; there was no suggestion as to how much they were to be sold for; I gave him no money at the time; an hour and a half afterwards I saw the prisoner again; the lambs had been brought in, and I had sold them in the meantime; the prisoner came for the money. I sold them to a Mr. Bradford. I gave the prisoner the money in the shop. I said, 'Here's the account; I have sold them the best I can. 'In<lb/>cluding</p>

                  </hi>. I am a meat salesman, of 99, Charterhouse Street—I have been in Charterhouse Street twenty years—I sell meat there on commission, and buy meat as well right out—I have different customers in all parts of the country, who send me meat—the prisoner has a share of my shop—T have known him twenty-five years—he never had any stain on his character in his life—on Thursday, 4th May, he was not in London; he went to Cambridge, and came back on Friday—on that Thursday Shaw brought in two sheep, which I sold on the same day for the prisoner to Dain—on the prisoner's return I informed him there had been in two sheep for him, and I had sold them for him—I have an entry of the transaction in my day-book: "Thursday, 4th May, two sheep. Sold to Dain, £6 2s. 8d.; not paid"—I had to give Dain credit—I had sold meat to Dain before, and had an account with him—there is "J. H". against the entry—the prisoner and I are not partners—it is my shop, and we are independent—if he was</p>

               <p>away I should represent him, and if I was away he would represent me, and if opportunity arose for me to sell meat for him I should sell it—great confidence is placed in the market porters as respectable characters and men we should trust; we trust them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never got a man a situation as porter in the market—I think a man has to get two salesmen to sign for him, either one or two, and then he becomes a licensed porter—the sheep are entered sepa rately, they generally weigh them separately—it was about nine a. m. on 4th May, I should say, when Shaw brought the two sheep in—they were hung up—my own meat is marked "J. P". and the prisoner's "J. H"—the number corresponds with the sender—when there is no number against the entry, it means my own meat that I have bought; when there is nothing against an entry it means meat that is bought in the market; when "J. P". is put it means meat bought alive from the Cattle Market—when Shaw brought the sheep on the 4th, he carried them there together and hung them up—I did not say anything to him—I never spoke to him in my life; never had any transactions with him—anyone brings in anything he likes and hangs it up—Shaw delivered them to my man and went out, leaving them there—my man spoke to me; he is" here—I do not know anything of what was said by Shaw about the sheep except what my man told me—Dain paid me for the sheep about a fortnight after, I should think—I have the entry of the payment in another book which is not here—I should enter it into the cash-book at the end of the week, and when it is paid I cross it off—I can send for that book—when it was paid I gave the money to the prisoner—he keeps a book or two, but he keeps his accounts very illite rately; he does not keep his accounts like mine—I have only seen a little book in which he puts down the meat he has sold—this is his book. (<hi rend="italic">Pro duced</hi>).—I was there on Friday the 5th; I was not there when Shaw came with the lambs—I was there all day from 5. 30 a. m. till three or four p. m., but I don't stop in the shop all the time—I did not see Shaw on either occasion, on Friday when he came—the prisoner came to the shop on Friday morning, end was there all day practically—I did not hear anything of Shaw having got into trouble over these lambs, till Mears came to me a day or two after<lb/>wards, I should say—until then the prisoner had not told me anything about trouble over the lambs—when I came back from market I think: I saw the three lambs, and the prisoner sold them to Bradford—I had no con versation with the prisoner about them.</p>

("Shortly after Mr. Payne came back, and I told him there were two sheep for Harrington".) Payne was not there when the sheep were brought in on the Thursday—("When the lad came in with the sheep I said, 'Who are they for?" He said, 'For Harrington. Sell them for me. The next day, about half-past one, the same lad came to the shop and brought in three lambs. Mr. Harrington was in the shop, and Mr. Harrington said, 'Hang them up there'")—that is not true—I did not say to the inspector that Harring ton was there when the lambs were brought in—I don't know how it came in that statement.</p>

What does it containt" he said, "I never brought it in, and I do not know these men"—I took him to the station and returned and saw the bag there—it contained a teapot and china cups, and a basin—I asked each prisoner separately, "Do you wish to give any account of these articles?"—I did not administer a caution, because I did not know that the property was stolen.

The receiver need not be fixed with any knowledge of the circumstances; mere possession of property under such circumstances as would lead a person to suppose it was improperly come by was sufficient, and it was not necessary to prove that the receiver had knowledge of what false pretences were used. If the allegations were necessary to the Count, then proof of them would be necessary, and a receiver could not be fixed with knowledge of specific false pretences made in his absence. The object of the Larceny Act was to place the receiver of goods obtained by false pretences in the same position as a receiver of stolen goods.</hi>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">in reply, submitted that the effect of putting the false pretences into the Count was not to throw on the prosecution the onus of proving that the receiver knew of them, because the Count need only allege "knowing the goods to have been obtained by false pretences" without alleging knowledge of the pretences.

I live at 12, St. Mary's Road, Hornsey, and am a grocer—when you were charged at the Police-station, and the inspector read over the charge, you did not say, "The worst of it is you have got forgery against me"—you said, "Everything is right except the forgery"—I was close to you, and had a better chance of hearing you than the detective, who was two or three yards away—I have known you for a few years, and I always found you straight forward in your dealings with me—when you sold me this sugar you came to me as an ordinary traveller, and asked me to purchase them, not on your own behalf—I bought them according to your representations, which were <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>—you said, "The party I am selling for is hard up, and he wants the money"—and you said the same about the second lot—you asked a certain amount—I said, "No"; I was afraid sugar would drop, and it was a larger quantity than I wanted to buy; and you wanted the money for the other party, and you accepted my terms.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer—I did live at 13, Hercules Road, Lambeth, with my father and the prisoner, who is my brother—we all occupied a room there—my father was a printer's pressman, and my brother was a compositor—my father slept on a chair bedstead, and I and the prisoner slept together on a bed in the same room—on Sunday night, 14th May, we all went to bed about eleven—I went to sleep—I was awoke by a noise in the room not very long after I had gone to bed; it must have been near twelve—I saw my father and the prisoner struggling together—my father called out for help—I jumped out of bed and went to him—I picked up a boot to separate them—father staggered back—I could not see how he fell—I was facing the prisoner at the time, keeping him against the wall—I struck a light and saw that my father's shirt was stained with blood; he was lying on the ground on his right side—I said to the prisoner, "You have done something now; you had better dress yourself and come along with me" and I took him to the Police-station—he said, "I meant to have served you the same"—when my father called for help he said that he was stabbed—he was calling for help when I got out of bed—I did not see any knife at that time—at the station I saw the inspector, and left the prisoner in his charge, and went for a doctor—the prisoner and father had often been quarrelling before this, about the prisoner going to work—the doctor found this knife in my father's back—I had not seen it before that night—one night about two</p>

               <p>months before this I was awoke in the night by father and the prisoner quarrelling—father said, "I can do nothing with him, he won't go into bed"—he was wandering about the room; I don't know what he was after—I had had no quarrel with him—he had not said anything to me about his food—my mother is in an asylum.</p>

               <p>the floor, all alight, among a lot of firewood which was poked underneath the bedstead—a young woman came in with me, and we opened the window and threw the things out, and a young man and a friend threw out the mattrass into the yard, where it flared up again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector M</hi>). About ten on the night of April 22nd the prisoner came to me at the station, and said, "I have had some words with my wife this evening; I went home, found she was out; I poured some paraffin oil on the bedclothes, and set fire to it with a match; some of the clothing was burnt"—I went to the place and found some bedclothes on the bed burnt, the wall-paper on the side burnt, and the articles which had been thrown out into the yard also burnt—I went back to the station and said to the prisoner, "You have given yourself up this evening for setting fire to your house"—he said, "I did it, and a b——good job I did"—when charged he said, "I acknowledge it"—I asked if he had a knife—he handed me this, saying, "This is what I stabbed her with this evening; if she had been there I would have set fire to her"—and pointing to Axen he said, "That is the drunkard leading my wife away"—he was sober, but excited.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have made inquiries about him—he is seventy-six years of age, and is a pensioner from the navy—I know nothing against him—from inquiries I have made I ascertained that on this night he was very much troubled by his wife, who had had some drink—there was a slight mark on her chin—she said it was more her fault than his—the room smelt very much of paraffin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in charge of the fire station in Tooley Street—on the morning of 22nd April Hitches came to me and told me that there had been a fire at his house—I went to the house and found a quantity of bedding alight in the back room, second floor—about a yard square of the wall-paper was destroyed, and about a yard square of the flooring was charred—I noticed a strong smell of paraffin oil.</p>
