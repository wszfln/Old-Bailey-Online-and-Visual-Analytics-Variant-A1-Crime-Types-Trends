I took him up, and there was the merchants constable Mr. Rawlins. We searched his trowsers, and found 5 lb of raw coffee; (produced in court, and deposed to.)

               <p>Biker. About a fortnight, at the close of which she pretended that she had fits, and could not con tinue any longer in my service, so she went away, but said she had got a place which she approved of much better than her present one I look'd about and missed two necklaces, as mentioned in the indictment, and likewise a mourning ring, concluding she had taken them away from out of my room, for being my house-maid she had access to the place where they were put. On this I went to Mr. Fielding, who granted a warrant to search her lodgings. She lodged with her <rs id="t17600416-2-deflabel12" type="occupation">mother</rs>

They were both carried before justice Fielding, where one was charged with stealing and the other with receiving them. They both denied knowing any thing of it, but at last Eleanor beg'd for mercy, and then Jane fell on her knees, begging for mercy likewise.</p>

            . I am a constable, and searched the lodging of the two prisoners. We sat Eleanor on a chair, and bid her sit still while we searched about. She sat very composed at first, but when we went to the grate she altered very much, and appeared very uneasy. She went, and insisted upon sweeping up the ashes herself, but we would not let her. I looked in the grate, and took it out, and in one corner of it I found the two necklaces, and in the other corner I found the mourning ring. [Produced in court, and deposed to.] I also found a pair of gold buttons in another room, which are not laid in the indictment. I observed the mother was very uneasy when we came near where that was concealed. I found about forty different keys about the house. [He produced four which he had tried, and they opened the prosecutrix's locks where the things were taken from.] The key that opened the lock where Mrs. Biker deposed she kept her necklaces, was found with the necklaces in the grate.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you not resist her?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, I could not stir, nor loosen my arms; after that, the prisoner and the man ran away, and I never saw the man afterwards; the prisoner ran forwards, and I pursued her; I struck her several blows on the head, she ran into a watchman's arms, and he secured her in the round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did she run before she was stop'd?</p>
               <p>Syms. I believe she ran about fifty yards; the next morning she was taken before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched in the round-house?</p>
               <p>Syms. Yes, but no money was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money again?</p>
               <p>Syms. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself?</p>
               <p>Syms. She denied it both at the watch-house and before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money at the time they stop'd you?</p>
               <p>Syms. I had, and am very sure the prisoner took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen your money?</p>
               <p>Syms. It was not ten minutes before, that I felt it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in any house after you felt it there?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, I had not, neither was there anybody near me in the street, besides the prisoner and the man that held me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person who took your money?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160005"/>Syms. I am, I pursued her that very moment, and she was never out of my sight till taken.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I am the girl that was taken out of a bawdy house, that was with the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Syms. She was taken in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner in any house?</p>
               <p>Syms Yes, in that house where we had a pint of negus made; she told me it was her lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that day?</p>
               <p>Syms. I had been at Knightsbridge, with some graers that sell cattle in Smithfield, and I met her in Piccadily.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was it you went into with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Syms. She said it was an acquaintance of hers, where I should be well used.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you meet with her?</p>
               <p>Syms. I met with her about half an hour after eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in that house with her?</p>
               <p>Syms. I believe I was with her about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation past between you?</p>
               <p>Syms. She wanted me to go to the place where she lived, and I went along with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when you were together?</p>
               <p>Syms. We had a pint of wine made into a negus.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in any other company besides hers?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, only the woman that brought the wine; whether she was the woman of the house, or a servant, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man in the house?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other woman drink with you?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, she did not. I paid her for the wine and she wanted me to give her some more money.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did she give for that?</p>
               <p>Syms. She did not give me any reason for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you together in that house?</p>
               <p>Syms. I believe not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose house it is?</p>
               <p>Syms. It is an officer's house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street?</p>
               <p>Syms. In Princes-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sign?</p>
               <p>Syms. There is nothing but a Bunch of Grapes at the door, I never saw the house before nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Syms. I was sober enough to know what I was about; I can't say I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know every thing that happened?</p>
               <p>Syms. I do; I quitted the place, being afraid to say there, and left the prisoner in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what conversation you and the prisoner had there?</p>
               <p>Syms. We had no conversation at all, only to drink the wine together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know that you had money about you?</p>
               <p>Syms. She saw me take my money out of my breeches pocket, and put it into the breast pocket of my coat</p>

               <p>Harper. I had just called the hour of twelve. The woman cried out, "Murder, murder, watch. murder."

We drank together some time, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160006"/> we parted, I do not know what o'clock it was. As I was making my way home, this man was behind me; he struck me first on one shoulder with his stick, and then on the other. I said, Sir, what is that for, and went to go away. Then he hit me over the head, and knock'd me down. The watch-house keeper, constable, and watchman, saw me all over bloody. The watchman assisted me, and I charged him with the man. I never saw him in my life till after he knock'd me down. I never was in a publick house with him.</p>

On the 13th of March two men came into my shop, and said they wanted some handkerchiefs; the prisoner was one of them I shewed them five handkerchiefs all in one piece, but they said they would not do. so I shewed them some others, when there came in two women, and asked for some silk lacing, the men said, serve the gentlewomen, for we want half a dozen: As I was giving one of the women change, she said softly, take care of these two men, who then stood near the door: After I had done with the women, I shewed the men another sort, which they said would not do, so I shewed them another sort, which they did not like neither; then I shewed them another, which one said would do but the other said it would not; this was the very first piece I had shewed them: The prisoner catch'd them up as they lay just within the sash, and they ran out; I ran after them, and called, Stop thief: The prisoner was soon taken, and brought back; he was got out of my sight first, but I am positive he is the man: He was searched, but nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your handkerchiefs again?</p>
               <p>A. Bayne. They were pick'd up by a person that is here, and brought to me (produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>A. Bayne. He said he never was in my shop, and he said the same before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>A. Bayne. It was the night before the fast day. between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a dress was the other man in, that came in along with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. Bayne. He was in a whitish coat; I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain they both came in together, or as customers dropping in one after another?</p>
               <p>A. Bayne. They did come in together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in your shop besides you, when they came in?</p>
               <p>A. Bayne. There was only my mother and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two men come in as friends?</p>
               <p>A. Bayne. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>A. Bayne. Because one said to the other, they will not do; and the other said they were for a sailor, and would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the man that took the piece?</p>
               <p>A. Bayne. I am; I had hung them on a line in the window, and he took them away. I had my eye upon him all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other man ever taken?</p>

            . I live in Broad Street. I was going down the street that evening between seven and eight o'clock, and at the end of Winchester-Street I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw the prisoner at the bar running, and I saw him fall down; this was about four or five hundred yards from the prosecutrix's house. I was on the other side of the way. I crossed the way and laid hold of him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160007"/>Q. Had he any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, not as I could see; he was in a great deal of confusion, and I saw him hustling something towards the ground. He said, it is not me. it is a man in a white coat over the way, there he runs (pointing with his finger.) I looked, but saw no such person. He said, for God's sake, don't swear against me, don't use me ill, and did not offer to get away; but we were then about ten yards from the place where he fell. The prosecutrix came up and said, if he is the man that took the handkerchiefs, he has a leather apron on; a light was brought, and he had a leather apron on. She look'd at him, and said positively he was the man. When we brought him back to the place where he fell, there lay the piece of handkerchiefs; there was another person that laid hold of him rather sooner than I.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Myer. As I was coming up from Old Bethkhem, between seven and eight that evening, I heard the cry stop thief. I ran directly cross the street, and just as I got to the prisoner, he fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner running?</p>
               <p>Myer. Yes, he ran as fast as he could. He got up again directly, and I laid hold of him, so did Mr. Jackson. He said he was not the man, it was a man in a white coat, but I saw no such man: He was got some yards from the place where he fell. Another gentleman came and took hold of him, and I left him. We walked back again, and when we came to the place where he fell, Mr. Smith took up the piece of handkerchiefs.</p>

            . I went into the prosecutrix's stop with another woman, to buy some lacing, where was the prisoner and another man. We were served and went out. I thought they looked as if they were going to rob the gentlewoman, so we staid at the outside of the door. The prisoner was standing within the door, with the door part open, and seemed to keep the door from shutting. I saw him take the piece of handkerchiefs, and run away with them; he snatched them from off a line. (She looks at them.) These are the same. The gentlewoman came out, and said. stop thief and we did the same. We staid there till the prisoner was taken.</p>

               <p>M. Mascalier. I keep a Silversmith's shop in Cavendish Street. I told him I would not bay them, and after I had asked him a few questions he told me they were his master's property, and that his master had sent him with them to sell. I said I should stop them. all he brought somebody to give account how he came by them. He said he would not stir out of the shop without them, and then with much ado I inticed him to go with me to justice Cox's. He had a bundle about him. The justice ordered it to be searched, when we found a tea chest with the rest of the plate in his pocket, the whole of which is laid in the indictment. Then the prisoner said he took them from his master on board a ship, I forget the name of it.</p>

The prisoner at last confessed he had taken it out of a cabbin on board a ship, and made his escape with it, and that he was an apprentice to the captain, and had served near twelve months of his time.

When I returned home (about twelve o'clock) my servant, the prisoner, brought me a pair of slippers, and my fillet, to put on my head as usual. I pull'd off my cloaths, and put on an old coat that I wore to dress myself in. I went to bed, and ordered him to call me between seven and eight in the morning. He went out of the room. I slept the whole night. In the morning (I was between sleep and awake) my door opened ( this was I believe soon after seven.) I said, who is there? The prisoner said, "Sir, it is me, for God's sake get up, for I</p>
               <p>"believe the house has been broke open to night,</p>
               <p>"for when I went down stairs this morning I</p>
               <p>"found the street door a-jar, and all the drawers</p>
               <p>"in the buroe in the parlour open and empty;</p>
               <p>"for God's sake get up, for I am afraid to go</p>
               <p>"down into the kitchen." I said, in a surprise, good God! I am astonished. In the interim I believe the maid servant came into my room. I slip'd on my breeches and slippers, and went down stairs. I saw the entry door and another door both open. I went into the fore parlour, and all the drawers there were open, except one in the chest of drawers, three out of the four were open; there is an escritore and chest of drawers. I immediately went down into the kitchen along with the prisoner, and by that time the maid was come down stairs; there I saw a trunk that belongs to my maid turn'd on the side, with all her things scattered round it, and it was perfectly empty.</p>
               <p>Q. What servants had you?</p>
               <p>Smith. Only a maid servant and the prisoner. As there was but little light in the kitchen. I desired the window might be opened, and I immediately perceived the glass part of the window was not shut at all; there is no outside shutter. only a wooden shutter in the inside, and a bar; the window frame was put back, and in the area I saw a considerable number of chips, and as I was above the area I could cast my eye all over it: I saw the groves of the shutter had been cut away, and chip'd to the length of about three feet and a half, and the bar that goes across the window had some scratches on the middle of it, which seem'd to be done by attempting to raise it out of the groove that it was in. Then I went upstairs into the back parlour, and beginning to find myself cold, I said, William, give me my coat and waistcoat to put on. He went into my back parlour, where he usually laid my cloaths after he had given me my old coat to put on, and said, "Sir, there is no</p>
               <p>"coat here, for they have taken your coat and</p>
               <p>"waistcoat that you had on last night." I saw my case of instruments, plaister case, and papers lying on the table. I desired him to go up into a room, and fetch me a coat from thence, saying, he would find an olive-colour coat there; it is a room joining to the room where I lie. He went upstairs, came down again, and said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, there is no coat</p>
               <p>"there, they may have been up in that room too,</p>
               <p>"for they have not left a coat there, nor nothing</p>
               <p>"like it." When he was gone upstairs, I went to look about the fore parlour, and in the desk part of the buroe, I saw there had been an attempt made to open that; but I imagined it had not been open'd, because I saw part of a key was broke in the lock. I put my hand to the lid, and could not pull it up. I had the key in my pocket, and opened the glass part of it, to see if some papers of considerable value there were safe, belonging to a gentleman that is gone to Germany, and I found them all safe. Had they been gone, it must inevitably have been my ruin. There were two pieces of key broke in the opening part of the escritore; two drawers were constantly kept unlocked, one having my shirts in it, which the maid servant had the care of, and the other my silk and other stockings and handkerchiefs, which the prisoner had the care of; the upper part had not been opened at all. I found my silk stockings, handkerchiefs, and several shirts were gone. After this, he telling me there was never a coat for me, I desired he would go to Mr. Langford, the auctioneer, and desire his son to lend me a coat and waistcoat. He came back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160010"/> again, and told me he was not at home. Then I went to the Rainbow coffee-house, and he came in. I told him the case. He said, have you any reason to suspect your servants? I said, no, neither my maid nor my man. I had a good character with my man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you?</p>
               <p>Smith. He had lived with me about three months. I desired the prisoner not to mention any thing of this robbery till I returned from Mr. Fielding's, and to look about while I was gone, to see what more was missing. I went to Mr. Fielding, and told him what had happened. He desired me to ask many questions of each of my servants. I told him I had no reason to suspect either of them, but if he pleased they should both come to him, that he might take their depositions, relating to the condition they found the house in when they got up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has your maid lived with you?</p>
               <p>Smith. She has lived with me about two years. Mr. Fielding took down the account I gave him; I sent for my two servants, I do not now recollect which of them I sent for first, but they both made their depositions in the same manner they had related it to me; both sign'd and swore to it. I went home, after I had heard what each of them said, much better satisfied of their honestly than before. Then I sat down and made an inventory of the things that I had lost, by asking my man after such and such things, and as he said they were missing I put them down as lost. Then I sent it to Mr. Fielding's, to be inserted in the Public Advertiser the next day; and as he had mentioned some Jews that buy wearing apparel that are stolen, I desired that he'd send out people to search after the things, and that I would grudge no expence. They were inserted in the Wednesday's paper following, and I ordered hand bills also to be delivered about. I was obliged to send for my taylor, to make me another suit of cloaths, having appeared about town in a borrowed coat and waistcoat, which cloaths came home in the evening on the 1st of April. While I was dressing myself on the Wednesday, which was the 2d. I said, William, as the cloaths I am going to put on are not mourning, I think I have a pair of crystal buttons set in silver somewhere in the buroe; the silver must be a good deal tarnished, let them be brushed. Yes, Sir, said he, I will do it. It immediately occur'd to my remembrance that I had a pair of gold buttons. I removed all my papers in the esoritore to look for them, and finding they were gone, I said to the prisoner, I am surprised to think what the people will do with the gold buttons, whoever they are, for they are so very remarkable, that let me see them wherever I will, I shall know them, and there is a scratch on one of the stones. Sir, said he, perhaps they may wear them themselves. I turned myself round to the fire, and put on my stockings. The prisoner then brought up my silver buttons, and laid them down. I ordered him to go into the back parlour and fill the cistern with water. Sir, said he, I believe there is water enough in it. I said I had used it the day before. He went and brought up water, and in about five minutes after I went to wash my hands; the cistern was about equal with my face. As I was stooping, I saw my gold buttons lying on the pedestal, by the side of the cistern.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put them last?</p>
               <p>Smith. I had put them, with my knee and stock buckles, in a drawer, the morning before I was rob'd. I was greatly surprised at seeing them on the pedestal, and was not only satisfied with seeing them, but I took one of them in my hand and laid it down again. I thought to myself, if I remove them, I shall not be nearer a discovery than now, but if I leave them and take no notice of them, and find them removed when I come home, I may challenge either one or both of my servants with this robbery. I went out to dinner and return'd in the evening about six, but being obliged to go out immediately, I did not go to look for the buttons; but about eight in the evening I return'd, with a gentleman with me, and the prisoner lighted us into the fore parlour; he seem'd to want not to leave me. I desired him to set the candle down, and said I would light myself. I took up the candle, and said now I think I can make some discovery. I went to the cistern, and when I was looking there, the prisoner came into the room, and made an excuse about his not bringing water. I could not see the buttons, and not knowing but that somebody might have been in that room, and put the cistern over them. I took it up and look'd under it, but there were no buttons there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Smith. This was the same Wednesday at night; then I sat down to consider what to do, after which we went to justice Fielding, and I told him the circumstance as it occur'd to me. He said, I had done extreamly right. I asked his advice what I should do, and he said, the best thing is to take this gentleman home with you, and call up your man first, and tell him what you saw in the morning on the pedestal, and that at your return you found they were taken away; then call up your maid servant, and if neither of them own any thing of it, have warrants and take them both up. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160011"/> to the coffee-house to consider of it. I thought probably they might be arm'd with an excuse for removing them, so I concluded not to do as Mr. Fielding's had desired me, but wait the event for another day. I went out to the Temple, came home about four in the morning, went into my house in the same manner as usual, and asked if any body had been there. Every thing appear'd to be well. Upon my saying, William, when did you hear the watchman, has he been his hour? Sir, said he, he may have been his hour, but I have been asleep, and seemed confused. Is there any fire says I; he said, yes there is; said I, let my bed be warm'd. I went out to look for the watchman, and came in and went to bed, and the gentleman along with me, desiring the prisoner to call me about eight in the morning. I got up about half an hour after eight, went into the kitchen, then up to the gentleman and said, I am going up into William's room, knowing he was engaged below, and the maid also. I went up and tried to open a trunk box which he had there; on his bed lay ( I think) the same coat he has on now, and I am very sure the same waistcoat he has on; in the pocket of his waistcoat I found something wrap'd up in a paper, in which was the bowl part of a spoon and the handle of the same; they were very black. I had lost a silver table spoon with a crest (a lion rampant on it.) I found this to be the same, and it seem'd as if an attempt had been made to molt the handle. I went down to the gentleman, who was in bed, and desired he would come up with me. I shew'd him the pieces, and then put them in the pocket as before. In the window I found the handle part of a key, and it immediately occur'd to me, that this might be part of the key that was broke in my buroe; then we went down to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that gentleman?</p>
               <p>Smith. His name is Sadler, he is now at Hertford; he has lately broke his leg in Hide-park. I desired myself; and staid at home about half an hour, then bid them take care for dinner for themselves, for I should not dine at home, being going to Carey-Street to bleed a lady. I went out, but instead of going there, I went to justice Fielding and got a warrant. I returned in about three quarters of an hour, and then I brought a constable with me; I placed him in the parlour, and asked the maid where William was, saying, I wanted to send him out with a letter. She said he was gone out, and had told her he was going to his washerwoman. I waited in the parlour with the constable about two hours, when he return'd, which was about half an hour after three. I opened the door to him, got him into the back room, and shut the door, saying, William, I can't help being much surprised at your behaviour, and much more at your being guilty of this thing, but, Mr. Saunders, there is your prisoner. The constable took him in custody, and I charged him with the robbery. He for some time was greatly confused, and indeed I was a good deal affected with it, and immediately left him in the care of the constable. He for the space of five or six minutes did not speak, and then said he did not do it; this I think was to the constable. Being in the next room. and the door open, I heard the constable say, Pray, William, where is the silver spoon that your master saw to day in your pocket, and the gold buttons that lay on the pedestal of the cistern yesterday. The prisoner said he had no silver spoon in his pocket, and that he knew nothing of the buttons, but still he was a great deal confused. I said to him, William, there is sufficient proof against you in this affair, you must be concern'd beyond all doubt, and if there is any body concern'd with you in it, you will do right to give an account, but do not think of charging any body wrongfully, for the consequence of that will be worse than your own suffering. I asked him once or twice to discover the affair, but he denied it. At last he desired me to go into another room, and he would tell me where my things were. I went with him into the next room, and there he desired me not to let him go before justice Fielding, and that I would be merciful to him. I said it was very far from me to do any body harm, but was obliged to do this for the sake of the publick, yet after I had done it, if I could be of any service to him I would. At that time it appear'd to me there must be somebody concern'd with him. He said it was the first thing of the kind he ever had done. I asked him what could induce him to do it, and his answer was, he believed the d - I put it into his head, with many other such speeches. He said, if I would not let him go before justice Fielding, he would tell me where all my things were. I told him it would answer no purpose to him to keep any of the things from me. He told me that many of the things were at a place where he had private lodgings, out of my house. He went with me, Mr. Saunders, and another of Mr. Fielding's men, to the lodging, which was somewhere near the Seven-Dials, but I do not know the name of the street; it was a fore room up two pair of stairs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160012"/> at a chandler's shop, where I found three sheets, a waistcoat, a pair of boots, a pair of pocket pistols, and in one of the bags with one of them was the silver spoon that I had seen in his pocket, broke in two pieces, fifteen pair of silk stockings, two neck cloths, and five stocks I said, here are not all; and he said, I'll tell you where the rest are I said, where are the gold buttons; he said. they are here, and took them out of his own breeches pocket. Then he took us to my house, and in a cocklost on the top of the house we found this coat and waistcoat that I have now on, about seven yards of Irish cloth. six or seven stocks, and one damask table cloth. Then he went with us to Mr Campion, a salesman in Monmouth Street, where he had sold two coats, two waistcoats, and one pair of breeches. All the things I have mentioned I found by his directions, my property. Then I went to Mr Fielding's, and he was brought soon after. When Mr. Fielding began to examine him, he owned his having taken all these things, and that the last mentioned two coats, two waistcoats, and breeches, he had taken a fortnight before, or thereabouts. He owned his having cut the shutter of the window, in order to deceive me, also his having attempted to open the escritore, and breaking open the bottom drawer of the buroe part.</p>

               <p>Thomas. It is up one pair of stairs.</p>

               <p>Thomas. I pull'd all off but my breeches, stockings and shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shut your door, are you sure?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I had, but it went with a spring lock with a knob on the inside and out, to open it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I keep a shop and sell sacks and hemp. I was awake when the door open'd, and saw the prisoner at the bar come in and take up my shoes, and take out my buckles I jump'd out of bed assoon as possible, and she had just quitted the room. I call'd out Thief, I am rob'd of my buckles. She was then on the landing place.

             met her there, but she got by her and ran about a hundred yards in the street, and was taken and brought back. I observ'd that after my maid met her on the landing place she open'd the door again, and clap'd the buckles down on a chair in the inside of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself, upon being charged with taking the buckles?</p>
               <p>Thomas. She owned she was in the room; her words were, she did not go to do it, but would not own she took them, and beg'd I would not carry her to prison.</p>

            . I am a servant to the prosecutor. I was going up stairs after my master was laid down, and saw the prisoner at the bar coming out of his room with his silver buckles in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear your master call out stop thief?</p>
               <p>M. Evans. No, I did not: I was going up on another occasion, and she was shutting the door. When she saw me she push'd back the door, and put the buckles out of her hand, and said to me, do not be frighten'd, my dear, I shall not hurt you. I was so much frighten'd that I did not take hold of her. She said, I only want Mrs. Smith, a mantuamaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did such a person live in your house?</p>
               <p>M. Evans. No, nor in the neighbourhood as we know of. She made her escape, and ran away, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160013"/> I catch'd her in running about a hundred yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. When I said I wanted Mrs. Smith, a mantuamaker, whether or no you did not bid me go down and inquire of your mistress?</p>
               <p>M. Evans. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I did live in Steward's Rents, Drury Lane, and at that time a woman lived by me, named Smith, a mantuamaker, who told me she lived in Cannon Street, Ratcliff-Highway; she had a gown to mend of mine. I going to live that way myself, went and inquired for her After I had been there, and found nobody in the room, I was coming down again, and after I was down I asked the gentlewoman after this mantuamaker; but she could not inform me of the house she lived at Then I went about in the neighbourhood inquiring for her, but could not find her. About five or ten minutes after that woman came and laid hold of my arm, pull'd and haul'd me about, and desired me to come back. I said I had done no wrong, and went with her.</p>

            . I was employed to mend any of the bags on board that were broken, that is, ginger and pimento bags. On Saturday the 1st of March Mr. Read sent orders on board for the ship to be got over betwixt Gun Dock and Wapping Old Stairs; she did lie next stairs to Execution Dock. On the Monday we moored her, made her cables fast, and went on shore to dinner. Between three and four in the afternoon the mate came, and said we must not stay long, for the lumpers were gone on board, to get out the staves, and clear the ship. I went immediately into the dock yard. Coming down to the water side, the people on board the ship called out to me, and said, they have been robbing your ship. I ran down to the further part of the dock, and saw the two prisoners at the bar in a boat, and Mr. Milemay in the boat rowing them, with a bag of pimento under their legs.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Milemay?</p>
               <p>Stent. He is a waterman. I ran out of the dock-yard and call'd the mate, and said there were two of the lumpers coming on shore with a bag. We went into a little alley close to the dock, and seized the two prisoners as they were going into a house with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them had got the bag?</p>
               <p>Stent. It was in Mr. Mackensey's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both in company?</p>
               <p>Stent. They were. Mackensey told us if we offered to take the bag from them, they would swear a robbery against us, and transport us, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160014"/> said that bag did not come out of the ship; this they both told us, and said we should not have it. The mae sent me to call a constable to our assistance. Coming back again I met a custom house officer, whom I desired to come and seize the bag, which he did, and carried it to the custom-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is he?</p>
               <p>Stent. He is not here. Here is the bag and pimento. (Producing it.) I know this bag well, it having been cut at one corner, and I mended it when the pimento was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is pimento?</p>
               <p>Stent. It is what they call all-spice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come out of your ship?</p>
               <p>Stent. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them on board the ship that day?</p>
               <p>Stent. I cannot say that I saw them on board that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen the pimento on board your ship before that time?</p>
               <p>Stent. I saw it on the Saturday before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Stent. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoners leave the ship on that Saturday?</p>
               <p>Stent. It might be about dinner time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them on board that Saturday?</p>
               <p>Stent. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that they were on board that ship any day after Saturday?</p>
               <p>Stent. Of my own knowledge I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many whole bags were there on board the ship?</p>
               <p>Stent There were but three whole bags. When I came on board I took and fill'd up two more, to make up five, which were the number reported of the ship; they had discharged some bags before I came on board, so that all the found ones were carried on shore but three, and some bags I mended, and some of the pimento I put in other bags.</p>
               <p>Q. How many might you mend?</p>
               <p>Stent. I might mend a hundred, but can't tell justly; there was another man came one day in order to help me to mend them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bags had pimento in them that you mended?</p>
               <p>Stent There was never a pimento bag mended but this; there was little or no waste, nothing left but dust and rubbish, about a peck of it.</p>

The three prisoners came into my house on the 10th of March, about one in the day, called for a pint of beer and sat down all together in a box in the publick room. Elizabeth Parker went out into the yard, where she staid about two or three minute, and then came in and sat down again. In about a minute or two after that Gates gave me a shilling to change. I changed it, and took for the pint of beer. Then they went away, and I said they were welcome. In my back room were some crack'd pewter pots that ran, and I had put them by there A the three prisoners were all very well dressed, I did not mistrust any thing, neither had I missed any thing. After this, the same day, I was sent for by justice Welch, to know whether I had lost any I said I did not know that I had lost any He desired I would look among some were there, which I did, and found two pint, one half pint, one pewter dish, and one pewter plate, my property; these were out of the back room.

               <p>Q. How long did you live there?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. I lodged there about a fortnight; on the 12th of February last I went to Hampstead, to live <rs id="t17600416-14-viclabel91" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. What were the things you left at Mrs. Turner's?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. There were in my box there one linen shift, one pair of white cotton stockings, one pair of laced ruffles, three linen caps, one white linen handkerchief, one cotton stomacher, a diaper napkin, and a great many things that are not in the indictment. I was at Mrs. Turner's on the first or second of March, and to the best of my knowledge they were all safe then; I return'd to Hampstead, after staying there one night, and came to town again on the 12th of March, about seven in the evening; Mrs. Turner was not then in her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. Yes; she is a relation or an acquaintance of a fellow servant of mine at Mr. Pelham's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her on the 12th of March?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. She was a lodger in the same room where my box stood; she came up stairs and open'd the door of the room, took a candle out of the closet, and went down stairs and lighted it; then I saw my box was standing open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lock'd it when you saw it last before that?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box broke open, or was it open'd by a false key?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. The nails were drawn, and I missed all the things mention'd in the indictment out of the box. I went to 'squire Ingrim's, where there was a person who said she had a strong suspicion of Abigail, and said she would go with me and talk to her, to see if we could get her to own it. We went the next morning, call'd her out and told her, we suspected her to be the person who had taken the things, but she protested she knew nothing of them. The maid of the house was taken up, and carried before justice Wright, on the 12th of March; the prisoner went along with me to get the warrant, but there was nothing proved against her, and she was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your goods again?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. Yes, we did, at Mr. Powell's a pawn broker ( a parcel of goods produced in court.) These are my property, and what I left in my box when I went out on the first or second of March.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find the things out?</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner-say for herself, when she was taken up?</p>
               <p>Trotter. She then said she took the things out of my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say this?</p>
               <p>Trotter. This was before she was carried before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say then how and when she took them?</p>
               <p>Trotter. She said she took them out of my box on the first of March, when I went out, and left it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out and leave it open?</p>
               <p>Trotter. I do not remember my going out then and leaving it open.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say before the justice?</p>
               <p>Trotter. There she own'd she had taken them.</p>

               <p>A. Humphrys. I pawn'd these things in my own name for the prisoner at the bar, who brought them to me as her own.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Axford. It was near three o'clock. I look'd over my shoulder, and saw the prisoner at the bar. I put my hand in my pocket, and found I had lost nothing at that time. I walk'd on into the churchyard, where I look'd back, and finding he followed me I thought I would stay and see a little of his performances. I stop'd at a print shop, and he came and fix'd himself at the rails of St. Paul's, where he made his observation (seemingly) whose pocket he could play upon best. I saw him eye other people's pockets as well as mine. He came up by me after he had stood there a minute or two, first on my left hand and then on my right. I observed his motions, altho' I looked earnestly at the prints; my handkerchief was then in my pocket. After he was behind me a little while he went away, and then I found my handkerchief was gone. I went after him and took him by the shoulder, saying, Now I have you. He then drop'd the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he gone from you?</p>
               <p>Axford. Not above three or four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he drop'd it?</p>
               <p>Axford. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel his hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Axford. I can't swear I felt his hand in my pocket, tho' so intent on observing him ( the handkerchief produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

There were two or three stairs that went up into a fort of a room, where was a fire and candle. and two other women; they desired me to sit down, and they would shew me my way directly. I sat down I had not sat long before they asked me for something to drink, so I gave them something, but how much it might be, I cannot tell. By this time I wanted to go. Two of them said, you shall not go, and surrounded me, so that I did not know which was best to do. There was a sort of a bed, but of no account. They told me it was the best and safest way to say there, and I should be as safe as can be till morning. I took off my coat and breeches and laid me down, and

               <p>Q. CAN you tell the just quantity of your money?</p>
               <p>Donnelly. I cannot, because I had laid out some.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>Donnelly. I saw it not half an hour before I met with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after this?</p>
               <p>Donnelly. Then, Sir, they made off every one of them, all four, and the place was left to myself, nobody at all there. I got up, and made into the street as fast as I could; going there I cried out, murder, I was rob'd, and the like. I met a man, who said, the whores and bitches are gone off with your money towards East Smithfield. I ran this way, that way, and the other way, but could see nothing of them till it appeared day-light. Then one of them came to me, and said, one of the bitches ran down such a place, shaking a purse of gold, and saying, here is money enough, buying goods here and there.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find them?</p>
               <p>Donnelly. I found them in a gentleman's shop, where they had bought several things, the next morning very early.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour?</p>
               <p>Donnelly. Perhaps between seven and eight o'clock. I found them myself, with the help of a young woman that guided me, and so on</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house did you find them in East Smithfield?</p>
               <p>Donnelly. In a shopkeeper's house there.</p>
               <p>Q. What does he sell?</p>
               <p>Donnelly. He sells cloaths of one sort or another. The two prisoners were both there. I took upon myself to stop them, with the assistance of the girl that guided me. Then I sent for an officer. When he came I charged him with them, and upon searching the prisoners, found the quantity of money that he has to give an account of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by at the time?</p>
               <p>Donnelly. Indeed I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they searched?</p>
               <p>Donnelly. They were searched in that place. We took them before justice Scot, before whom King declared, that one of the women had rob'd her of thirty guineas of the money, and ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was found upon King?</p>

I found in King's pocket two half guineas, eleven shillings in silver, and five pennyworth of halfpence. She had a little child about ten years of age, which I searched, but found nothing upon it. The child pull'd a cloak from out of its pocket. Then I searched again, and found a green purse with eight guineas and seventeen half guineas in it. I asked

               <p>Q. On what account did you suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sing. He having committed several things of the like nature. After that I was going by a broker's shop in Fleet Market, where I saw some of my goods I asked the broker who he bought them of, and he described the prisoner at the bar. Then I got a search warrant, and in the prisoner's house I found on e china cup, which I believe to be mine, they matching to the saucers which I have by me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find at the broker's?</p>
               <p>Sing. I found the picture and the cheeks to my grate; the picture has my name on it. (The picture and cheeks produced in court, and deposed to.) I never found the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with the prisoner at Mr. Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Sing. I was. He said the same as now, that is, he knew nothing at all of the matter. I asked his wife how she came by the cup.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he by at the time?</p>
               <p>Sing. He was in the same room. She said she bought it of a woman at the door. My wife asked her soon after where she had it. She said to her, she brought it out of the country.</p>

The prosecutor came and told me he had lost some of his goods, and desired I would go along with him to the broker, who, he said, had described the person he bought them of, and it was one that had done some petty robberies in our neighbourhood. I went with him. We got a search warrant, and found this cup in the prisoner's house. I advised the prisoner to confess where he sold the rest of the things. We had got him upstairs. He gave a jump down, and got from us, then jumped over one pannel of pales, and upon his going over another, we catch'd him by the leg.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams. I am a constable, and took the prisoner as he was at dinner. He said to me, Let me have a little air. I would not let him go. He jumped down and ran, and I ran round to meet him. He got over a fence I believe six feet high, with tenter hooks in it. As he was going over another I catch'd him by the leg, and with assistance we did secure him.</p>

            . On the 27th of March last, I was going over More fields, where I saw two young chaps; I knew one of them had been committed two or three times. I knew him to be a thief. The prisoner was not along with them, but he walked behind them. On seeing me he turned his face back; they were in Chiswel-Street, coming towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. How old might the other lads be?</p>
               <p>Bradbroke. About sixteen or seventeen years old; the prisoner had a handkerchief, with something tied up in it, I judged he might be one of their party; the others made off over the paved stones; I call'd out, stop them, and catched hold of the prisoner, he said what do you want with me; I asked him what he had got in his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Bradbroke. No, not to my knowledge; he said what is that to you. I brought him down to the Ship alehouse, and untied his bundle, and there I found these handkerchiefs ( produced in court) I cut a piece off from one of the corners, so as to know them again (he compared the piece and it agreed) he told me he found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he found them?</p>
               <p>Bradbroke. I think he said some-where towards Drury Lane; I asked him if he did not know the other two lads; he said he knew nothing of them; I said I shall take you before justice Fielding, and you shall there give an account how you came by them; he own'd nothing there, and Mr. Fielding committed him upon my oath.</p>

               <p>I was going home to my mother's house, about nine o'clock. At the corner of Long-Acre, going into Drury Lane, I trod upon these things; I found something soft under my feet; I gave them a kick and they flew open; I took them up and carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160026"/> them home to my mother's house, in Mayner-Street, St. Giles's, and in the morning I look'd in the paper to see if there were any such things advertised, and I found there was not: About ten o'clock I thought I would go and leave them in pawn, instead of a furtout coat. As I was going to leave them I met that man, he stop'd me in the street; this was between ten and eleven the next day. He asked what I had got under my arm. I said what is that to you? He took the bundle from under my arm, and said he would know how I came by them; I said I found them, and told him the place where; he took me into an alehouse and examin'd me, and then he took me before Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bradbroke. Where did he say he found them before Mr. Fielding?</p>

               <p>He call'd three people to his character, one had known him from six years of age, the second had known him twelve months, and the third better than a year; they all gave him the character of an honest lad.</p>

The prisoner came by me as I stood at the White Horse door, a publick-house; he had been gone out of that house about half an hour before. I had seen him there.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that house to where the fire was?</p>
               <p>Rider. I take it to be about a quarter of a mile. As he came by my door, he had this piece of cloth under his left arm. (A piece of woollen cloth produced.) I said to two women that were standing there, I believed here was a thief coming from the fire. One of the woman knew him, and said he was just gone from the White Horse. They wanted me to stop him, but I thought it was dangerous at that time of the morning. As one of them knew where he lodged, I thought it best to let him alone till day light. I got up the same morning about 9, and told people of it, and they blamed me for not stopping him. I went to the fire about 11 o'clock, and found a man belonging to Mr. Swain, who told me his master had lost such stuff. They got a warrant, in order to take up the prisoner. We went to his lodgings in Old Street with the constable, who knock'd at the door, and the prisoner got off his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Rider. This was about 2 o'clock in the day; he opened the door, and said he knew what we were come about, you come about this piece of stuff that I have got; it was locked up in a box, and his wife was gone out with the key. He called her up. She brought the key, and he delivered the piece to us. The constable took charge of the prisoner, whom we took before the justice, and he committed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he had it?</p>
               <p>Rider. He said he had it from the Swan with two necks Yard. Mr. Swain has a warehouse in that yard.</p>

               <p>Willis. We lost a great many goods that night. This piece was thrown over the gallery amongst the mob. Many of the people took them to their own houses, and restored them again the next day, or two or three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver any pieces to people that you did not know?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I happened to be in this yard at the time of the fire. A man came and desired me to lend him a hand with some goods that lay under the piazza's. We rolled out one pack into the street, with some more help. After that I came into the yard again, and a man gave me this piece of stuff, and bid me carry it away. I do not know the man, he was a stranger to me; he said take care of it. I went to go along with other people, and not knowing where they carried theirs to, going through the croud, I lost fight of them. Then I did not know what to do with it; but I knowing my wife was well acquainted with the gentleman that keeps the Swan with two Necks, where I had it, I thought I would carry it home, and my wife should carry it the next day. When they came for it, I did not deny having it.</p>

One cock was taken out of the prisoner's pocket. I believe it is my property, but cannot swear positively to it; 3 pair of snuffers were found in his room in a trunk, which I was suspicious might be my property, but could not be certain, but I believe they are mine.

               <p>Q. to Walker. What time was it you saw the prisoner come out of the alehouse called the Stone Kitchen?</p>
               <p>Walker. It was much about the same time the last witness mentioned.</p>
               <p>Parslow. There are four men go their rounds; three private men and a serjeant. I stood on the step of the door, and he came down stairs and open'd the door; I asked him if the serjeant was coming down, or if there were a great deal of company up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you ask that?</p>
               <p>Parslow. Because the serjeant had staid longer than ordinary. The prisoner had neither quart nor pint pot in his hand, no more than I have this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. to Walker. Was you there at that time?</p>
               <p>Walker. I was there at the time that they went their rounds. The serjeant at that time was above-stairs, seeing the house clear'd of the soldiers.</p>
               <p>Q. to Parslow. Did you see Walker?</p>
               <p>Parslow. I did; he was about a yard or a yard and a half from the door: At that very time the prisoner came out at the door, and went about three or four yards from the door, and stood stock still. I saw both his arms before him when he came out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. to Walker. Did you see Parslow at that time?</p>

            . I live in Cockspur-Street, St. Martin's parish. I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment. I advertised them, and in about a week after a gentleman came and told me the persons that robbed me, as he supposed, were before justice Welch; I went there and saw the prisoner; she had one of my handkerchiefs about her neck. She took it off and I swore to it. She said she had another that hung upon her door at home. She owned she bought them of the two men cast last sessions, Guest and Smith. I think at first she said she gave three-pence each, but at last she said, she gave a shilling each; I gave half a crown for them myself to the wholesale merchant, but that about her neck I had the misfortune to tear down about a quarter of a yard.</p>

               <p>A. Parsons. They were at work below. He sent the prisoner up for some emery and oil.

I went out at the back door, and told the gentleman that made the buckles of it. He went home along with me, where he said to my husband, Mr. Parsons, call up your man.

The gentleman, Mr. Hatton by name, put his hand into that pocket, and there he found them. Then he asked him how he came by them. He gave him no answer, but fell down on his knees, and beg'd my husband would forgive him. Then we took him before the justice, where he said he knew nothing of them.</p>

            . I am a silver-buckle maker. On the 5th of this instant, between four and five in the afternoon, Mrs. Parsons came to my house, and told me she had seen the prisoner take a pair of silver knee buckles and two silver stock buckles out of two drawers, and desired I would go along with her. I went, and the prisoner was called up, whom we desired to go into the back room. Mr. Parsons began to accuse him of being guilty of robbing him. Mrs. Parsons said he had put them into his right hand pocket, in which I found them; three of them were of my own making, that is, two knees, and one stock buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you make them for?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I believe for the prosecutor; the prisoner beg'd forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner to the prosecutor. Did you ever see me wrong you of a farthing?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I always had an extraordinary opinion of him, as an honest man. I had no intention to bring him to this place; it was his own obstinacy. I desired him to give me an account of other things that I had lost, but he would not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming from dinner that day from Newport Market, and I found these buckles in St. Martin's Lane; they were in two different parcels; I put them into my waistcoat pocket. I intended to keep a pair of knee buckles and one stock buckle for myself.</p>

I went up into the warehouses, and thought there was a sack gone. I went down stairs, and saw some malt scattered. I followed the trail, and saw the prisoner going down the stairs at Ivy Bridge. I took hold of him, brought him up to my master's warehouses, and told him I was informed he had stoln a sack of malt from my master's warehouse. He said he had not. At last he said he would go and shew me where it was. I went and saw it, and ordered one of our men to carry it again to our warehouse.</p>

            , Green Dragon Yard, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>S. Aldridge. I went, and while I was gone my door was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a whole house?</p>
               <p>S. Aldridge. My house is over some stables, and there is nobody over nor under me; the door, after I am up, opens into my two rooms upon a floor; there is nobody lives there but me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the door at going out?</p>
               <p>S. Aldridge. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out?</p>
               <p>S. Aldridge. I went out a little after three in the afternoon, and returned about half an hour after seven at night; this was on the 5th of March. When I came back I found the staple drawn out, and I missed two linen gowns, seven yards of camlet, a black callimanco petticoat, a black stuff petticoat, two yards of nankeen, a cheque linen apron, a dowlas shift, a pair of stays, a pair of ruffles, a white ghenting apron, a pair of worsted gloves, a glove knot, eighteen caps, two white linen handkerchiefs, a purple and white ribband, a pair of dowlas shift sleeves, and a silk and cambrick handkerchief, all from out of my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>S. Aldridge. No, I had no knowledge of her. I went and took up the woman on suspicion that brought the note, and took her before justice Berry; She told me it was the prisoner at the bar that sent her. Then I went by her direction, took up the prisoner, and carried her before the justice, where she was examined, and she confessed the thing. It was taken in writing, and signed by her. I saw her and the justice sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sign it free and voluntarily?</p>
               <p>S. Aldridge. She did.</p>
               <p>[It was read in court, dated March 12, 1760, wherein it appeared she acknowledged the fact clearly and fully.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your goods again?</p>
               <p>S. Aldridge. I got some of them again by her direction, and some were sold.</p>

I was sitting by my fire side on the 1st of April, about eleven o'clock at night, when my door was push'd a little way open, and the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out. I heard them taken out, and went to the door, but saw nobody. Next day, between eight and nine in the evening, there was a cry of stop thief. A lad that lodges with me ran out, and took the prisoner He had stole a joll of salmon. I took hold of the prisoner, and said, my boy, did you not take such things from me last night? He was very drunk, and said nothing, but after a great deal of examining he owned that he and another boy took them; he said the other boy's name was

            , that they took out the two gowns first and carried them into an alley, and then went and took the petticoat, and when at the constable's house, he confessed they were sold in Rag Fair, and before Mr. Fielding he said Knight sold them while he was at the door, and that he did not know the person's name nor the street but he could carry us to the house. He did so; it was in Red Lion Street, Roper's Alley, Goodman's Fields. He went into the house, and the woman at the bar was sitting by the fire with a child in her arms. The woman said she never bought any old cloaths in her life that her daughter dealt in them, but she did not, but we found the petticoat there. The prisoner said her daughter bought it in the fair, and nobody had any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the boy say he sold them for?</p>
               <p>M. Lawrence. He said he sold them for five and six pence. When we were looking about, the boy said we must go up stairs, for they keep things there. We found the petticoat under a bed up two pair of stairs; I believe it was not the prisoner's bed, for after we had found it a person came into the room and said to the prisoner's daughter. O you base jade how could you carry any thing into my room? we found one of the gowns over the prisoner's head where she sat ( produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

Mary Fulham's daughter bought a gown and petticoat in Rosemary Lane, on a Wednesday about a fortnight ago, betwixt eight and nine o'clock, and to the best of my knowledge the boy at the bar was standing at a little distance whilst she bought it of another boy. I took a great deal of notice of the gown, it was a brown stuff gown, and the petticoat was a kind of a pink colour.</p>

When we came from thence, it was about two in the morning. Then he said he would give me half a bed if I would go with him to his lodgings. I went, and in the morning I found myself in bed, but my shoes, buckles, breeches, hat, wig, buckskin gloves, two guineas in gold, five or six shillings in silver, and a silver watch, were gone, and the prisoner was gone also, and I lock'd into the room. The people of the house sent me some things to put on, till I went home to put on some of my own. Then I went to the Red Lion at Charing Cross again, where the man that keeps the tap there told me the prisoner was then in the tap-house. He seeing me, went and hid himself under the manger in the stable. I went and pull'd him out by the collar, and brought him into the tap room again. Then the master that keeps the inn desired one of his servants to take a candle, and look under the manger; he went with him, and there they found my watch. The master came to me and said, what case has your watch? I said, a shagreen one, which appeared to be the same they had found. Then the prisoner took my shoe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160035"/> buckles out of his pocket, and threw them down between my legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him throw them down?</p>
               <p>Hopkins. I did, and took them up. We carried him before justice Cox, but he would not confess any thing. He had sent away a parcel by a porter, and when the porter return'd to carry his box, we sent for the parcel back again; there were in it my breeches, hat, wig, and knee buckles: The key of my room was found in his pocket.</p>

            . I am a watchman belonging to Covent Garden, and a porter in the day-time. After I had done my duty, I met the prisoner in Maiden Lane, who said, Watchman, if you'll carry this sack to the corner of Bow Street I will give you a pot of beer. I went with him to the Coach and Horses in Charles Street, where he got liberty of the people of the house to let him leave the parcel in the tap room. He called for a pot of porter, and then said, If you'll go along with me to the Red Lion at Charing Cross and fetch a box to this sack, I will pay you for your trouble. I went thither with him, where he called for a pint of purl, and after that another; then he went out and left me, and these people came in and said, I was along with a thief; I told them where I had carried a sack for him, and they desired I would go and fetch it away. I went along with two men, and brought it before justice Cox, where it was opened, and I saw the breeches, hat, wig, and a pair of gloves, which Mr. Hopkins owned. Then justice Cox sent me to the Red Lion at Charing Cross for the prisoner's box, which was also opened, but nothing found in it belonging to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was at the Red Lion, Charing Cross, on Easter Sunday, where this man came in much in liquor, and I believe I was in his company about two hours; he said he was shut out, and I said if he pleased to accept of half a bed he was welcome; he said with all his heart, and going along he wanted some liquor, so we went to lar in the Haymarket, where we staid about a; then we came to my room, opposite the Nag's Head in Hedge Lane, but he met with a girl, and we all three went and lay together; about three the girl was gone. I wanted to remove my lodgings, so had the sack carried to the Coach and Horses in CoventGarden; then I came back to the Red Lion, and wanted the box to be removed to the Swan in Bishopsgate Street. I staid at the Red Lion two hours, or two hours and a half. Hopkins came into the yard, and challenged me with the things, watch, buckles, and the like. I said I did not know any thing of them, and that if he had lost them possibly the woman had taken them. He found a pair of buckles under the bench. I went into the stables, as I had been used to the yard, and having been drinking all the morn ing I wanted to lie down to sleep, where they came and disturbed me. I said I was willing to go before a justice of peace. I know nothing of the watch.</p>

I went there with my son, and we found other parcels there; I had left orders at home to let him go. There were about eight ounces in the whole. I had not spoke to him about it at that time.

               pleaded guilty
            </rs> to that of the burglary and robbery, and spoke as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, I from my first being taken into custody intended to plead guilty. It has been reported since I have been taken up that I am a methodist, and that several masters and mistresses have discharged many such of their servants on my account. I beg leave to acquaint the honourable court that it was not the doctrine which the methodists teach that caused me to commit this robbery - I beg leave to trespass on your patience to speak a few words, as to the character of the young woman that I corresponded with. Notwithstanding my conduct in other respects, my behaviour to her was unexceptionable. I believe her to be a pious, godly young woman, and hope no centures will be cast on her on my account. I have no more to say, but to beg your Lordship's prayers, and those of the jury.</p>
               <p>[There were two other indictments against him for robberies on the highway.]</p>
               <p>Being brought to the bar the last day of the sessions to receive sentence, and asked what he had to say why sentence of death should not be past upon him, he said,</p>
               <p>I recommend myself to the mercy of God and this court, and acknowledge my crime is grievous both in the fight of God and man, for which I willingly give my life a sacrifice to the Lord. I am willing to receive the sentence due to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160037"/> crimes, and hope the young people in this court will take warning by me, in seeing the dreadful consequence and effects of telling a lye. * I desire the prayers of this honourable court.</p>
               <p>* He had told the young woman, to whom he made his addresses, that he was worth more than he was, and by taking those methods, to make it appear true, he was brought into this dreadful situation.</p>
               <p>N. B. His speech to the populace, and last prayer at the place of execution, were taken in short-hand, and transcribed by the writer of these proceedings, and may be seen in the Ordinary of Newgate's account of the malefactors, &amp;c.</p>

I said if he would bring anybody to give an account of his character, I would buy them. He went away and left them, and the next morning came again, saying he would make good his character if my servant would go along with him, that he was then going to FleetBridge, and would call as he return'd. He said he would take my servant to Dr Graham's, but not returning as he had said, I sent my servant to the Doctor's, and Mr Clark came back with him, who described the cloaths, and I deliver'd them to him. The prisoner came a third time, and insisted upon money or cloaths I told him I had given them to the right owner. Then he said he would clear his character, and staid in the shop two hours or better. Then we took him before justice Welch, and he was sent to the Round-house; and yesterday the prosecutor came and gave an account of the cloaths to justice Welch, when the prisoner said that another man gave him the cloaths to sell.</p>

About the beginning of December last the prisoner came to my shop, and said she wanted some goods of different kinds, as specified in the indictment. She was served with them; they came to 40 s. and 6 d. After she had bought them, she said she had not money enough in her pocket, but if we would send them to her house, the Gentleman and Porter in Chancery Lane, she would pay the money. The young man who carried them was foolish enough to leave them without taking his money, contrary to his orders.</p>
