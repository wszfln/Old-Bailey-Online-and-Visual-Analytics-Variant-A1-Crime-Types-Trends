                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Battersea, and am in the service of Isaac Isbel, a carrier. Between five and six o'ekiek, on the evening of the 6th of December, I stopped at Mr. Phillips', in Rood-lane, to deliver a box—I had a tilted cart—whilst on the step of Mr. Phillips' door, I saw the pri<lb/>soner setting the parcel on the foot-board, im front of the cart—I had taken up that parcel at Mr. Ingleworth's, in Princes-street, Leicester-square, about three o'clock, and placed it in the back part of the cart, as far back as I could—I was to deliver it at the steam-wharf, to go to Glasgow—I did not notice the prisoner before I saw him with the parcel—he was in the cart—he jumped down—I made a grasp at him, but lost my hold—I immediately cried "Stop thief "—he ran up Rood-lane, and immediately he saw the constable he truned back—I kept on crying "Stop thief;" and a gentleman stopped him, and brought him back to the cart—I am certain he is the same man—the parcel was opened at the station, and contained snuff boxes and cigar cases—my master would have had to replace them if they had been taken away.</p>

Morgans'—he appeared to be waiting for somebody—I missed him sud<lb/>denly, and in about three minutes saw him again with some paper on his shoulder, come out of the Messrs; Morgans' shop-door—Jewell let him out—I and another officer in plain clothe followed him to Cooper's-row, Crutched-friars—he pitched his load in the doorway of No. 4, then opened the door, and Job Palmer came and helped to drag the paper in by a cord—I immediately crossed and seized George by the collar—Job had only his shirt and trowsers on—I do not know whether he had shoes—there was no knocking or ringing at the door; it was opened so suddenly—I could not tell whether he opened it himself or set—it is a private house, and the door opens into a room—there it no passage—Wardle seized Job Palmer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Vinnicomb, a tailor, of Howland-street, Fitzroy-square, St. Pancras. On the evening of the 6th of Dec., between six and seven o'clock, I came up stain from the kitchen with a pail of water—at that time the street door was fast, as I was putting the pail down in the passage I saw a man looking out of the front parlour door—I screamed out—he rushed out at the door, threw up his arms and hands as if he was going to knock me down, and got out by the street doot—I ran after him—he was brought book by a policeman and a soldier—the policeman showed me a handkerchief, which was my husband's—I had such an one in the parlour folded together—the prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>

I left with my son, leaving some tools on a bench in the front room—the front doors were locked—we returned in about twenty minutes, and found the prisoner in the back-room—I asked how he came there—he intimated that he was tipsy—I went for a policeman, got a light, and found a smooth<lb/>ing-plane and stock in the parlour which had been on the bench in the other room—the prisoner had worked on the premises about three weeks before.</p>

On Friday morning, the 10th of Nov., about a quarter past ten o'clock, I met Biggs, Vitteridge, and Ross in company, coming out of the Bee Hive, in Crawford-street, drunk—Biggs asked me to have something to drink, and took hold of me round the waist—Vitteridge ran away from him, and ran down Spring-street—Biggs showed me some silver in his hands, and said, "You shall have something to drink"—I said, "I will drink another time with you"—he said, "Perhaps you will not have another chance, I have plenty of money, and it is all b—<hi rend="italic">square</hi> money"—Vitteridge then came back, and they proceeded up Crawford-street till they came to Montague-mews, where Biggs's father resides, and there I left them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Vitteridge's Defence.</hi> I get my living by washing and charing. About half-past six o'clock, on the morning of the 10th of Nov., Biggs and Ross came to my place; at least they came into the passage, and knocked at the next room door; the person living in the back parlour was out, and I opened the door to say so; they said, "We want a little washing done, can you do it for us?" I said, "Not before the afternoon;" they said that would do; they came in, and laid on the table a bundle, wrapped in this handkerchief. Ross took out a pair of boots, took a little pen-knife out of his pocket, and tried to cut the tops off; it did not cut well, and he said, "Will you lend me a stronger knife?" which I did, and he cut the tops off; they said, "We will make you a present of these; and as it is unlucky to keep a knife, you may have it." I threw it on the bed; they opened the bundle, and looked at the table-cloth. Ross said, "Biggs, I will lay you a shilling, that when this is washed it will pawn for half-a-crown." Biggs replied, "I will lay you what you like, that it won't pawn for more than 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but will you have it cleaned." I said, "I will this afternoon;" they took the boots, and said, "Will you bind them?" I said I had no tape; Ross gave me a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I went out, and bought some; and if you examine the boots, you will find that one is not finished now; the young man I was living with came in; I thought he looked angry at them, and said, "I cannot finish them now, I will this afternoon." Ross gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for binding them, and they went out; after breakfast, my young man said, "Mary, you must go for my brush." I went out, and met Biggs and Ross again. I went and got the brush, and met Ferryman at the door of the Adam and Eve, with a whitewash pail in his hand. I gave him the brush, and he went away. Biggs and Ross were there, and treated me to some gin; we went towards Crawford-street, and they treated me again: they went to another public-house, and got quarrel<lb/>ling, and I went away; when I got home I felt very ill, from the effects of the liquor, and laid down and fell asleep. Ferryman came home at twelve o'clock, and found me in bed, where I remained till the policeman came and said stolen property was there. I told them to go to the box, and said, "If it is stolen, I know nothing of it." I struck Ross, and said, "You thief, if it is stolen, you have brought us into it." It is the first thing I was ever charged with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cordwell's Defence.</hi> What Ross states against me is quite false; I had not seen him for nearly three weeks before. I was at home at my mother's at half-past eleven o'clock, and slept in the same room with my father and mother the whole evening, from half-past eleven till seven in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Charles George Price Windsor, of Victoria-road, Kensington. On the 2nd of Nov., the family was out of town—I do not know when they left home—it was on a Thursday—I was left alone in the house—I was at that time acquainted with the prisoner Blackman—the night my master left, a nurse was left in the house in charge of a little boy—I slept alone in the house on Friday night—Blackman lodged in High-street, Kensington, at Mr. Braid's sweetmeat shop—I went there on the Saturday, saw Blackman, and asked her to come and sleep with me that night—she did so—I slept alone on Sunday night—I saw her again on Monday, and went out with her from about eight o'clock till half-past, to see my bro<lb/>ther—she slept with me on Monday night and Tuesday night—I went with her on Tuesday nignt to her mother's, to tell her that she was going to sleep with me—she also slept with me on Wednesday and Thursday nights—in the coarse of that time I had some conversation with her about a young man who I knew at Lambeth, and on the Thursday she wanted me to go there to see if he was single—it was first spoken of in the day time, and again in the evening—I declined to go, both times—on the Friday night she slept with me—she asked me several times that evening to go to Lambeth to see this young man, and she went with me to her mo<lb/>ther's to say she was going to sleep with me, and after she had been there the repeated it ever so many times before her brother, asking me to go—she wished me to go at past ten o'clock, before her brother—she repeatedly expressed a wish that I should go—she did not state any object she had in wishing me to go—on my refusing to go at ten o'clock, she went up and whispered to her brother—I have a slight recollection of seeing Jones at her mother's that night—nothing was said in her brother's presence about plate—when we were at home, at Mr. Windsor's, in the course of the week before the Friday, she asked me whether they had taken the plate with them—I told her I did not know—she said what a lot of plate I had in my charge—I said I should not wish any thing to be missed, for I was very careful of it while they were away, and said that I had hid it—I did not say where—she knew it was down stairs, because she has seen, me go down stairs to hide it—she slept with me on the Friday night, and left between eleven and twelve on the Saturday—she had a dress to make for me, and she went to fetch it—she returned between one and two—she did not bring the dress—she said she had been in the town to her brothers—she stopped till about three o'clock—there was no occasion for her to have returned that I know of—she again left at three to fetch my dress—she returned at six without it, and said she had for<lb/>gotten it—she asked me a great many times that day to go to Lambeth—I said I could not say, I did not know whether the family would be home—she pressed me several times, and at length I agreed to go—we started about half-past nine—I am sure it was post nine—before we started I secured the house—I</p>

               <p>give her tbc keys to mind, because my pocket was very shallow and torn—I locked the kitchen door, the garden gate, and made all secure—we came out at the front gate, and up Victoria-road—when we got pretty near to the top of Victoria-rood, leading to the Kensington-road, she said she must go home for a handkerchief for her neck—I offered several times to lend her mine off my own neck—she said no, she must go home, and she ran away from me, and went home—she said she would not be many minutes before she was back—I followed her to where she lodged in High-street, Kensington, and I saw the prisoner Jones standing at the door of the house—she was in the passage—I saw her brother come along the passage, and Jones said to him that he could fetch the dog—Jones and Blackman's brother then went off together towards the Victoria-road—the female prisoner brought the keys to me, and told me to take them for fear she should lose them; and she went after them, in the same direction—she was not many minutes gone—she then came back, and begged of me again to go to Lambeth—I did not notice that she had any handkerchief on her neck then—she did not go up stairs to any apartment to get one while I was there—her brother and her returned nearly together—I do not know which returned first—I saw nothing more of Jones then—the female prisoner and I then went on to the Victoria-road together, and when I said I would go home, she said what was the use of going home, why not go on to Lambeth?—I said no, I would return home, for I did not like leaving the house—she several times wished me to go on to Lambeth—we then went down the Victoria-road together—when we got to my master's house I saw a man walking about there—I said to her that I did not like the appearance of it—we walked past the house, because I wanted to look at him—she then wished me to go with her and buy some paper in the new town, which is just beyond the back of our house, in the direction we were going—I said no, I would go home—she then wished me to go round the back of the house, not to go in—I said no, I would go in—I then gave her the key, to open the front garden gate—she made a great noise with the keys in opening it—when she had opened it I went in, and went round to the back kitchen door—she followed me—I had the key of the door, and tried to open it with it, but did not succeed—I tried to open it, and then the front bell rang—I gave Black man the key, and told her to try to open the door while I went to see who was at the gate—when I got to the gate there was nobody there—I did not see the person that I had formerly seen walking before the house—I then saw a light up in my master's dressing-room window—I was frightened, and began screaming "Thieves" and "Murder"—Blackman came to me, told me not to make that noise, and asked me what I was screaming about—Mr. Gee, my master's next door neighbour, and a gentleman named Surplim, who lives there, came to my assistance—I went to the back kitchen door; it was then open, and I saw Jones and another man rush out, and go towards the back gate, which was locked—they tried to open it—Jones then came up towards me, and the other one rushed towards the trees, and got out of sight—I told Jones he was the man that came out of the kitchen—he said he had only come to hear the screaming—I pointed him out to Mr. Gee, who took him—I then went for a policeman, and found Dunbar—before I came back Jones had been taken away—I went into the kitchen and found every drawer open—the plate-basket, and every thing on the table, and nurse's boxes, had been broken open, and a desk, (the plate was found up stairs in a bag)—all the things were still in the boxes and drawers, but were all turned over—the cupboard had been opened—in Mr. Windsor's dressing-room one drawer was tried to be broken open—the other drawers were not locked, and the things in them had been disturbed—most of them were found in a strange</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Edward-square, Kensington. On the 2nd of Dec. I was in an omnibus—when I got in I had a purse containing three foreign Danish gold coins, which I have had forty years, and six shillings—I received information from Clark—I found my purse, silver, and gold coins gone, my right pocket cut in two places, and part of my dress—this is my purse, and these are my coins.</p>

               <p>the Black wall Railway. I was acting as conductor to an omnibus on the 2nd of Dec.—the prosecutrix sat on the off side, next the door—the prisoner clare and a lady were opposite—Clare was nearest the door—Moore was next to the prosecutrix—as Moore had got in at Regent-circus he walked up the side of the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> to see who was in it—he got in—we proceeded a little further, and Clare hailed me, and he said I did not look out—I put him in, and made a remark that I thought they were bad characters, as I had had a lady robbed in my <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> a fortnight before—another lady got in, who got out again at Wind<lb/>mill-street, and I observed her dress was disordered—she had sat near Moore—the prosecutrix then got in, and during that time Moore shifted up to the end of the omnibus, but afterwards found his way down to her—we proceeded along—I picked up one or two more persons—we went to Temple-bar, and the prosecutrix desired me to put her down in Fleet-street—before we got to Chancery-lane Clare said he would alight—I said, "Very well"—Moore said he would get out, he had but little further to go, and would not trouble me to stop again—the prisoners did not appear to know each other—directly they got out I collared one with my right hand, and the other with my left, and Moore said to Clare, "Take it, take it, you d—d fool"—I asked the prosecutrix if she had been robbed—she at first said no—I said, "Be particular; if you are not robbed I am doing very wrong"—she felt in her pocket and said her purse was gone—I saw Moore's hand pass towards Clare's—I was obliged to release Moore then, because they both struggled very much, and Moore got away; Clare I held very tight—he kicked, and jumped, and did all he could to get away—I held him, hallooed, "Stop thief," and Moore was caught—Moore dropped the purse when he was taken, on the other side of Fleet-street—I took Clare to the station, and saw the purse brought in afterwards—the prosecutrix was sent for, and identified it—the scuffle took place between Temple-bar and the Temple-archway.</p>

On the 2nd of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was dressing my shop-window, and the prisoners came in, to look at some white window-blinds, which hung over some flannel—Calman said they would wear black (I saw he had a black patch on his head) they did not buy that, but bought a yard of green leno—about two or three o'clock I saw them again, and about a quarter past four a lady came in and bought something, and then I saw Calman again—a man called out that a piece of flannel was gone—I saw cleary with it—I called, "Stop thief," and he dropped it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Cook. There was some of his property in the house of the late Captain livingstone, in Pelham-place, Brompton—I have seen some of it since this inquiry, at a house at Prospect-place, Old Brompton, which is occupied by Ayley—amongst the property were two candlesticks, a pair of snuffers, seven forks, a chimney orna<lb/>ment, two salt-cellars, two decanters, 300 newspapers, one feather-bed, 100 books, two yards of carpet, and other things—I also saw some things at Clark's, the auctioneer's—some of them were my husband's, and some Captain Living<lb/>stone's—I resided in the captain's house up to Feb. last, and then left—I have not been there since—I have only passed it once since—my husband's property was in the house when I left in Feb.—Trigg was in the captain's service when I was there. In consequence of information from Dr. Lynch, I went to the captain's house about eight at night, on the 11th of Oct., but did not go in—I saw Trigg assisting at the hall door, and several men—I do not know whether Charles Davis was there—they were removing printed books and papers from the house into a van—I caused some of the police to follow the van—on the following Friday I went to the first-floor front room of the house in Prospect-place—I saw the same papers and books there that I had seen placed in the van—some of them belonged to my husband—the others belonged to Captain Livingstone—I had seen them in his house—I found a bed and other things there—I then caused Trigg and Charles Davis to be taken into custody—a day or two after, I got a search-warrant, and went to the house of George Davis, in Pond-place, Chelsea, and saw some other pro<lb/>perty.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who is your attorney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Steel—I am the pro<lb/>secutrix of this indictment, as far as my husband is concerned—I do not know that any one else employed Mr. Steel—my husband is in the Queen's Bench—he has been there between twelve snd thirteen years—he has been in the Fleet for not answering a suit in Chancery, and he was removed to the Queen's Bench—I have not borrowed money of the late Captain Livingstone—I swear that—I have had money of him—I cannot tell how often—it was for the purpose of housekeeping—I never had money from him on any goods I claimed to be mine—I first left the capta n last March twelve months, and he sent for me again last Jan.—he was very ill at the time—I finally left in Feb., by my own desire, and by desire of my friends—the captain did not desire me to leave—it was the wish of my eldest son—I had been living in that house with Captain Livingstone about three years—I never borrowed any money, or had any advances of him, nor had advances of him on any goods of my husband's or mine—I have not had as much as some hundreds of pounds from the captain, that I know of—I used to live in the drawing-room, and dined with him sometimes—we were on friendly terms—I never lived with him on any other but friendly terms, in the ordinary sense of the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What does all this mean? "Whereas, my husband, Samuel Cook, being now a prisoner for debt, and being in want of money for the support of himself, and me, and his family, he authorized me, from time to time, to raise money on certain articles of furniture and books, and in consequence of Mr. Jeremiah Livingstone's having advanced to me various sums of money amount<lb/>ing to 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I do deposit with him the following books, manuscripts," &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These were the books belonging to my husband—Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not in the habit of breaking sealed letters addressed to Mr. Livingstone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not but by his desire—I opened a letter in his presence by his desire, and answered that same letter to the gentleman—I never was applied to for any keys of Mr. Livingstone's, which had been lost—I never had any keys—I had that bond in my possession which I was charged with having taken—Mr. Livingstone gave it me to take down to the Rev. Mr. Donald, at St. Alban's—I did not take it out of the scrutoire—Mr. Living-stone gave it me, and I brought it to him again—I took it for the purpose of obtaining some money on it, but I did not obtain it—I handed it back to Mr. Livingstone again, and after that Mr. Colville had it in his possession at the Court of Chancery—Mr. Colville told me himself that he got it from the hands of Mr. Livingstone, and the deed too—I never was ordered by Mr. Livingstone to leave the house—to the last moment he solicited me to remain, in the presence of Trigg—I had not been living upon Mr. Livingstone for above ten years—I was living on my own means, which he obtained upon my papers—he was not in a condition to lend me money but on my papers—I might write to him in 1835 to get money of him—I was then seeking to get money on our papers.</p>
               <p>

               <p>possession of them till after the captain died—on Sunday afternoon Trigg rang the bell—I went up to see what was wanted—she said the captain wished to get up and be dressed—my husband and I went up—Charles came up afterwards when we rang for him—(I am giving an account to the best of my recollection)—we all assisted to dress the captain, and he walked into the next room with our assistance—he came back into the room, and wished Trigg to fetch him a pen, ink, and paper—she fetched it from the parlour—the captain wished to hate put down what he left to Charles—he tried to write, but was not able—he said, "Charles, I am not able to write now, but never mind, it will be all right"—he did not appear capable of writing—Charles took the pen out of his hand, and said, "Never mind, captain, you are not able"—we then all assisted to undress him, and persuaded him to go to bed, he seemed so much worse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Long-acre. On the 11th of Dec., at twelve o'clock at night, I was in St. James's Park—this prisoner asked me for some gift—I aid I had no money—she still kept hold of my arm—about half a dozen policemen met us, and she quitted my arm, went some distance, then came and took my arm again—I said I wanted nothing to do with her—she left me, and at the instant I felt a sudden jeck at my left-hand pocket—I found it was turned inside out—I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loose in it—I caught hold of her—she said, "Let me go—I said, "No, you don't go any further; you have robbed me"—I seized her two wrists—there were some females near; she need some slang language, they came up, and she tried to pass the money from her hands to theirs, but could not, and it fell on the ground—I picked it up at her feet.</p>

I have done nothing"—I felt his pockets, and found nothing there—an officer came and took him—I returned towards my shop, met the prisoner Fitzgerald, and gave her in charge—I had three pairs of stockings delivered to me—I did not see them picked up—here is my own ticket on some of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am parcels-agent at the London and Birmingham Rail<lb/>way at Euston-square.

Rurtter against the Excise parcels, I said, "How is it that you have now a genuine signature against the Excise parcels?—I told you to employ Francis as usual"—he said Francis did not meet him as he had done before, and therefore he delivered them himself—it was his duty to keep this book himself entirely—he had no authority to part with it to any<lb/>body—it would be a breach of his duty to do so—on the 26th I sent for Francis, and said, "What do you know about these Excise parcels?"—he said, "I have usually met Thorogood in Falcon-square, where he has always handed me the Excise parcels; I have sometimes delivered them, and some<lb/>times employed a man named Bugden to do it"—I said, "On Friday what did you do?"—he said "I met Thorogood in Falcon-square, and received two parcels from him; and I met Bugden, and delivered them to him, who returned shortly after with the money and gave it to Thorogood, and in hit presence signed the book J. Smith"—he stated that the genuine tickets, or the right tickets, had been torn up by Thorogood; and the fresh ones supplied by him to Francis's parcels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Allen, of the Two Brewers, High-street, Wandsworth. On the 21st of Nov. the prisoner came to the bar of my house, and asked for a bed—I lighted him up to bed—he told me he must go in the morning at seven o'clock, on his road to Kingston—there was one</p>
