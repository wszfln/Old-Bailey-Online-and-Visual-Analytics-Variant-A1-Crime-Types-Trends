On Sunday evening, the 22d of December, about half-past five o'clock, I left my house in the care of Kenaley, who was my errand boy, and had been a year and a half in my service. I desired him to make himself a comfortable fire in the parlour behind the shop, and gave him some books to read.

            , who had the care of my horse was with him. I went out for the purpose of attending chapel, but called at my brother's - I was sent for about nine o'clock, and found my daughter Elizabeth in tears. I found the inner door of the second parlour open; the lock was picked. I went to the drawers where I kept part of my money, and missed upwards of twenty sovereigns, some silver, and Bank notes - there was a 5 l. and a 10 l., and others, and two cheques, one for 30 l., and the other 18 l. There were marks of two chisels on the drawer, and in the other part of the drawer, I found the key of my iron chest, which I took to the chest, and found it locked. Some clothes which I had left on the top of it were thrown into the middle of the room, and upon opening it, I found there was not a farthing left. I lost above a hundred sovereigns, a 100 l. Bank note, a 80 l. Bank post bill, and from one to two hundred crown pieces. My suspicions fell on Kenaley. I had a very sharp dog in the house - no stranger could enter without his barking; the same dog was with me when Strong lived there, and if it was here it would run at him now I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Kenaley was accused himself - A. Yes. I have lodgers; the same people lodge with me now. I kept the keys of the iron chest in the drawer - I do not think Kenaley knew that; he had no access to that parlour. I have recovered none of my notes.</p>

            . In December last I lived with the prosecutor - I had been in his service nearly two years before, and came back to him the Monday before the robbery. In that week, I met the prisoner at the Lamb and Flag, public-house, kept by Mr. Evenden, in James-street, Manchester-square; it was on the Friday evening - he asked if I had gone back; I said I had; he said that was all right, and if he came on Sunday would I let him in - I said I did not know whether it would be my turn to stop at home on the Sunday or not; he said I could stop if I liked, and if I did would I let him in; I refused and went away. I saw him again on the Saturday night, at the same place - he said if he and Bob came the next night, would I let them in, (I had seen Bob in his company before, but did not know his name); I said there would be no way for them to come in - he said Chandler would watch the man out of the stable, meaning Griffiths my fellow servant, who took care of the horse. I agreed to do it - Bob was present at both the conversations on Friday and Saturday. Strong said he thought my master had a great deal of money in the house, and that fishmongering was a good trade. I went home to tea, and afterwards returned to the public-house, but saw no more of them. Chandler was not present at these conversations. I saw them again about five o'clock on Sunday evening, at the Lamb and Flag. On the Saturday evening, Strong also said Chandler would watch my master out to chapel - he always went on Sunday nights, and did so when Strong was there. When I went on the Sunday, they asked me if I was going home to tea, I said I was, and would return - I returned in about an hour, and found Strong there alone; he asked if I was going back to the shop, I said, Yes - we then came out, and he asked if my master was at the shop, I said he was not. He said Chandler and Bob were in James-street. He told me to tell the man to go and clean the horse directly, I said I would. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190004"/>agreed that when the man was gone, I was to stop at the door, and should see him at the corner opposite, I said I would. He said when the man was gone they would come in. I went to the shop; Griffiths was there - he said he would go and do his horse up, and then go home; I said, very well - he went, and I went to the door, and saw them at the opposite corner; Strong and Bob came over - I did not see Chandler; they had some keys; I do not know what they did with them. I remained at the door while they went in. They had a chisel, which would not do - Bob went and got another; they were in the house about ten minutes. I was not at the door all the time - I went into the room and saw them opening the drawer; they said they would go and fetch another chisel - they did not make much noise. I had not seen the dog after returning from tea. As they went out, I asked them how much they had got; they said about 300 l., and said I must know nothing about it. No appointment was made for me to meet them about it. I never learnt from the prisoner what became of it. Griffiths came back from the stable in about half an hour - I was sitting in the outer parlour; he came in and did not stop two minutes, and then left, but before he went, I left him in the house while I took some oysters into Manchester-square - I was gone about twenty minutes, and on returning found a girl talking to him at the door, and when she went away, he asked me who she was, I told him; he said she had been standing there for five minutes. I said I knew her by seeing her walk by the shop. He went away in about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prosecutor took you out of a charity school I believe - A. Yes. I was examined twice before I charged the prisoner with the robbery. I said at the first examination that I had been out with oysters, and did not know whether the robbery was done during that time or not. I have been in the House of Correction ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that you was sorry you had accused the prisoner for he had no hand in it, but Bob was the person who broke the place open - A. No. I do not know one Barry. I was in the room when they said they must fetch another chisel. I told the Magistrate about another chisel being sent for.</p>

On the 4th of January, the prisoner applied at the stables for a horse and chaise to hire, for twenty-eight days - he was to pay ten guineas for that time; he said he was the son of Mr. Hale, of Grosvenor-place. I knew there was such a person, a gentleman of property. He said he would have given me a reference to Martin's banking-house in Bond-street, but not being on good terms with his father, he did not like to give too many references at the banker's - that he lived at Hyde Cottage, near Edgware. He also referred me to Mr. Smith's, North Audley-street; I called upon him, but he was not within. The prisoner came again, I told him I had not seen Mr. Smith; he then said he would have referred me to Martin's, as I said before; on his representations, I was induced to let him have the horse and chaise on those terms, and gave him the stamp office ticket for the month. In about ten days or a fortnight, I began to make enquiry about my horse and chaise, and after the month had expired, I found the chaise and harness at Stone's livery stables, Marylebone-street, and the horse at Mr. Parker's of Southall; they were the same that I let the prisoner. I had found the prisoner at the Mitre, public-house, Connaught-terrace, on the Thursday after the twenty-eight days had expired, and asked where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190005"/>the horse and chaise were, he said at Hampstead, and not being satisfied, I took him into custody, and found them in consequence of information; it was a brown gelding - they are now in my father's possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I first applied your foreman stated the terms much higher; but they were lowered in considation of my taking it for three months - Witness. I recollect nothing being mentioned about three months - it was let for one month.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Southall. On the 27th of January, the prisoner came to me in Berner-street, where I live when in town, and said he had got a horse and chaise to dispose of (I did not know him before, but my servant had seen him); he brought the horse and chaise to the door. I sent my servant with him to Mr. Stone's, in Marylebone-street, to enquire his opinion of the value; his hostler said, 20 l. I asked the prisoner where he got the horse and chaise, and how long he had had them - he said about three months, but did not say where he got it. I asked what he was, he said an officer in the army; I asked him if any one recommended him to me; he said, Yes, Mr. Kemp of Pimlico - I had known Mr. Kemp, of Pimlico, upwards of thirty years. He asked 23 l. or 24 l. for it altogether; I said I was informed 20 l. was the value, and would give no more - he agreed to take it, and gave me this receipt for the money (looking at it); my servant wrote the body of it, and he signed it in my presence; it is signed

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hired the horse and gig under the belief that if I paid regularly for the first month, I was to have it for three months, and before the expiration of the first month, I was unfortunately embarrased, and wanted to pledge it, hoping I should be able to redeem it before the time expired. I applied to Kemp, a pawnbroker, of Pimlico, who said it was not in his way, but that Parker took pledges of that kind, and I went, and saw him in the presence of his clerk - he said, No, it would eat more than its value in the year, but if I chose to make a sale of it he would insure me the return in a month, and if I called on Monday, he would look at it, which I did; he came down, and looked at it. I had said I only wanted 20 l., but on Monday asked for 25 l. - he said,</p>
               <p>"You said 20 l. at first, and 20 l. you shall have." He asked where I lived, I gave him the address; he asked if I would let his clerk drive it into the City to get a bill cashed, and if I called in an hour I should have the money; he agreed to keep it for a month. I returned in an hour, and when his clerk returned he laid the money on the table. I repeated the stipulations before his clerk. I asked him to write the agreement at the back of the receipt; he said he often had dealings of this kind, and never had his credit called into question, and it was not customary to write the stipulations. I gave him the receipt, he engaging to keep it for a month, and said if it was a day over the month, and the interest and keep not paid, he should not keep it. He asked what interest I gave, I said 3 l. would be sufficient; he said 3 l. would be too much, he would say 2 l.; and at the time I pledged it, I had every idea of being able to redeem it before the month expired, and had no idea of making away with it.</p>

I ran out, and saw two young men standing at the door - I found a pane of glass broken, and missed some shoes, I cannot tell how many. The pane was not quite out; it was a piece cut out at the corner; they had then put a hand through and opened the casement, which was fastened with a wire. I found the window about two inches open; a person could put his hand in, and take the shoes. I had seen it about half an hour before; I did not examine the pane then; I could see that the window was not unfastened then. I asked the two young men if they had seen anybody near, for somebody had been robbing me - they said they saw two boys; they went away on saying so, but one of them returned in about a minute, and said there were some very suspicious boys round the corner - I ran over towards the boys, One of the young men said,</p>
               <p>"That is him, catch him." The two prisoners were then together, I went to take Fairer, he ran off as hard as he could, I secured him, and gave him in charge.</p>

I went to the house, and the landlady brought me up a pair shoes, out of the area - I gave them to the constable of the night at the watch-house.

My friend came out, we went on, and as we turned into Henrietta-street, at the corner of the street and Bird-street, we observed the two prisoner's as if looking for something; we passed them about five yards - Harding ran after us, and asked if we had picked up a shoe; we said, No. It immediately struck me they were the theives - I sent my friend to the prosecutor's house, and while he was gone they kept looking for the shoe. Fairer said they had bought a pair of shoes, and shewed me one, saying it was the fellow to that they lost. The prosecutor came up - I said,</p>
               <p>"That is he, mark him," pointing to Fairer; he immediately took to his heels, and Harding walked leisurely across the road, turned round, and seeing me following him, he unbuttoned his coat, threw something down the area, and then ran off - I followed and took him at the corner of James-street, and gave him to the watchman.

               <p>"Don't shove me against the window;" and at that time I had a sight of the prisoners - Cox had hold of my arm, and Davis was very busy about my person, at my right side - I am certain of them both. I was released immediately I told them not to push me against the window - it struck me immediately that I was robbed; I clapped my hand on my fob, and missed my watch and chain; I said,</p>
               <p>"I've lost my watch," still keeping my eye on the prisoners, who were going away. A man said,</p>

               <p>"Young man, where is my watch?" he immediately up with his clenched fist, and struck me on the mouth. I called out,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake help;" Cox then came up, and I immediately received a violent blow on the face; I am not sure he struck it. I still kept Davis, and grasped at Cox with my left hand - I held them both, and was down on my left knee crying for help, still holding them both, and while down I received several kicks or blows about my body. Two patrols came up, and I gave the prisoners in their charge. My watch was not found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How long had you seen your watch before you put your head through the window - A. I did not put my head through the window; I only looked in. I had put my watch into my fob two minutes before - I had just left the shop. I did not pull it out in the street; nobody could take it before I got into the crowd. I did not feel it taken. Davis did not strike till I collared him - four or five persons were about me, but my eye was on the prisoners.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Davis touch your person - A. Yes; I felt his hand down at my trowsers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cox. Q. You said nothing to the Magistrate about my holding your arms or striking you - A. I did not mention every thing to the Magistrate, for I was so irritated, and all in a gore of blood. I said my arms were pinioned, and I think I said Cox was one who pinioned them; but I was confused, and on recovering I recollected every thing. I am certain of both of them.</p>

On the 8th of February, about a quarter before six o'clock, Hall and I were coming along Whitechapel; there was a mob at the corner of Goulston-street, we ran across, and were told a gentleman had lost his watch. I immediately ran, and just before I got to Petticoat-lane, I found the prosecutor holding Davis - he complained of losing his watch. I secured Davis, and Hall took Cox, who was standing by.

               <p>"I have got nothing." I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cox. Q. Did I resist - A. Yes. When I first went up, he was striking the prosecutor, and when I laid hold of him, he made all the resistance possible.</p>

               <p>DAVIS'S Defence. I was passing; the prosecutor said he had lost his watch. I stood in the crowd, and if I had known anything of it, he could have taken me in the crowd; but I walked away to Petticoat-lane, when he knocked my hat off, and I struck him.</p>

I sent for Forrester, but he did not come. I drank nothing, but went into the bar, and had tea with the landlady - I left there about five minutes past nine o'clock; two officers saw me home. When I went into the wine vaults, I had two rings on my finger. The prisoner called me by the most in famous names, and spit upon me eight or nine times; I never spoke to her before that. I had indicted Martin, who she lived with, for a conspiracy - she said,</p>
               <p>"If that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190008"/>won't suit you Madam," and then threw off her shawl and bonnet, and began to beat me; I protected my face with my hands, and she took my ring off, and after breaking my thumb, and knocking out one of my teeth, she went out. I then missed the ring, and took a candle, but could not find it. I felt her pull my ring off; she then returned, and tore my cap and gown off. I went before the Lord Mayor about it, but she was bailed, and Martin went to indict me for it - I went out of the way, to avoid their taking my life.</p>

The prisoner came and offered an article in pawn, but would not take what I offered, and left. In half a minute I missed the gown and coat, which she must have passed to go out. I looked up the court, and saw her turning the corner - I secured her; but before I got up to her, I thought she threw something from her lap; she returned to the shop with me willingly. I left her in Mr. Whitaker's charge, while I went to look for the goods - there was nobody else in the court. I found them on the very spot where I thought I saw her drop them. She said she was going to the other end of the town; but there was no thoroughfare in the court - she at first said she was going to call on somebody in the court, but nobody knew her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to pawn an article for 6 s., he offered 4 s. I turned down the court, and finding it no thoroughfare, I returned, and met him - he asked me to walk back, which I did; he examined my parcel, and then begged my pardon. Two women in the shop said, they saw it taken, but could not say it was me; he desired me to go about my business, and I was angry at being accused. The young man brought the things in, and said he would detain me for my impudence.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 18th of January, a little after five o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and pointed to two gold rings, which he wanted to see - I shewed them to him; I stood by him all the time - my mother was in the shop. The price, 12 s. 6 d. was marked on them each. He offered 10 s. for one; my mother refused to take it, and after asking for other things, he put one on his finger, and had the other in his hand, and then went out of the shop; I pursued, calling Stop thief! and only lost sight of him for a moment, while he turned the corner into the pig-market - my father was crossing the market, and stopped him. They have not been found. I am certain he had them.</p>

            , of Little Distaff-lane. I sell ribbons - Wigley came into my shop on Friday last, about one o'clock; I was in the shop alone; she asked for some narrow ribbons - I cut one yard off for her, which came to a penny. The other ribbons were in the window, but not within her reach, unless she undrew a curtain - she had a child with her, and tied the child's shoe with the ribbon, and while she was doing so, Giles came in, but did not speak to her - she asked for some satin ribbon to trim her bonnet; I went round the counter, and shewed her the ribbons, which hung in the window, but took none out. She hesitated about them - Wigley then asked if I had any black ribbon to trim her bonnet; I said I had purple which would do as well, she would not have it, and asked the price of some caps on the counter, and tried one on - I turned my head from Giles now and then, but did not leave her. Giles offered 1 s. 9 d. for three yards of ribbon, which I could not take - she kept hesitating, and then I found Wigley was going; I looked to see if the caps were all safe; by that time she had got close to Giles, and stood with her back to her - she appeared pulling down her own shawl; I saw her countenance change, which induced me to watch her; she immediately left the shop - Giles kept holding the ribbon. At that moment my husband came in, and before he entered the door, he asked me where the ribbons were, which had hung in the window - I then missed a piece, and asked Giles if she had got it, she said, No. My husband went for an officer, who came; I told him another woman had been there, and described her - we went after her; she was found in half an hour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190010"/>after. Giles was searched in my presence, and five or six halfpence found upon her - she had not got 1 s. 9 d. We let her go, not finding the property on her. I missed the purple ribbon, which I had offered her - nobody but them had been in the shop. Giles denied all knowledge of Wigley while she was in the shop. They were both apprehended together in a gin shop; she then said Wigley was her sister-in-law. Wigley had then changed her bonnet and shawl.</p>

            . When I came home, I found Giles in the shop, with a ribbon in her hand, looking at it. I said to my wife,</p>
               <p>"Have not you lost a ribbon;" she said, No, but on looking round, she found she had. I ran for an officer, who went in search of Wigley. We let Giles go and she left her address, and in half an hour, we found them together, in a gin-shop in Shoemaker-row - she had told me she lived opposite the gin-shop. She denied all knowledge of Wigley in the shop, but afterwards said she was her sister-in-law. Wigley said nothing - she did not hear Giles say this. They were given in charge.</p>

My sister-in-law lives in the same house; she came and told me she had been charged with stealing ribbons - we went in and had some beer. Mines and the gentleman came in and took us - I told them they might go up and search my place. I had 2 s. in my hand. A woman searched me at the Compter.</p>

I offered 1 s. 9 d. for the ribbon - she could not take it. A gentleman came and shut the door - I was searched, and nothing found upon me. I have lived in the parish many years. I gave them my name and address. I went and told my sister-in-law, and we went to have a pint of beer. Mines came in and took us.</p>

            . On the 7th of February last, I dined at the Service-club, in Regent-street, and left the house shortly after eight o'clock. I had a severe cold, and abstained from drinking - I was quite sober. I returned home through St. James's-square, by the house of the late Lord Londonderry, and up King-street - I had walked by the bottom of Duke-street, about twelve yards. I was dressed in a Portuguese cloak, which confined my arms a good deal; it was open in front, and my chain and seals were exposed. I do not recollect meeting anybody in <placeName id="t18230219-18-crimeloc108">King-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230219-18-crimeloc108" type="placeName" value="King-street"/>

I half turned round to see who it was, and in turning I fell against the rails. I saw a man standing close behind me, with both hands lifted up, in an attitude ready to strike - I imagined that he had an enormous stick; but I do not think it could have been so, because if it had it must have fractured my scull. I called loudly for help, and cannot say that the second blow fell upon me; I held up my umbrella, but I rather think the man did not strike, but ran away. At that moment I saw two men on the other side of the way. There were three gas lights; the most distant of which was not many yards off - one of those two men pursued the one who struck me, and the other crossed to my help. In a few minutes the prisoner was brought up to me, by Roper and Donovan, who were the persons I saw pursuing him. He appeared very much agitated, and said to me,</p>
               <p>"Are you the man I shoved against just now?" I believe I answered,</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you call shoving, but I am the man whom some cowardly villian has most cruelly assaulted behind my back;" I think he said,</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, I took you for another man." I desired he might be carried to St. James's watch-house - I followed as well as I could with assistance. I felt myself much hurt, and could not speak plain, my tongue was parlalyzed. When I got to the watch-house, I felt sick and faint - I did not then see the prisoner; I told the constable it was a man of the same stature as that (meaning Donovan, who stood before me); I did not mean to accuse him as being the person. I was much agitated, and did not know who the person was. Upon getting home, I had fomentations applied to my head, which was exceedingly swollen, but not cut. When the prisoner was brought up to me, a cotton umbrella was produced, saturated with wet, as if from rain - it did not rain then, but I think it must have rained before. The soldier who had it, said the prisoner had struck him. He was dressed much meaner than he is now, and was much agitated at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When you described the person at the watch-house, the prisoner was not in your view - A. No. Being much agitated, I cannot be certain what passed. I cannot say whether the man had passed me, but if he had not he could not have seen my seals. He was near fainting at the watch-house - I cannot say whether any words passed after I received the blow, nothing was said before. I held up a silk umbrella instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought to you, he said he mistook you for another person - A. To the best of my recollection he did.</p>

I had occasion to come from Pimlico, where I live, to Poland-street - I crossed the Park, and finding it very cold, I ran or trotted across the Park into Pall Mall, up Kings-place, into King-street, and was met by a man, who made a heavy thrust at my stomach with a stick or umbrella, which irritated me - I turned round, ran a few paces after him, and thrust at him with my umbrella, and struck him. I saw one or two persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190012"/>whom I thought belonged to him, and ran to prevent my being ill-used.</p>

Freeman went to one door, and I to the other - I asked for admittance, and somebody inside used a bad expression, and refused to admit us. I then broke the door open, and saw Walker; he jumped out of bed, (the door opened into that room) he had his trowsers on. Aldridge sat in a chair, with a child in his arms, and Gibson rushed out at the front door, Freeman stopped him. I searched the place, and found a glass jug on a side-board, in a corner by the fire place, and behind the back of the stove, I found a two crow bars, a box with phosphorus matches, four keys in an unfinished state, but in preparation for cutting to make picklock keys, and some wax, with the impression of a key on it. The rope ladder was under the bed; it would reach to a third floor room. There was a false back made to the table drawer, and the keys were in there.</p>

I went with the officer on the 14th of January - we found the prisoners at the house; Gibson was endeavouring to escape, and Walker attempted to come out half dressed, he had his trowsers on. I found a hat on Gibson's head, which the prosecutor claimed. The tea-pot was on the mantle piece - I saw the implements found, and applied the crow-bars to Armstrong's window shutter; they had used both ends of one of them, and some marks agreed with the other one.</p>

I stooped down to pick it up, and she thrust her hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took out a little canvass bag with a shilling in it; I immediately seized her - she fastened her teeth into my hand. I called the watchman, who forced the bag out of her hand with the shilling in it.</p>

               <p>"It is you Miss Oldfield is it, you must come with me." She was very impudent, and in liquor.</p>

We went into the Queen's Head, public-house, and had a glass each; he began to be very sick, and said he would go home with me all night - I said he should not, he said if I did not give him a lodging, he would give me one. The watchman came up, and he had the purse in his hand all the while.</p>

I pursued him till he came to the corner of Bedford-street, and then collared him; he dropped them, and resisted.

I had some money and other things in my care belonging to my fellow servant, Robert Beeson, who was in the hospital. There were four 10 l. notes and a 5 l., and twenty four sovereigns, a gold seal, and a thimble of my own - I kept it in a box, which was not locked, in an upper bed room - I did not sleep in that room as it was not finished. The prisoner was backwards and forwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190014"/>fetching water for the men. I saw him in the morning of the 28th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, near some of the other bed room doors - I saw my box safe about half-past ten o'clock that morning; I opened it and every thing was safe. Some of the sovereigns were in one part of the box, and some in another, loose in a little box. I missed the property about half-past six o'clock in the evening - there had been but one workmen employed in that room, and he was a carpenter - he only put a lock on the door; that was before one o'clock. I think the door was not locked at all. I missed all the property together. I went to the box for the thimble, and missed all this property. I went and told my master of it - he had not slept there at all. I and the housemaid first slept there on Monday the 27th. We expected our master would come to sleep there in a day or two - there was but one bed in the house, and that was on the first floor. The prisoner was apprehended next morning, and my thimble produced. I got back nine sovereigns, eight shillings, and a gold seal a few days afterwards.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th, about eight o'clock at night, I was informed of this robbery. I went to the house at nine o'clock next morning, and examined a side drawer in the box, and there found four 10 l. notes, a 5 l., and six sovereigns. The prisoner's father was at work there at the time - the father said he lodged in Queen-street, Seven-dials. I went there, and found a box locked; I asked the father if he had the key, his wife said the prisoner had it - the father forced it open, and I found in it a brace of pistols and a bullet mould. At that moment the prisoner came into the room - I asked how he came by them; he said he found them. I searched him, and found a silver watch in his pocket; he said he found that also. I asked what he had done with the remainder of the money, and said I could hold out no hopes to him - he said,</p>
               <p>"If you won't hurt me, I will take you round the corner and tell you where the money is;" I told him not to say anything - he seemed alarmed; he went round into Great St. Andrew-street, and into a Jew's clothes shop, and said to the Jew,</p>
               <p>"Give me the money I gave you last night" - the Jew said he gave him no money, but paid him 12 s. for a jacket - the prisoner said he had left between seven and eight sovereigns with him; the Jew denied it. I then asked the prisoner what he had done with the rest, he said he had bought a brace of pistols, and gave three sovereigns to another boy, whom he met in the street - I asked what he had done with the seal and thimble; he said he had pawned his coat, and if I would go to a pawnbroker's, which he directed me to, I should find the seal in the jacket, which I did, and have kept it ever since. He directed me to where the watch was bought; I went and returned it, and got back 5 l. 2 s. from the watchmaker, and the money for the pistols from Jones. I got back 9 l. 10 s. in all. I produce the seal and thimble.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your Lordship and Gentlemen, I stand charged with stealing a handkerchief, which I deny - though it is of little use, for you are bound to give a verdict according to the evidence, and it is my misfortune to be in custody at a time when I am too poor to employ counsel. I understand two persons can prove my innocence, but have nobody to send for them. I was convicted here at a former period, and soon liberated having His Majesty's Most Gracious pardon. All I can say is that in this, as in the former case, I have been pursued by bad men, who seek my destruction.</p>

I went to No. 25, Bunhill-row, but could find no such person. I returned and told him, I would not be trifled with; he then said he had it from his mother, who lived in the Hackney-road, and if I went there I should be satisfied. I went and found her, but had no reason (from what I heard there), to believe his account was correct. I returned and gave him in charge. I had locked him in the parlour, while I went, and the other two watches were found just where he sat, among a bundle of clothes, we knew nothing of them, he was not present when they were found. Marsden came in and claimed the one offered in pawn. We had not then found the others, but when he saw them, he claimed them. I produce the one he offered me.</p>

I went in and found her behind the door; I told her she was charged with stealing 35 l. from her uncle, (Mr. Kemp.) she denied knowing any thing about it. I took her up stairs to an apartment, which she shewed me as her own, and searched her in Wayling's presence. I found no notes upon her; I said,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed your uncle before." She said, she never did it before; I neither promised or threatend her, she was much in liquor. I told Wayling to take her to the watch-house, and I searched the house. Parrott was out at that time. I put Eagleston at the door to take her if she came in, and bring her up to me. I remained up stairs with a girl who was in the house, and in about an hour Eagleston brought Parrott up to me. I searched her but found nothing. I told her (Parrott) I was still certain she had the money. She sat down on the bed and called God to witness she had never seen it. I was going to take her to the watch-house; she wanted to go down stairs to a young girl who was laying in - she wished me to leave the room; I refused, and she then asked the girl to give her the notes, she had given her to take care of; she handed them over to her; I caught hold of them; there were three 10 l. notes, which the prosecutor claimed. We took them to Bow-street, and went from thence in a coach to the Mansion-house, and as we went, the prisoner said to Parrott.</p>
               <p>"I never should have robbed my uncle if it had not been for you." (Parrott is between fifty and sixty years old.) She said, Parrott had said she owed her a little money, and she must get it somewhere or other, and that she told her afterwards, that she had robbed her uncle of the money; that Parrott had a son in Whitecross-street prison, and the notes were to be taken there to be put off, and that Parrott was to have one 10 l. note herself out of it, and that she had nearly the whole of the change of the 5 l. note.</p>

In returning I met Alvey alone, with a pair of half boots in his hand - I seized him, he dropped the boots in my hand, scuffled, and got off - I cried Stop thief! and followed; he was taken in about an hour after; I am certain of him. The boots are mine. My<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190017"/>son went with me to look after them, and in crossing Smithfield we met the two prisoners together.

On the 8th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was on Holborn-hill, on the opposite side to Mr. Martin, and saw the prisoner in company with two more running after the prosecutor. I watched them and saw, Jordan take the handkerchief out; they all ran up Union-court - I sent a man to stop the gentleman. I followed, and lost sight of them - I knew them before. I went towards Field-lane, and met Wilden, who accompanied me, and in West-street, I took Jordan; he was standing at the corner of a court in company with several more. I had taken the other two before that. I found the handkerchief in his hat with another; he said he bought them of a sailor. Mr. Martin claimed it, and produced the fellow one.</p>

On Sunday evening the 26th of January, I went out about a quarter before six o'clock, leaving only Mrs. Dale, who lodges on the first floor at home, it was dark. I returned about seven o'clock, and saw a light shining on the wall of the stair-case; I immediately went back, and saw White and Anderson. I got a light, and we all went up stairs, and found the prisoner trying to get out of the first floor window; Dale occupies that room. He ran to the landing, and struck me on the side of my head, and then knocked the other man down, and ran into the second floor back room. A third man collared him; and I laid hold of him, and brought him down, and took him outside the door, and laid him on the snow, and took him to the watch-house. I returned to the house, and went into the first floor rooms, and found the linen laying about the floor, and in the back room the trunks were on the bed. My master picked up a crow-bar, soon after in a chair, in the front room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he ever get away - A. No. I first saw him in the front room. Holmes never slept in the house, but I do, and his other servants do. I saw the prisoner's face distinctly.</p>

I returned about eight o'clock, and found every thing in confusion; the drawers were all open, and the linen laying about on the ground. I missed thirteen sovereigns and some old silver coin out of a trunk; two watches and a pair of silver sleeve buttons. I had left every thing safe; the watches and money were entirely gone.</p>

            . I am a constable of Shadwell. I was sent for and took charge of the prisoner, about half past seven o'clock. It was quite dark. I searched him and found two matches in his waistcoat pocket, and his left hand coat pocket was turned inside out. Next morning, Bowcott, who keeps a shop next door to Holmes, brought me a small piece of candle and two matches wrapped up in a paper; and on the Monday evening, Sedger brought a watch to the watch-house.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Holmes. On the morning of the robbery, I heard a cry for assistance, and immediately went. I found the prisoner and the witness on the snow; I assisted in securing him. As we got to Smellie's door, the prisoner was struggling and fell on one knee; and after he was put into the watch-house. I went back to the spot, and found a green-bag on the snow, near the curb; it contained seven skeleton and one picklock key, which I gave to the officer. When we took him to the watch-house, he laid down at the door on the right hand side of the steps, and on that spot I found next morning, a piece of wax candle and two matches, which I also gave to the officer.</p>

            . I went to Holmes's house - no force was used to the doors, they must have been entered by false keys. I picked up a skeleton key which unlocked the door. I also found a silver watch and sleeve button. I saw the prisoner at the watch-house, and asked where he lived. He said in North-street, City-road, but afterwards he said in Great Gardner-street. I asked what he was, he said a chair-maker. I asked who he worked for, he hesitated. I then asked where he worked last, and who for. He said he had sold half a dozen chairs in Moorfields, but could not tell me the name or number. Bowcott gave me eight skeleton keys, and one picklock key. Another picklock key was given me by a young woman who picked it up.</p>

When he left, I missed my silver hunting watch, with a seal and two keys, and a silver snuff-box off my bed-room table; my trowsers which I had placed on a chair by my bed side, and 2 l. 15 s., which was in the pocket; also my hat and gloves from down stairs, a pair of nankeen trowsers from my drawers, and two silk and one white handkerchief out of the same drawers, and two pair of stockings; my watch, snuff-box, and two handkerchiefs were afterwards produced at Worship-street.</p>

            . I am a constable of Coventry. On the morning of the 7th of January, about eight o'clock, as I came out of a private lodging-house, at Coventry. I met the prisoner coming in enquiring for a lodging - the coach comes in early in the morning - he had no bundle. I saw he was rather intoxicated, and advised the lodging-house keeper to let him have a bed. I stopped with him a few minutes; he was telling the lodging-house keeper that he had paid 17 s. for a chaise from London to Barnett, to take the coach. I took no notice, but thought his statement not correct. In the evening, I went to the house again - he was then in the kitchen. I said I would go with him to the coach-office, which I did, with the landlady. I asked the clerk if he knew him; he said he believed him to be the person who came down by the coach that morning, that the coach had gone to Liverpool without him, for he was so intoxicated, and they had had much trouble with him on the road. I asked what money he had about him, as he was going to Liverpool; he said as much as would take him there. I took him to the watch-house, searched him, and found a purse in his pocket containing eight sovereigns, seven half crowns, five shillings, two sixpences, and an old coin, and in his waistcoat pocket was another half crown. In his coat pocket I found a silver snuff-box, and in his breeches pocket a small silver hunting-watch, and in his great coatpocket, two pair of stockings, two white pocket handkerchiefs, a coloured handkerchief, and a night cap. The hat he had on was claimed by Burk. I have had them ever since.</p>

             very well. I saw him at the house, on Sunday, the 26th of January, at half past one o'clock in the day; he spoke disrespectful things of the prisoner there. I saw the prisoner a few minutes after Durham left the house, and I told him what Durham had said; he said he was a good for nothing man, and had he been there he would have given him a good hiding; but if he did, he would take the law of him, and therefore it was better to leave him alone. I saw him and Durham in the street, opposite the house that night, about a quarter past eleven o'clock. It was a very light night and frosty, and there were lumps of hard snow on the ground. I could hear distinctly what they said. The prisoner said, to the deceased,</p>
               <p>"What have you been saying disrespectful of me;" Deceased said,</p>
               <p>"What I like;" he repeated this several times. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I would give you a good hiding, but you would take the law of me." The deceased answered no, I would not, and immediately took off his hat, and laid it on a lump of snow, and put himself in a fighting attitude; they began to fight together. I think Durham hit the first blow in the prisoner's face; the prisoner then struck him - Durham fell on the stones on the opposite side, where the snow was swept; he got up, took his hat and hurried away towards his father's. He was not so stout as the prisoner, but about his height.</p>

The stones were all pebbles, and very sharp; he was thrown on the pavement with violence; he was quite thrown up, his feet were a yard and a quarter off the ground, when his head touched the pavement; he rose his head from the pavement, and I saw the blood trickle down from the wound; he got up and put himself again in a fighting attitude; they set too and he received a blow; he then took up his hat and walked off towards his father's, saying he would fight no more. Bingley went towards home.</p>

I considered him at that time in a dying state; there was not the least hopes of him from the first moment I saw him. He asked me to go with him to see if the man could be apprehended.

He came to the hospital to remain, on Sunday evening, the 2d of February.

On the 29th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I went into the parlour, and she was laying on the sofa-bedstead, and said she had a pain in her chest; I said, I thought she was in labour, she denied it; I sent for her aunt, who came, she went to get a room for her, and sent her cousin to fetch her to the room - we got a coach for her. Her cousin went behind her to put on her things, and heard the child cry, she was delivered of it between the time her aunt came, and our getting the coach; nobody was with her at the time.

I found some clothes for it - it was a very fine boy, its nails were grown, we tried to feed it, but could get nothing whatever down it. I told the nurse it would not live from the first, that was my opinion; it died at two o'clock next morning. She never had it in bed with her, or touched it after the nurse came, which was about half an hour after it was born.</p>

I had spoken to her about her condition, and told her she had better go home to her father's; she said her father had a large family, and had trouble enough, and she wished to get another situation. I was sent for, and went to her; she complained of a pain in her chest - I went to get her a lodging, and sent my daughter for her, she did not come, and I went back, and saw marks on the child's neck after it was washed.

When he came down he stated his apprehensions, and having seen some blood on the stairs leading to the yard, he asked for a candle - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190021"/>went with him to the privy, and found an infant laying on its back, with the head and part of the neck in the soil; I sent for a person who came in half an hour, and took it up - it was put into a box unwashed. I could see no marks of violence on it in the state it was then in. The constable nailed the box down, and put it in the front vault of my house, and nailed up the door. This was late on Saturday evening - it remained there till Monday morning, when Howell took it away.</p>

            . I am an apothecary. On the 4th of January, Mr. Ellis sent for me about eight o'clock in the evening. I first went to the privy, and on throwing down a piece of lighted paper, I saw the child laying on its back, and the head depressed on the soil. The chest and face were visible, but sunk a little in the soil; Mr. Ellis sent for Watson to take it up; I did not observe any thing about its neck - I went up stairs to the prisoner with Mrs. Ellis, who introduced me as a medical man, and left me with her; I asked if she wished for my assistance, she said No, that she had been poorly, but was better - this was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no reason to suppose from what passed, that she had been recently brought to bed - A. Not the least; the child appeared not to have come to maturity by a month or two - I am induced to think it was born alive by its general healthy appearance, but cannot say it was so. A feeling similar to an inclination to stool, is very common in pregnancy. I opened the body and found the lungs inflated, and from that I think it had breathed, but that is not conclusive - it might have imbibed sufficient air, even in parturition so as to have inflated the lungs.</p>

I had drank 6 d. of gin and water, and half a pint of half and half, two hours before that. When I fell down, four persons came up - the prisoner was one, but I cannot recognize the others. I am confident he was one; they lifted me up, and led me by the arms about three yards; the prisoner had my left arm, and another my right. One of the other two put his hand into my pockets, and turned them inside out. I could not hinder him, as they held both my arms; they took four sovereigns, and four or five shillings out, a pair of spectacles, and a silver medal belonging to my volunteer corps. I do not know that the fourth man touched me at all. I am sure the prisoner was not the fourth man. When they had robbed me, three sovereigns, a half, and some halfpence fell on the pavement; they all ran off except the prisoner; he pretended to come up as a friend, and assisted me into the house, and then asked for some cold water to wipe my face; my wife gave him some warm water out of the kettle; he washed the mud off my face. I saw three sovereigns laying on the table - my wife put them there; they were three of those I was robbed of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you lived at this house - A. Nearly thirty years. I dare say the prisoner knew me very well; I did not know him before. I was neither drunk nor sober. I did not apply for drink at the watch-house - I might ask for beer, for I was knocked all to pieces by the dreadful fall I had, and a blow which one of them gave me. The man who robbed me had a white rough coat on - there was nothing to prevent the prisoner's running away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say,</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I heard his voice, and went to the door. I found him close to the door, with four men round him; one had old of each arm, another was in front, and another behind. There was one with a white coat, whom I pushed with my hands, and made the money fall out of his hands on the pavement; he ran across the street, with the medal in his hand - I pursued him. When I got up to him, he knocked me down, and ran off, and dropped the medal - the watchman picked it up, and gave it to me; the other two men ran off. The prisoner remained, and still had hold of my husband's arm. I came back, and picked up three sovereigns. a half crown, and some halfpence, close to the door. The prisoner wished my husband to go into the house; he said he could go in without his assistance, but the prisoner forced him in, and sat him down in a chair, and asked me for some cold water. I had gone in before the prisoner, and laid the three sovereigns down on the table. My son came down stairs naked, hearing his father call, but went out of the room directly, to dress himself. I saw the sovereigns on the table after he left the room. The prisoner washed my husband's face. I turned round to get him a towel, and on turning again, I missed a sovereign off the table - they were there when I put the bason down. I said I missed the sovereigns; he seemed agitated, and said he would show me what money he had, and produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190022"/>three half crowns, and a sovereign. I said the sovereign belonged to me, and he had better deliver it up and go about his business - he refused. I heard him call my husband Mr. Bois. I never saw him before. There was nobody else in the room when the sovereign was missed - we gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not your son been in and out of the room - A. No, my son saw me pick the sovereigns up, and put them on the table, and left the place immediately; he did not come in again till it was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there not been a debate, whether there was not a farthing on the table instead of a third sovereign - A. No, I said nothing about a farthing; my son gave me one after I picked the sovereigns up.</p>

            , JUN. I looked out of window, and saw my father laying in the kennel - I ran down stairs naked, and helped him up. The prisoner was there then, and the other man was gone. My father had complained of weak legs - he had been drinking, but was not so intoxicated as not to know what he was about. I and the prisoner put him up against the door, and took him into the house. I saw my mother lay down three sovereigns, half a crown, and some halfpence, but do not know how many. I picked up a farthing afterwards in the street - I thought it was a sovereign till she brought out a light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not go into the parlour to assist your father - A. I went into the house - the prisoner was wiping my father's face; my mother asked how many soveriegns I saw her put down - I said three, and if one was missing it must be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go in to assist your father - A. The prisoner would force himself in - my father kept saying he did not want him, and I was looking for the other sovereign. I live next door to my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your father's house unknown to him sometime ago - A. No. I do not know Valentine. My father never charged me with stealing any truck wheels; I had lent a pair to one Viner. I never ran away. My father was told that Valentine had stolen them. I did not keep out of the way while he was examined.</p>

            . I live in Middlesex-street, near the prosecutor's. About a quarter past twelve o'clock on the night of the robbery, I saw him laying on the stones near his own door - he was intoxicated; only I and his wife were near him. I called the watch; two watchmen came up from about two hundred yards off; one of them had found the medal. I and Bays's son picked him up - some silver, gold, and halfpence were found on the ground. There was nobody else near - I wished Bays good night, and told his wife she had better take him in doors - I went to my own door, and then the prisoner came up, and asked what was the matter; I said a neighbour of mine was knocked down - he asked if he had been robbed, I said, I thought he had lost nothing, for his wife had picked up the money, which had fallen out of his pocket. When I was with Bays, he said he had lost his medal, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then the first thing you saw was the prosecutor laying in the gutter, and his wife by him - A. Not in the gutter - he laid along the pavement; there was not a soulinear him. I went out upon hearing her call out</p>
               <p>"Stop the two men with white coats." I never saw the prisoner go up to him - the prisoner deals in glass. When he left me I went in doors, and he went up the street. I never spoke to the watchmen.</p>

I let him have them, and desired they might he entered in our return book, not considering them as sold - and a paper was delivered him with the seals, expressly stating they were upon approbation for his brother to choose one, and return the others. I gave him several chains, and several seals, he said he would return in an hour, and pay me for that which might be selected, and return the others.

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner between the Three Tuns, and the Bell, Aldgate, with a truss on his back. I looked after him to see where he was going - he crossed the road, I followed him, and when he got near Jewry-street, I stopped him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where are you going with that?" He said,</p>
               <p>"What is that to you." I said,</p>
               <p>"It is directed, where are you going to take it?" He said, he did not know, nor where he brought it from. I took him, he said he was a seafaring man, and knew a great many smugglers, and met them in Whitechapel; and they said they had some tea and coffee to get rid of, that he was waiting to take it, and that they gave him the truss. I found it contained calico, and the invoice in it led me to the prosecutor's.</p>

            . At Christmas last, I lived at Milton, in Barking, and was going to move to Barnet, and sent by the Woburn waggon, ten boxes, and a small cask of wine, on the 13th of January, and on Thursday morning, the 16th, I went to the Bull, public-house, at Whetstone, in consequence of what I had heard, and found one box missing it contained wearing apparel; they were numbered from No. 1, to 11. I missed No. 5 - Jarvis shewed me some pieces of things cut up at Whetstone, which I believe to be part of my goods. I got a warrant in consequence of this, and searched Mardell's house at Whetstone, and found eight of my neck handkerchiefs, with the marks at the corner cut off, and the corner rounded at the end, but not hemmed, and found other articles of mine there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did not you tell him, he might as well tell where he got them - A. No. We went there about a fortnight after the 16th of January.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Pancras. On Wednesday, the 29th of January, I went with a search warrant to Mardell's, with Mr. Brunton - he lodged on the first floor, and was at dinner with his wife. I found some fancy trimming, and in an unfurnished room below, which was locked up, I found eight handkerchiefs with the corners cut off. Mardell's wife gave me the key of the room; I found nothing else there. Mardell denied all knowledge of it, or how they got into his possession. I neither held out threat or promise - I said I thought he might save me a great deal of trouble if he would say where the rest of the property was; he still insisted he knew nothing of it - I asked him for the key of his stable, knowing he was an hostler; he said that was of no consequence. I said unless he gave it to me, I should break the door open, and search it - he then said he would go, and fetch the remaining part of the property; he left the room - I followed him very close; he unlocked the stable door, and went up a ladder into a loft, I followed. He got into a large corn bin, about three quarters full of corn, and handed me out a large bundle, consisting of some bombazeens, a plated cruet frame, and several articles of wearing apparel. I asked if that was all, he said, Yes - I searched myself, and found a smaller bundle. I took him into custody, and asked where he got the things; he made no reply then, but afterwards said he had them from Louse Jack, (meaning Baldock.) I then went and apprehended Challis, the hostler, and then to a cottage at Barnet, rented by

On the 25th January, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop together - no other customers were there; I was the only person serving. They bought some Irish and flannel, and a blanket which were to be put up for them. I knew Sullivan before, but not Dowling - she came to recommend Dowling, who bought the goods. They were half an hour in the shop; there were other goods on the counter. I missed nothing, but the officer came in in about twenty minutes, while I was putting away the blankets, which I had shewn them. I accompanied him to the office without looking if anything was gone, and found the prisoners there in custody. I saw the articles there in a basket. I found three hearth rugs in one basket, and some flannel in the other - they were my master's property. I returned to the shop, and missed them; they had laid at the side of the shop, about two yards from the counter, against the wainscoat. Dowling sat on a stool close to the counter, and Sullivan stood at her side, and each had a basket - Dowling had a cloak on, and I think Sullivan a coat. I went behind a partition at the back of the shop for ten minutes, for the blankets, and I could not then see into the front.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 25th of January, I was on duty at Charing-cross; with Ball, and saw the two prisoners coming towards the Horse Gaurds, in a direction from Cockspur-street. As we passed them Dowling slipped down by accident, and I saw this roll of flannel under her cloak, with the shop ticket on it - Sullivan lifted her up; they walked on about twenty yards together, and Dowling staggered in the road - Ball caught hold of her arm, and brought her on the pavement - Sullivan had then left Dowling, and was crossing the road; I fetched her back to where Dowling stood, and as I took the flannel from under Dowling's arm, two had shillings fell out of her hand, as she was trying to snatch the ticket off the flannel - she shut her hand again; I forced it open, and took three bad shillings from it, tied in a piece of rag. I gave her to Ball, and took Sullivan into custody; I found two hearth rugs, and a bill of the prosecutor's, and 20 s. in silver in her basket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Sullivan had the basket - A. Yes. Ball took another basket from Dowling.</p>

On the morning of the 5th of February, at a quarter past ten o'clock, I was on the drawing-room stairs, and heard somebody in the passage; I looked back, and saw the prisoner. The door had been shut - I cannot swear that the latch had caught. I had seen the outer door not a moment before, but did not examine it. The persons coming into Mr. Grisewood's office, came through there; Mr. Grisewood pays the taxes, and keeps an office in the house. I saw the prisoner go into the office, and take down a great coat, and put it in his basket; I came down to him, and he asked if I wanted to buy any pens - I said No, but he had a great coat in his basket; he denied it. I went outside, shut the door, and called the hostler, who took him; he had thrown the coat up on the nail again. I am sure I saw him take it off the nail, and put it into his basket.</p>

On the 30th of February, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner standing by the door, and go away in about a minute; I went out and missed nothing, but saw this waistcoat hanging in its place. He came to the door again in about half an hour, looked in, and went away - he came again in less than a minute; I was in the other shop; I saw his arms move, as if he was reaching in at the door, he then went away. I went to the door, and missed the waistcoat, which was about a quarter of a yard within the door; I followed and brought him back, felt in his breast, but could not find it. I sent for an officer, who searched him at the bottom of the shop - he asked for a light, and as I turned round to reach one, I saw the prisoner putting on his hat, and the waistcoat on the floor about a yard from him, and five yards from where it had hung - he denied throwing it down.</p>

On Friday morning, the 17th of January, about eleven o'clock, when Mrs. Flint came from Wandsworth, in consequence of information, I called all the servants together. Mrs. Flint asked the shopwomen for the keys of their boxes, and I asked the shopmen and porter for theirs, and said that two Cypress dresses, and a length of plaid sarsnett were missing, and they must all be searched; the prisoner gave me four keys, saying, that three of them were of no use, and that the other belonged to his locked-up box, and said,</p>
               <p>"In searching my box, take care of my money;" the place he slept in was parted off from the shop by two doors, which I lock up every night, and until I open them in the morning nobody can get into the shop; there is a large sky-light at the back of the shop, which opens, and a person can easily get into the shop that way from where the prisoner slept. Mr. Dumeford and I went to the prisoner's room first; I looked in and saw his room in great confusion; his bed-clothes all turned about, and several boxes. I said, it would take us a long while, and we would go to the young men's room first. I locked the door with a key which had been in my possession ever since his brother left; he was in the shop when I locked the door, but could not see me do it - he had no key himself. I went and searched eight or nine of the young men's boxes, which were in a room at a great distance from the prisoner's, and was an hour and a half about it. I then returned to the prisoner's room, and found it forced open; a piece was forced off the door-post, the lock was wrenched from its place, and there was fresh blood on the door-post; we sent for a constable - the prisoner at that time was gone out with a parcel; we took his locked-up box marked (T. C.) into the drawing-room, came down and examined the room, and between the bed and sacking, I found a pair of new worsted stockings. I found a phosphorus box, and two pair of ladies' gloves in a little box on the shelf; also a new silk handkerchief, and two pair of ladies' gloves on the shelf, with three or four handkerchiefs which were not new. I then went to the box in the drawing-room, and found the hasp of the lock completely forced off, and immediately it was opened, I found a clean neckcloth with a mark of fresh blood on it, four fans which had never been sold, and two new black silk handkerchiefs. The prisoner had just come in as I opened the box - I fetched him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Thomas, here is the constable to search your box, but before we do that, if you are the person I suspect of breaking open the door, you have a wound on your hand;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Broke open the door, my door was never locked." I said,</p>
               <p>"Let me look at your hand;" he gave me his left hand - I asked to see the other; he then gave me the right, and there was a cut across the knuckle of the first finger, which was bleeding then; he said he did it in opening the shutters that morning - this was half-past two o'clock - we open at half-past seven; he then saw us search his box, and find the property; he said,</p>
               <p>"These fans I took out of the warehouse, and meant to have spoken to Mr. Dumeford about them," and that he bought all the other things in Whitechapel. I asked where there, but he could not tell; he said, he knew nothing about the ladies' gloves. There being no money in the box, I asked where it was; he said, he had none. I said, he had desired me to take care of the money; he said,</p>
               <p>"My clothes are my money, I have no opportunity of saving money in this service;" the constable searched him, and found five sovereigns and fifteen shillings in his left-hand pocket, and twenty-seven shillings in the other, which he had received of a customer. I sent him to the watch-house, and in the evening went with Mr. Flint to him. Mr. Flint asked if he knew anything of his brother; he said,</p>
               <p>"I have not seen my brother for this month," and that, he did not know where he or his sister lived, but that his mother lived in some court which he mentioned. I asked if he had not a relation who lived at No. 33, 63, or 23, Curtain-road; he said he had no relation in Curtain-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You are not concerned in the business - A. Not at all. Mr. Flint has no partner. The prisoner sat within five yards of the door, when I locked it; he was sent out about one o'clock. We have about eighteen persons employed in the shop; I can swear to the fans; he could have had the other things from his master at the wholesale price; it is not likely he would have given the retail price to another person.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can people in the shop see his bed room door - A. No. They must open a door on the fourth stair, to see his room; he asked what I was going to search for, I told him the Cypress dresses.</p>

             and Co's. of Exeter. On the 5th of December, I enclosed the notes stated in the indictment, in a parcel for the Exeter subscription coach, of which Baker was the guard, and had carried parcels for us for many years, containing money to a large amount; he received 6 s. 8 d. a parcel, for himself, besides the carriage - he knew that it contained money; we had no regular time to send them, he was always to carry them sown up in his pocket, and to deliver it to Messrs. Hankey, or their resident clerk, I sealed the inside cover and directed it to Messrs. Hankey's, No. 7, Fenchurch-street, and the outside one, to the guard of the Exeter subscription coach, and sowed it up in his left hand outside coat pocket; his coat was on at the time. I have since seen five of the 5 l. country notes, at the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The parcel in question, I believe was to have been sent by the five o'clock coach, but the guard who went that time, being a stranger, you sent it by Baker - A. Yes. I took the numbers of the country notes. His coach left Exeter, at six o'clock in the evening. I sewed the parcel in his coat, about twenty-five minutes before six o'clock; I saw him the next time he came to Exeter, which was on the following Monday; we had not sent a parcel by him, for more than four months before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where, were the five notes you saw at the Mansion-house, made payable - A. At Messrs. Hanbury's. We sent parcels much oftener by the morning coaches, than by Baker, as he was evening guard, (looking at a parcel,) this represents the size and appearance of it, and is about the same weight.</p>

             and Co's. banking-house, and know Baker perfectly well. On Friday night, the 6th of December, about half past ten o'clock, he came to the banking-house, and said, he had bad news to communicate to me, that he had lost the parcel, I said how could that be; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190031"/>he found it cumbersome, and took it out of his pocket, and put it in the coach seat. I detained him until eleven o'clock, when Mr. Hankey came home, he was then suffered to go, upon promising to come next morning, which he punctually did. Nothing was said to him in my hearing, he was permitted to go away. He seldom brought parcels from the Exeter bank, but when he did, they were always sown up in his pocket, and which is the way all the guards bring them, and we unstitch them at the banking-house - I never recollect a guard bringing a parcel in any other way, but once.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long had you been in the habit of receiving parcels from Exeter - A. I have been there five or six years, and generally receive them myself. He said, he had lost it at the White Horse-cellar he believed, and accounted for his calling so late, by saying he had been after two female passengers; he usually came between seven and eight o'clock - he said he missed it first at the Bull and Mouth, but had seen it safe at the White Horse-cellar, and had returned there, and told them he had lost it. That he took the address of the female passengers, which he gave me, they were Holman and Masters. We had received no advice of the notes, or we could have stopped them - he gave me all the information in his power, and was permitted to go on his journey on Saturday night.</p>

            . I came from Exeter by the subscription coach - we left about six o'clock in the evening, on the 5th of December. Baker was guard - we stopped at the White Horse-cellar next evening, about six o'clock, (after dark), Baker appeared then to have a white coat on, the same as when we left Exeter. At the White Horse-cellar, Mr. Barnett came and looked over all the parcels on each side of the coach - I did not observe him take any out. I told him there was one he had not seen, he then looked at it, but did not take it out; it appeared to be a white parcel, like the one produced. I did not see Baker at this time. Barnett shut the door after him, there was a woman in the coach with me. Soon after Barnett left, Baker came into the coach on the same side as Barnett with a lantern, and looked at the parcels in the seat - and while he was looking, I heard a voice on the other side of the coach, the window was down, but the door shut - Baker only looked into the front sent where the white parcel was. I could not distinguish what the voice said, but Baker said something, which I supposed to be answering the voice, and almost immediately left the coach. I did not observe him take it away - he shut the door, and after that, I heard a voice on the road side, saying,</p>
               <p>"Hand me that parcel," I turned round to the woman in the coach, and said,</p>
               <p>"That parcel is wanted." I lifted up the seat, and gave the white parcel to the man who spoke.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to give that parcel - A. It was the first I laid my hand upon, and thought of course if it was not right, he would have returned it. I had not seen it before Barnett came. I did not see the face of the man I gave it to, so as to know him again - we drove to the Bull and Mouth, and soon after arriving there, Baker asked me if any one had come into the coach to look for parcels - I said,</p>
               <p>"No one has been in the coach, but the person you was speaking to asked me for that parcel, and I gave it to him," he made no answer, but turned round, and said to the people who stood near,</p>
               <p>"I must go back to Piccadilly." I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"It is that fellow Bob there;" I saw no more of him. The other woman went to the Bull and Mouth with me - I got out first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Baker applied to you for your address - A. Yes. There was no other passenger but the woman and her child. I believe Barnett keeps the booking office at the White Horse-cellar. I believe there were outside passengers.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told Barnett that one parcel had escaped his attention, did he not say,</p>
               <p>"Oh, that is the guard's parcel" - A. He might have said so, but I have no recollection of anything of the kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the guard came to look, I suppose you moved to let him open the seat - A. No; he only looked at the front side - he might have taken anything away without my seeing it. Barnett looked at both sides. The woman came outside part of the way; but being very wet, she came in in the morning.</p>

            . I was a passenger by the Exeter coach. I got inside about seven o'clock in the morning, as it rained hard - we got to the White Horse-cellar about seven o'clock in the evening. A gentleman came with a lantern, and searched both sides of the coach, but took no parcel out. Baker came soon after, and looked in at the coach seat, but took nothing out. I forget whether he had a light; I did not hear any voice - I had a child. Mrs. Holman and I sat on the same side, with our backs to the horses - we stopped on the left hand side of the road; Mrs. Holman was next to the road, and I next the pavement. After Baker went away, a man came and asked for the parcel, it was a man of Thomas's appearance, but I am not certain of him - he opened the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Will you have the goodness to give me that white parcel;" Mrs. Holman rose, and lifted up the side where I was sitting (I had moved my seat after Barnett came) and gave him out the white parcel, which was like the one produced; we then went on to the Bull and Mouth. Baker asked for the parcel, and said he did not know what he should do - he must go back to the White Horse-cellar about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He took your address, I believe - A. Yes; Mrs. Holman told Barnett there was a parcel he had not seen - he returned and looked at it - he said nothing about it being the guard's; he merely touched it, but did not take it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What time did you come to town - A. About seven o'clock; it was dark - the person who demanded the parcel, opened the door on the right side.</p>

            . On the 6th December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I and my brother Phillip were going up Holborn, to Mr. Hemmings, a hardwareman, of Broad-street, St. Giles; with some Waterloo crackers, which we make - and in our way, saw the prisoner Thomas in company with three others, at the Bell and Crown, Holborn; about the inn gateway. I had seen him before, and stopped to notice him - we went and stood at Furnival's Inn-gate; I saw Thomas and his companions talking together, and whipping about the inn. The old Salisbury coach came out, and drove<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190032"/>towards Oxford-road - one of the three men had a great coat over his arm; they all ran with Thomas to the first coach-stand, beyond Middle-row - and there he and two others got into the first chariot. I saw no more of the fourth man. We followed the chariot up Holborn, down Little and Great Queen-street, Lisle-street, and in Piccadilly it stopped; at the corner of Arlington-street, all three got out; two of them ran round the hind part of the coach, and just as they got out, the old Salisbury coach came up - we had then got into the road to see who came out of the coach; Thomas was then on the pavement - the other two crossed over to the old Salisbury coach; we then went and stood by the Gloucester coffee-house door, one of the two men put on his great coat, and appeared as if he was going off by the coach; but seeing the old Salisbury coach full inside, they went to another coach which stood on the opposite side, on the Arlington-street, side, the horses heads being towards the City. They crossed behind the coach; we went round the horses heads, I walked by the coach door, and the two who were in great coats appeared to be assisting a lady out, and Thomas stood behind them, with his face towards the coach door. I then went by, and the guard stood against the hind-wheel with a light in his hand, looking over some boxes; I do not know who the guard was. I then crossed the way to the corner of Berkley-street, and stood looking over a post, and saw Thomas come round the hind part of the coach, and go up to the road-side of the coach, which was nearest to me. I did not see him doing any thing, but he came away stooping, with his hands on his knees, and appeared to be looking under the coach - he went up a second time towards the coach door, but I could not see what passed; he then came back holding his hands in front, and when he went to the corner, I saw he had something white, which appeared to me to be a parcel - the other two who had been at the door joined his company; I crossed the way, and went up Berkley-street; they passed close to me. I walked over to the coach, and saw Exeter on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What are you - A. A fire-work maker. Mr. Hemmings's son has a toy business, and I was going to him with the crackers - my brother had the crackers. I generally go with him to see what they fetch - we had done work, and I went with him; we trotted all the way to the White Horse-cellar. The old Salisbury coach went another road; we got to Piccadilly before it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you mention all this - A. Directly I saw the bill up in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Offering 500 l. reward - A. Yes. I thought there was something wrong, but I would not get myself into trouble till I was sure of it. I went to Mr. Brown, the City marshal, according to the direction on the bill, and he sent for Forrester - this was about a fortnight before Christmas. My brother said,</p>
               <p>"Let us go over, and ask the guard if he has lost anything;" I said we had better not get ourselves into trouble, because we were not rightly certain, and if anything was lost it would be advertised. I hardly knew whether to go and ask the guard or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever come into this Court, at the same door as the prisoners have - A. Yes, but my innocence was proved. I was told I should be asked about that, and offered money to keep away. I have been tried here twice, but it was when I was a boy, and might be among bad company. My innocence was proved both times.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear the guard was in custody - A. When I saw the bill. I knew nothing about Baker being committed till Martin told me he stood for trial on the following morning, which was the day after I gave the information - that is the first I heard of his being taken up, to the best of my knowledge - I will not swear it, as I might have heard it. I never read it in the newspaper. I was tried here about the year 1810; I cannot recollect the time, for I have been at work ever since, and do not wish to remember it - it was thirteen or fourteen years ago; I am thirty years old. I was only tried twice. The reward offered is 500 l. upon conviction and recovery of the property, and 200 l. upon conviction, whether it is recovered or not. I believe the guard to be innocent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You watched them from the first, and never saw the guard do anything - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you manage to keep up with the coach - A. We ran all the way. The horses were bad, or we could not have kept up with it. I had seen Thomas before in bad company, which was my reason for watching him.</p>

            . I am a fire-work maker. On the night of the 6th of December, I was in Holborn, with my brother, and saw four men - Thomas was one of them; I did not know them before, but I took particular notice of him. He walked up and down by the gateway, and kept looking up, and in about ten minutes, the old Salisbury coach drove out of the Bell and Crown; they all ran after it to the first coach stand by Middle-row, then Thomas and two of them got in. We followed the coach down Little and Great Queen-street, Long-acre, and Lisle-street - it stopped on the left hand of Piccadilly; they got out. The Salisbury coach came up, and two of them ran up, leaving Thomas on the pavement - one of them took hold of the dickey of the Salisbury coach, and gave a swing; they then went on the pavement, and one put on his coat; they stood at the coffee-house door. Thomas was on the other side of the way. The two then crossed the road to the pavement, by the Exeter coach, (I cannot read, but my brother read the name;) they went round the back part of the coach; we crossed and went round the horses' heads. I stood by the hind horse, and my brother walked by them, as they stood at the coach door. I saw Thomas go round the hind part of the coach, and leave the coach door - the other two stood on the pavement at the coach door. Thomas came away in about a minute, with his hands before him, and the other two men one on each side of him, looking at his bosom. I was behind and could not see what they were looking at. They went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Where were you going - A. To take some Waterloo crackers to Mr. Hemmings. I had them tied in a handkerchief. I asked my brother to go with me - he had half the profits; he generally goes with me. I did not see them do anything to the Salisbury coach. I mentioned this matter at the wine vaults in Fleet-market; they told me the guard was taken up, and I ought to mention it - I went to my brother directly, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't give information, I will;" I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190033"/>told him the guard was taken up. He said he would go and let them know of it. I heard of the reward along while afterwards. I do not know when my brother gave information.</p>

            . I am a freeman and porter of the City. On Saturday morning, the 7th of December, about ten o'clock, I was at my stand in Angel-court, Throgmorton-street. The prisoner Thomas came and gave me five 5 l. notes, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go to Lloyd's, and get me sovereigns for these" - Messrs. Jones and Lloyd, live in Lothbury, but as I was going along, I observed that he was mistaken, and that they were payable at Messrs. Hanbury and Lloyd's, of Lombard-street; I went there, received sovereigns for them, and brought them to him. I had asked where he would be, he said,</p>
               <p>"Up in these chambers," pointing to the first door in Angel-court - but on returning I met him at the end of the court; I think I walked on to the door, and gave him the sovereigns in the door way - he then took out six more 5 l. notes, and said,</p>
               <p>"You may as well go and get me these done," they were payable at Messrs. Hoares and Barnett's, and were Tavistock Bank notes - I got sovereigns for them. He met me about half way down Angel-court, where I delivered them to him - he put them into his pocket, without counting them, and gave me 2 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You have not always expressed yourself so certain of his person - A. I did not swear to him at the Mansion House; I swore that I believed he was the man - I felt as confident of him as I do now. When I was shewn into the room at the Mansion House, I said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who employed me." I am not a ticket porter - I was one for three years, one of my bondsman died - I provided another, who was not accepted. I have a badge; it is merely my name, and stating that I am a freeman; I produce it. I thought this a singular circumstance when I saw him put the money into his pocket without counting it. I then thought he might be a servant who had robbed his master, and went and gave information at the banking-houses, as soon as I saw it in the papers, which was on the Tuesday or Wednesday. I never had the least doubt of his being the man.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoners going from Shore-place. Mance had the bag on his shoulder. I could not see their faces, but from their appearance, they are the men. I saw them both run into some unfinished building, and found Pallisier between the joists, under the flooring; he begged to be let go, saying, he had had nothing to eat all day, and it was the first time he had done any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>"I have dropped my shoe," and at that moment, I saw him drop something at his right side. I took him to the watch-house, and shewed Rushton where he dropped the thing.</p>

On the 28th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw Stone going down from the County Fire Office into Piccadilly; he called a coach off the stand, and followed it down to the corner of Queen-street; he there opened the door and jumped in, and I saw Davis throw a bundle out of his arms into the coach - he then got in. I called Bidgood to assist me. I got in, took the bundle and them - it was linen. I asked them where they got it, they said, they picked it up at a gentleman's door in Marylebone-street.</p>

While he was there, I frequently missed property; after he left, he was succeeded by his brother Thomas, and about the 18th of January, in consequence of what passed about his brother, I went with Turnpenny and Bestow, to No. 63, Curtain-road, Turnpenny went in there - and after he returned to me, I went with him to the same house, and saw the prisoner there; I told him they had got his brother in custody, and to clear his character, if he was an honest man, he could have no objection to my searching his premises - he said he had none. I searched in the parlour and bedroom which he said were his - he said, he had no other rooms. I found a great deal of property in the rooms; different kinds of silk goods and lace, cottons, Irish, and other things which I deal in, and were mine. Some of them had my mark on them, and those which were not marked, I knew to have been part of my stock. There was a particular shawl found in his sitting-room, with no mark on it, but which I well knew; it cost me 2 l. 2 s. (his rooms were on the first floor). I found three yards of lace, and a piece of figured sarsnet, measuring twelve yards and three quarters, which I also knew, it was worth about 4 l. Turnpenny tried the bedroom door and found it locked - he said</p>
               <p>"Richard, we must have the key of the bed-room" - he said it was lost, that the child had lost it, and he could not find it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Richard, if you are an honest man, you will not object to my searching;" he gave me a chisel, with which I opened it - (I think there was a child in the bedroom) there were several boxes in the bed-room, one of them locked, and several made-up dresses in the drawers; he was asked for the key of the locked box, he said, that was lost, but I believe it was afterwards produced. I was much agitated at the time; he objected to our opening the box, saying it belonged to his sister, and not to himself. On opening it, I found twelve yards and three quarters of sarsnet, and many other articles - and 92 l. in gold - I asked how he came by the money, I think he said his mother had two farms in Ireland, which she had sold, and that was the produce; I particularly well recollect the shawl being missed; we took stock on the 31st July, and some day in the first week in August it was missing.</p>

Certainly not; it is a rule with me not to suffer any servant to have goods without their being entered in the book - his brother could not have stolen the shawl, sarsnet, or lace, as he was not in my service at the time. I found fifty yards of linen at his house - he said he bought that of a Jew.</p>

            . I searched the premises with Mr. Flint. I am a silk manufacturer, and live in Wood-street. I saw Turnpenny go into the house, he afterwards came out, and I think I saw a woman and boy come out at the door at the same time, looking after Turnpenny. Soon after Mr. Flint, Turnpenny, and I, returned and saw the prisoner; we went to the first floor where search was made; I stood at the door to prevent any one going out - Mr. Flint told Clark his brother was taken for robbing him, but he believed he was an honest man, and he wished to know his brother's connections; he said, he was sorry for it - Mr. Flint asked when he saw him - he said, on Sunday. A great many things were found in the front room. On opening the drawers, Mr. Flint asked whose these goods were, he said, they were his sister's, who was a milliner. I noticed Mr. Flint's marks on some cotton balls, and on a fan. A shawl was found in the drawers, Mr. Flint said,</p>
               <p>"This is I believe my property" - the prisoner said he could not tell, his sister might buy it at the shop. Mr. Flint said, he had no doubt of it being his, for it was missed immediately after taking stock. In the drawers we found a great deal of property, and a great deal of lace on dresses partly made up, which Mr. Flint knew. The officer asked for the key of the other room, Clark's mother said in his hearing, that it was lost - we got into the room, there was only one bed there, and a child on it; there were several boxes containing different goods, one was locked - the officer said, the key must be found, or it must be broken open; he found it at last; some Irish linen, several pieces of lace, and ninety-two sovereigns were found in it; he said, he had saved part of the money, and the rest was the produce of some land in Ireland, which his mother had sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Mr. Flint's mark - A. I do. The name of Clark was on the door, and I think,</p>
               <p>"dress-maker," and something else; The prisoner brought the things away himself, by Mr. Flint's desire, to Fish-street-hill.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Flint and the the last witness to the Curtain-road, on the 18th of January, I went first to the house alone - I saw a little girl, who called Miss Clark, and the prisoner came down; I asked him if Miss Clark was at home, he said, No. I asked if he lived there, he said, he did - I said, in what part of the house; he said, the first floor. I said, by way of excuse, that I wanted one Clark, a little man, who used to live at Westminster; he said,</p>
               <p>"I am not a little man - I have a brother about my size;" I wished him good evening. Mr. Flint, and the other gentleman with him was standing up the street - I went and told him what had passed, we returned to the house - I went up stairs. The prisoner sat by the fire, and got up - I made search - and found a great deal of property, which Mr. Flint claimed. I asked for the key of the bed-room, and was told by somebody that it was lost. I went to the door, opened it, and found a child in bed, there were several boxes there; we found things which Mr. Flint claimed - there was a large box locked; I asked for the key, somebody said it could not be found; I said, I should break it open, and I believe the prisoner immediately fetched a hammer and a chisel; Mr. Flint opened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190036"/>it; several things were found, and 92 l. in sovereigns in a bag, in a tin box; he said, he had sold some land in Ireland for it, and it was his property. I did not hear his mother's name mentioned; I put the things into a box, and took them to Mr. Flint's, to see if the shop-people would know them, and then took him to the Compter. I searched him in Mr. Flint's dining-room, and found six sovereigns, twenty shillings in silver, an ear-ring, a broach, a watch, three seals, and a key. I searched him again at the Compter, and found two new silk handkerchiefs loose in his pocket, a watch-ribbon, and a pair of gloves, all new. I have returned him 20 l. of the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His sister carried on business there as a dress-maker - A. Her name was on a brass-plate upon the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whom did the child belong to - A. He said it was his sister's. It was not said in what part of the house his mother and sister lived - he said the first floor belonged to him; there was a turn-up bedstead in the sitting room, and a bed in the other. All the property was on the first floor.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Flint's employment in July, August, and September, last year. I remember a particular shawl being missed in the early part of August; enquiry was made about it by the young people, and Mr. Flint knew it - I cannot say whether the porter knew it was lost; (looking at one,) this is it - I am positive of it, and the shop mark is on most of the other property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Does Mr. Flint sell goods with his mark on them - A. Not this description of goods; trifling things are sold with the mark. I know this shawl as well as I should know my own apparel, and can say with confidence that it is the very shawl which was lost. I was called into the shop twice to see shawls of a similar pattern, but which I could tell was not the one. We never had but one of this kind in the shop - I should know it if I accidently saw it upon a person's back.</p>

            . I have lived four years with Mr. Flint. I assisted in taking stock in July. I know this shawl - we had but one of the pattern; it was missed a few days after taking stock; it was known through the shop. I firmly believe it to be the same, by the pattern and general appearance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. If you had seen it among six of the same pattern, could you have picked it out - A. I think I could - it had been in the shop some months. (The witness looked at the rest of the property, most of which he identified.)</p>
               <p>MR. FLINT. I can swear to most of the property. The shawl, scarf, and twelve yards and three quarters of sarsnet, were all missed before the prisoner left.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY contended that the counsel for the prosecution was bound to elect upon which article he should proceed; it being evident they were stolen at different times. The Court concurred on the objection, and Mr. Adolphus elected to proceed upon the shawl.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the pit door. There was a cry, and I stopped the prisoner; the prosecutor charged him stealing his watch, and gave charge of him. As I took him across Great Russell-street, he slipped from me, and ran under the coaches, down different streets, to the Olympic theatre, where he was taken. I lost sight of him for three minutes, but have no doubt of him. On the Thursday afterwards, the watch was brought to me by a person belonging to the theatre.</p>

On the 31st of January, I sent him with a cheque upon Messrs. Cox, Biddulph and Co, for 208l. 6s. 8d., (looks at a check,) this is it. He was gone an hour and a half, or two hours, he had to call at the stamp-office for some stamps; when he returned, he said he had lost 205l. of the money, that he had put in his trowsers pocket, leaving the 3l. in his waistcoat pocket. I asked why he had put it there, he said, he put it all into his waistcoat pocket, but at the stamp-office, he took the 205l. out of his pocket and put it into his trowsers pocket, that he had a hole in his trowsers pocket, which was the reason he did not put the change there, that he had gone to the bankers. and got the number of the notes, which he gave me. On the Monday, I had some conversation with him about it, he was very impudent, and said his character and mine were on a par. He was discharged, and a week after (which was Monday the 10th.) I received information from the Bank.</p>

             re-examined. In consequence of information, I went to Liverpool - I got in on Tuesday night, the 11th inst. and early on Wednesday morning, I applied to the police, and the prisoner was taken in three quarters of an hour; he denied taking the property, and said it was his own money he had laid out, that he had only saved two hundred Spanish dollars - we found five hundred dollars at his lodgings there. On shewing them to him, I asked if he knew Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Reynolds; he said, he found I knew more than he suspected, and was willing to confess that he took the money, and gave the 200l. note to Mr. Reynolds. He bore a good character before this.</p>

On Tuesday, the 4th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came to our shop - it was dark; another young man served them; they wanted some prints to the pattern of the gowns they wore; he shewed them a great many - none would suit. They then asked to see some stuffs - the counter was much loaded with the goods they had seen. They then brought three quarters of a yard of Persian, which came to 1s. 6d., and asked to see some shawls. I began to suspect them - they were shewn some, and fixed on a red one, the price was <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190038"/>10 s. 6 d. - they offered 6 s. for it, but we refused. Conner pressed us very much to take 6 s., saying, she had no more money. While dealing for the shawl, I saw Willmott take one off the counter, and put it under her gown. I informed Mr. Graham. Conner wanted to leave 1 s. deposit on the red shawl; we took it to try them. She gave 2 s. 6 d., being 1 s. 6 d. for the Persian, and 1 s. for the shawl; they then went towards the door - I stopped them. Mr. Graham took Willmott into the counting-house, and found the shawl on her; they said it was the first time, and did not appear to be concerned.</p>

I went to him there at eleven o'clock, and received information, and took the prisoners in bed together, in Church-street, St. Giles's. I said I wanted them for felony. I found in the room, a shawl, three odd braces, fifty cards, and a skeleton key. There was a crow-bar in the prosecutor's room, the door of which was broken open, and the hasp forced off - part of the door was cut away with a knife, and then wrenched.

            . I am a patrol, of Aldgate. On Monday morning, the 2d of February, about half-past four o'clock, I saw the prisoners in company in Butcher-row, East Smithfield - Witney was with me. I stopped Mason, who had a bundle, and asked what he had there - he said, a jacket and waistcoat. I asked if any thing else was in it - he said, Yes; a gown. I found no jacket<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190040"/>or waistcoat in it, but a shawl, a cloak, and a handkerchief. Keppie ran off, but I took him three hours after in Nightingale-lane, and found the watch and handkerchief on him. Thompson came and claimed the things about six o'clock.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Alderman Thompson. Maxwell has a warehouse opposite my parlour window. On Sunday last, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner go into the warehouse,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190042"/>and move some empty bottles, which stood at the door; he then took two bottles and went into the warehouse, and in about twenty minutes, he went out with one of them, a basket will hold six dozen - he brought out another soon after and fastened the door up as before. I threw up the window and heard two voices, and saw a man assisting him out of the gateway with them; I went round and was up to them in a moment, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where are you going with those; bottles" the other man said, he knew nothing about it, and that he only helped him out with them; I told the prisoner I must detain him, he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! No, look over this, it is nothing, I am in your hands." I took him to the watch-house, and then made the other man assist me, in taking the bottles back to the premises. He seemed rather fresh with liquor, and said he had been to an Irish raffle - he fell on his knees, and begged me to look over it, and said, he was going to make a few shillings of them, he would not tell me where he was going to take them.</p>

I went down to fetch some water, and on returning, I found the street-door partly open - I had pushed it too. I saw footsteps on the ground in the office. I stopped a moment at the end of the stairs, and saw the prisoner and another man come out with coats under their arms. I had noticed them before, two doors off; the prisoner went out first, and the other followed, and pulled the door rather too. I called out, and saw them cross the road into Lincoln's Inn.

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On Sunday, the 19th of January, about ten o'clock at night, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner Cherry's house, at No. 8, Almonry, Westminster - she was in the front parlour; I asked if she had not got some one concealed in the back parlour; she said No, there was no one - she took the candle up, and went into the back parlour with us; we saw nobody there, but I saw a cupboard with a padlock on it, and asked what she had got there - she said there was nobody there, nor anything belonging to any one. She immediately blew the candle out, and went into the front parlour. I said I insisted upon seeing what was in it, the candle was lighted, and she unlocked it, pulled a bag out, and tried to conceal it in front of her. I caught hold of it, and asked if she knew what it contained; she made no answer - I opened it, and found a silver tea spoon, a knife with a silver handle, and other articles of plate. After that she said it belonged to a man who was up stairs. I went up and found Kinder laying on a bed with his coat off, and two women in the room, (there were two men down stairs.) I asked Kinder if he had got anything below; he made no answer, but said afterwards that what was there was his own. He gave me his name, but refused to say where he lived, and said it was hard to detain him as it was his own property. I took them to Bow-street, and found a bill of parcels in the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She tried to conceal the bag - A. She put it between her knees. There was nothing else in the cupboard but old rags.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Snowsell. There was a bed in the back parlour, and only one person could get between it and the cupboard. Cherry went to the cupboard, dragged the bag out, and put it between her legs; it was concealed under some old rags. Cherry had put the candle out.</p>

On the 15th of January, Kinder brought some plate, and took some back - I believe I myself delivered him the knife, but I am not certain.

               <p>KINDER'S Defence. My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury, however imprudently I may have acted, I feel concious of no intention to defraud my employers - I have indeed been guilty of great excesses, but is it possible to suppose I should let the plate remain in the bag till Sunday. The woman was ignorant of my conduct.</p>
               <p>CHERRY'S Defence. I gave him the key to look into the cupboard, and did not conceal the bag, but gave it him out of the cupboard, and said I did not know what it contained. The prisoner gave it me to take care of, and I gave him the key to lock it up himself. I gave the officer two candles, and insisted on his looking all over the house.</p>

            . I live in Long-lane, Southwark. Sinfield was convicted at Horsemonger-lane, of stealing these skins; and in consequence of what he told me, I went to the prisoner's house, Middlesex-street, Whitechapel, on the 3d of September, with an officer, and Anthony my man - we found him at home. I told him I had been robbed, and was informed he had part of the property, which I described; he keeps a furrier's shop, and deals in hats. I had lost them on the 29th of August; he appeared confused, and said, he had bought no skins of any description for three weeks, and knew nothing at all of them. I said, we must search the premises - he immediately pulled about twenty skins of various sorts, principally cat and fitch, and said,</p>
               <p>"If any of these are your's, you may see them." Anthony identified four Dutch cat-skins, three of which had his mark - two of them were in a finished, and in a saleable state - and the other two in a half manufactured state. I said, if he had those, he must have some others; he took a seal-skin from under the counter, and asked if that was mine, it was mine; I had given it out to my man to finish some time before - it was nearly finished, and cost me 12 s.; the finished cat-skins are worth 18 d., and the others 1 s. 3 d. each; they are part of those Sinfield was convicted of stealing - he was taken to Union-hall, and said, he bought them of a man named Hart for 10 s. 6 d.; they are worth 17 s. 6 d. Foreign skins are never hawked about, but bought of merchants. No respectable person would buy them in this state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were these skins produced on Sinfield's trial, and given in evidence - A. They were, the magistrate did not reject these - it was one others; I lost about 1 l. worth. I might not have seen these for a fortnight, before the 29th of August.</p>

            . I deal in clothes and hare-skins; the prisoner took me to Union-hall, and I was told to go about my business. I sold some skins very much like these to the prisoner. I was coming down the Minories, and a man asked if I would buy some; I said, I did not understand the value of them; he said he was a furrier, and if I would go with him to sell them, he would pay me for my trouble - I went with him, and when we got to the market, he said, he would give me 2 s. to sell them,</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the market - A. Petticoat-lane, he waited outside, while I went in and sold them to Phillips - he told me to ask 12 s. for them, but I asked 14 s. Phillips offered 9 s.; I at last took 10 s. 6 d., came out, and gave the owner the money, and he gave me 2 s.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago was this - A. About five or six months. I live in Phillip-street, Commercial-road; he did not ask where I got them, for he knew my face. I had sold him two or three hare-skins before - he called me Hart; I think he does not remember that he did. I have told him where I lodged once - I never spoke to him much - I did not hear of his being taken up till I was taken myself. I sold them to him above a month before I was taken I dare say. I only know him by dealing with him two or three times.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday, the 31st of January, I went to watch Mr. Adam's premises, in Union-street, Middlesex Hospital. I got there about five o'clock in the morning, and concealed myself in a door-way opposite. I saw a man whom I believe to be Campbell stand directly opposite; he went off into Rebecca-court, which is two doors off. I returned to my post, and saw

I had a pair of diamond ear-ring drops which were delivered to Miss Roe, at Mr. Pearman's, Gower-street; the price was 87 l., but they were rather too large for her. I agreed to make her a smaller pair, and she was to wear these, until I could make the others. The prisoner knew all this; he told me afterwards that he had seen her, and she liked them very well and would keep them till about Christmas, by that time, I was to make a smaller pair; he afterwards told me she would keep them, but towards Christmas, I received a letter from Mrs. Ross, the friend of Miss Roe, to wait on her; I told the prisoner the conversation I had with her. Miss Ross said,</p>
               <p>"Have you done the ear-rings," I said, I understood Miss Roe, liked the large ones, so much that she will keep them, she said,</p>
               <p>"I understand you have had them back sometime; I said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! No, that cannot be, and as a proof of it, I will bring you my clerk;" I took him to Mrs. Ross, he told her, that Miss Roe, had told him that she meant to keep the large ear-rings, having a friend who would buy them. I afterwards received a letter from Miss Roe, which I shewed the prisoner, he looked it over, and immediately said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to say, I have them, circumstances have obliged me to make away with them for 25 l.;" he shewed me a card with Mr. Dobrees name on it, saying that he should have some money in a few days, and would get them; he left, and I saw him in Hart-street, Covent-garden, on the 24th of December; he then said, he was very sorry, but he should have 300 l. or 400 l in a few days, and they should be forthcoming. I received a letter from him, on the 28th of December, and had him apprehended on the Sunday following, and after that received another letter from him. I never empowered him to receive the diamonds from Miss Roe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe in July you met me, and requested me to make up your books - A. Yes; he appeared distressed and I took him into my service; my circumstances became involved, in consequence of being robbed of 1600 l., and I desired him to make up my books. I agreed to give him 1 l. a week, till I could get him a better situation, I interested myself for him, and had got him one, at one hundred and thirty guineas a year, just as I discovered this robbery; I said to him repeatedly that it was odd, I did not hear about the ear-rings, and he always said,</p>
               <p>"She will keep them, or if she does not, she knowes a lady who will buy them."</p>
               <p>The following letters alluded to in the evidence were read, one dated,</p>
               <p>"Cheltenham, the 10th of December," from Miss Roe, expressing her surprise at hearing from Mrs. Ross, respecting her being possessed of the drops, and stating that she had returned them to the prosecutor's man, also the two following from the prisoner to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>"My good Sir, From the same principal which operates on the mind of any man, who may have transgressed on the rules of propriety, has rendered me heart broken. I hope in a few days to see a friend, who will be productive of a mutual adjustment of our differences. In the mean time, I hope you will excuse my attending upon you.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Dobree. I have a pair of diamond drops, which I received from the prisoner, on the 23d of October, as security for 25 l.; he redeemed some diamonds at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have I not frequently pawned diamonds with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was placed in a very critical situation by the prosecutors trusting the business to my care - he found my services useful to him in his embarrasments. He has frequently desired me to do the best I could to carry on the business in his absence, and I have pawned goods to pay the workmen on Saturdays, and when the ear-rings were pawned part of the money was appropriated to his use. There was an account between us, and if the ear-rings were brought into the account there would be little difference between us. There was no intention ultimately to injure him.</p>

On Saturday night I sent her to the watch-house for disorderly conduct, and getting tipsy; she wanted to take a bundle with her, but I refused to let her - it was detained in my parlour till the Tuesday following, locked up in the parlour; I kept the key in the drawing-room. The constable opened the room on Tuesday in my presence, and found the parcel, she had come to demand her clothes - she had made up the bundle on Saturday night. When my servant opened the door to her, she rushed on her, and began beating her. I ran down stairs, hearing the screams, and saw her beating her. I sent for an officer, who opened the bundle in the presence of the prisoner and myself, and found two napkins belonging to me in it; she then asked for her trunk, which was brought down. I said I would have that searched also - she ran away when she was asked for the key, one of the constables fetched her back, and threatened to break it open - she then gave up the key, and a silver fork was found in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BERNARD. Q. I believe you had her with a character - A. She referred me to a person, who did not satisfy me; but being ill, I took her for a week on trial. I went to the watch-house on Sunday to sign my name, two gentlemen went with me; neither of them called himself Mr. Rowley - she was discharged on bail. I had charged her with threatening to take my life; she had held me down on the stairs at half-past twelve o'clock at night, and pulled off all my clothes. I have four silver forks constantly in use, they were kept in the drawing-room cupboard; her box was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. When her trunk was opened, did not she look at you, and say,</p>
               <p>"Oh! you wicked woman" - A. She did several times, and I nearly fainted; she said it before the box was brought down. I do not know what she said when it was opened, for I was near fainting at the time the fork was found.</p>
               <p>Q. At what church were you married - A. I was married in a private house. I cannot say when, for I took no notice of the time; it was in the period of St. Mary's, Dublin.

The parcel laid in the corner of the parlour tied up at two corners, and the other two untied - she claimed three dusters and a napkin, which were in it; the trunk was brought down - I asked the prisoner for the key, which she refused two or three times; I said I should break it open; she then delivered it. I unlocked it, and Mrs. Rowley took out the fork.</p>

               <p>"I have stopped long enough," and ran to the door - I fetched her back, and saw the trunk opened, and the fork found; she made a second attempt to get to the door, but I had the key in my hand.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went before the magistrate on the Monday, did you say a word about the fork - A. No; I had not missed it. I suppose the watchman must have opened the bundle on Saturday, in pulling it from her, some things came out at the time. I pushed them in with my feet, and locked it up. She told the magistrate that I put the fork there, but positively I did not.</p>

Mrs. Rowley appeared rather agitated, when the prisoner said she put the fork there.</p>

I gave the door a push, and walked in - she screamed out - her mistress came down, and a constable was fetched. I was shewn into the parlour, where the bundle was. Mrs. Rowley requested the constable to turn me out of the room, which he did, and I could not see my things examined. I did not like to give up the key of my box, as I was not allowed to see my things, so I ran to the door to tell the neighbours. The moment the box was opened, Mrs. Rowley fell back, and pretended to go into a fit. I looked at her instead of the box. I turned round, saw the fork, and said,</p>

            . I live opposite the prosecutor's. On the evening of the 6th of February, I was at my parlour window, and saw the prisoner and another walking up and down the door. The prisoner went in and took up two or three bars of soap, and ran towards Baker-street - the other followed. I ran out, and saw them both returning without the soap; they passed the shop again two or three times, and the prisoner was going in again. I ran over and secured him. The soap was not found. I am sure of his person; there was a strong light in the shop - he said nothing.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went into the house about half-past two o'clock in the morning, and when we got to the foot of the stairs, we heard people running up stairs - we went to the first floor back room, and found the sashes with all the glass taken out. We found the prisoners in the atris - they said they came to sleep there. We searched them at the watch-house, and found a knife on Mitchell covered with putty, and both of them had putty stickings on their hands.</p>

I shewed him down stairs into the back kitchen - he looked at the cistern, and I went up to the door, as the bell rang again; I found a boy, who asked for some name which I did not know, and as I turned to go down again, I found him coming up; he went out - I went into the kitchen, and missed a time piece, which had hung up.

I gave him a bag of linen, which was made up ready for the carrier. I followed him, and found him in about ten minutes, in Fenchurch-street; and asked where he was going to take the linen - he said, to the cart; I was not satisfied, and he stopped Wickers, another carrier - who said, he was Larkin's son, who is our carrier; he threw the linen into Wicker's cart, and I went home. He is Larkin's son.</p>

            . I am a hackney-man. I was on the stand in Mark-lane, about three o'clock; Smith came up, and asked the fare to Westminster. I asked if there was any thing to carry - he said, a bundle; I said 4 s., and he told me to follow him; he overtook Larkin with a bundle, which was put into my coach; they got in with it, and just by Westminster-abbey, they told me to go to the public-house over by Dean's-yard, and have something to drink; they both got out, leaving the bundle in the coach. I went into the public-house with them, and had a pot of beer - Smith went out, Foster joined them, and soon after Smith returned, and paid me. Foster carried the bundle from the coach.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday afternoon, the 17th February, I went with Larkin's father to Bureau's house, in the Almonry - he and his wife sat there at tea. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the bundle of linen which was brought in this afternoon - he said,</p>
               <p>"There has been none brought in here at all;" both declared that none had been brought in. I said, a person saw it brought in - he said, I was welcome to look round the room. I asked where his bed-room was - he said, that was it; I said,</p>
               <p>"There is no bed here." I went to the back-room, on the ground-floor, where I knew that he slept; I pulled the curtains back, and saw linen strewed all over the bed; I called for a light, he muttered something, and seemed unwilling to give me one, my brother got par. Bureau said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Popls, I will tell you where it is." I said, I had found it; he followed me into the room, and the linen laid there - the woman went out of the house, I asked the man how he got it, he said, it was left there for him to purchase, and that he opened the bundle to uncertain the value. I sent him to the office, and afterwards apprehended his wife. Next day, I apprehended the other prisoners, and found the duplicate of two shirts upon Smith.</p>

I took him to the Coach and Horses, public-house to drink, and asked him to lend me the money to pay for the coach. I borrowed 5 s. of a young man, and being obliged to make up the money, I took the bundle to Bureau, and asked him to let me leave it for half an hour, then took out two shirts and pawned them to get the money for the coachman - intending to make them good the following week. I was going to fetch it, but hearing that Bureau was apprehended, I was afraid.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I have the same to say - he said, if I called him a coach, he would give me a ride to Westminster. I met him on Tuesday, and he gave me the duplicate of two shirts.</p>

I had entered the number of the notes in my memorandum book, the 100 l. was No. 19,834, dated the 11th of October, 1822; I stopped them at the Bank, and in about a month, I was sent for and found the 100 l. note.</p>

            . I am a clothes salesman, and live in Whitechapel, and know the prisoner. On the 20th of November, about nine o'clock at night, he and a girl who I never saw before, came to my house; he pulled an 100 l. note out of his waistcoat pocket, presented it to me upside down, and asked me what amount it was; I turned it round, and told him it was an 100 l. Bank note - he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! is it;" I turned it round on the blank side; there was an endorsement on the back of it, hardly legible - I could not make out what it was. He put it into his pocket, and then pulled out a 20 l. note, and asked what it was; I told him; that was quite new, and had no endorsement; he then pulled out a new 5 l. note - I told him what that was - he said he would lay out the 5 l. note if I would change the others for him; I refused, and he left the shop. (My house is half or three quarters of a mile from Chapel-street,) I had known him for about four week before, and when he left the shop, suspecting all was not right, I followed him and the girl seven or eight hundred yards off into Rosemary-lane, and lost sight of them all at once. I then went to Whitechapel watch-house, and stated what had happened. Plankett Parteridge, and I went round together after them for three or four hours without success.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is your's an open shop - A. Yes. There are clothes hanging outside the same as at other shops. I had seen the prisoner about the neighbourhood frequently, and had seen him seven or eight times; he was dressed in a short fustian jacket; I do not know where he lived. I never saw the woman before; she looked like a girl of the town; she had a red whittle on. I had no power to stop him if I had chosen - he could have overcome me. I was tried here some years ago, for fetching three spoons out of pawn, and was acquitted. I have been in the House of Correction, and in Clerkenwell, about a stolen 10 l. note, which I took in my business - I was detained for a fortnight, and then discharged. I was also in prison about a quantity of palms, which I had sold to a slopseller, and when the business of the 10 l. note happened, a person came forward and owned four of the palms, and I was held to bail, tried at Hick's Hall, and was acquitted. I never said that it was another man who brought me the 100 l. note, or that I offered 50 l. for the notes.</p>
