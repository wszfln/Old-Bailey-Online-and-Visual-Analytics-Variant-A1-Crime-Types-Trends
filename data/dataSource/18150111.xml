               <p>Q. Did you miss any bank notes - A. I have lost bank notes at different times; I do not know who had taken them; I rather suspected the prisoner that he was spending more money than was his own. One day I saw the key in his box; I opened it; I saw some one-pound notes in it, with my own hand writing upon the notes, I can say no further then on four one-pound notes, there was my own hand writing upon them; the name of the person I took them of, and the date; I left them in his box, and sent for an officer; the officer came, and took him in custody. I put my notes in the till after I have endorsed them, my till is not locked, it was left open. I can swear to my having taken these notes since I paid the prisoner any money. I send all my notes to the bankers two or three times in a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid these notes to the prisoner - A. Not to the prisoner I did not; I cannot say whether I paid them to any body else, or whether they were taken away. I knew nothing of the notes until I saw them in the prisoner's box, and that I had taken them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. It is possible you might have paid them to persons that you paid money to - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the number of the other young men that you have in the shop - A. I have four or five; I occasionally keep five persons.</p>

            . On the 19th of December, I took the prisoner into custody; I searched his box, I found in his pocket-book seven one-pound notes, twelve half-crowns, two dollars, six three-shilling pieces, seven shillings, some sixpences, and a ten-pound promissary note. I asked him how he came possessed of so much money; he told me he wanted to speak to his master. I told him I should not allow that, I should take him before the magistrate; I did, and Mr. Bynner picked out four of the notes that he had endorsed. After the examination, I locked the prisoner up, I then asked him again, how he came possessed of so much money; he said, he took from the till a few shillings at a time, and when it amounted to a sum he changed shillings for notes, sometimes he got the notes out of doors. I told him he had four that had Mr. Bynner's hand writing upon them. I asked him if he could account for that, he said, he would give no account for that. I produce the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the notes - A. These four notes have my hand writing upon them, they are all marked in the front; my writing is the name of the person I received them of; there is one Ellis 3rd of August.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. This note has on it the 33rd of August, it is 33 August, that is an inaccuracy - A. It is for the 3rd of August.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say you do not remember paying them to any body - A. I remember nothing of them until I saw them in the prisoner's box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin, If these notes were stolen, they might be taken before the 24th of November - A. On the that day probably.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner knew it was your habit to mark each note - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found the notes until the 19th of December - A No.</p>

               <p>Q. They had your master's writing on them - A. I cannot say. I was indebted to the prisoner's brother; his brother authorised him to receive it; I paid the prisoner four pounds, two of the four in one-pound notes that I had received of my master.</p>

I told my boy to strike a light; he did, and lighted the candles on the shop board; he took the prisoner a light down stairs; the boy went to wash him, he had the coats afterwards in his hand; they were on the shop board. one was a new superfine coat, the other was an old superfine coat. These coats were on my shop-board just going in at the door; the boy had them in his hand, when he shifted the candle block they were in his way, he put them out of his way; he put them down again; the boy told 
               <persName id="t18150111-2-person64">Welch</persName>
             the candles were ready to go to work; my boy shut the door after him; the shop door I opened in the morning to let him in. There is another door that goes into the street. The boy heard the shop door open, expecting him to go to work; then after a little time the boy heard the street door open; it was shut then that morning; I was the first up in the house. I heard the street door open, I did not know who was going out; the door was shut then, it was fastened the over night. I heard the street door open soon after the boy went to wash him, and then when the boy came out of the yard, the boy said, master, the coats are gone, and Mr. Welch is gone. I sent the boy down into Holborn where I was informed he was gone. Whoever it was could not go out of the yard door, they must go out of the street door. I heard it open. One of the coats comes to four pounds ten shillings, for the other coat the man charges me two-pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, was the prisoner to have left you that morning - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever return - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the coats after - A. No. I tried to find them. but I could not any where.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended - A. On the 3rd of January; I was present when he was taken; he was found at the Red Lion, Seven Dials. A young man saw him the night before, he watched him; the prisoner tried to get away; the young man watched outside of the house, he catched him. There are other lodgers in the house, we all go in at one street door.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner in a kitchen, in a corner house of Red Lion-street, Seven Dials; there were two ways to get out of the kitchen, he went out of the back way, he pulled the door sharp after him; I opened it; a young man stood in his way, he could not pass; I took him in custody, and took him before the magistrate. I did not find the coats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a coat and a waistcoat to make for myself; he has a large shop-board where four or five can sit and work; I asked him to let me come and make a garment or two for myself; when my waistcoat was made we pledged it for twenty shillings, the money was all expended; he said when my coat was made he could pledge the coat for more money than I could; I said to him my friend, I will give you a couple of days lift. When he took me up the constable said, I was a fool if I did not take my wages; he told the magistrate he owed me three days wages; I said he has perjured himself. He then said I gave him my work; he then told the truth. It was day-light when I went out, I could see it was a foggy morning; the street door was open; Mr. Smith was jawing the boy. I wished him good morning. He was with me yesterday, he said if I could give him a little towards the clothes, he would not prosecute me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I said, let me see what you have got in your bag, I opened the bag; I pulled out one parcel, and found stockings. I told him I should send for a constable; he said, he hoped I would not hurt him; I told him I would not. I told him, he had better tell the truth; he told me if I would let him go, I should have the two pair of stockings, he would say no more about it. I kept him in custody until the officer came; I told him he condemned himself; the two pair of stockings he offered me I gave to the constable.</p>

On the 25th of December, about three o'clock my shopman was standing at the door; the prisoner passed him; my shopman asked him if he wanted to buy any clothes; he said, yes, but he had no money, he was to get an order from the captain to the owner of the ship, then he should want to buy a good many clothes; my shopman asked him to walk into the shop; I then came into the shop, and asked him his pleasure; he said, he should get an order in an hours time, and then he should want a good many clothes. I asked him if he would walk into the parlour; he said, he should be obliged to me, he stopped till about four o'clock, then the prisoner went out of my house with my shopman, and went to the top of the street, and returned in an hours time; he then remained in my house, and lodged there that night, this was on the 25th of December. The next morning, I got up a little after six o'clock, and when I had dressed myself I went to put my gold watch into my pocket; my gold watch and my silver watch were both gone; I ran down directly into my parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen them - A. One I had in my pocket, the gold one I had in my pocket; the silver one hung up at the fire-place; before I went to bed, I wound up my gold watch; I took the silver one from the fire-place, and took them up into my bed-room. When I missed them, I ran down into the parlour to see if the doors were all secure as I left them at night; when I looked at the bolts, the yard door was unbolted, and the door shut to. I am positive the yard door was bolted the over night; a young man that lives with me now bolted it. I went down stairs to see that it was bolted, but the bolts were not shoved quite home; I shoved the bolts quite home. The next morning the watches were gone; when I found the door unbolted, I ran up to the prisoner's room; I put my hand to the bed; the prisoner was gone from the bed and the bed quite cold.</p>

               <p>MR. SALTER. I am a pawnbroker; I live at Ratcliffe Cross. On the 27th of December, the prisoner came and offered a gold watch for sale; Butler the officer had been with me and informed me that two watches had been stolen a gold one and a silver one. I sent for an officer to apprehend the prisoner; I secured the gold watch; I have kept it in my possession ever since; this is the gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the watches - A. I am certain they are my property, the seal is mine; the gold watch I wore myself, and the silver watch was for use at the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had no intention to take them; a poor man went with me to buy clothes; I had no occasion in the house; I am a stranger here.</p>

He saw a bridle hanging up in the stable, he said can you lend me a bridle, I will bring it back to-morrow; I lent him the bridle; he left behind him the halter.</p>

            . I live at Whetstone. On Saturday, the 2nd of December, I overtook the prisoner at Barnet, he was walking and leading the horse, a little bay horse with black legs. I said, my friend it is very dark, why do not you ride the horse; he said, he was going to Windsor for some horses. I said how came it you have not a saddle; as we were going along, he said, he had the horse to sell, if I can get money to satisfy my master and some for myself. I asked him what he wanted for it; he said twenty-five guineas for it. I said, will you take twenty pounds for it; he said, no. We came into the County of Middlesex; he said, he would take twenty-five pounds. I saw the patrole; I told him what I suspected. He agreed to take twenty pounds if I would treat him with a bottle of wine. I took him into custody. I have since given up the horse to Mr. Pentalow. As I was taking the prisoner to the cage, he confessed that he had stolen it; he was taken to the Justice and committed.</p>

I apprehended both the prisoners by the assistance of Cox; I took Keaf, Murray stopped at the door untill I came. Keaf got above twenty yards from the door; I apprehended both the prisoners by the assistance of Cox, I took Keaf; Murruy stopped at the door until I came back; I went up with Cox to him and took him to the watchhouse. I observed the two prisoners talking together before they look the handkerchief down.</p>

I can prove my property.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a smith at Brentford, on the 3rd of January about five o'clock I saw the prisoner on the threshold of Mr. Ride's door; he was reaching this bundle of stockinge from the window board. I saw him take his hand away from the window board and the stockings in his hand; no one being in the shop. I supposed he had stolen them; I took the stocking' from him; I called Ride, I threw the stockings down in the shop, and caught hold of the prisoner's great coat tail, he attempted to throw off his great coat, and ran away from me; I closed with him, and threw him down, and at that time Mr. Ride came to my assistance, I delivered him into his hands; we took him to the constable's house that night, and took him before the magistrate the next morning. The prisoner said I pushed him up against the window.</p>

He burst out crying; he said for God's sake do not stop me, I have got a good master. He had been three years and a half in his place, he put his hand into his pocket; he said here, my friend, there is a bottle of good old wine; let me go. I said he was my prisoner he could not go; I delivered him up to the constable of the night at the watchhouse. I saw the portmantau contained twelve bottles of wine, five new napkins an old glass cloth and the butlers apron, he had a bottle in each of his coat pockets; he said his master lived at No. 22, Montague-street Russel-square.</p>
               <p>- SMART. I was constable of St. Andrew's last year, The prisoner was brought to the watch-house by Chapman; he delivered to me a portmantua; I have had it ever since, the contents were twelve bottles of wine, five towels, an old glass cloth; he had a bottle in each pocket, The prisoner told me the wine was his perquisites the clothes belonged to his master. He seemed very much troubled about leaving his place. I told him it was my duty to keep him in custody.</p>

In about two hours, I went there with the porter; and counting them over, there were five skins short of the number, I weighed them again, and found a deficiency of eighteen pound in weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of them - A. About eighteen shillings; I have seen the skins since, I have not the least doubt they are the skins I purchased; they agree exactly in weight. I have not the least doubt they are the same skins.</p>

            . Q. You are the person the last witness bought the skins of - A. I am. I live in Long lane, in the Borough, I am a leather factor and tanner of skins. I sold to Elliott four dozen of bazil skins. After they were weighed I considered them ae the property of Mr. Pickford after that, in the afternoon. Elliott came and told me there were five skins missing, I said I would enquirs into it, I mentioned it to the warehouse keeper that such a loss had been sustained, after I went home in the evening, to my house, he sent me a note, that Stevens had got them. I went to Steven's house in Long lane Bermondsey street; I told Stevens what I had come for; he gave me the skins; they have the same duty mark, and of the same weight. I have no doubt they are part of the skins I sold to Elliott. The prisoner said he was sorry for taking them away.</p>

I laid hold of the prisoner likewise, and assisted in taking him to the Compter. I am sure he is the same man that the prosecutor taxed with having stolen his watch.</p>

I locked the prisoner up, and the next day I took him before the Lord Mayor. I took the address of both the witnesses.</p>

               <p>Q. Are your goods outside of the shop - A. Yes, they do some times. On the 8th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I lost three pair of pantaloons, they were inside of the door of the shop, they were on a railing inside of the shop for sale; I was in the shop; I heard a scuffling in the shop; upon looking down, I saw some pantaloons fall down off the railing on the shop floor which gave me suspicion there was something going on wrong, and upon running out into the street at the corner of Play-house-yard, I saw three men standing together, one of the three had the pantaloons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner - A. No; I said to the man that had the pantaloons, them pantaloons are mine, and when I came up to the man, the prisoner was taken in custody by two officers, Prince and Lewless. I heard the noise in the shop, and saw the pantaloons fall down, it gave me a suspicion; I ran after the prisoner from hearing the noise in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you did see the prisoner, the officers happening to be at Play-house-yard, Golden-lane and saw him running with the pantaloons - A. When I came up to him he was taken by the officers, Prince and Lewless are the officers that had got the pantaloons when I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body snatch any thing from off your rails - A. Yes, I did; that gave me suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately upon that, you ran out, and saw three men - A. Yes; the prisoner was stopped by Prince and Lewless.</p>

               <p>RICHARD LEWLESS. I am a constable. I was in company with Prince; I saw Prince take these three pair of pantaloons of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner doing - A. He was running; he ran right against me, Prince and Dewd was following him.</p>

I took the prisoners and the beef to the office, and gave information where I met with the prisoners; it was exactly seven o'clock when I met the prisoners.</p>

I went to the office, and saw the beef<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110011"/>there: it was my beef; I swore to it. It was beef that was in my shop for the purpose of sale.

My wife reached me a cup of tea and a bit of toast; I reached out my hand to take it, and when I sat up, I missed a piece of beef; that was about half past six. I said to my wife, we have had a d - d good customer; she said what; I replied the piece of beef is gone.</p>

            . I am an officer; on Friday the 9th of December, I was in White-cross street, looking about there, I am generally there of an evening about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner with these things under his arm, he was in company with a tall man, I asked him how he came by the property; he told me he took them from his father, his father lived at Islington, he was going to take them to a brother of his in Crown Street Soho; he would not tell me any more. I then said to him, if he was going to Crown street Soho, he was in the wrong direction, he was making for lower White-cross street, and within a few doors of it, that lies south of the place, and Soho lies westward; I then took him to Hatton garden office; I took the caddys and him into my custody, I asked him who was along with him, he said, he did not know the name of the tall young man, he did not belong to him; I then took him to the office, he told the same story nearly to the magistrate; the magistrate asked me if I had any thing else against him. I could not say although I suspected him. The magistrate said, if he would bring his father the next day he would liberate him. He was ordered to bring his father, the next day the father came, but nobody came forward to own the things, a carpenter came into the public house and said he was going to put up some iron bars to a house that had been robbed; I took the prisoner to the Shears public house, the parties came forward and swore to the articles, he was committed for trial, These are the caddys, I took from the prisoner. The prisoner had just been discharged from the New Prison when I took him; I never had him in custody before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix This tea-caddy is my husbands property, I know both the caddys, this is the key of one of the caddys, I lost the key of the other caddy some years ago, I have brought the key of one of the caddys, I had it up stairs in my bed room. I have brought the key with me now, it will lock, and unlock it both. The caddys were unlocked.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>MR. EYRE. I am a hosier. The prisoner Ringrose came to my shop on the 14th of September; about eleven o'clock, and bought some Angola stockings, flannel, and silk handkerchiefs, for which she offered in payment a fifty pound note; thinking it was a forgery, I sent my young men to the Bank of England to get it changed, there it was stopped, a gentleman and a Bow street officer came from the Bank and took the prisoner into custody at my shop. I took her address, it was not a true address, 26, Berwick street; she said she had the note of a servant who was going abroad; I endorsed my name and I believe the name she gave me, on the back of the note.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched Ringrose's lodgings; I found some plumbs, currants, two handkerchiefs, and two pictures, that had been stolen out of the parlour; I in company with Plank we went to the prosecutor's house; when we came to the house we took the man prisoner into custody, on suspicion. On the next day, at the examination, Ringrose said the man had let her into the house; no threat or promise of favour had been made use of to her before the woman said this; she said it frely of her own accord; she said it to his face, he denied it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin. The two handkerchiefs, two pound of plumbs, a pound and a half of currants, two half ounces of ground spice, two ounces of candied lemon, orange-peel, and two pictures, are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is their value - A. A shilling, and the handkerchiefs one shilling; six shillings they cost me.</p>
               <p>COURT. The other articles are not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. I think you told me you had two notes of fifty pounds each - A. Yes; one fifty-pound note I had changed some time before, and the other remained in my possession on the night in question; I received them at my bankers; I don't know it by any particular mark; I only know it by being told by the banker that was one of the notes paid to me; I received it myself at the bankers.</p>
               <p>MR. STURCHER. I only know the note was paid to Mr. Martin by reference to the book; this is one of the notes I paid to Mr. Martin; I know it by refering to the book.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Had you any note of fifty-pound in the house except what came from Currie and Company - A. None.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. I got up at the same time in the morning as usual to dress my goods; I went on to work the servant came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Ringrose's Defence. On Tuesday evening about half past eight o'clock, I met this man coming out of the house; I seemed surprised, I thought he had been away some time; he said, he would give me a bit of suet if I would wait until our people were gone to bed, he would let me in; he let me in about half past twelve, he said, he would let me out about half past six; the bundle was tied up, he told me there was a note, he did not tell me where it came from. I asked him what it was; he said, go to a shop, and get it changed, and get some things there to get change; he said, he should come and see me on Sunday, he did not say he should see me before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This instrument I found by the side of the bureau in the morning; I imagine it is what broke the bureau open.</p>
               <p>Ringrose called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

I immediately seized him by the collar; the prisoner drawed off to my left hand side; he took something out from under his coat, I thought it to be a pistol, it turned out to be an iron crow, it had green baise cover over it.</p>

On Saturday I went to the field; I counted them, and found twenty-one missing. I gave Mr. Duckwell information.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. In consequence of information that I received, I went to Mr. Buckley's house in Virgil-place, Mary-le-bone; they are very small houses, this house consisted of two rooms, a shop, a room above it, and another place as a slaughter-house, that was at the back of the premises; the slaughter-house was behind the shop, and a room above. When I went there, the prisoner was not at home; I searched the shop, and found twenty-one skins; them skins I afterwards produced at the office; the skins were most of them in a very putrid state; there was the appearance of slaughtering by the congealed blood, and plucks hanging up, as though sheep had been recently killed there. I took the skins to my own house. I apprehended the prisoner on Friday the 9th of December, at the house of

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in Taylor's house - A. No; the prisoner lived next door. Taylor keeps a horse and cart; the prisoner was his next door neighbour.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you went there the prisoner was not at home; you searched the shop, and found the skins - A. Yes. I apprehended the prisoner about a quarter of an hour before twelve on the 9th of December, I told him I apprehended him for having stolen some sheep; I took him to the shop where the skins were then deposited, and asked him how he came possessed of the property; he said, he bought twenty-one sheep of a man in Oxford-street on the Thursday week previous to his apprehension, he said he gave forty-two pounds for them, he had no receipt, nor did he know the man he had purchased them off.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110016"/>Q. That is the day they were lost - A. Yes. The putrid state the skins were in I was ordered by the magistrate to keep as many as were sufficient; I have kept four; I shewed the bailiff and shepherd the skins. This is one of the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. to Duckwell. Look at that skin, does the mark answer - A. Here is the letter P on the near side; this is the brand. The mark on the skin answers to this brand; this is one of our own breeding, it is a half bred merino.</p>

               <p>(The skin and the brand handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The mark of the brand and being a half bred merino, you have no doubt of it being your master's sheep, have you - A. No, I have not. This is another of the skins; this one I bought of Mr. West in Smithfield, it is marked with O on the shoulder, with red ochre, and over the loin, and on the hip with ochre, and it has a mark on the head that I gave it at the time myself. I bought five of Mr. West; the other four remained in the field.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Mr. Duckwell, were you always equally clear to the marks of these sheep, were not you asked at Bow-street about these skins - A. Yes; I was then as positive to the marks as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q, You found four that you bought of Mr. West in the field, and therefore you think that is one of your sheep that you lost - A. I am certain it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold none of the half bred merinos - A. Yes, some, not lately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley Did you find any one with particular horns on one of the sheep skins - A. Yes; one that I could swear to out of forty thousand; it is a circular horn that I bred myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Were is that horn now - A. The skin was in a putrid state.</p>
               <p>Q. The horn it not is it - A. No; it is not worth while bring the horn without the skin.</p>

               <p>Q. Who occupied them two rooms - A. A person that went out of them last; the prisoner took them rooms; when he took them, I cannot say, but the shop and slaughter-house he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he occupy them on the 2nd of December - A. That I cannot say. On Friday morning the sheep disturbed me of my rest, they awaked me out of my sleep about a quarter before three o'clock; there were no sheep when I went to bed about ten o'clock, they were not there then; the first I heard of them was about three o'clock in the morning; I never saw them. That is all I know of them.</p>
               <p>AUGUSTNS READ. I am a pig-killer. I know the prisoner; he came on a Saturday to me, I can hardly say when it was; he asked me if I would assist him in killing a few sheep; I told him I was but of little use to him; I said, sheep killing was a thing I did not understand; if it was any thing in the Pig killing line I could help him. He told me he bought I could do a little towards it; I did; I helped kill nine sheep and took the fat off them; the prisoner and me were together; I killed them underneath the apartment of the last witness, next door to where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a person of the name of Taylor lives next door - A. Now he lives up at the corner. The sheep that I killed was afterwards carried to market twelve of them. I never saw any more than twelve; Taylor took the twelve to market.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where did you see these twelve - A. In the place where I killed them, and I saw but twelve.</p>

            . I am a patrole of St. Luke. Chelsea: about five or ten minutes after twelve, I got to the bottom of Hinman's-lane; I met the prisoner full butt, I cannot tell whether he was running or walking; I said to the prisoner, halloo, my fellow what have you got there; he said, his brother had stripped to fight at a house below, he gave him the things to take care off, he said, he was going away to take care of them; I told him he must go back, and show me his brother; he tried to get past me; I took him by the collar, and shoved him against the wall, and took the coat and waistcoat from him, and going along Jew's-row I saw a soldier ran up to Clubb with a stick, and Clubb turning short round the house the blow missed him. I asked Clubb what he had lost; he said his coat and waistcoat; he said I had them under my arm. I asked him where he had lost them; he said, he was knocking at the public-house door, (pointing to the Royal Hospital public-house,) three soldiers rushed out and knocked him down. I then took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and Clubb went with me. The prisoner begged me to take him to his officer; he said, he bought the clothes with his clearance money, of some boy in the street, he gave nine shillings for the coat and waistcoat, out of his clearance money; I went to his pay serjeant, the serjeant said his clearance money was only five shillings and four-pence altogether. I do not know what became of the other two soldiers; I have made all enquiries after them, I could not find them. I produce the coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. to Clubb. Is that your coat and waistcoat - A. Yes, this is the coat and waistcoat that I gave to Wynn to hold on Saturday the 24th of December, Christmas Eve.</p>

               <p>COURT. Have you known him long Mr. Adkins, - A. Three years,</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I am entirely innocent of the crime imputed to me. I received the notes at a gaming table where I lost some of my own. I believe it was in Oxendon street, or some of the streets at the west end of the town; being lately out at sea. I am not perfectly acquainted with the streets; I was ignorant that they were dishonestly come by; I took them for payment I trust that your lordship and the gentleman of the jury must be satisfied of my innocence. Had I stolen the notes, or known them to have been stolen, is it possible to suppose that I should go and offer them at the very bankers where they were advertised to be stopped, surely no guilty man could not act so; he must have known they would not be paid, and that himself must be brought into trouble. I have recently returned from abroad, I have no witnesses.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time of night did you see this before it was broken open - A. Between eight and nine o'clock at night on the night before; in the morning I found the bar raised, and a crooked hole cut in the gate; a person could get at the bar to raise it up, by means of that hole, by cutting away the gate: the hole appeared crooked as if cut with a knife; the knife I believe was found in the prisoner's box; the gate was cut with a knife, the hole was big enough to put a hand in; that I saw between eight and nine in the next morning; I went into the waggon office and saw Mr. Greenwood looking over his papers in his desk. I found his desk had been broked open.</p>
               <p>Q. How could the person get at the waggon office - A. By breaking away some brick work and forcing some boards down; a partition divided the waggon office and stables, that partition was made of wood, there is some brick work at the top of that, there had formerly been a door there, and on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110020"/>top of that brick work, the brick work had tumbled down, it appeared to be tumbled down by a dung fork the point of the fork was bent. Mr. Greenwood also observed there was a box broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose box was that - A. It belonged to the witness Smith, and the things were taken out, and on looking down by the side of the box, I found an iron pin that was used in binding the waggon, that iron pin appeared to have opened the box and the desk; there were marks on the box and the desk that corresponded; then I went into the accompting house, and compared the pin with the desk, it had been used as an iron crow to the desk; the marks in the desk also corresponded with the pin; some money was taken out of the desk, how much I cannot say, the time piece was laying on the desk in the accompting house, that was gone also; from knowing the situation these things were kept in, I knew the robbery must have been done by some persons well acquainted with the place. I knew that the prisoner had been in Mr. Willan's employ. and was out of work, and having seen him in different company, my suspicion fell on the prisoner on the Sunday following I understood he had gone down to Marlow; I went down to Marlow after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him at Marlow - A, Not at that time, I found him at last at Bisham it adjoins Marlow; I saw the prisoner there at Bisham, he was very bad in bed with the small pox, his box was in the house with him;

             the witness got the key of his box from Mrs. Creswell, in his box there were several shirts and a great quantity of wearing apparel, which wearing apparel turned out to be the property of Smith, the witness in court. He was ill, we did not remove him then: when he got well he was brought by Clark to London. The prisoner confessed to having done the whole thing himself, it was perfectly voluntary on his part; he said he had broken open the place himself, he was distressed for money it struck him he might get some money out of the waggon office to take him home to his friends, I asked him whether he did not expect at that time there was one of the bankers boxes of silver; he said he did, he knew very well they frequently came there by the coaches, he said he did expect that. On the last day of his examination, I took the shirt off his back, it turned out to be Mr. Smith's. marked S. S. No, 4; I have the shirt here; he broke through the gates into a stable.</p>
               <p>Q. He broke through a door way - A. Yes; that door had been railed up some time, he got over the door way into the waggon office in the door way: there is the coach office on the right, and on the left hand the waggon office, they are all fenced in with a fence.</p>

            . I am chief constable in Birmingham, I was so in September last. On the 18th of September, in consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner; I first said to her you have robbed Mr. Bloomfield of a twenty pound note, in Gilt-spur-street, London; she made no reply; she put her hand into her bosom and pulled out seven one pound bank notes, she said these are all I have got left of it; she said she had changed it in London, I do not recollect she said at what place. I then asked her how she accompted for the difference there was thirteen pounds deficient; I searched her pockets, in her pockets there were eighteen shillings that I gave her back again; I asked her again what she had done with the remainder; she said she had paid three pounds at the swan and two necks Lad-lane for herself and child, and she had paid two pounds more at the coach office Birmingham, to carry her down to Warwick; and she said on coming down from London she had supped, and had given a five pound note instead of a one which she had not discovered untill afterwards; and she had bought some things amounting in the whole to seventeen pounds, she accompted for the whole, with the seven pound I had got; to the amount of seventeen pounds; I told her I had got a warrant to detain her, she wished to go to her husband in Lancashire, no doubt she said her husband would advance the money and the prosecutor would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the money nor touched it, the money I had was my own property I had it gave me, I thought it was a one pound note when I came to look at it, it was a twenty pound note.</p>

On the 28th of October we received a package from Wales, in which the gold chain was inclosed; the 28th of October being Friday, we are in the habit of setting our accounts in the accompting house early in the afternoon, it is the prisoners department to shut up the shutters. On Saturday evening he came into the accompting house again, and the chain was left on the desk; on Friday we looked for the chain it could not be found; the prisoner had been applied to whether he had found such a thing, he said no, he had been looking among the dirt and could not find it. Some weeks after a gold broach, ring, and pin, had been sent in by one of the workmen, was missing the prisoner received them of the workman that brought them he always brought word that the workman had brought them in and when the prisoner was asked for them; he said he knew nothing of them From these suspicions we were induced to have the prisoner searched, in his box we found duplicates of these articles.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out at the General Post office - A. Ten minutes past eight.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day the accident happened - A. I do not recollect what day of the month it was, it was in the month of October; I believe we left the Post office about ten minutes past eight; the Bath mail coach was drawn by four horses, and when we came to the two mile stone or thereabouts I heard a crush; I then looked of one side, and saw a man laying in the road; I looked of one side at Hammersmith; I saw a cart with the shafts broken, and a man laying in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mail coach go over the man - A. I cannot say it did.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18150111-41-person366">Q. </persName>
            Where was the man that you saw laying - A. He was laying between the cart and the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he near the wheel of your coach - A. He might be two or three inches off; I looked on one-side; I saw the man laying in the road; I desired the coachman to stop. I have every reason to suppose he stopped as soon as he could, considering the rate the horses were going, he pulled up as soon as it was in his power, and sent somebody back to help the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called out to him to stop, how far might he be from the man - A. It might be an hundred yards off the man.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had passed, he pulled up, did you tell him why you desired him to stop - A. I said Akerman, pull up, I believe you have run over this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe he had run over this man - A. By seeing the man lye in the road I thought that he had, I cannot swear that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. He had got an hundred yards past the man, you called out to him to stop the coach - A. He stopped at the Hand and Plower, and sent a shopkeeper at the next door to the Hand and Flower to the man's assistance; I did not get off my box; I had two foreign mails on the top of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other mail coaches before yours - A. Yes, two; the Exeter first, and the Worcester second, and our coach behind; we were as close to the Worcester as we could go, without running foul of her; it was a dark night, we were obliged to have all our lamps a-light.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the crush that you heard - A. I suppose it must be our coach that ran against the cart, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. And upset it - A. I have every reason to believe our coach ran against the cart, I cannot say upset it, the cart stood in the road, and no shafts; I saw the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the road were you - A. The near side, about eight feet from the path.</p>
               <p>COURT. You were on the left hand side of the road when this accident happened - A. Yes, when I heard the crush our near wheel was about six feet from the path.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cart standing - A. On the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the cart on the off side of the road - A. The cart was more on the near side then on the off; the man appeared to me laying about two or three inches from the wheel of the mail coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going on the near side, how happened it to touch him - A. The man that was run over was on the off side, if any wheel run over him it must be the off wheel; the man was more on our side than he ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the man's name that was run over, do you - . No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You were going about eight miles an hour, that is a common mail coach pace - A. Yes, the road was very heavy, we were going a steady trott; we were following the Exeter mail and the Worcester mail.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you running a race with one-another - A. We were keeping steadily behind them; we driving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110023"/>on the near side of the road, about six feet from the bank; the road at that part is about sixty feet wide, the middle of the road was fresh gravelled; our off wheel ran over the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. Your lamps were lighted, had the cart any lamps - A. No; the cart might see our coach, we could not so well see them. I am sure we were following in the same track as the mails before us; the other mails had their lamps lighted at Lad-lane, there can be no better lights than the mails have, they have the best oil.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITE. I am the coachman of the Exeter mail.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how this accident happened - A. No, I cannot; I only know I was first coach, and it was on a Saturday evening, I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It was on the 22nd of October - A. I was before the Worcester coach, I might be twenty yards off the Worcester coach; the Bath coach was just behind the Worcester; the Worcester and the Bath coaches were following me; I was on the left hand side of the road. I neither heard or saw any thing of the accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other carriages on the road at that time - A. I did not see any other carriages; I did not see the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark night - A. Particularly dark, we all had our lights, all of us three coaches had lights; we went our usual pace, about seven or eight miles an hour, perhaps not quite so fast, the roads were bad and heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gravel upon the road - A. Yes, rather more on our side of the road than on the other, which kept us more on our side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from the foot-path - A. The off wheel from the foot-path was about four yards; I was on the left hand side of the road, the coaches were all following us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I have had the road measured, it is fifty feet mide - A. It is.</p>

            . Q. You are brother of the deceased - A. Brother-in-law.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did your brother live - A. In Devonshire.</p>
               <p>Q. On this night were you in the chaise with your brother in the Hammersmith road - A. Yes, I was in a chaise cart, we were coming towards London, we had one horse in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, tell us what happened to you coming on the Hammersmith road - A. We met three mail coaches; we hailed in on the near side of the road to let them pass; we were on the left hand side coming to town: on seeing them we pulled nearer in on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the center of the road - A. I think we were about six feet from the center of the road our right hand wheel; the coach coming in contact with our wheel, the violence broke both our shafts off, the horse went off with the shafts, and run away; the horse was not hurt; the body of the cart directly fell down; I and my brother fell out my brother fell on the right side of the cart, the wheel of the mail coach went over his body, he was then laying on the left hand side of the road, about six or seven feet from the center of the road, on our own side; he fell nearer the mail coach than me; my brother called out when he saw the mail coach coming over him, it was too late to call them; he did not call until the mail coach came upon him, the mail coach did not stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any of them heard your brother or not - A. I cannot say. The jerk of the mail coach coming against our cart was so sudden, I should think they could not be of hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gravel on the road - A. I believe not; I did not see any gravel on the road where my brother was laying; I think our near wheel was about four feet from the ditch, and about six feet or more from the center of the road.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the mail coach was on its proper side of the way when it run over your brother - A. No, the mail coach was rather on the wrong side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the road was the mail coaches when you saw them - A. The first mail coach was a considerable distance to the right, the wrong side of the road, we did not notice the hind mail coach; we got out of the way as fast as we possibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was your brother thrown from the cart - 
               <persName id="t18150111-41-person368">A. </persName>
            Perhaps one or two feet, I don't think more; it was a moon-light night, rather a cloudy night. My brother was taken up, and taken to the Hand and Flower; Mr. Weston was one of the gentlemen that helped to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of your brother - 
               <persName id="t18150111-41-person369">A. John Southcomb</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Q. You have brought an action against the proprietors of this mail coach for damages done to this cart of yours - A. Yes. I myself was thrown out of the cart, and hurt also.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before any person came from the Hand and Flower to pick your brother up - A. Within three minutes, there was a gentleman passing by assisted my brother up before I could get up; we were quite sober; we had been to Windsor; we dined at the market-place, we drank a glass of gin and water at the Cricketers; we did not stop any where between Windsor and Hounslow; as we were going through Hammersmith we met these coaches, we were going a steady and quiet, quite a gentle trot about five miles an hour, the horse will not go more than six miles an hour; the road is wide at that part; all the three coaches were on the wrong side; we were on our proper side; I think the first mail coach was on its proper side, I will not take upon me to swear the second coach was on its proper side, the last mail was driving completely on the wrong side; the second and last coaches was over the center of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the last drive steady in a strait line - A. I do not believe it did.</p>
               <p>Q. You think he drove against you for the purpose - A. No, I do not mean to say that.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you saw the coaches coming, why did not you pull out of the way - A. We pulled in, and made sufficient way for them as soon as we saw the first coach.</p>

            . I was on the Hammersmith road at the time this accident happened, I was coming from Hammersmith to Kensington. The mail coaches were apparently upon the center of the road at the time of passing me; when the last coach had passed me six or twelve yards, I heard a loud crush, it appeared to me as if it was a collision of two bodies, it drew my attention of course, I immediately looked towards the road, I saw a horse with the shafts of a cart dangling behind him, coming from behind the mail coach, the horse proceeded towards London, walking with the shafts dangling behind him; the mail coach proceeded two or three yards at a slower pace, and stopped about three or four yards from where the accident happened, it stopped for a few seconds, when a voice exclaimed from behind the coach, drive on, never mind; upon which the coach proceeded on its way; I was fearful that some accident had taken place, I went immediately over to where the cart was, and the cart was standing on its hinder end, with the bottom turned towards the north edge, without its shafts, its shafts being torn away; the body of the deceased was laying obliquely in the track which the coach must have passed going along, his face was bleeding; he growned very deep, and appeared to be in the greatest agony; I said he ought to be taken to the nearest public-house, directly he was taken to the public-house, I do not know the names of the people that took him; Mr. Hollis was with me; Mr. Southcomb, the brother of the deceased, was there. When I first came up the deceased was quite speechless and lifeless, the body was laying about half a yard from the center on the North side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the road new gravelled - A. I don't think it was; it was new gravelled about a week before.</p>
               <p>MR. BEWLIN. I am a surgeon; I was sent for; I went to the Hand and Flower; I saw the deceased on the floor of the parlour at the Hand and Flower, he had a wound on the right side of the head, it was about an inch long, quite to the bone; the right collar bone and the three first ribs were broken very much; I bled him, but he died in about five or ten minutes. By the desire of the Coroner, he was afterwards opened; we opened the brain, in the brain there was a small quantity of extraversated blood; the collar bone broken in several places, and the three first ribs were broken very much, a large blood vessel had been torn in the cavity of the chest in the right side; the extraversation of blood in his chest was the immediate cause of his death.</p>

            , ESQ. I reside at Woodbine, in Oxfordshire. On Saturday night, the 22nd of October, I was outside passinger on this mail; I sat upon the roof in the front; we were following two other mails; I think we were about fifteen yards behind the Worcester mail, and the Exeter mail about the same distance from the Worcester. I first discovered the cart passing the Exeter mail, I saw distinctly the cart was upon the n gravel; I saw the cart pass the Worcester mail, the cart run very close to the Worcester mail: afterwards the cart came in contact with the Bath coach.</p>

               <p>Q. Before it came in contact, did any person in the cart call out or say one single word - A. I did not hear any one until the crush. The prisoner appeared to drive in a strate line to the other coaches. I think the accident happened by the driver of the cart pulling the wrong rein. We stopped at the Hand and Flower directly, and sent back assistance. I think the prisoner was neither careless or negligent, I saw nothing that he could have done to prevent the mischief.</p>

            . I am a clergyman. I was travelling by the Bath mail on the night of the 22nd of December last, an outside passenger, there was two mail coaches before us; I observed the cart just as it passed the second mail, when the cart had passed the second mail, it appeared to come towards our horses; I heard a loud calling out by the coachman, the coachman called to the man in the cart, the cart came very near our front horses, it appeared to have struck the bar by which the leaders drew; I am sure the cart struck against some part of the coach; the cart was dashed to pieces; I heard the boards of the cart crack,</p>
               <p>COURT. You had an opportunity of observing the prisoner's conduct, was there any blame in the coachman - A. I did not perceive any in which his conduct was blameable at all.</p>

After supper my son brought Mr. Penton up stairs out of the public-house; I was going home, I said to Mrs. Penton do not say any more to him that night, and then I said to Mr. Penton if Mrs. Penton says any thing to you to-night, do not mind her; he said, no, I will go to bed; then I bid them good night, and left them; I know no more.</p>

               <p>MR. HUDSON. I am resident surgeon of St. Bartholomew Hospital. The deceased was brought to the Hospital on Monday, the 5th, she was accompanied by another woman, I do not know the name of the other person. She had a fracture on the let arm: I used proper means for the recovery, and ordered the sister to put her to bed; she complained of a slight pain in her right side; I offered to examine it, she stated that the pain was not very acute, she begged that I would examine her in the morning; accordingly on Tuesday morning I came about ten o'clock, and on examining her, I ascertained there was a fracture, I cannot state the number of ribs that were broken; I treated her as a fractured rib; I used proper means also for it. She grew worse, and complained of pain very much, at the same time the inflamation increased, very much blood was taken from her arm. On the same evening I saw her again, and the inflametary symptoms encreased. Mr. Wheeler, the apothecary, was called in, he thought proper to take more blood from her. On Wednesday morning she was seen by Sir Ladbrooke Harvey, he thought it advisable that the woman should be bled again; she was bled again. I saw her the same evening, she told me she was much relieved by the bleeding. I saw her again on Thursday morning, on finding her much worse, I called in Mr. Wheeler, the resident apothecary, he thought it advisable that more blood should be taken: On Friday she complained of being low spirited, she seemed to state that she was in great danger; I saw her again the same evening, she told me she thought she was going to die. On Friday morning she was visited by Sir Ladbrooke Harvey, he thought her if any thing better. I saw her again, the inflamatory symptoms encreased. He saw her again on the Saturday evening, he saw there was actual inflamation, he ordered me to bleed her copiously. On Sunday morning the inflamation was much encreased, and twelve o'clock at night she died; she was opened in the presence of Mr. Lawrence and myself, and the appearance was as if the lungs were much condenced through actual inflamation; on further examination we found that five or six true ribs were broken, of which the sixth rib peferated the plura, and pressed against the lungs; that was the only appearance inside; outside she was much bruised on her hips and shins.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the occasion of her death - A. She died of inflamation from the injury; the injury had caused the inflamation.</p>
               <p>Q You do not know but it might have been done by a chair being throwed against her, might it not - A. Yes; she told me it was on account of jealousy.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she told you was she in a dying state - A. No. When she was in a dying state she told me she was in great danger, nothing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The husband used to visit her - A. He did; I was not present; he came once or twice.</p>

The last time I saw her was on Friday evening; she said, she was very ill. She always said it was her own fault, her husband would never say nothing to her if she did not begin it first; that was really the case; he was a very quiet indulgent man. When she was tipsey she was very quarrelsome, and very aggravating. I know what was the matter with her before. The woman went with her to the Hospital. She never told me who broke her arm; I do not know that she knew herself; she might have tumbled down. The man was a good husband as could be; she was always tormenting him.</p>

            . I am a servant at St. Bartholomews Hospital, and a constable. On Friday, going round with Mr. Hudson, the house surgeon, he called me of one side, and said the woman was in a bad state, she was labouring then very hard for breath; the surgeon said, Penton, the husband, should be taken into custody. I went then directly, and asked the woman if she thought herself in danger; she said, she did; she said, she had a few words with her husband, jealousy took place; he up with the chair, and broke her arm, and her ribs; she said they both were very much in liquor; she did not say any more. I then spoke to the surgeon, and apothecary they ordered me to take the man into custody; I went, and waited at a public-house opposite where Penton lived; between nine and ten Penton came in, he said, is that you Mr. Bray; I said, yes. He said, I know what you have come for; is my wife dead; I said Penton, she is in a very bad state, and you must go with me; I then took him to a public-house, and left him in the care of another officer while I went to search the premises to see if there was a chair broken; we searched the three pair of stairs that he worked in; there was no chair broken there, but in the one pair I found a chair broken; I then came and spoke to the prisoner; he said jealousy was the occasion of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I suppose she said to you as she did to the others, that it was all her own fault - A. I have known the woman eleven years, she was a woman very much addicted to drinking.</p>

On that day between three and four o'clock in the afternoon I had occasion to go to the necessary; I went into the necessary, and sat down upon the occasion I went for, another necessary joined with it, a partition separated one necessary from the other; I heard the door of the other necessary open, and a person come in; I heard a moving as if in great distress; the moving lasted between four and five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who the person was - A. No. The next I heard was the cries of a child two or three times; the next I heard was the drop into the cesspool; I cannot say exactly it was it; I supposed it, and then a faint cry, and a snuffling, as if it was getting short of breath; upon which I went out, and went to a railing that separated the two back yards, it being too high for me to get over, I put my head over; I heard some thing wiping the floor of the necessary house, it seemed to me as if with a cloth; with that I came into the man that I lodged with, his name is Rhodes; I told him what had happened, and asked him what house that privy belonged to, it belonged to the next house. I went there along with Rhodes; I saw a good many women there, and a mangle; I asked the women which was the woman that had delivered herself of a child, the prisoner was present; one of the women said the prisoner was the person. I asked the prisoner what made her put the child into the privy; she denied putting it in herself, but that it went into the privy, and said that it was in the privy. I desired a nightman to be sent for, and the child got up; a nightman was sent for, he is here; I saw the child found, it was dead.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and nightman; I was sent for by a man, he told me there was a child down in the privy; I immediately stripped, and went down; I dragged seven times, and the eighth time I brought a female child up; that is all I know. A child that fell from its mother could not have gone down so low, without it had been poked down with a pole it could not.</p>
               <p>MR. OLIVER. I am a surgeon. I saw the infant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110027"/>immediately after it was taken out; the infant was quite dead, a female child; it was a full grown child.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the child to have been born alive, would it found in that situation, would that have been the cause of its death - A. I understand the child had been down an hour in the privy, certainly that was the cause of its death.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of a woman's delivery, the difficulty is greater with the first child - A. Certainly it is.</p>
               <p>Q. I beg to ask you from the knowledge which you have acquired upon this subject, whether it is by any means uncommon for a child to drop from its mother without a moments notice - A. No, it often happens they often come all at once, and drop on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a person who went to a privy for the ordinary purpose, be surprized with labour, and the child drop from her in an instant - A. No doubt of it. On examining the child, I found no marks of violence upon the child, the navel string was broken as it would be by falling from its mother. It is common for a woman to mistake labour pains for a pain in the bowels.</p>

            . On the 10th of December between six and seven in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of No. 2, Swan yard Bishopgate street, I saw he had this carpet on his shoulder, that is about three or four minutes walk from Brokers-row; he crossed the street and went up New street. I followed him through suspicion; and when I came into New street, he crossed to a house to look for a name as I supposed; he then went to the next house and looked as if to discover the name; I then asked him what name he wanted he said Mr. Mason; I asked him what he had got, the carpet was covered with a mat, he said a brussels carpet, I told him I believed there was no such name as Mr. Mason there; I said we will go into the Magpie public-house and there enquire; I took him into the Magpie, I asked him whose porter he was, he said Mr. Olivers in Brokers-row; he then begged hard for mercy, he said you know my wife very well, I have four children; he has a wife and four children I took him to the watchhouse. I then went to Mr. Olivers and informed him what I had done this is the carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr. Oliver. is that your carpet - A. It is the property of one of my partners, I had not given the prisoner any direction to take the carpet to a Mr. Mason. I saw the carpet at the watchhouse; it was matted; it would not have been matted unless intended to be sent out, I value the carpet at ten pounds.</p>

On the 31st of December about six o'clock, an officer came in and asked me if I had lost any shawls; I then looked at the window directly; I went out and saw the boys about the window. I saw three boys, these two boys, and another. I am quite sure the two boys now at the bar were two of the three boys.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion that you had did you watch - A. I watched: I went behind the two boys and stood behind a waggon. I was in a situation that I could see what any person did at my shop window. I saw the two prisoners go to the window, both together taking hold of the clothes, with their hands both in the window, lifting the clothes up; they were both taking a part in it; I went behind them both, and catched them both by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid hold of them - A. Yes this was about six o'clock, on the 31st of December, When I laid hold of them I brought them to the shop.

             dropped a shawl at the door, a lady in the shop picked it up. I brought them both into the shop, I am sure it fell from Kettle.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of that, do you think - A. Eight shillings and six pence; I saw it fall from Kettle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other of your shawls in the possession of the other boy - A. The officer took a shawl from his breast, I saw the officer do it. The officer took a shawl from Reeves he had it in his breast; that was worth eight shillings and six pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your window to see how they got these shawls - A. Yes I did afterwards: the window had been cut or broken, and the glass removed; they could take any thing out of the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before that had you occasion to turn your eye towards the shop window, to know whether it was safe or not. A. Another officer came at five o'clock; I went out then and examined the window; there was a small piece out of the window at the bottom, but not big enough to take any thing out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by that part of the window which had been broken at five o'clock - A. Yes; that was not big enough to take the goods out; it was cut in a fresh place, large enough to take any thing out at six o'clock. At five o'clock it was only cut a little at the bottom; that is all I know, I know the goods to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner - A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 31st of December I was at Mr. Hughes's shop about six o'clock. I saw the two prisoners at the window; there was another with them a few minutes before, I was close behind them, I heard the glass break.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the glass of Mr. Hughes's window - A. Yes; the two prisoners stood close against the window when I heard the window break nobody else was nigh it.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that window come low down - A. Yes; the glass is about two feet from the pavement. I kept my eye upon them; I saw Kettle take the shawl out; he came just round the corner he put it inside of his waistcoat. I went into the shop, and told the gentleman of it; I told him there was some things taken out of his window; and when I came out of the shop, they were both at the window again when this shawl was taken out they both had hold of this shawl, they took out this shawl, they both had their hands in the window. I was just going to lay hold of them but Mr. Hughes laid hold of them before me; I did no know that one of the shawls was dropped by Kettle, at the shop door before they were taken into the shop I searched them; on the prisoner Kettle, I found the shawl underneath his waistcoat, Kettle dropped one and the other was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hughes. I think the constable took that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110029"/>shawl from Reeves.</p>
               <p>Carlisle. I took it from Kettle; it is a mistake of Mr. Hughes; I found a second piece upon Kettle they had got hold of a piece of cloth that laid against the window; they had got hold of that, that would have made a third piece; but they could not take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hughes. Were these goods laying near the window - A. They were belonging to my shop.</p>
               <p>Kettle. Said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Reeves's Defence. I had been driving beast in Smithfield; I was making the best of my way home I met this boy, he said here is a pretty shawl should you like to have one.</p>

             then took up the seal which he had before in his hand and said he would give me thirty five shillings for it as I was anxious not to keep the ladies at the door; I said he should have it; there were two or three ladies in the carriage; upon which he agreed to it, and left a three shilling piece deposit, saying he would call as he returned from the Hay market and pay the remainder and take it. He left the seal with me; they both left the shop. I sent my nephew and a little boy to watch these men to see if they went into any of my neighbours.

I went into Mr. Blissets two doors lower down thinking they might come in there; they did not come into Mr. Blissetts; as they came by, Mr. Blissett being a constable, I asked him so pursue him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Blissets from your house - A. About two hundred yards, I waited a little time at Mr. Blissetts untill he came back and told me where they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you ascertain yourself that your seals had been taken - A. My lad brought me the fellow seal, I then ascertained I had lost a seal; they were searched and the property found upon them, before I went home.</p>

            . I am a nephew to Mr. Taylor the last witness. I was in the shop when the two prisoners came in; they came in together, they appeared to be companions, as if they knew each other; they asked to look at gold seals I first called my uncle from the parlour; and as soon as I saw him coming I took the tray from the window; the seals were contained in that tray; no seals had been sold that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners buy any of the seals from that tray - A. No;

            . I am shopman to Mr. Gibbins. On Saturday, the 31st of December, somewhat better than half past five in the evening, about half an hour after I lit the candles, I was at the desk, and heard a noise at the window, some thing similar to an umbrella going against the window; I took no notice of it at first, until it was again repeated; I then went to the window, and saw a persons arm in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the window been cracked - A. It was a little cracked about ten minutes before; it was a large square, and two large pieces were taken out, the two pieces were taken clean out, and another strait cut down the center of the glass remaining, it did not appear as if broken, it appeared cut, half of it appeared to have been cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing the arm in, did you make to the party, and seize the party - A. Yes, I seized him in the act of taking the cloth in his hands; that person is the prisoner now at the bar; I took him into the shop; the cloth was in his hands, which I took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cloth removed - A. Yes, it was out of the window, whether the whole of it was out of the window I cannot say, but the most part of it was clearly out of the window; it had been removed from the spot where it lay; that I am clear in.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you think it laid from the window - A. We have a show board, the cloth was laid out spread on the show board, it laid away from the window, it could be got no way but by putting the arm in; he could have got it by putting the arm in about seven inches I should suppose. I sent for a constable, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Q. You seized him outside of the shop, of course - A. Yes; at that time the light was quite gone; there was light enough from the shop window to discover the countenance of a man, but not day-light; day-light had been gone some time. I delivered him over to the constable; he was committed. This is the piece of cloth, I have kept it ever since; it is worth eight or nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when you laid hold of him - A. No, not till I brought him into the shop, the substance of what he said was to let him go, he would not run away. The cloth is my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent of the crime that is alledged against me; I went up to Mr. Pollto's, it took my whole attention to look at the gass-light; a young man said, he should like a piece of that scarlet cloth; two little boys came running along, and throwed my arm in the window; I am quite innocent.</p>

On the 22nd of December, I was in Rosemary-lane, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner running: he turned up Haye's-court, where there was no thoroughfare, there I took him. I searched him; he had these three pistols under his coat, which I now produce. I asked the prisoner where he got the pistols; he said from the Tower. I took him to the watchhouse. I produce the pistols; I have had them ever since.</p>

               <p>EDWARD HUNT. I reside at Liverpool; I have a brother of the name of John Hunt, resident of London.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 17th of November last, had you occasion to transmit any bills to your brother in London - A. I had, I made them up into a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bills did you transmit that day - A. Three bills of Exchange, and two bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one of the bills that you transmitted that day - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the endorsement, you see the endorsement of the name of Coughland; was that endorsement on the bill at the time that you enclosed it - A. It was not, that endorsement was not on the bill at the time I lost it.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBERTS. I am a clerk to Mr. Hunt. On the 17th of November last, Mr. Hunt gave me a letter to put into the Post office at Liverpool; I lost that letter out of my pocket when I came to the Post office it was gone; I lost it before I got to the Post office.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GALL. I am clerk in the house of Jones, Lloyd, and Company, bankers. On the 22nd of November, the prisoner called with this bill, he left it for acceptance; on the 23rd he called again, I asked him if he was the person that had left it; he said, he was. I asked him to accompany me to a person in Finch-lane, as there was some difficulty about the bill, which we must get rectified before we could accept it. I took him to Finch-lane, he accompanied me, and when we came to the door, there was another person joined us. The prisoner asked me if the bill was stopped; I evaded to answer him direct, and when we came to the house in Finch-lane, he desired the other person to go into a public-house, and to wait until he returned. We then went to Mr. Hunt's accompting-house in Finch-lane, that is Mr.

            , the last endorser, to whom he had paid sixty pounds, the amount of the bill, he pretended, he said, he was a respectable man at Liverpool, an agent he called himself, and he had commercial transactions in London, and at other places; the answers to the questions which were put to him by the prosecutor's brother and myself left the impression on both of us that he was an imposter, he did not satisfy us that he was the man he represented himself to be. Mr. Hunt gave him his opinion, that that man had the other part of the property that was lost, or connected with the people that had it. I refused letting him have the bill; he said, he would sue me for the bill. He stated that Coughland was a pedlar, and he believed he was gone to Ireland, he could not tell where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body sent to the public-house after the other man - A. We took the prisoner into custody, and searched him; on him was found the memorandum of this bill in the name of Brown, Cobb, and Company.</p>

               <p>Q. While he was in the House of Correction, did he say any thing to you - A. He did; I made him no promise or threat, On the 12th of December, the prisoner came to me; he wanted to know, whether he could relieve himself of the charge, by giving information against the person who had received the notes of him, I told him I could not answer that; but what he thought proper to say to me I was bound to hear; he then said, he had committed the robbery between Newport and Bristol; by taking the parcel out of the box, directed to Down and Company. He then made up the box, in the bag, in the same way as when he received it, and then he forwarded it by the Bristol mail to London and the bills and notes he gave to Mrs Hinchesman the night or the day after the robbery. I am not certain which, he had advised Mrs. Hinchesman to negotiate some of the bills before the robbery could be known at Bristol; it could not be known there till the return of the mail, She did circulate several, it was then known at Bristol, and she had absconded she was afraid of being taken into custody, he said, she went to Bath.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker. On the 29th of December, at half after eight o'clock, the woman prisoner knocked at my door, and asked to speak to Mr. Jacobs; the servant answered at the door she is within; I said walk in; when she came in, she said she had brought a glass to sell, for a woman that was very unwell; I asked her how long she had had it; she said she had it a twelvemonth; I then said this glass has not been compleatly finished a month; she replied if I did not like to buy it to give it her back again; I said the glass had not been hung up a twelvemonth, glasses that have, have always dust on the back of them. I then asked her how she could knock at my door, and ask me to buy a looking glass; she said that she was sent by a person at Temple bar, that said I was in want of a looking glass; I detained the glass. I went myself to the office; I told her to bring the person who belonged to it, and while she was gone I went to the office; I brought Mr. Upton the officer, home with me, he had not been in doors above half an hour when a knock came to the door the door was opened, and in came the woman, with an elderly man; she said this is the man that belongs to the glass; I said do you claim it as your property; he said he did, the officer told him it was stolen property, he then said it was not his property, he was authorized by the woman to come and claim it, and then he should have it; he then said it was not his, he knew nothing about it, he was to come and claim it as his property. Being an elderly man, the officer asked him how he came to claim it; he said he was employed by the two prisoners to come and claim it; the woman prisoner said she would point out the two thieves. We lodged the pie-man in the watchhouse; the officer and I went with the woman, into Charles-street, Drury-lane, there she pointed out two little boys; one of these little boys went with the officer, to shew him where the thief had done the robbery; I knew nothing about the prisoner Wells.</p>

On the 29th of December, I was with the last witness, we met with the prisoner Wells; he asked us to go with him; we went with him, he left us, and when he returned he brought this looking glass with him. I afterwards went into Charles Street, Drury Lane; I saw him go out of a house with a woman with the glass.</p>

               <p>Well's Defence. He is telling false.</p>
               <p>Parker's Defence. He brought the glass to me; he said his mother was ill; and wanted to dispose of the glass; he asked me to sell the glass for him, and he would shew me where to sell it; I ignorant of his character, and unsuspecting, out of good nature, took the glass to sell. I have been drawn into my present situation by Wells; he told me his mother was sick and destitute; I consented to sell the glass; I did not know it was stolen.</p>

             - A. Yes, I do; her christian name is Mary.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 17th of November last, when you were in bed, did you hear any noise in the night - A. I did, it appeared to be over my head, in the back parlour, it appeared as if the footman was either rubbing the tables or some furniture moving. I got up, and opened the window to see if it was light, I found it quite dark; I listened a little time, and returned to my bed, not hearing it again; I listened again when I got into bed, I heard the same noise again apparently; I got out of bed, and loaded a pistol, which I had close to my bed side; I went into the lower part of the house first, to see if it was all safe; I found all safe below, and the doors all shut as I left, them when I went to bed, and I saw the doors fast before I went to bed. After I had loaded the pistol, I went up stairs, I got into the passage leading to the room where I heard the noise, I then found a light coming upon me, I could not be certain whether it came out of the parlour or coming down from the drawing-room; I went back on to the top step of the kitchen stairs, before I could conveniently turn round the prisoner was looking at the clock, about six yards off me; I could see him particularly with a wax-light in his hand looking at the clock, standing in the passage, standing between the two parlours he had a wax-light, he took it out of the back parlour; he looked very deliberately at the clock, while I could tell half a dozen, and I looked at him; he then squatted himself downright to look at the key-hole of the clock, he could not stoop properly forward, he squatted, in that act I shot at him with the pistol, he jumped or fell immediately, I could not tell which; he fell against the door; the candle went out; I could see no more. I heard him make a noise. I was a little alarmed myself, fearing there were more. I heard a noise of getting out, he went out at the street door; I called out thieves and murder; I was on the top of the stairs; I called out thieves and murder, for him to be stopped at the door. The servants heard the report of the pistol, they called out thieves and murder; the watchman came up to the door, and the patrole. I desired the patrole to stop outside, they had their lanthorns; the watchman came in; I took the watchman to the place where I shot him; I found the blood had already spurted from the prisoner about two feet from the side of him; I traced it along the passage down the steps to the pavement, a vast quantity of drops of blood. When I got down the steps, I found a lamp-lighters ladder, apparently, reaching to the balcony. I took the watchman then up stairs into the drawing-room; the windows were all secure, apparently as I had left them the day before; I went twice or three times round the drawing-room; I said I would open the windows to see how he could get in; I thought he might get the ladder into the the balcony, and so get in at the second floor; at last I found the middle window a little dirty; I said I would open that first, which is the middle of the three; on opening the shutters I found they were divided into three folds, the bottom part fell out upon me, which had had six screws fastened to it at the side; they were all found out; the middle shutter was fastened; that fastening had been broken off then; I saw marks on the cloth under the lower shutter, because the floor was clean, there were the marks of his fingers; then I was convinced he must have got in that way. I went down-stairs, I saw a shoe and a hat, between the place and the door where I shot him. Then I went to the back parlour where I first heard him; I found two drawers had been broken open, which had always been kept locked; I did not miss any thing, nothing has been missed; there was only these two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110035"/>drawers broken open; all the things and furniture in the drawing-room has been looked over, because I saw the marks of dirty fingers; the goods were all covered over with sheets, and there were marks of fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a fair sight of the prisoner, so as to know him again - A. A very fair sight; he had a wax-candle in his hand, I perceived that distinctly. In the morning I went to Bow-street office, and gave a description of the prisoner; I said he was about six feet high, dressed like a lamp-lighter; I thought about thirty years of age, dark whiskers, and shot on the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you are certain that he is the man - A. I am quite clear that the prisoner is the man; I have no doubt about it; I never saw him before as I know of; he never lived in that house; he has been formerly a workman there.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is Mrs. Broderick's house in - A. In the parish of St. George's Hanover-square. I shot him exactly as the clock struck five, it was quite dark; it was quite dark when I first heard the noise.</p>

            What was the man doing when you first saw him - A. He was looking at the clock, and he was squatting down when I shot him; I had a full side view of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the man before - A. No; nor never after until I saw him at Bow-street; he was dressed in a dark coat, rather short for him; I think it was something of a jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he on breeches or pantaloons - A. I will not swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you will swear to the man - A. I do not swear to the lower part of his dress; I found a great deal of blood in the passage, and the watchman traced it all the way to Grosvenor-street; I only traced it down the steps.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his business - A. He is a carpenter,</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming home to his lodgings on the 17th of November - A. Yes, it was on the night of the 16th, and the morning of the 17th, it was about six o'clock, it was dark; he came to his lodgings; I let him in; he went up stairs directly; I lodge on the first floor. I opened the door, and left him to shut it.</p>

He had a short jacket on, he had no hat on I believe, and I think his jacket was a blue one, I will not be sure, and I believe he had no shoes on as he passed my room door. I never saw him afterwards until I saw him at Bow-street; he quitted his lodgings on Friday evening, or Saturday morning; I never saw him afterwards there. This was on Thursday.</p>
               <p>OWEN GRIFFITHS. I am a surgeon; I was sent for to the White Horse public-house, Little Britain, on Thursday, the 17th, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon; I found the prisoner in bed; I looked at the man as he lay in bed, and examined him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what he sent to you for - A. I went to examine his face; no words passed as I can recollect. I examined his face; I found him wounded in three places in his face. I got some water ready to dress him; I dressed him. He shewed me his thigh and arm; I extracted a few small shots from the thigh, and asked him how he came so much injured; he said, he was shot at in Lincoln's-inn-fields, and he fell down, which was the occasion of the wound in the forehead; he was faint. I desired him to lay down, seeing no means of his being taken care of, I recommended him to go to the Hospital; he promissed so to do. I ordered him to take the medicine that I sent, and I sent him a lotion to wash the part with. I called the next morning, the landlord told me he was gone away; that was Friday. He had one shot in his right cheek; that is all in his face. The other shots were in the arm and thigh, one shot in the left arm, and some in the right; the wound had been recently done; he did not tell me when they were done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep any of the shots that you extracted - A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. From information, I was sent down to make enquiries upon it; on going into the house, in the passage, near the place where the blood was, on the 17th of September, I found the hat and shoe; I went to the window, where it was supposed he entered; I found it broken open in the same way the former witness has described; after getting as good a description of the prisoner as I could, I inserted it in the newspapers; there were many spots of blood close to the clock, and on the wall near the street door was the mark of a man's hand smeered with blood. On Friday the advertisement was inserted; on Saturday I received information of the prisoner; I went to his lodgings, I found he had left them on the Friday. I then went to every Hospital in London; I could hear nothing of him.</p>

            . I am high constable of Birmingham. On Saturday, the 6th of November, I sent a man to the Hospital for this man; the surgeon of the Hospital waited upon me, saying, he had a man then in the Hospital under suspicious circumstances, he was brought to me in a bad state at that time with very great difficulty he walked, he was a long time coming; I did not say any thing to the prisoner that night, not till Sunday morning; I put him in a good bed up stairs; I sent for a surgeon to examine him on the Sunday, I was informed he was in that state that it was not proper to move him; Mr. Cox informed me that he ought not to remain in my prison; he desired I would send him to the Hospital in the workhouse; I sent him to the Hospital at the workhouse. I told the prisoner I believed he was the man that committed the robbery at Mrs. Broderick's house; he said no, he committed no robbery; he said he had got into the house through the window, and as he had taken nothing, he hoped they would do nothing to him. I believe I have told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110036"/>every word that passed between him and me, I made him no promise or threat.</p>
               <p>William Moiley. I produce some of the shots the same as I loaded the pistol with.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Griffiths. Are they such sort of shots as you extracted - A. Yes, they are about the size.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It appears from the evidence that the man shot in Grosvenor-place lost a great deal of blood; the blood was even traced to the White Horse, Piccadilly; I can make it appear that I bled none, not even the sheets that I lay upon.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I had been gone but a few minutes. when a neighbour came to tell me that Mr. White, a linen draper, had sent for me; that a suspicious person was in my shop, and wished me to come home. I came out, and went to Mr. White; he told me to go home and finish serving this woman; she had been in his shop, and he had no doubt she was a thief. I then went to my shop, the prisoner was sitting on a stool in my shop, and a number of silk stockings were opened, and on the counter. I went on serving myself; she had previously looked out six pair of silk stockings, she then looked out four pair of worsted stockings, and told me to send them to Mr. Brown's, 45, Lincoln's-in-fields. Mr. White was waiting to follow the prisoner, which he did. I looked at the papers of stockings, I missed two pair, and I thought three, but two pair I was certain of. After that I went to Mr. White's house, and by that time he had brought the prisoner back to his house. I went up stairs into a room where she had been taken to, and on the table in the room I saw three pair of black silk stockings, two pair of them I knew to be mine; the prisoner confessed of having taken them from my shop. She was delivered to the constable.</p>

               <p>MR. WHITE. I am a linen draper, at the corner of New castle-street, in the Strand. On Friday the 16th of December, the prisoner came into my shop; my young man was serving her. I afterwards served her. She bought fifteeen yards of flannel, and a silk shawl, and desired me to send it to the Reverend Mr, Rigby's, 15, Lincoln's-in-fields; I suspected it was a false address; I followed her until she went into Mr. Lacey's shop. I sent a person to give information to Mr. Lacey of her, and afterwards followed, and took her to my own house. I told her I suspected she had stolen something from me; she said she had not. She delivered to me three pair of stockings she said stolen from Mr. Lacey; these are them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my stockings, I know them by a B 4 3 in the velt in the feet; these stockings have the other B 4 3 in the feet.</p>

               <p>Q. On the evening of the 11th of October, did you see the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, he came into our shop with a young man of the name of Jones, as I am told. When they came in, Jones, the other man, spoke; he said he wanted to see some fine broad lace, to him a dress for his sister. I shewed them a box of lace, the prisoner looked at it with him, and he spoke about it with him. We had four or five candles in the shop, there was a good light, it enabled me to see the prisoner and to observe the persons of the two men. While they were there, a gentleman came down stairs, I think, from recollection, a person came down stairs. Jones told me it was not precisely the lace that his sister wanted. The prisoner said, the the lady, or sister, had better come to the shop. Upon that they left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay in the shop - A. Some minutes, I took no particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner said she had better come herself, and quitted she shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 14th, did the same men come again - A. Yes, about half past seven; I believe both the same persons came again on the 14th; before they came in, the door of the shop was shut, one of the prisoners opened it; it was shut upon a spring latch, they come in together as close us possible, and one of them opened it. I am quite positive the door was quite close, and the latch had fastened in the catch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is there any thing particular in that circumstance the latch is always shut, of an evening is it not - A. I am sure it was shut, I was standing at the end of the counter, about four or five yards from the door; they spoke to me when they came in; the other one said, I was so good as to shew them some lace the other morning. Jones said that I took down the box again; I knew them to be the same persons again. The box had some paper folded over the lace; upon my taking the lace out, the lace was folded on cards. I removed the paper with intention to expose the lace; two cards of lace laid on the top; I was taking the two cards of lace out when the other young man laid hold of the lace and run out of the shop. I cried stop thief immediately; Rice let him pass by him, and stood by him so as nothing could go after Jones without passing by him. My<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110037"/>youngest sister got out of the shop first, immediately after him. I run out of the shop as quick as possible, and just as I turned my own door, some man laid hold of me; he said, where are you going, my dear? I returned immediately; my youngest sister had gone to make the pursuit.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner - A. In December I saw him again; this was on October the 14th. I saw him again on the 19th of December in Bow-street Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him again - A. The moment he came in at the door; I am certain he is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this lace - A. One hundred pounds; I have seen three yard of it again at the pawnbroker's, it was brought to Guildhall; I saw it first at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the two - A. Yes, he was; I saw him look at the lace on the 11th of October. The young men came in and asked to look at some thread lace; I was then in the shop by myself. I rang the bell for my sister to come, she shewed the lace to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner is one of the said person - A. I am, I recollect him perfectly. When they came again on the 14th, my sister shewed the lace net to the prisoner; one of them put his hand into the box, and took out two handfuls of lace, and immediately ran out of the shop, I pursued the one that took the lace and lost sight of him; the prisoner followed him.</p>

             and Shenston. I lodge in a court in Clare Market, the name of of the court I cannot call to mind. We all four went out together from my lodgings; we had agreed before then where we should go to; it was to this house in Cannon-street. I had been there on the Tuesday before with the same party; nothing was done on the Tuesday. On the Thursday we agreed to go again, for the purpose of taking this lace. When we got there we waited, we all four looked at the shop, and looking in, and seeing three ladies, we thought that was too many to do business. We waited a quarter of an hour, we made the proposition to get one of the ladies to leave the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the means - A. We thought of taking a neighbour's name that the Miss Jacksons might be acquainted with. We observed the name of Wrigglesworth. Then Joseph Shenstone went into the shop, saying he came from Mrs. Wrigglesworth, she had got a friend come from the country, and wised to look at some laced caps, and begged the lady would step down immediately with a sample- Shenstone went in, and came out again to the door; we watched him in, and saw one of them go up stairs. Then James Jones and William Rice went into the shop, what they said I cannot tell. I saw one of the ladies, there was a strong light, and three or four candles in the window. I stood on the opposite side of the way, we saw one of the ladies pull down a box of lace, I walked about two yards from the door; as we turned our heads, we saw Jones come out of the shop with a hand full of lace. Rice followed, and a lady followed and cried stop thief. Then me and Shenstone followed towards St. Paul's Church-yard; we had agreed where to meet; we met in a sort of a Brood way, at the back of the Blue Last, and when me and Shenstone came there we met Rice and Jones, they said all was right; we went to a public house in a court in Drury-lane, nearly opposite the Pavillion, and sent for a person to buy the lace. The lace was not produced, they did not agree to the price. I saw the lace in Jones's hands, it was sold for eleven pound to the best of my knowledge, to a man in Fleet-lane, of the name of Green. We all four went to his house, and measured the lace; I believe the man lives there now; he has a lodging in the two pair, at a muffin shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Should you knew him again if you were to see him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe you were not taken up? without being taken up you made a disclosure of this - A. Yes, and some other offences, without ever being taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You never were taken in custody, were you - A. No, sir, no, not even charged, I never was in my life: I engaged in this business.</p>

               <p>Q. Other people were to thieve, and you were to share the profit, that was the case then - A. To be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How many more things have you been concerned in besides the present - A. One more.</p>
               <p>Q. In what was that, stealing from some body else - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Come, out with it? Of which you were to share a part of the plunder, were not you - A. Only once.</p>
               <p>Q. Try and recollect yourself - A. I have once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. If you would recollect yourself Mr. Harvey, you might give us another time, three times, this and two others - A. Yes, very good.</p>

I produce the scissors; I got a constable, and the prisoner was taken before the Lord Mayor.</p>

I did not come back till the next morning; and when I returned the man requested that I would look over the goods, he had lost two knives, there were three deficient valuable knives, one of them with twelve blades; a pocket knife, mounted with silver, and pearl handle; the two knives would cost me fifty shillings to manufacture them in my own house,</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Smith, the prisoner came into my master's shop on the 9th of November, between six and seven in the evening; he first of all asked to look at some oyster knives, which we had none; there was nobody in the shop but me, I was the only person that had the care of the shop at that time. As we had no oyster knives, he wanted to look at some pocket knives, I opened the glass case upon the counter, and shewed him what knives there were. There he examined them, he had another person with him, he and the other person was companions together. They examined the whole glass case there were a great many knives in the glass case. After they had looked over the glass case, they wanted to see some other knives, which I shewed them; sporting knives they were with horse pickers, and different kind of instruments, he overlooked the sporting knives, and none of them suited, after that the prisoner said he must have a common knife to cut his nails with. I pulled out a drawer, and took out a paper of common knives; when I opened it to shew him, one of which he purchased. I asked him for the paper which he had taken out of the drawer; he returned it to me, the paper which he took up contained common knives; he returned that to me. He bought a knife at eight teen pence, and then they left the shop. From their behaviour, they caused me to suspect that something else might be gone, I did not see them take any thing. After they were gone, I looked over the glass case, two valuable knives were in that case; the two knives were missing from that case, the two knives were worth two pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after these persons had left the shop was it that you missed these knives - A. In less than five minutes. I am sure these two valuable knives were in the glass case at the time the prisoner was there, no other person was in the shop before they came in, and I was in the care of the shop all that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. When the officer took him in custody. I think the 24th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your knives since - A. No, when the officer met him and charged him with this, he said he was at Oxford at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not deny being at your shop.</p>
               <p>Robinson. You did, you said you were at Oxford at the time, it was on Lord Mayor's day, when you came.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. to Robinson. I understand you to say you saw him in custody on the 24th of November - A. That was a mistake; it was on the 20th of December.</p>
               <p>Matthews. Robinson said he was the man that robbed the shop on Lord Mayor's day, he was one of them he said there were two together; he and another. The prisoner said he was in the country at the time, I do not recollect at what part of the country he said. I searched him, and found no knife of any sort upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this cutlers shop - A. Yes, there is a good light in this shop, to know a mans person again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I solemnly declare I know nothing of the knife I am charged with stealing. I acknowledge I was in the prosecutors shop; I did not take any thing from the prosecutors shop but the knife that I bought and paid for. I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. to Robinson. Before the prisoner came to the shop - A. Before the prisoner came in the shop I looked at these two knives they were in the case and almost immediately after they left the shop they were missing. I am positive they were in the glass case all the day; they were in the glass case when Mr. Smith went out at four o'clock in the afternoon; and after he was gone the glass case was not opened until the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What made you recollect these two knives in the glass case - A. Because there were only two of the sort; one of the knives had a pair of the scissors at the end of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Roberts. Do you swear to seeing these two knives being there - A. I do; we had no more knives of that description; the glass case was not opened from the time that my master went out, untill the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Prosecutor. How long had Roberts been in your house - A. Twenty five years, I served my apprentership after he was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any clothes at any time - A. I did, the prisoner was a servant of mine; I missed these clothes on or about the 16th of November last; the coat was my own; I had never worn it above six hours. I went out to dinner, and on my return I found the prisoner had left my house without any warning, I missed several things, among which were these in the indictment.</p>
               <p>DICKENS. I apprehended the prisoner. On the 18th of December, I told him the charge I had against him, he denied it; and afterwards he confessed it. I found this new coat, and his master's shirt, on his back, and the other things I found at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe them all to be my property. I have no doubt of it.</p>

They then went away, I saw no more of them until the evening, and in the evening, about six o'clock, two officers came and presented the blue print, and asked if any one knew the pattern; I said it had been my employer's, I had sold it to two women. They then opened a bundle, and shewed me three pieces of print; I knew them three pieces to be my master's property. I had seen them on the counter that day, ready to be put on the shelf.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3rd of January the three prisoners passed me in Holborn; knowing them, I followed then to West Smithfield, and there I saw my brother officer, Bray; he joined my company. We then followed the prisoners, they went into two or three gin-shops; we followed them into Ratcliffe-highway, and at the bottom of Prescot-street they had a conversation together. Blake and Smith went to the shop of Davis and Bottomley, leaving the old one, Lambert, behind. Lambert stood in the road, opposite, about twelve or thirteen yards off the prosecutor's house. I saw Smith and Blake go into the prosecutor's shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110041"/>and when they came out of the shop, Smith had this print; they then proceeded to Prescot-street, Blake then appeared to have something bulky under her shawl. We followed them until they come to Fore-street, we then took them into custody, and took them into a wine-vaults, all three of them; in Lambert's lap we discovered these three pieces of printed cotton. Lambert had likewise the piece of blue cotton that was purchased by Blake and Smith.</p>

I pulled out my pocket-book, and gave a one pound note out of it to get change, the prisoner came and stood at the right-hand side of me; and took the pocket-book up; and as soon as I received my change, I turned round to look for my pocket-book, it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse her of it - A. There was nobody in the shop but her and myself; I gave the prisoner in charge of the watchman; as she said she would not be searched but by a proper officer. The watchman found the pocket-book upon her; his name is Ripshaw.</p>

Tisley came back, and said, I should have them; he said, he came from Penman. I am sure the two prisoners are the men.</p>

On Monday, the 9th of January, I went in company with Gleed at a house in Turk-street, Bethnel Green, I knocked at the front room door; I was answered by a woman; I told her if she did not open the door, I would break it open; I found a trap door under the stairs; I got a light, and went down, there were no stairs, and in the third cellar, I found the prisoner Tisley, I asked him his name; he said, his name was James Thomas. I told him I took him in the name of John Tisley, on suspicion of robbing some people in Quaker-street, he then said, it was no use denying his name, it was Tisley. I then brought him to the office; I took a pair of shoes off his feet, which are here. I left him in the custody of my father. I found nothing but a pair of shoes on Tisley's feet.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and looking-glass frame maker. Last Monday week about half after four in the afternoon. I was in company with Penman at the Spotted Horse public-house, Shoreditch; John Tisley came into him, they went out together, and talked together. Penman came in, and asked me to take a walk with them; we went over Friars Mount; when Penman came to Loader's house, Penman burst the door open, with his arms, he had no crow with him; it was about half after six; when he went into the house Tisley followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you - A. I was at the corner, I was to look out, and to inform them if any body was coming. Penman brought out of the house a looking-glass, and three pair of shoes; nothing else as I saw. Tisley had one pair of shoes; they said I was to have one pair of shoes, but I had none; they gave me only four shillings and sixpence for my share.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Loader. Look at these shoes - A. They are my shoes, and the looking-glass is mine.</p>

            . I belong to the ship the Amelia; I was on board on the 27th of December, when the two prisoners came with the Martha lighter.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time did the lighterman reach the ship - A. Some time in the forenoon. I went into the lighter to bear the case off from knocking the sides of the ship; when I come out of the lighter, I went on the Deck; I saw the case in slings; Fenn and 
               <persName id="t18150111-77-person680">Stewart</persName>
             both assisted in unloading, they were both in the hold. I saw them strike the case once or twice with a mallet, or something of that kind; he gave it a harty blow two or three times. I took particular notice it was along the side of the case, the boatswain of my ship asked me what we were doing, the boatswain heard the knocking; the package was afterwards brought, and the whole contents of the lighter was brought on board our ship, and the lighter rowed away. The boatswain observed a hole in this package; I called to the man; I am sure they heard me; they answered me. They did not come back, they asked me what I wanted with them, I said the boatswain wanted to speak with them; they said he should have spoken before.</p>
               <p>DOMINE DEHOURST. I am a boatswain of this vessel. I recollect the case coming on board on the 27th of December; I heard a knocking in the lighter, and this case afterwards was brought up, and as soon as this case was brought up I had it placed on the Deck. I observed a piece broken off the corner. I and Miller hailed the lighter, the men in the lighter did not return on our calling them, I told them to come on board, one of the cases was broken, I shewed the mate the condition of the case, these goods was put on board the ship on Tuesday; on Friday I saw Stewart at the office; Fenn came on board our ship on Thursday: I shewed him the case, he said the case did not come on board our ship in that state. I asked Fenn for a duplicate, when first I took the things in, he said he had got none it always was customary to have a duplicate; and then the mate given a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dehourst. Were you present when this case was opened - A. I was, the carpenter and master opened it. I looked into the case, there were a deficiency in it; there were a vacancy inside, near the place where it had been broken open, the case remained in that situation until Mr. Dubious had seen it; we had fourteen men on board, all the men saw the case had come on board with a crack in it; the case was always kept in the hatches, none of the men could get at it, the hatches were locked.</p>
               <p>MITCHEL, The case was opened in my presence in the ship, and at the police office, a great part of the things were missing.</p>
               <p>Mr. DUBOIUS, I examined the case; when I packed the case it was quite full, so much so that it bulged, and when I saw it at the office, there was a vacancy; all the articles in the indictment were missing, and the articles had been replaced; I had balls of cotton like them in the package.</p>
               <p>Mr. MITCHEL. I took Stewart into custody; I went with him to his house; below, in the front room, on a table, I found this ball of cotton; and up stairs, in this paper, in a bag hanging up, I found these balls of cotton, eighteen balls of cotton, and in another bag, fourteen balls of cotton. Jennings found these pincers; I compared these pincers to a mark on the inside of the case; one end of the pincers is bent, as if used in raising that part; the pincers exactly fitted the hole in the corner of the case.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went in company with Mr. Waller to the Martha lighter, on Friday the 30th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I waited there until Stewart came; I asked Mr. Waller for the key of the lighter, he gave him the key; I, in the presence of Waller, searched the lighter; I found these three boxes of cotton among some rubbish, covered over with two or three handspikes, tied up in this paper, and a pair of pincers in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110045"/>locker. When Stewart came, I took him to the watchhouse. These are the pincers that Mitchell examined. (The case shewed to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>Stewart's Defence. After I had the order to watch the lighter, I set off home to get my supper before the lighter went off to the ship. I had a friend or two at home, when I stopped longer than I should. When I returned to the lighter, the lock was unlocked and the locker; it being dark, I could not know that was the cotton now produced; my wife bought it; I know nothing of it.</p>

I thought he had robbed him, therefore I ran after him, I pursued that man as far as the second house in the Crescent, as far as St. Clement's Church. The prisoner came up to me; there was no watchman there at that time; the prisoner took hold of my collar, and with great violence threw me against the shutters; two watchman came up, he gave me in charge of one of the watchman as being the man who had robbed the youth; he then looked me in the face, and begged my pardon; the prosecutor came up, and said the prisoner had held him while the other man man robbed him, I then laid hold of the prisoner.</p>

I believe she has lived with me about four months; a circumstance occurred in the family, I will not state the circumstance. It induced me to go into the kitchen, and speak to the prisoner. The kitchen is divided from the parlour by a partition; I said to the the prisoner, Ann, your conduct during the time you have been in this house has been much to my satisfaction, but Mrs. Hatton has made communication to me, which, if true, will lessen you very much in my opinion. Now, if you will let me look into your pockets, I shall consider you know nothing of it, and that Mrs. Hatton is wrong in what she has stated to me. She refused to be searched; she said no, if you want to look into my pockets, you must send for an officer, then you may look in my pockets or my boxes, as long as you please. I said if that is your wish, I will certainly send for an officer. I called for the errand boy, to send for an officer; she then begged that I would not send for an officer, she consented to be searched. In searching her pockets I found as many of notes as applied to the business I wanted to find out. I searched the notes and letters that applied to the business; we found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110046"/>six yards of ribbon in her pocket, and a pair of patte ear-drops, which I have had ever since the ribbon is in possession of the constable. We also found a little snuff box on the table, I value that at a shilling; a top of a silver cannister that had been brought into the shop as old silver, worth about two shillings. I am a watchmaker and jeweller; I found a silver knife in her possession, and another silver fruit knife; the silver knife has my private mark upon it. We deal in such things in the shop. I gave the prisoner in charge. These articles were left with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. What things were left with you - A. The top of the cannister, a box, and a pair of ear-drops, all but the ribbon.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of information you received respecting the prisoner, did you go and see Burton - A. Yes, he is an officer; and what I afterwards did was in pursuance of his directions. On the 14th of December, I went to the George in West Smithfield, about one o'clock; my husband went with me; the prisoner was there; we entered into conversation together; my husband told him I was his wife, and if he had any to dispose of I would look at some as well as himself, my husband said, I could pass money as well as he could, the prisoner told us if we went to Whitechapel, he could get us what money we wanted. We then went to Dickson's public-house, in Essex-street. When we got there, the prisoner talked about Jacobs; he said he was going to Jacob for the money. He left us and went away; he returned, Jacobs followed him. The prisoner gave me ten counterfeit shillings; I gave him three shillings; he said they were good ones indeed, my husband's money was. After this Jacobs said he would give no money in that house. He proposed to go to the Rose and Crown, in Essex-street. We all went to the Rose and Crown, into the parlour. Jacobs came in; Jacobs put his hand into his right fob, and took out a great many counterfeit shillings. He said he would not give any body counterfeit money but the prisoner. He said if my husband was a trap or, an officer, he did not care for him, he could have but a twelvemonth; he would save the money for buttons for his coat. Jacobs went out the prisoner followed him, and immediately the prisoner returned in and gave my husband eleven shillings; my husband gave him three shillings in value; the prisoner said he had, used my husband well. He gave him eleven shillings; he had given me but ten; I was to go down the following morning to get some eighteen-penny pieces and three-shilling tokens; I was to have them on the 15th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did your husband give him for the eleven shilling - A. A three shilling piece; I know it was three shillings in value; we came away, we had been in the public-house about two hours together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She swore at the office, that her husband paid me three shillings, now she says a three-shilling piece; now she says she purchased on the 14th, at the office she said on the 15th.</p>

               <p>Q. You went from Smithfield to Whitechapel - A. Yes; we went into the back parlour; the prisoner asked me what I should like to have; I said tokens.

            , they are all the partners in that firm. I produce the book with the entry of the coals; the carman took out eighteen sacks to the stable-yard, St. James's, and twelve sacks to Burr-street; I have also it signed by Maybank, as the carman, his charge is eighteen-pence for shooting; he worked until the 22nd, and then he absconded. On the day the coals were taken out, they were five shillings and sixpence a sack; this sort of coals were sixty-six shillings a chaldron; they were the best coals the carman's name is signed on the ticket, he afterwards signs the book; we send one man, he may take another. Fox was a backer; we owed the prisoner one pound for shooting when he absconded; he never called for it.</p>

            . I have an apartment in St. James's Palace; Mr. Marrabone lives next door to me. On the evening of the 19th of April, I recollect seeing a coal waggon come into the stable-yard, it was near six o'clock; I happened to be looking out of the window; I saw the coals unloading; there were two or three sacks emptied; I saw the man moving the sacks from the front to the tail, he knocked two sacks down, and the coals fell into the street; he put some empty sacks down in the street; I cannot say how many; I then thought there was something wrong, and I watched the counting of the sacks; they counted eighteen, part of them were empty; I watched the waggon; they drove to Maddox-street, they stopped at Mr. Hill's door, in Maddox-street, it is a cook's shop, in Maddox-street, and a private house in Swallow-street, it is a corner house; the waggon pulled up to the private door; I thought the man in the waggon suspected me, I went two or three doors further; they went into the house with two sacks; I saw them come out as if they had taken more; the waggon moved on towards Burr-street, Golden-square; on my seeing Hill in his house. I went, and asked Mr. Hill if Messrs. Wood, were his coal-merchants; he said, no. I said you have had some coals in; he said, he had four sacks out of the waggon, Mr. Wood was not his coal-merchant; he said, the man came into his shop, and said he had some coals to sell, he bought four sacks of him. I told him he had done a wrong act, and he would get into trouble about it. The next day I told Mr. Marrabone of it, and afterwards Mr. Wood was acquainted with it; Mr. Wood sent the metre to measure them; they measured only fourteen sacks, instead of eighteen; they were four sacks deficient, including them that had been burned. I cannot tell who the carman was, whether it was the prisoner or any other man; this happened on the 19th of April.</p>
               <p>MR. M'CALLAH. I am one of the Westminster coal-metres. In April last, I measured some coals in Mr. Marrabone's apartments. I saw his servant, she told me how many she had used; they turned out to be fourteen sacks, and no more.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PACE. I am an officer. I apprehended Maybank on the 25th of November; there was a warrant against Hill, he came directly to the office; he was bailed out, and surrendered to day.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Marrabone. I remember the coals coming in; soon after Mr. Amos told my master something, or else he would not have known it; I used no more scuttles of coals than four only; the scuttle is about half a bushel; I told the metre how many I had used.</p>

On the 1st of December, somebody pulled at my watch as I lay in my hammock, about one o'clock in the morning, I thought it might be one of the ships company that wanted to know what o'clock it was; I recollected there was no light on the half deck; I then thought they could not want to know what it was, there being no light there; I found a pull at my watch a second time; I instantly seized the person by the wrist; he pulled me out of my hammock; I sung out for assistance, and held him fast until assistance came, and then I gave the prisoner into the charge of the ships company; the prisoner said his name was Peterson, he did not belong to the ships company; I never saw him before.

Gentleman, my mistress looked over my box, and found nothing but my own property. I missed a little tin box that contained three one-pound notes, and a two-pound note; I had a cloak, my mistress took a fancy to, and tried it on, and pursuaded me to move it from that box to one where it might lay strait, and when different people came for money my master used to write a note, and I was pretended to be sent for the money, and to come back and say the people were not at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. to Prosecutrix. Did you ever try on any of her clothes - A. Yes, a black Mode cloak; that is not in my house now.</p>
               <p>Q. to Porter. Did she relate the circumstance of her money in her box - A. She did.</p>

             the key of the street door - A. That is in general left open when I came home. I am not a married man. I returned a little after ten; I found the street door open.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find the door of your room - A. Locked, as I expected it to be.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the room, did you find the things as you expected them to be - A. No, the covering of two beds were tied up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there two beds in that room - A. Yes, and the covering of the two beds were tied up; it was all level upon the bed when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any body in the room; is Shorter here - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever had done this, had they taken any thing away with them - A. No, only removed them, and tied them up. One of my lodgers came, and informed my sister that my room had been broken open; I run off as hard as I could; this was half after ten that I received the information. This room that I left at two o'clock, I slept in, and worked there; I did not go into the room until I had the information, and instead of going up stairs, I went to the side front window of the one pair; I could see the window was shut of the one pair. My sister cried out to me Tom, he is coming out of the window; I saw the prisoner about half out of the window of that room that I found my things tied up in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any body in that room when you found the things tied up - A. I saw the prisoner come out of the one pair of stairs window; he slid all the way down on the tiles, and when he came down, he fell on the stones; I and my brother run up and secured him before he could rise off the stones.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110051"/>Q. Did you afterwards go up to your own room door, and see how your window was - A. Then I went for an officer; when I went for the officer the officer was not at home; and when I came back the prisoner was rescued, and had got into his landlord's house opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before - A. Yes, he is a bootmaker, and in the course of ten minutes or of a quarter of an hour, we got him again. I think he went into the room with a false key, the lock was not injured at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the bedding altogether - A. About thirty-eight shillings.</p>

I went to spend my Christmas at the same place with Satchell. At five o'clock I returned to the room, I found every thing safe. Then the bedding was in its proper place, it was dark at that time, there was no day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear that any thing was amiss in your room - A. At half past ten, at the same time that Satchell did. When I came there the bed clothes were tied up in one bundle on the ground, and the other bundle tied up on the bed. When I left the room at five o'clock, the bed was laying as it would do as I left it at half past two o'clock, it was not tied up in a bundle then, that was done by somebody without my knowledge.</p>

            . I am a lodger to Mr. Satchell, I lodge in the two pair, in the room over my landlord. About half past nine I was sitting quiet by the fire, I heard a key go into Mr. Satchell's door; my door was a-jar. I heard a noise as if a key was going in his lock, I heard the key go in a very slow manner, I took my candle, and called at the top of the stairs. I went out on the landing, and called out who is there? Nobody answered, I saw nobody, nor saw no light. The key had been put in more gently than ever I heard Mr. Satchell put it in. About ten oclock I had occasion to go out to the chandler's shop, and on my returning, going up stairs past my landlord's door, I heard a latch go up, whether it was up stairs or down stairs I cannot say; it was within side of my landlord's room, I thought it was within side of my landlord's room, I thought it was an old man; I knocked at the door, and said, who is here? No answer was given. I said to the old man, as I thought it was, you are not so deaf but you hear me, I tried the latch, and the latch seemed forced against me. I then know there was some one in the room that had no right to be there. I knew there was a dog in the room; I said to the dog, you mind! I run out of my landlord's house, and gave information. I saw the prisoner sliding down the tiles when I returned from giving my landlord the information.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner. I found the bundles tied up in Satchell's room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in liquor when this happened. On Christmas morning my master sent me a pair of shoes to do; I promised my master I would get them done on the day following; he told me to borrow a last of Mr. Shuter, I drank freely indeed that night with an acquaintance, I was very much intoxicated; I did not lose my recollection; I knew I had these shoes to make; the liquor took that effect on me, I knew it would make me ill on the day following. I considered I should not be able to make the shoes, I thought of getting Shuter to assist me in making the shoes against the next morning. I went up to the room, and knocked at the door, the door was opened by an old man; I asked him if Shuter was at home; he said, no, if I wanted him he would go and fetch him. The man went out, and whether he locked the door or no I cannot say; I went in and fell asleep; how long I was there I do not know; when I awoke I knew where I was. I really thought Shuter locked me in by way of a joke. I went to the door for the purpose of coming out; I raised the latch for the purpose of coming out. I felt the lock, there was no key in it. I then thought I would get out of the room as well as I could; as for entering the room for any robbery, I am as innocent as a child unborn. My prosecutor has worked for the same shop that I have worked; it is out of his power to say he ever knew any harm of me.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. When you went into the room about half past ten o'clock, had you a light with you - A. I did not go into the room myself, until after he was gone to the Compter, and when I went into my room, I found the things tied up, nobody had been in the room before me. There was no person in the room when I went in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I have got four children besides the twins, six in all I have had. The twins were born in the week after Bartholemew Fair, in September, and then I had four children alive besides them. I lost one of my twins. One day I was sitting in St. Paul's Church-yard; the prisoner came up to me; I only had sit there two days, She came up to me, and gave me a penny; she said, poor woman, you have got two fine babies. I said yes; she then said, you do not seem to get much money here; if you will go along with me. I will take you to a fine lady that will give you half a guinea. I walked with her, I took notice of her person; I saw there was a tooth out on the right side of her upper jaw, pock marked, and dark eyes. She had a reddish spotted gown on. I walked along with her, I was carrying both the twins; in Cheapside, the wind blew my cloak off the babies, my child of five years old was following me, I asked the prisoner to put the cloak over the babies, for fear they should get cold, She offered to carry one of them; I yielded to give her the biggest of the twins into her arms. We went into the Commercial road, and she kept close to me all the way, until I got to the Commercial road at the corner of a public house. She put her hand into her pocket, and gave me three pence, and told me to get a pint of beer; I told her I did not want beer or gin, I wanted to see the lady. She said, my dear woman, I'll not be long from you, I will go and shew this fine lady this twin. I followed her up a court, I kept sight of her until my child of five years old fell over a heap if bricks. I turned round to see whether my little girl was coming after me, I went and picked up my child, and when I turned back again, the prisoner had turned the corner out of my sight directly, I did not see her again for six weeks. This happened on the 14th of October, about three o'clock; then I screamed out; I searched about for my child from three o'clock in the afternoon until seven. When I lost the child, the child had on a striped cotton bed gown, a shirt, a flannel cap, and a cotton light bonnet. When I saw the prisoner again, I knew she was the woman that took the child from me; I saw her on board a ship; I wanted to have a kiss of my child; the sailor that was with her would not let me kiss my child; the sailor is here to day; the officer took tho child and the woman into custody. My child had not on the same clothes as I left with it; I undressed the baby at the public house for the first time again; I found my piece of flannel on it. I told the prisoner that was my piece of flannel. I claimed it in the hearing of the prisoner and in the hearing of the officer. I had handbills printed; I gave description of the baby and the prisoner, and I went to Lambeth-street office.</p>

The prosecutrix was in a boat along<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110054"/>side of the ship. The prisoner seemed very much confused; said it was her own child; that when she came to London she would shew me the room where she was delivered on a Friday, six weeks before that very day. On the 26th of November she had been taken bad in the Minories, a young woman came by and took her to her room, where she was delivered, the young woman took her to her room in White Rose Court, Rosemary Lane. She said her name was Mary or

The prisoner said she lived in Bly's buildings, Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street, that she went out of her mother's room at three o'clock, and went home to her mother at five o'clock the same day. She went home in a coach; she lived in the same house with her mother in the room above her; she said the name of the father of the child was Swaine. I assisted Mrs. Cremer up the side of the ship; she said that is my child before she saw it. I heard the child cry likewise as well as Mrs. Cremer. She said before she saw it that is my child. When Mrs. Cremer saw the prisoner, she would have struck her had not I interfered; she said that is my child, and that is the woman that stole it. The description in the handbill corresponded with the prisoner very much but as to age. On the next day I went to White Horse Court, Rosemary Lane; there is twenty houses or more in the court.

We came out of the public-house together; the prisoner stepped back, I received a violent blow at the Dundee Arms, I fell directly, then I felt his hand under my jacket, and when I went home I missed my pocketbook; I made an alarm that I was robbed; I went to go into another public-house, they would not let me come in for fear I should say I had been robbed there.</p>

            , On the 22nd of December, I lost a five shilling paper of penny pieces and halfpence they were in my pocket, I put my basket down at he public-house door; I took the last fowl out of my basket to carry in doors, two persons followed me in, they turned out, one of them went to my basket and took out the five shilling paper of copper, out of my basket, and then kicked it upside down; I pursued him, and took him; a paviour at work in the street, when I came into the street, said to the old man that man has robbed your basket; I said, yes, I saw him; the paviour went, and where the prisoner stooped down he found my five shilling paper of copper money; this is it, it is mine.</p>
               <p>- I am a paviour, I saw the old man set his basket down at the public house door; the prisoner and another man followed him in, the prisoner came out, he took a five shilling paper out of his basket. I kept my eye upon the prisoner, I saw him stoop down at a fence, I went to the spot, and took up the five shilling paper of halfpence.</p>

            . About the 13th or 14th of December, I apprehended the prisoner. I searched his lodgings; I there found a quantity of feathers, knives, and forks, sheets, and crockeryware. I then discovered that Mr. Nott had another lodging; there I found some ale that belonged to a brewer. I found at another lodging of the prisoner, there I found some cards of Nott's addressed to ladies, concerning fortune telling; I searched three lodgings of the prisoner's, and found Mrs. Bishop's property in them. I produce the property, all but the crockery-were; I have not brought that for fear of breaking them.</p>

               <p>LOUISA SMITH. I was engaged as a servant to Mr. Nott, the day before he took the house in Han's Place. I had the care of the house to do everything there was to do. He sent for a few things out of the house while he was in Newgate. I do not think he did it with any dishonest motive.</p>

               <p>Q. How came the feathers out of the house - A. The feathers were never in the house; there were no feathers taken out of the house as I know of the beds in the garret had a great many holes in them, and were pinned up on one side. I left the house on Monday the 5th of December; Mr. Nott sent a bed back from Newgate, because he would not dirt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110058"/>it, I lived with Mr. Nott in Park Place as his mistress; but I parted with him, and became his servant in Han's Place.</p>
               <p>Gillmore. I have brought a sample of feathers from Mrs. Bishop's bed they correspond with the feathers I found in the prisoner's lodging.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have compared the feathers; they correspond; they were taken out of two of the best beds; they are goose feathers; the beds in the garret had no holes in them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These feathers were never in Mrs. Bishop's place at all.</p>

            . I am bailiff to his Grace the Duke of Devonshire. The deer got his leg broke; I shot it, and skinned it in the slaughter-house; the slaughter-house is in the yard, and all the premises are within the Park fence. Badsey is a labourer employed on the premises. On the 21st, I went into the slaughter-house, and missed it. The officer found part of a deer at Mrs. Crystall's, the hind quarter; I knew that part of the deer, where the accident happened, because there was a deal of concealed blood on the part where the leg was broken; I knew it again, because I dressed it; the body was worth ten shillings.</p>
               <p>ELI STEADHY. I went to Mrs. Crystall's house, just at he back of the Pack horse, Turnham Green, where the prisoner lodged, about a mile from the Park; I there found haunch of venison. On the 27th of December, I apprehended the two prisoners at Acton, in Middlesex; I took them up on suspicion of stealing the carcase of a deer, and when I found the deer; they came in the house, they said, they were not guilty of any thing of the kind; they said they were innocent.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SMITH. I am chief mate of the brig Commence; John Mudie is the master; the ship was delivering her cargo at the London Dock. On the 14th of December last, Davis was a seaman delivering the cargo on board: about half past twelve at noon, I was upon deck, I was looking down the hatchway, I saw Davis between the decks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110059"/>where he chest of opium lay; I went down towards where he was; I saw him stoop of one side; he appeared to be secreting away something, and their I asked him what he was doing there; he told me he was looking for a ball of spun-yarm; he came out with a ball of spun-yarm in his hand, and went upon deck; I immediately went to the same place that he came from, and found a ball of opium; I looked at the case of opium; it appeared to have been fresh broken, about a yard off from the place where Davis stooped down, and there was one ball of opium taking out of that case; he was stooping at that very ball where I found the opium. I compared the ball of opium I found under the sail, to the balls in the chest; that ball appeared to fill up the vacancy in the chest, which I saw had been plundered.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of opium that you found - A. About a pound and a quarter; the ball of opium is not here; I put in the case again.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the morning of the 29th of December, I heard two strange voices on the stairs; I live on the first floor; I go out of bed, and asked who was there; two men answered me. I asked them what they wanted; one of them answered that Mr. Barnett had sent them for his watch; I opened the door a little a jar, and gave the men my husband's watch; the star case was dark; I cannot speak to either of the two men.</p>

               <p>JOHN CARLISLE. I am an officer. On last Wednesday week I happened to be at the watchhouse in Coweross, the prisoner was brought in on suspicion of stealing a barrel. The next night I saw the prisoner, by Peter's Lane. I tapped at the watch-house, asked the officer how the man got on that was in for the barrel. He said he got off. I said, He goes, with a piece of wood on his shoulder. They came out of the watch-house, and went after. He asked him where he got that; he said he it. The officer took him to the watchhouse, and or three minutes Mr. Pearcy came into the watchhouse and claimed the piece of wood. He said it was for a shoemaker's cutting board.</p>
               <p>- HUDSON. I was officer of the night. I went out and apprehended the prisoner with this board on his shoulder; he told me he bought it of a man in the street. I said that is the same story you told me last night. He said yes, he bought this board and the barrel in the same way. This is the cutting board. Mr. Pearcy came to the watchhouse, and owned it.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The cutting board is mine; this is my mark on it.</p>

            . I am a timber rafter. On the 9th of January I was at Black-wall. I went through the Folly House; and on my going through the upper gate, I saw the prisoner on the timber. As soon as he saw me, he put his bag on his shoulder, and walked off; I walked up on the timber, and missed a piece of rope; cut off. I asked the prisoner what he had got in his bag; he put his bag down, and said he had only got a few pieces of rope that he had picked up on the timber. I said, I was look as it. I opened the bag, and found the rope cut in short pieces. I then said you have cut the rope off the timber; he said, I have not shoved any of your timber knife. I took him into the Folly-house-yard, and sent Mr. Bilgdon's son for an officer. This is the rope, it is all cut in pieces.</p>

I am one of the Bow-street patrols; on the 6th of December, about half-past six at night I and Dickens were walking through Islington, we met the prisoner; I saw him with a bag on his back I asked him what he had got, he said, what he had got, was his own; he said he had got three quarter loaves and some potatoes. I thought it was a large bulk for that; I took him into a green grocers shop there, Dickens followed him in, I holding of the prisoner and when he turned out the bag I saw two bee-hives; we handcuffed him and took him to the office. Dickens and me went to Mr. Nicholsons; we saw the garden were they were stifled with brimstone.</p>

               <p>ROBERT CAVE. On the 7th of December, between twelve and one at noon, me and my brother officer were coming down Holborn; we observed two men standing at a door or two off a cheesemonger's shop; they stood there about two or three minutes; one of the men took the cheese, put it under his apron, and ran off; Wilson ran after the man with the cheese; the man dropped the cheese, I picked it up with one hand, and took the prisoner with the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Holborn; a man came and asked me where Brownlow-street was; I told him. This gentleman came and took me; the cheese I never lad in my hand, nor did I see it until I saw it in the gentleman's hand.</p>

               <p>RICHARD WESTBROOK. On the 10th of December, I had been into Tottenham-court-road; as I was returning home, I saw the two prisoners at the top of High-street; I heard Bates say if it had not been for these two men, we should have had it; I walked towards the church; Bates followed me. I saw the two prisoners look into Mr. Harvey's shop window; I saw Bates come down to Mr. Harvey's shop window another man came up. Bates then went to Robinson at the top of the street. Bates came down to the shop again, unhooked the coat; the other, Robinson, came and took the coat away. I then went and apprehended the two prisoners. This is the coat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to the coat being my property, it is worth twenty-five shillings.</p>

On the 4th of January, I met the prisoner in the street, I took her with me into the public-house; I got very groggy, and then I went home with her, and went to bed; when I awoke, I missed my pocket-book, It contained five; five-pound bank notes. The prisoner's landlord searched the prisoner, found on her my pocket-book, and the money. I was so drunk, I do not know whether I gave it her to keep till the morning.</p>

            . I am an headborough of Islington parish, on the 1st of December, between three and four in the afternoon, I was out of an errand, I saw all the four prisoners together; I had suspicion of them; I went home with the article that I had gone out for, and then returned and watched them: I saw Sheffield take a pair of gaiters from the prosecutor's window; the other prisoners stood forty or fifty yards distance. After he had taken them off the hook, he went up to the other prisoners. I went to apprehend the prisoners; I apprehended Sheffield, the other three of them, run away from me. When I apprehended Sheffield, he shoved his hat off his head; one of the other prisoners took his hat up, and ran away with it, with the gaiters in his hat. When the other three prisoners were pursued, one of them dropped the gaiters; we picked them up. These are the gaiters.</p>

I matched this pipe with the pipe; it appeared to be cut off at Mr. Goodhugh's; it matched exactly. Mr. Hill said he paid for the pipe that had been fixed there. The lead is worth fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night of the 17th of December I was in the Edgeware-road, a man asked me to carry this bag to York Mews; he said he would pay me for carrying it there. The watchman took me and the bag to the watchhouse.</p>

I perceived he walked aukwardly; I went after him, and brought into the yard, and told him to go into the accompting house.

            . I agreed that he should go with me, Matthews and Wood, the two officers, to the prisoner's house. Mr. Hodges went in first; Matthews and Wood followed. I went in after the officers. When I went in I saw Matthews the officer with a basket of articles; he was stopping a little girl with the articles close to the parlour door; I looked at the property in the basket, I knew it to be mine. I told the prisoner he knew it was my property, there were my marks upon some of them. The prisoner replied, yes, master, I know it is your property, I know your marks as well as yourself. He stated that a man left them there that owed him a score; I said, what a pretty rascal you must be not to let me know of it. I asked him the man's name; he said the the man would no disclose his name, he lived some where over in the Borough. We searched the house, and found nothing else than what was in the basket.</p>

               <p>GEORGE HODGES. I live at Petonville I have been a sadler and a harness maker. On the 12th of December I called at the prisoner's house to enquire after the former landlord that kept the house. I never had any knowledge of the prisoner before.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came there did you find any whipcord - A. The prisoner told me if I was in the trade he would let me have some reasonable, and some sadler's nails and bridle buckles. He offered me these things for sale. He asked me three shillings a pound for the whipcord, the buckles and nails he left entirely to me to fix the price. This raised a suspicion in my mind; I afterwards went to Mr Armstrong's shop, and told him what had taken place. It was agreed that he and I should go there on the following Thursday, with some officers. This was on Sunday. On the Thursday I went there with Mr. Armstrong. I went in first for an introduction for the property to be produced. He told me if I would wait he would produce the property. A few buckles in a basket were brought forward; he called me in and said, he would go up stairs and fetch more. Then the officers and Mr. Armstrong came in, and the little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110065"/>girl with the basket. I never had seen that basket before. It contained whipcord, buckles, sewing hemp and nails; the basket was shewn to Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Armstrong said to the prisoner, John, they are my property, and you know my private marks. The prisoner said he knew the private marks as well as he did; and that a man who lived in the Borough had left them there for a score; he said he did not know his name.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the situation of the prisoner's house - A. Yes, it is in the county of Middlesex. On Thursday, the 17th of December, Mr. Hodges sent into the prisoner's house first. I and Wood, and Mr. Armstrong, followed in a little time; I found the prisoner and Mr. Hodges in the parlour; I went into the parlour; Wood went up stairs to search the house. While I was in the parlour I saw the prisoner's daughter coming out of the bar with this basket; I seized the basket and took it from her just as she got to the back door. I have kept the basket and its contents safe locked at the offices; it contains whipcord, buckles, and sewing line, and sadler's nails.</p>
               <p>Mr. ARMSTRONG. The whipcord in the basket has the writing of the manufacturer; the loose buckles have my own writing upon them. The whole of the property I have no doubt is mine; there is fifteen pound of whipcord, at six shillings a pound, and the value of the buckles is three pound twelve shillings. The property there altogether is worth eleven pounds.</p>

At night, as I was backing the carriage, the door flew open, and I went to look at the door. I saw one glass was gone. I have seen the glass since. I am sure it is my masters's glass.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Wednesday the 11th of January, in the morning, I saw the prisoner opposite to the Admiralty. He went to Cockspur-street; he then turned back, and went down Spring Gardens into St. James's Park. I went up to him, and asked him what he had got there; he said nothing. I took it from him; I said it appears to be a coach glass; he said it was, he was going to make a shilling or two for himself, being out of work. I took him to Bow-street office. I asked where he got it from; he said a man gave it him that morning, four miles this side of Croydon he said he did not know the man that gave it him, I have the glass ever since. This is the glass.</p>

            . I keep a linen draper's shop at Somer's town. On the 6th of December these two boys came into my shop; they told me they wanted to look at some handkerchiefs; they were not so well dressed then as they are now. Tilley pointed to a particular sort of handkerchief: I got up in a chair to reach it down; that handkerchief was above my reach, and when I got down off the chair, he ran out of the shop. Jones staid in the shop; I said to Jones, the other boy has got something that he ought not to have. He replied he was not that kind of a boy; I said, what could he run out of the shop in that ridiculous manner for. He said that was the nature of him; and while I was standing looking at the door,

             the officer brought the other boy back, until the officer brought him back I did not know that I had missed any handkerchiefs. The officer searched them, and found two handkerchiefs on each of them.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. On the 6th of December I was at the Seven Dials were a gang of these boys meet and set off from there; I followed Tilley and Jones to Tower-street, Sommer's town; Tilley took off his apron, and Jones put it on him. I knew them, they were going to do what they call work. I saw them both go into Mrs. Pile's shop; and, as Tilley come out, he was tucking something up under his waistcoat. I stopped him; he asked my pardon, he knew me well. I took him into the shop; I searched them, and found two handkerchiefs on each of them; these are the handkerchiefs. They had no money about them, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my handkerchiefs, the are worth a shilling each.</p>

My shop is a mason's shop. My sister saw him on the first floor and tried to lay hold of him, he passed her, and got into the shop, and then he pushed her down, and got into the street, and was taken immediately. I am the sole owner of the house; my sister is not in partnership with me; I have a lease of the house; it was my mothers's trade, it has come to me; I have the whole property in the house. Nothing was taken away. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I live at Milford. I supply Mr. Peters's horses with hay. On the 6th of December, I received of the prisoner sixteen shillings and threepence.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the two bills that purports to be yours - A. Neither of them bills are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he actually pay you on the 6th - A. There is three shillings more than he actually paid for. He was not at Milford on the 10th; I let him have four trusses on the 9th; that was paid for on the 12th.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill dated the 10th - A. That is not my hand-writing; nor any part of the two bills; this hand writing is not the hand writing of any person that makes out my bills.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Brown. When the prisoner gave you these bills, did he say they were Mr. Ever's receipts - A. I did not ask him; they appeared to be receipts of Mr. Ever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ever. He never had any hay on the 10th, and the hay the horses had on the 9th, was paid for on the 12th. The prisoner never had any bill of me on the 10th.</p>
               <p>Brown. He charged sixteen shillings and threepence for hay the horses never eat, and there was a forgery in the next weeks bill.</p>
