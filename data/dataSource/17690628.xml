On the 8th of June as I was going to attend the funeral of a relation in London, my son followed and overtook me, and told me Old Mouse (that is a dark brown gelding of mine) was lost from out of the field where were five others. I sent him back to enquire at the turnpikes. As I came on I overtook the prisoner on my gelding at Hounslow. The prisoner formerly had lived with me about eighteen years ago. I had forgot him till he mentioned it to me. The gelding had a halter on, but no saddle; it was both a cart and riding horse, the value about 5 l. I took the prisoner before a justice, who there begged my pardon.</p>

We got up and found a window shutter taken down, and the sash broke, and one square of glass out. The window shutter was fast at out going to bed before eleven o'clock. I could not tell what was lost out of the window till afterwards, when I saw a bag of things which were taken out of the window. The watchman told us he had taken the thief, and a bag of things, which was gone to the watch-house. About nine in the morning it was brought to our house, and in it were the things laid in the indictment, which I knew to be my mistress's property.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 15th of June, between twelve and one, having been been my rounds, I hung up my lanthorn, and sat down: about five minutes after hearing some glass break, I went with my rattle, but left my lanthorn behind, towards the place: when I came within about forty yards of the White Horse I heard the glass break again; then I knew where it was. (This house had been attempted twice before, and I put them by.) By the reflection of the lamp I saw hands moving at the window, and heard glass break again. I advanced nearer, and saw hands go in and draw goods out. There were two men. I came within seven or eight yards of them: they saw me, and stood and looked at me as if they had an intent to attack me. I saw some goods hang out of the window, and some in a sack by the window. I gave a spring with my rattle, and they turned about and ran away. I pursued them both. They left all behind them. They both took one way. At last one wheeled about and went another way, but I followed the prisoner, and rattled still as I ran. He ran into a yard, formerly the manor house in Finsbury. I stopped the gate. Another watchman came immediately. I said, Stand at the gate, I know where he is. Then another came. Two of us went in: then I heard the prisoner jump down off the wall, which was ten feet high: he was got into a close place, about six or eight feet broad. I got over and took him in a vault. There was no way to get there, but by going over that wall, or through the house to which the vault belonged. We took the prisoner back over the wall, and to the watch-house. I knew the prisoner before, by seeing him about with a bad gang. He shammed as if he was asleep when I took hold of him. There were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280004"/> a couple of keys and a pack of cards found in that vault in the morning by the person that owns the vault. He was never out of my sight, when running, till after he got in at the gate of the yard. I found these two chissels (produced in court) about two hours after he was taken, hid in a corner near Artillery Court. We compared them to marks made in the window shutter, and found the marks were done by them.</p>

            . I am the constable. I was on duty betwixt the 15th and 16th of this instant in the watch-house, and heard the alarm given by Taylor with his rattle (it is in the same form with a child's rattle, which they swing round, only it makes a greater noise.) I ran out with two watchmen and the beadle, and made towards Mrs. Hubbard's house. I found this bag within three or four yards of her house, in the foot way, with the things that are now in it. I have had them in my custody ever since. (The goods laid in the indictment produced in court, and deposed to by Rutherford as the property of her mistress.) The watchmen were rattling as they ran to Taylor's assistance to this yard, which is about thirty or forty yards distance from Mrs. Hubbard's house, on the opposite side the way. When I came into the yard I saw Taylor, and another watchman or two. I heard Taylor say, He is gone over the wall, pointing to where a brick was fresh broke out. Taylor got over. Presently the prisoner came over, and Taylor after him. When the prisoner jumped down we secured him, and took him to the watch-house: then I went with Mr. Crowder the beadle to Mrs. Hubbard's with the bag. Her servant, which is now here, was very particular to every article.</p>

               <p>About seven or eight o'clock I went to the other end of the town to my uncle, coming home I came down Fleet-market, and went into a cook's shop, and bought some meat and a halfpenny-worth of bread; I went to a public house and eat it with a pint of beer. I staid there till about eleven o'clock, then came directly home to my mother's. I knocked at the door, and could make no-body hear. I did not know where to go to lie, searing I should be taken up as a disorderly person; then I thought it best to go over this wall and sit down in the necessary house. I did, and fell asleep. I had not been asleep long before this man came and awaked me. He laid hold of my collar, and said, you are the man that broke the window. I said, I know nothing of the matter.</p>

My wife, seeing the prisoner go out at the door, said a man was gone out with something under his coat. I followed him, and when he was on the other side the street I laid hold of his collar. I saw the tea chest, and said to him, How came you by these things? Not very honestly, said he. I said, Come back. He said, I am hanged! I am hanged! I am transported! I said I will not hang you. I took him back, and up stairs into the room where he took them from. He put the chest down from under his coat, and the Bible and bell from out of his pocket. (Produced and deposed to.) They were taken from a two pair of stairs room forward, where I lie. I asked him what business he had there; he said he had no business there at all, and was very sorry, and hoped I would not hang him; and that he would down on his knees if I would pardon him. When before the justice he owned he took the things.</p>

               <p>I pick up rags and broken bottles, and black shoes. I was coming by, and he called me names. I ran in after him. Then he said I stole the things. They were not about me. I must be very impudent to take away those things at that time of the day. I have got three children in England, and one in Ireland; and I lost the use of my sight at Leghorn. If I get a drop of beer, I am not my own man.</p>

I am a weaver, and live in Rose and Crown Court, Whitechapel. The prisoner worked with me. He followed weaving twenty years ago. When he came from sea, his eyes were so bad he could not see to bring in his threads right. He ought to be in Greenwich College, having served in four or five men of war.</p>

The prosecutor said that was his box ( Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) He had before told me he had lost a paper snuff-box, with other things. In the snuff-box were three shillings and sixpence, and a quarter guinea. Ingram said she found the snuff-box on the bed, in the other room.</p>

I came up to the prisoner, and saw part of a coat hanging out of his apron. I seized him by the collar, and asked him what he had got there; he muttered something, I can't say what. I told him he should carry the things back, to where he had them; but in leading him back, the mob was so great, that we were forced to take him into a public-house; (there was another man with the prisoner who made off;) we sent for an officer and the prosecutrix, and she owned the things.

The young woman that took us there asked us if we would have any thing to eat or drink, and said if we would get any thing, she would pay for it. We staid about half an hour; when we came down stairs the prisoner followed us, and asked us to go to a public house to drink. I said I had rather not, I rather chose to go home. We went to the corner of Honey-lane market to a public-house; presently<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280007"/> Litchfield came in. After that they both insisted on our going to some gardens. We told them we had rather go home, and desired they would not detain us. I told them my nearest way was down Cheapside; they told us the nearest way was through Newgate-market. When we came out, I requested they would let us go home. The prisoner begged I would not make myself uneasy, we should be at home by six o'clock; that he would go and have some tea, and we should go home directly after. I told the other young woman, that it was so far from our house, I would go home with her, and turned, thinking to get away, then they lugged me back and brought us away, and said we should go along with them. When we had gone a great way, we came into a road. I said I did not know where I was, and insisted on going no farther. The prisoner told us we were only going down this road; he brought us to a public-house, the sign of the Bull's head; this was when it was about dusk; there they said they intended to go a little farther, saying they could not have tea there. We insisted on going no farther, and that we would go home. Then the prisoner said we should go in there and have something; then he dragged me in, and called for a bottle of cyder. All the while we staid there I begged and intreated to go home. I was very uneasy. The prisoner insisted that we should not go. A man that was in the house said he would join company with us, saying he lived just by. They brought us into a little room. The prisoner said he could not drink cyder, he called for some beer; there were us four, and that other man. We staid a great while in the room. I insisted upon his letting us go; but he would not; he insisted I should drink, and I drank but a little of the cyder. I said I was very uneasy, and got upon the table to jump off to get out of the room; he dragged me down, and insisted that I should not stir, for he would see me home. When they came to pay, the prisoner came to me and asked me if I had any money, saying he had not money to pay the reckoning. I said I had none. Then he said he could not go, and if I would give him any he would go directly. I gave him eighteen-pence and two-pence, thinking to get away. He said that would not do, he must have a shilling more. I told him I had no more; then he said he could not go, he must stay longer. He said the reckoning came to three or four shillings. I told him I knew how much it came to, and if it came to more I must borrow it of

               <p>Q. Did he not return the rest of the money after he had paid the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Warnett. No, he did not. We proceeded out of the house, us four; the other man that joined us in the public-house did not go with us; there was a woman and two girls stood at the door as we came out, we asked them which was the nearest way to town; they told us, if we would go with them, they would put us in the nearest way. The prisoner dragged me away, and said we should not go with them, we should go with, him, and he would shew us the nearest way; he then dragged me down the road, and in the road he threw me in a ditch. I screamed out murder. I got out again, and he pulled me down in it again, and jumped down himself, and some how or other he got me out again. I went to scream out; he said if I did, he would cut my throat from ear to ear, or stab me. He dragged me along after that, and got me into a field. I said, Pray let me go home, for God's sake let me go home. He said, God d - n you, you b - h, can't you hold your tongue? If you will not, I'll cut your throat. He dragged me a great way up the field. I cried and screamed, and said, For God's sake let me go home, and when I come to London I'll go any where with you, thinking to get away; he dragged and forced me along. When we came a good way up the field, he asked Litchfield whether he would go any farther; he answered no, he would not; then the prisoner took and threw me down on some hay. I cried out, For God's sake only let me go. For God's sake take my life. Do any thing in the world with me, only let me go home. He d - d me for a b - h, and said if I spoke a word he would cut my throat.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you?</p>
               <p>Warnett. He put what he had into my body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do it by force?</p>
               <p>Warnett. He did. I cried and screamed, and strove as much as I could that he should not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the words what he had?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I mean his private parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280008"/>Q. Did you feel any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>Warnett. With the horror and fright I was in. I do not know whether I felt any thing come from him or no, I swear it was against my will and consent.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was this?</p>
               <p>Warnett. It was duskish. I do not know. After that he put his hand up my body. I cried and screamed, and said, O! for God's sake dont. He put his fingers in my body, and said if I did not hold my tongue he would cut my throat. He asked me whether I ever f - t. I told him I did not know what he meant by it. He said if I did not know what he meant, he would make me know before he left me. Then he put his private parts into me again. I cried and screamed, and begged him for God's sake to let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not feel something come from him?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I believe I felt something come from him then; but I was in such horror, I thought he would have killed me; with the fright, I am not certain. Litchfield called to him and asked him whether he had done with me. He said no; but he would lay in the field all night. I begged he would go home. He said he would not. He staid a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing to you after the second time?</p>
               <p>Warnett. Yes, he put his fingers up my body again. Litchfield called to him, and begged of him to come away. He said he would not. I begged he would let me go, and told him he knew I was an honest girl. He said, D - n his blood, he knew I was: for I had never known a man before, and he did not know what to do with me hardly. Litchfield came to him and begged he would come away. He said he would not. Litchfield took hold of him, and dragged him from off me. Litchfield bid me get up and come away: he had the other girl with him. With my fright I did get up; but hardly knew how. I begged of Litchfield to let me lay hold of his coat: my hat and cap were off, and Litchfield bid me put them on: they hung behind me. He bid me come along, and he said he would shew me the right way to London. The prisoner followed us.

             was along with me. We went around another field. Litchfield led me, and it brought us to some houses. I took it for a barn. I thought it was needless to call out to them houses, for I saw no body in them. They were new houses just doing up. When we got a little farther, I heard a coach go along; it past me in great speed: the prisoner was behind a hedge, but he came up to Litchfield and said, D - n your eyes, why did not you stop the coach? Now we might have got a good booty, and you have let it go. Did you ever see such a d - d fellow in your life! Litchfield said he did not think of it. We came on a little farther. I thought I saw a light (it was dark then). I saw a woman come to light some gentlemen out of a house. I was afraid to run to them, till I thought I could get up to them, fearing they should drag me away again. When I came so near that I imagined I could make my escape, I ran up to one of them, and laid hold of him; his name is Ham; he is here.

             asked which was the way to town. All the gentlemen said they were going to town, and if we liked to walk with them, we were welcome. I begged to speak to Mr. Ham first. He went into the public-house, and I followed him in: I kept hold of him all the time

             went in. Mr. Ham and the other said they thought it was only men and their wives quarrelling, and said we must come in and drink, and make it up. The prisoner followed us in. I told Mr. Ham how I had been used by the prisoner. The others, Mr. Wooden and Mr. Thodey, were there also. I told them the same as I have here. The prisoner said I was a vile woman, that I had lived with him seven months, and that he had kept me seven months. The gentlemen said if it was so, they had no farther business to trouble themselves about it. I told them he was a vile man, and informed them who I was, and where I lived; that I came out of place but on Tuesday morning last; that I knew nothing of him, and had never seen him till that afternoon. Curtain said the same, and that she had not known the man till that afternoon. Mr. Ham said he would take it into consideration, and if we would charge them, and the woman of the house would send for a constable, they would secure them. Then the prisoner and Litchfield wanted to go away. A carpenter and another gentleman stood at the door to prevent their making their escape. The constable came in. I charged the prisoner. He told the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280009"/> constable I had lived with him fourteen months; but that gained no credit. When they heard he differed in his story, they all thought he was in the wrong. Then the prisoner said he had a wife, and she was a little jealous of him, and he kept me private, because she should not know any thing of it. They were both taken into custody. The constable said, the prisoner must have his hands tied, he having made a resistance. He was very obstropulous. He said he was never tied in his life, they might take hold of him, and he would go with them; but if they would tie him, they must do it by force. They were obliged to lay him down all along on the floor to tie him. They were both taken to the watch house, and on the morning following, which was this day week, carried before Sir

               <p>Q. What place in this Bull-Head at?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the prisoner and you very familiar in the Compter?</p>

               <p>Warnett. No, not that where they used us so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make all the resistance you could when he threw you down on the hay?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I did. I begged and intreated him to let me go, and cried out murder, and he stopt my mouth with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. After his throwing up your petticoats, how long was it before he got into your body?</p>

             doing at the time?</p>
               <p>Warnett. The other man was laying with her at the same time. My spirits were so far gone, that I was forced to resign to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make resistance the second time?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I did; but not so long as the first. My strength was quite spent. I was quite gone. I was afraid they would murder me. They had a dog, and I was afraid he would set the dog upon us to kill us.</p>

               <p>Warnett. That was the Nag's Head. They told us it was leading to Hackney. We had come a good way before we came to that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your home?</p>
               <p>Warnett. My home is on Saffron-hill, at Mrs. Winter's, in Blue-Court. I lodged there after I came out of place.</p>

            . The first time I saw the prisoner was last Thursday was week. We were at the Mansion-house: we walked from thence to Wood-street Compter. There I saw Litchfield and the prisoner. From thence we went to a public-house in Honey-lane market, and had some beer. The prisoner begged of us to go there, and Litchfield came in after us. Then she was for going home to tea; the men said we should go to some gardens to drink tea along with them. We told them we had rather go home; but they insisted upon it we should go with them. Then we went all down Bishopsgate-street, and never stopt till we came to the public-house in the road. In going along,

             turned down a lane, and the prisoner dragged her back. I really do not know whereabouts that lane is. The prisoner took hold of her arm, and Litchfield laid hold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280010"/> of mine; they bid us not be uneasy, for we should be at home by six o'clock to drink tea. I aid that I did not like to take hold of a man's arm I did not know. We were carried to the Bull's Head, a public house; they wanted us to go a little farther, but we would not. They wanted us to go in there; we were not for that; but rather than go further, we went in just to drink, not thinking to stay. We went into a room. They called for a bottle of cyder; there was a gentleman joined our company there; he continued there till we came away. He told us he used the house, and that he lived just by.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might you stay at that house?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I fancy we might stay there about an hour, or an hour and a half. The prisoner sung, and that other man came in, and begged of him to sing. He sung a good many songs. We both got up, and immediately insisted upon going, and they said we should not, they would go presently, and would see us safe home. I rung the bell for the waiter to come and take the reckoning. The prisoner sent him away, and said he did not want to go; he would have another pot of beer. I said, You may have as many pots of beer as you will; but we will go. The gentleman said he should sing another song. Warnett paid the reckoning. She got upon the table to come away, and the prisoner pulled her off the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Curtain. She gave the prisoner the money to pay. He asked her for money to pay; she said she had none. Then he said he had none, and he must leave his coat to pay the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay any part of the money?</p>
               <p>Curtain. No, she gave me money to pay. When we went out of the house, a woman and two girls were standing at the door: we asked her the way to London, she told us she was going to London, and she would shew us. The men told us that was not the way, they were going right, and they would shew us: they took us quite the wrong way. They took us into a road we knew nothing of. We said that was not the road we came. We begged they would take us to the right road. When we got down a lane, the prisoner dragged

The prisoner pulled her out of the ditch, and I saw him throw her in again the second time, and he pulled her out again a second time; after that they swore if we did not go along with them into the field, they would cut our throats.

She got up, and begged she might lay hold of Litchfield's coat: he said she might; and bid her put on her cap; which she did; and we went away, and left the prisoner lying down in the field. We did not meet with any body till we got into the road but a gentleman's coach. The prisoner, who was following us, stooped down under a hedge: after the coach was gone by, the prisoner said to Litchfield, Blast your eyes! why did you not stop that coach? Now we might have had fifteen or sixteen guineas. Litchfield said, I did not think about it. We walked a great way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280011"/> before we could see any body, for the value of a quarter of an hour, till we came to the road; then Molly Warnett told me she saw a light: I bade her hold her tongue, for we should see somebody presently: just as I spoke the word, a gentlewoman was lighting some people out of a house. We ran to them as soon as we could, but was afraid to speak to them too soon, fearing they should prevent our making our escape. The gentleman that I ran to is named Thodey.

               <p>Q. What time might it be when you got to the ditch that she was in?</p>
               <p>Curtain. It must be almost nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How old were the children that were with the woman at the public house door?</p>
               <p>Curtain. One seemed to be about nine years old, and the other not so big.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you resist, when they dragged you along?</p>
               <p>Curtain. We stopped two or three times, but they pulled us along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go by any stiles?</p>
               <p>Curtain. Yes, one. I stooped under it. I do not know whether Warnett went over or under it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she mean by saying there was a man in the field?</p>
               <p>Curtain. She called out to me, in order to have that man to assist us; but I saw no man. I said, There is no man, what shall we do!</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from her when she was upon the hay?</p>
               <p>Curtain. She was on the same hay that I was. She then called out, For God Almighty's sake, let me get up! let me go home! I was on the other side the hay-cock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak that aloud?</p>
               <p>Curtain. She did; a great deal louder than I do now. She cried out all the time she was upon the hay, and he bid her hold her tongue, or he would cut her throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see her lying?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I could; it was a little cock of hay, such as haymakers make in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been out of place?</p>

We were crossing the road very near the public-house. The girls slew to us and asked the way for Holborn. We said we were going to town. The girls desired we would protect them, saying these two men had used them very ill, and threatened their lives. We went into the public-house. They told their story before the landlord and landlady. The landlady advised to send for a constable. We sent for one. He came.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the girls tell you had been done to them?</p>
               <p>Wooden. The women told us that they had used them very barbarously, and that they had lain with them by force, and threatened to murder them. They desired we would secure the men and not let them go: they were greatly afraid the men should get away. They appeared in great confusion, and cried very much. Warnett cried the most. We thought proper to secure the men. The prisoner said he would not be tied, unless we did it by force. I believe he offered to strike. He was seized by Mr. Thodey, who got him down, and we tied his hands, and then tied the other man and him together. The prisoner behaved very desperate. He said he had taken a lodging for Warnett in Purpool-lane, where she had lived seven months. He called her a cruel jade for saying he used her ill. She said she came out of place but the Tuesday before from Mr. Alexander's in Shoe-maker-row.</p>

They seemed very much frighted. They said they had been badly used. We went into the Nag's Head. They told us that the prisoner and Litchfield had used them both very ill in the field. We thought at first they had been some prostitues: we could nto think otherwise; but when we came to hear how they had threatened the girls lives, and how they had used them, that they had thrown Warnett into a ditch several times, and had lain with them both, an officer was sent for, who took charge of them.

I examined her other parts, and found her body was inflamed and torn; that is, her private parts. I observed her linen, and saw she had been used indecently. If she had not been debauched, there would not have been what I saw. I asked her her age; she said seventeen. I said, It is very odd to me a person of your age should be in this condition. She said, That was done with his fingers. He has torn me. I have examined her since, and I found that appearance on her thighs was gone. I asked if she had drank any thing that occasioned such an inflammation. I was told she drank nothing but tea and water.</p>

               <p>Q. to Wooden. Did the girls appear to be in liquor?</p>
               <p>Wooden. No, they did not; we all of us took particular notice that they were sober.</p>

               <p>When I first saw this woman in the Compter, she was drin king with another woman and a young fellow that I went to see that was in a little trouble: we came into private discourse. We agreed to go into Honey-lane market to drink a tankard of porter, afterwards they desired me to take a walk into the fields. I said I could not go conveniently. I wanted to go home about business. Litchfield paid for the</p>
               <p>porter. We agreed to go together. We went very pleasantly together. I know nothing of the house we were at. I had no money. I said I had much rather go back again. We had five or six pots of porter and cyder, and brandy. There was a gentleman there. I sung three or four songs. I took her round the neck and kissed her as I would my wife. She was all the same as my wife, as agreeable as if she had been my wife. Going over the fields, I remember I saw a man in the hay-cock. I said, My dear, will you sit down a bit? she said, No. Going on a little farther, running and playing with the other young woman, they fell down in the hay-cock; we played with them. I lay with her; she was rather tightish. She was as agreeable to it as I was. I never threw her into any ditch, nor never was in a ditch with her, When we came up Hackney-road, we had agreed to take a room and live together. I was for going home; but they asked us to go in and drink at the Nag's-head. We drank with them in the house. I did not observe their talking to the gentlemen before they went into the house, and when they found we would not go with them, they gave charge of us. The woman was as generous and free as ever I lay with my wife in my life. I am a glazier and painter by trade.</p>

            . I am a slender acquaintnce of the prisoner's. I saw him on that Thursday between five and six-o'clock at the Bull-Head at Haggerstone: there was another man and the two girls with him. I was in the yard when they first came in. Then I came into the room where they were. I heard the prisoner sing. I thought it was very agreeable. He sung a good song. I took my beer and went and sat down facing him in the same box. One of the gentlewomen seemed to be found of my nosegay. I gave it her. She put me out a glass of cyder. They were very jocose together. We went into another room by ourselves to hear the ladies sing. They sang a little bit of a song, which was very agreeable. There was nothing but modesty on both sides. The girls did not appear to be there against their wills, but far from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner kiss the young women?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I did not. I was with them as near as I can guess about four hours. We had three pots of beer together. The girls went out into the yard, and when they came in again, they each of them took their place. I paid for three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280014"/> pints of beer, and I believe the prisoner paid part, and the other man the rest; but I cannot be positive of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the girls pay any money?</p>
               <p>Jackson. The girls paid no money; there was no occasion for that. I settled my reckoning and went about my business. They were up at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of the girls getting on the table?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, there was no getting on the table; there was no fear of that; there was no attempt to go away, nor no dragging.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner take his money from when he paid?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He took it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask the young woman to lend him any money?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I saw nothing of that.</p>

               <p>Jackson. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not the girls press several times to go?</p>
               <p>Jackson. They did press to go; but nobody held them.</p>

            . About five o'clock, or between five and six, that afternoon, the two girls and two men were in a hay-field belonging to Mr. Bocock at Haggerstone. The prisoner was one of them. When we had made the hay-cocks up, they tumbled them about; tumbling one another on the cocks.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might they be going cross the field?</p>
               <p>Murrel. They might be a quarter of an hour. We called to them not to tumble the hay. I saw them go out of the field to the Bull. I went in at the Bull after that, and sat down, and had a glass of cyder. I heard the man sing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the women sing?</p>
               <p>Murrel. No, I did not. I staid there I believe an hour, and came away between seven and eight o'clock. One of the women went out to make water in the yard; then she came in and called the other out; then they both came in, and sat down by the men again. They were willing to sit down and abide by the men. They were as agreeable as the men were. I could not tell whether they were not man and wife. There were twenty or thirty of us in the field. If the women had a mind to get away, they had opportunity enough; there was nobody hindered them.</p>

            . I am a journeyman breeches maker. I have known the prisoner two or three years by drinking with him. I never heard a bad character of him. I was going to Rosemary Lane with a pair of breeches, on the Thursday before last, when I saw a mob before the Mansion-house. I went in there. I saw these girls. They said to me, What are those fellows here for? I said I did not know: I suppose for a robbery. After that I went to Wood-street Compter. I was up stairs eating bread and butter. Those two girls came there. Warnett asked if any body could get them any victuals. She gave me a shilling, and I went down, and into Honey-lane market, and got some, and ordered a pot of beer up; they asked the prisoner, Litchfield, and me to eat some; they both eat and drank: then the girls went down stairs, and the prisoner and Litchfield went into the tap-room; but what they had to drink I cannot say, they proposed going to drink tea somewhere. I will not say downright the girls asked the prisoner to go to White Conduit House. Then they went to an ale-house at the corner of Honey-lane market. I went and drank with them there. They appeared very agreeable there. I went away, and did not see them go out of the ale-house.</p>

             to the Mansion-house on business of my own, and from thence to the Compter; then to a public-house in Honey-lane market, and from thence to the Bull's Head; and from thence I apprehended we were going home. The prisoner and Brooks were with us. We went along a lane, where Brooks catched hold of the other young woman; then I ran from them a great way. I apprehended they were designing to do us some injury. Litchfield ran after me and brought me back by force. I cryed out, and he swore if I spoke he would kill me. He brought me into a field: I saw Warnett and Brooks before me, they were both down in a ditch when he brought me back. Litchfield said, Now, you b - h, go after the other, and d - d me. Before that he had unbuttoned his breeches in the lane, and bid me take hold of what he had. I told him I would do any thing in the world, so that he would let me go. They got out of the ditch, but Brooks threw her in again: then I had got up to them. Litchfield had then hold of me by the arm, pulling me after her. He swore if I did not go along with her, he would cut my throat. I begged of him to let me go home; he swore we should not. I said, Did we think of your using us in this manner when we were in the public house? (meaning at the Bull-head.) He dragged me a great way up the field. It was dark. I said, Could not you as well take us up half the field, as to drag us all this way?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by that?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I was so frighted, I did not know what I said. He threw me down upon the haycock: this was a hay field where they had been making hay.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do when he threw you down?</p>
               <p>Speak the truth, nobody will think ill of you for speaking the truth.</p>
               <p>Curtain. He entered my body.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he enter your body?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He pulled up my petticoats, and unbuttoned his breeches, and entered my body with his private parts, against my will and consent. I cryed out, but he swore if I spoke he would cut my throat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he threw you down was it before he entered your body?</p>
               <p>Curtain. A good while. The other called to him, and asked if he had f - d me. Litchfield said No. D - n her, she never was f - d before. I cannot. He continued his attempt till I felt him in my body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did. I struggled, and did all in my power to prevent him, but he kept me down, and tired me till I had no strength. After that we went away, and found assistance from the gentlemen that appeared on the other trial. We craved their assistance, and they took us into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined by the midwife?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I was. Mrs. Ham examined me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner attempt your body after this?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He did. But I cannot tell rightly whether he did enter my body a second time or not, I was in such a fright.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your story to the gentlemen at the Nag's head the same as here?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did. And the same before the justice the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Litchfield in Newgate since?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did. The woman where I lodge told me what a dreadful thing it was to have a man hang'd for me: she desired me to go and speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280016"/>Curtain. She never saw him in her life. I went, his wife was there; she said she had been seeking me all the day. I stood just by the gate; she said she would be very glad if I would stay till she came out. He told his wife there is the young woman. I thought I saw him through the rails, but I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's father.</p>
               <p>Curtain. The prisoner's wife got me to some relation, it was not his father. When she begged of me to go, I said, I will not go till my sister knows of it. They said they would give me any thing in the world if I would make it up. I said I would not without my master's consent. I did not know the consequence of it. Mr. Lennell was my master. I lived a little time with Mr. Ryland, a copper-plate printer in the Old Baily, after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go through a hay field going to the Bull-head?</p>
               <p>Curtain. Yes. Brooks said that was the pleasantest way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the men play with you upon the hay?</p>
               <p>Curtain. Brooks said he would kiss

             on the hay, and he wanted to kiss me, but I got away from him. I did not tumble on the hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people call to you?</p>
               <p>Curtain. They called to Brooks. Litchfield did not insist upon it so much.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Litchfield behave at the Bull?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He behaved very civilly, for he never offered to kiss my lips there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean when you said to him, Could not you as well take us up half the field as to drag us all this way?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I thought he wanted to have his will of me, therefore I thought he might as well have his will half the way as to go so far, and I thought we should be nearer to people to hear us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think of that at that time?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go into the field?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I cannot recollect that; we were in the field an hour, or more, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the field before he entered you?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He did that in less than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he tried to persuade you to consent?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He said nothing to me before, but then he swore if I would not let him, he would kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I think he was very sober: he threw my hat by, and threw the hay about before he threw me down. I begged of him to go to the other young woman when the other fellow called; he called to Litchfield, and said, Have you done her once? Litchfield said, I have. Brooks said, Then blast your eyes, why don't you f - k her again? When he strewed the hay about, I was standing by the other young woman as she was struggling.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the road?</p>
               <p>Curtain. This was the length of a great field.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not run away?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I was afraid, they had two dogs with them, and I was afraid they would set the dogs at me. He went to hawl Brooks off, and Brooks said, No, blast your eyes, I will stay all night. Upon that Litchfield took hold of him and hawled him off; then she begged of Litchfield to take hold of her; he set her at liberty, and Brooks lay on the ground flat on his back, and did not stir for some time. I was told that I should say I would not hurt a hair of Litchfield's head, but I never said no such thing. I said I should be very sorry a person should be hanged on my account, but if he deserved it, I could not help it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have been willing to have made it up, if no harm had come to you?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not declared you spent that afternoon in a very agreeable manner?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I have declared so, only they would not let us go home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not declare you had spent the afternoon with as much pleasure as ever you had in your life?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did. They used us very well till that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said the prisoner had done you no harm, unless you should prove with child?</p>
               <p>Curtain. No. For the midwife told me I had got the foul disease, and I found myself very sore and much hurt.</p>

            . I examined Curtain on Friday the 23d, at the justices request at the rotation. I did not find at that time that there had been any violence offered, for the situation she was in, that attends women, prevented my making observations. I examined her last Wednesday again, I did not find any appearance that gave me room to think she had received any injury. I thought she did not appear to have been used<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280017"/> with any violence lately, but the discharge she had before might have taken off the inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath can you say whether she was a virgin or not?</p>
               <p>E. Ham. I will not venture to say she was, or was not I thought there was something of a little venereal complaint: there was something of a running, but I cannot answer what it could be.</p>
               <p>Q. How old do you take her to be?</p>
               <p>E. Ham. I should imagine her to be about eighteen. Whether the appearance I observed the second time was natural or by force, I cannot say.</p>

            . Last Thursday was a week, I saw Curtain first by the Nag's-head in Hackney road, about the hour of ten in the evening; there were, Mr. Wooden, Mr. Thodey and Mr. Dunkin with me; the last is not here: when we were coming out of the field it was pretty dark, being a wet night, when the girls came to us and begged we would give them a protection: they said they had been cruelly used by a couple of men. Warnett catched hold of me, and Curtain made up to another. Warnett said she had something to say. We did not seem to take much notice of them: we went into the house, and the girls and the two men followed us in. The girls told us they had been ravished in the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Curtain say she had been ravished?</p>
               <p>R. Ham. She did; that was, she said, by the prisoner at the bar. The prisoner desired me not to mind them, but said they had lived with them some time. The girls said they had never seen them before that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner mention he had lived with one of them?</p>
               <p>R. Ham. He did. Brooks said he had lived with one seven months. Curtain appeared very much frighted: they both cryed very much, and begged our assistance. There were two dogs with them, one with a collar about his neck, and Mellar upon it. Brooks said the dog was his. They were about the size of a spanniel. The prisoner behaved different from the other: the other said he would not be tied. I attended the justices the next morning Curtain told the same story there as she has now, and as she told us that night.</p>

The prisoner standing by me, and no body else near me, I said, Good woman, you have got my watch. She said she had not seen me. I felt in her bosom and felt a watch. I desired her to give it me, but she would not. I offered her a guinea to give it me. She snatched it out of my hand, and would not return either. Some company coming up, I saw her give the guinea to a man. I called the watch, and gave charge of the man and the prisoner, who were both carried to the watch-house. Before my Lord Mayor she denied all. The man was acquitted there. I am certain I had my watch in my pocket before I fell asleep.</p>

I asked to see what she had got, and pulled her apron down, and saw two sheets and two shirts. I called out, and said I was robbed! A constable was near.

I went out after him, up Church-alley,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280020"/> into Aldermanbury. He ran. I called, Stop Thief! He was stopped; and him and my boots were brought to me. He had taken them from about three yards within the shop door, where they hung. At first he denied taking them; but, at last, he said he was very sorry, and would make me amends.</p>

My wife can give a farther account.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Feild. I am wife to the prosecutor. After my husband was gone out, I heard the club room door move. I ordered my little boy to go up and see what the prisoner was about. He came down and said the prisoner at the bar had stole his dada's great coat. It was too big to be hid under his coat, for the flap of it hung out. I laid hold of it. He took and threw it out at the window, held up his fist at me, and got out: he made a full stop to take up the coat, but did not take it. I went out and called, Stop thief! He cried Stop thief! all the way he ran. He was taken in about two or three hundred yards. My child is about nine years old.</p>

            . I received this bill (holding one in his hand) the 23d of January, 1768, of Mr. Ive; it is for 98 l. 6 s. I saw the prisoner about two or three days after in our counting-house. He said he was very sorry he could not oblige me with an hundred pounds, but he had sent me a very good bill on Mr. Aked (that is this bill in my hand ). I believe I had not discounted it.</p>
               <p>Q. What day in January was this that you had this conversation with him?</p>
               <p>Fryer. It might be about the 26th. I never saw Mr. Alexander to my knowledge before. He told me he should not want it for some time. He applied to me the 29th of January, 1768, for 20 l. I let him have it. He applied to me the 1st of February for 20 l. more. I told him then I thought he did it to serve himself and not me, for it was of no service to me to come to me for the money so soon after. I imagined he would lend me the bill till it became due. He told me he had some particular payments to make, and he had been disappointed, but he should not come any more for some time. He came again on the 8th of February, then I let him have 30 l. more; that was 70 l. in all. I believe then I told him pretty much the same as I did the second time. He told me he wanted the money, and he must have it. He applied the 26th of February for ten pounds, then I lent him ten pounds; this was money lent, because we had some other bills between us. When the bill became due, it was presented for payment, which was the 4th of March: it was noted, protested, and brought to me, and I paid the money. He gave me a note of hand to be accountable for this bill of 98 l. 6 s. I believe on the 12th of March I insisted upon him either to indorse the bill, or give me a memorandum to be accountable for the value of it. After that I never thought any thing about the writing. Then I thought there was a great deal of likeness between the writing of the memorandum, and the indorsement John Brown. I told him I thought John Brown and he learned at school by one master. He asked me why. I told him, because I thought there was a good deal of likeness in the writing. He said, One man may write like another. I told him I thought the indorsement, John Brown, was his hand-writing. He answered, It was immaterial to me, but I should have my money in two or three days. I had asked him several times about John Brown, but he never would give me an answer where he lived; but said I should have the money in a few days. He desired I would not trouble my head about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this bill presented to?</p>
               <p>Fryer. To Mr. Aked's house in Prince's-street. I discounted the bill with Fothering and Barber in Watling-street. I gave them the cash for it. After I received the bill I went to Mr.

             two or three times, and I received for answer from him, That he never wrote such a bill in his life. I shewed Richard Aked's letter to the prisoner, and I believe I shewed it to Mr. Ive.</p>
               <p>Q. What past between you and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fryer. He proposed he would take up the 98 l. 6 s. bill in a few days. I applied a great many times for the money. He told me I should have it in a few days; sometimes the next day; sometimes in two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner write?</p>
               <p>Fryer. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the words John Brown on the back of this bill, and tell me whose hand-writing you take it to be.</p>
               <p>Fryer. I told the prisoner I believed it to be his own, and I believe it now.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know such a man as John Brown?</p>
               <p>Fryer. No; I know no such man; nor could I ever learn from the prisoner where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you form your judgment, that this is the prisoner's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Fryer. By having seen him write this memorandum, and by receiving several letters from him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you ever saw him write any thing besides this memorandum?</p>
               <p>Fryer. No; I will not swear I have.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to prosecute him sooner?</p>
               <p>Fryer. It was through his promises that we should have the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to change your mind and prefer this bill?</p>
               <p>Fryer. Mr. Aked of Leeds insisted upon it that we should find out the forgery. The prisoner had promised, from time to time, we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280024"/> should have the money, and we became bankrupts, which put it out of our power to prefer a bill against him or any one else. There were several people that gave me reason to believe it was a forgery. Tatlock and Parry did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I borrowed the bill in question to raise cash, and though I wanted it myself, I lent it to Mr. Fryer to raise money for him. John Brown had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280025"/> put his name to several bills drawn upon his master payable to me, on purpose to raise cash as a friend of theirs. I nether forged it, neither do I know it to be a forgery, nor do I believe it to be one. As to Brown, he is now in France, and I cannot have his testimony. Supposing the name was not his hand-writing, it might be written by virtue of a power from him; but that is a matter of which I am very ignorant, and I believe it to be the hand-writing of that Brown, and therefore I humbly submit it there can be no charge against me.</p>

            . John Brown was my clerk for about six months, he was so in February 1768. He is now gone abroad. I have seen him write many times. (He takes the bill in his hand.) Here is the name John Brown to this bill. I am very certain this is his hand-writing. I will look no further, that is his hand-writing. He was my clerk in Prince's Street, near the Mansion house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the body of the bill in his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Aked. No: that is not. That I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave you?</p>
               <p>Aked. He left me I believe in June. He came to me about the 2d of January.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see this bill before it was put into your hands now?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. For acceptance. I would have paid it, but I never saw it after it became due.</p>

               <p>N. Aked. He lived at Leeds.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand-writing is the body of it?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. That is my brother's hand-writing. I have no doubt of it. If I had had any doubt, I would not have accepted it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first of your hearing there was to be this trial?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. The first time of my hearing of this trial being in agitation was yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how your brother came to draw this bill upon your clerk?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. My brother was then a little out of money, and this was drawn to keep the credit up.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been no application to you to pay this bill?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. I never heard of it: if they had come, I would have paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known any instances where Brown has lent his name to Alexander?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. That I can't remember.</p>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

I took notice to my coachman that the place where the clothes used to be was in disorder. I suspected things had been taken away. I looked, and missed the clothes mentioned, and expressed my surprize to him that the person that had taken these clothes had not taken more; because there were more clothes in that chest which they might have taken. I thought this must have been done by somebody that belonged to my family. I said I would go to a magistrate. I asked him what time he got up. He said about six; but he seldom got up so early. The coachman agreed it was extraordinary, and the more so, as the back door had been shut fast the night before. When at breakfast, I talked of going before Major 
               <persName id="t17690628-24-person253">
                  Spinnage

            . The prisoner expressed a great desire to have it inquired into. He wished it might be cleared up. I said, You can have no objection to going before the Major to have it inquired into. He went with me. When we came there, many circumstances made me suspect the prisoner. At last we found where he had been the night before. The servants<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280026"/> had informed me he had been out twice that night. He told me he had been to see one Sharp, who had been his fellow servant when he lived with Lord Douglas. I went there, and found a bundle in a trunk which was broke open; there I found my white frock, and silk and cotton waistcoat. (Produced and deposed to.) Then before Mr. Spinnage the prisoner was asked particularly about the scarlet waistcoat. He said he had flung it down the necessary. I sent for a carpenter to search in the necessary-house, but there was no such thing found.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Evans. He had worked about our neighbourhood all the winter. He owned before the bench of Justices he stole the horse. William Green of Bethnal Green sent word the horse was with him; there I found him. He is the property of Gamelia Key.</p>
               <p>William Green. I live at Bethnal Green. I keep a chandler's shop and deal in horses. My son had bought a horse of the prisoner at the bar, at Hounslow fair, which was stolen, and he was taken from him. He meeting with the prisoner on a bay one eyed horse with a Switz tail, took him in custody, and brought the horse to my house, which proved to be the prosecutor's horse. He bought him on the 1st of June. I asked the prisoner who the horse belonged to, he told me he belonged to Mr. Key at Ardley. I sent word to Mr. Key, and the evidence came and owned him as his master Mr. Key's property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

I found the prisoner sitting on the side of her bed. She complained she was very ill, so that I did not go to bed. She complained of her leg swelling, and said she was very full of pain across her joins and back. I thought it proper she should have assistance. I went into mistress's room, and desired she would get up. She did; mistress gave her something to drink; I believe it was brandy. Seeing her so bad, we thought proper she should have a surgeon. We sent for Mr. Abel, a man-mid wife: this might be between twelve and one in the night. The prisoner got into bed before he came. He asked her what was the matter with her; she said she was very full of pain; he ordered her a draught and went away, after being there about five or six minutes. She drank the draught; after that she said she found herself better. I left the room and went down stairs. I did not stay long below.

This was about a quarter of an hour after Mr. Abel was gone. I heard her make a noise as if moving about in the bed. I thought I heard her open a knife. I heard it clash. This very much shocked me. I had hardly power to stir; I thought she was doing something to herself. She seemed to be very busy under the bedclothes. I went into mistress's room, and told her that I heard her make a noise, and thought I heard her open a knife, and imagined she was going to make use of it. Then I went back again; the prisoner then seemed to be pretty easy; she seemed to compose herself, and desired us to go to bed. This was betwixt one and two.

During the time I sat I think the prisoner drank one draught which I had put in a bottle at her desire, and put it on her bed. I went to bed about four, and slept till about eight; then I got up and went down stairs. When I awaked, the prisoner was in bed, she seemed to be asleep; but I said nothing to her, nor she to me. I carried her up a bason of tea about nine; she drank it, then I think she was sitting on the side of the bed. She got up and made the man's bed in the garret by herself. She came down, and began making her own bed; I came up at the time, and assisted in putting the blankets on. She had changed her sheets, and got a pair of clean ones. I went and told mistress of the clean sheets; then my mistress and I went up into the room. We saw the foul ones, and then we began to think something. Then the prisoner was go: down stairs; there was an appearance on the foul sheets, as if she had been brought to bed. We found them in the drawer. I did not see the child till after it had been seen by other people, about the middle of the day. After we found the sheets, mistress came down and desired the prisoner to go to bed.</p>

            . I live at Edmonton. The prisoner was my cook four months. On the first of May she complained of her legs swelling very much. I saw them on the fourth: they were very much swelled. I then had not the least suspicion of her being with child, having at that time a very good opinion of her. I was going out of town, so I desired her to keep her legs on a chair. When I came home about ten, she was gone to bed. I went to bed also about eleven; and just as I was got into bed, my servant came and told me the prisoner was very bad, and desired I would come to her. I put my under petticoat and bed-gown on, and went and asked her how she did; she said she was in such pain in her stomach and all round, that she did not know what to do. I gave her some pepper-mint water. I did not suspect then that she was with child. She continued in pain. After that I ventured to give her some gin. I told her, I thought her very bad, and that I durst not give her any thing else. I said I would send for Mr. Abel. He lives but a few doors distant. She desired I would not, saying she was out of order, and was sure she should be better. I sent my maids out of the room, and hoped to make some discovery. Then I told her I was frightened very much at her, that I had a great opinion of her, otherwise I should not know what to think. She gave no answer, but seemed ignorant of what I aimed at. I did not mention any thing farther. She had told me before she had had a long illness two or three years ago. I asked her whether she was as bad now as she was then: she said she never was so bad as she was now; and added, in her illness before, her mistress gave her strong things that made her almost drunk. She said the drinking of gin had done her good, and that she was much better, and begged I would go to bed. I said I was so uneasy about her, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280028"/> could not think of going to bed, and that I would send for Mr. Abel. I did so, and directed he should not go up till I had seen him. She said there was no occasion for him. When Mr. Abel came, I went down and told him my suspicions, and desired him to question her. He went up stairs, and asked her a great may questions, which I cannot particularize. I was by at the time. He stayed with her about five minutes. She did not appear worse. He told her he would send her a draught. I went down with him, and asked him what he thought. He said he thought she was in labour. I saw her a great many times that night. He desired me to charge her with it. I told him, if he would stay a little, I would go up again to her, and hear more what she said. I went up, and sat down by her, and told her I was very uneasy and frighted at her, and could not tell what was the matter with her. She asked me if Mr. Abel was below. I said, Yes. She asked what was the reason he did not go, she could not think why he stayed so long; adding, that there was no occasion for him to stay. I told her he stayed to see how she did. I went down and told him what I had said, and that I had not courage to say any more to her. I told him if he would go home and prepare her a draught, I would send a person for it, and that there should be no bad consequence, she should not be left alone a moment. When the draught came, I went and gave it her. She then seemed better, and said she was very sleepy, and begged I would go to bed, for I should get cold without my cloak. She seemed then a little easier, yet I could discover she had little pains now and then. She pressed me very much to go to bed. I told her I would, but insisted upon it my maids should stay by her. I was not satisfied with this, but told them by no means to leave her. They promised me they would not. Then I went to bed. As soon as I got into bed, one of them came and knocked at the door, and said the cook wanted a little water. I told her she might fetch a little, but she must put some brandy in it to take the rawness off of it, and bid her make all the haste she could. I believe in about a minute after

             came, exceedingly frighted, and said, For God's sake, madam, come to the cook; I don't know what she is doing, she is doing something to herself: she has got her pocket in the bed, and I think she has taken her knife out; I heard it clash; and she is very busy under the bed-clothes. I sent her back again directly; my daughter was in bed with me; I desired her to go to the door and hear if she heard any noise. She came back again and said the cook lay very still and quiet. She heard nothing. I lay till about four. I was very fearful the maids were gone to sleep, hearing no stir. I sent my daughter to see. She came again, and said the maids were laid down in their clothes, and the cook was snoaring. I lay till six: then I went into the room, and found the cook fast asleep. I then went to the other bed, and waked the other two. My room is close by theirs. I desired them to get up: they said they had stayed some time by her, that she slept very well, and they thought they need not stay any longer, therefore they lay down. I desired them to call my daughter as they came through my room. This was between seven and eight. I asked them how the cook did when they came; they said she was not got up. As soon as I was dressed, I went into her room, which was about a quarter of an hour after eight, and asked her how she did. She said she was a great deal better, but she was so much out of order, she was afraid to move. I said I hoped she was no worse than common. She said, No. I desired she would stay in her room, and I would go down and make some tea, and send it up. I sent her a bason of tea up. I said I was certain there was something more than ordinary, she looked so shockingly. She came down a little after nine into the kitchen. One of my daughters came and told me the cook wanted clean sheets, for she was going to wash her foul ones: they were very dirty. I bid my daughter give her a pair, but would not let her wash the others. I sent

             up to help her to make her bed, as I heard she was going to make it. I went up, and saw them both putting the blankets on. I looked about, but saw nothing then. I went down again. When the prisoner came down, I desired my daughter to keep her in the kitchen, while I went up and looked about the house for the foul sheets. I went and looked in the garret, where the foul linen is kept. I could not find them there. I looked under her bed in her room; I found there a blanket, her under petticoat, and a bedgown that I had lent her: though I had not found the sheets, I was satisfied there was something more than ordinary. At last I found the sheets in a corner of a drawer where her things lay: then I was thoroughly satisfied she had had a child. They were bundled up in a very bad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280029"/> condition, I have had many children myself, and was quite sure she had had a child. Then I went to get her out of the kitchen: she was wanting to do some work, but I thought her not in a condition to work. She went up stairs. I went up and kept her in talk the while my daughter tried my keys to see whether any would unlock her trunk in the garret. After that I came down, and consulted my daughter what I should do. I took the chare-woman, who is a married woman, up with me. I first sent her into the room to the prisoner to ask her how she did: then I went in, and said, You look sadly, will you have any thing? She said she thought she was a little saint. I said, Cook, you may very well be saint, for I am sure you have had a child. She denied it at first. I said, Though I was so ignorant last night, I am not now, for I was very certain by what I had seen, and if she would not tell me, I would send for a constable. Then she said, there was a child. I asked her where it was; she said in her trunk in the garret, and gave me her keys out of her pocket. I told her she shocked me very much, and bid her go to bed, as the most decent place for her. I got her into bed, and got her some caudle, went with the chare-woman, and found the child tied up in a handkerchief in a corner of her trunk. The trunk was locked. The chare-woman brought it in her apron into a parlour, which we made but little use of. I did not care any body should know of it then. I saw the child was cut down from the ear, and then another cut across the throat, about two inches long each cut. It was a boy. The cut seemed to be to the bone of the neck. I saw the bone, but did not care to look at it much. It seemed very deep. It was very bloody, and bled very fresh till the Monday. This was Friday. The handkerchief was very bloody in which it was. I sent the chare-woman to tell her, I thought she had murdered her child, and I could not see her any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it seem to be a full grown child?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Steers. It did; it appeared as if she had gone her full time.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Low. I am a chare-woman. Mrs. Steers sent for me. She went up stairs and I along with her. This was after the sheets and things were found. We went up to search for the child. I went to the prisoner and asked her how she did; she said, she was very poorly. Madam came up a little after; we then went up into the garret. Madam said, she was certain there must be a child by the things she had seen. The prisoner denied it at first, but not much; afterwards she owned it. Madam asked her for the keys; she gave them to her. Then we went up into the garret, and found the child in the prisoner's trunk. It was very bloody, so also was the handkerchief in which it was. The child bled fresh then from the neck, where there was a wound. It was cut down the neck and cross the neck. I saw the bone. I staid with the prisoner three nights, she never said any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Steers. I bid this chare-woman to ask the prisoner for her pocket, thinking she was not fit to have a knife. She gave her her knife out of her pocket, but that was not bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. What growth was the child.</p>
               <p>E. Low. It was at its full time. I have had children. It was tied up in a snuffy linen handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Steers. Had she made any preparation to put the child in?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Steers. The prisoner sent me word, if I would look into her trunk, I should find some child's things. I looked in her trunk, and there I found a neckcloth for a child, that was formerly used about a child's neck: that I found on the Friday. She was taken away on the Monday in the afternoon. (Produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>E. Low. There was a linen cloth, that seemed to have been made for a clout, wrapped about the child's head in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Barthelomew Abel. I am a man-midwife. I was sent for to Mrs. Steers's, at about eleven o'clock at night, on the 4th of May. Mrs. Steers told me she was exceedingly frighted about her cook. She had lived with her about four months, and was a very good servant, or else she should suspect something was the matter more than ordinary. I asked her if she thought her with child. She said she looked big, but not bigger than she was at her coming. She informed me, she had not been regular for the time she had been there; but would not have me take notice to her that I suspected her to be with child, but go up and have some talk with her. She was cautious of the girl's reputation. We went up stairs together. I asked her several questions, particularly how long since she had been out of order; she told me four months before she came to that place, and that she had been taking some pills, which began to have a proper effect, and that she expected she should soon be better. I looked at one of her legs, and found it very much swelled. I came down stairs. I could not be absolutely certain she was with child, but it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280030"/> my opinion she was, and that she was in labour. I thought it proper for madam to go and tax her with it. After some little time she went up in order to do it. She came down again and told me, she told her that Mr. Abel thought her much like a woman in labour, but the prisoner said it was a particular time, and asked why I staid; saying, I need not to stay; if she had any occassion, she would send for me. I said I would send her something by way of amusing her, and if they sent for me, I would come directly. I sent a draught, and desired she might not be left alone. I went home, and lay down between the blankets, and fell asleep, and heard nothing till morning; when about nine I went to see how she did. She was then not up. I was told I might go up stairs. I went up, and found her dressed, sitting on the side of the bed. Upon asking her how she did, she told me she was much better, that she had had a considerable alteration, as she used to be at particular times, and was quite easy and free from pain, and should soon be well. As she was up, I looked at her to see whether she was big as usual, but not having seen her before to observe her, I could not tell. I went home. After this Mrs. Steers beckoned me. I went into her house. She told me there was a child found. She and I went up into the garret, and there I saw it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Steers. The child had been washed and cleaned, and carried up there when Mr. Abel saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abel. It was a full grown male child, with a considerable wound on its neck. It was cut straight down the neck, and afterwards across the neck. The first began about two inches or an inch and a half below the right ear, and came down right about two inches or an inch and a half long . It reached to the first bone of the neck. It penetrated quite to the bone, about an inch and a half deep. The other cut across was full two inches long, and full two inches deep. It appeared to have been washed when I saw it. I did not see any blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any thing to be inferred from its fresh bleeding, as Mrs. Steers has given an account, that it was born alive?</p>
               <p>Abel. No. If it had been born dead, it might have bled. On the Monday the coroner sent to me, and asked if it was necessary to open the child, to find out whether it was born dead or alive. I told him it was a received opinion, if it had been born dead, the lungs would sink, but did not know it was an infallible sign. I took out the lungs and put them in water, and they swam. I don't mention this as an infallible rule.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your judgement, upon the whole, of the appearance of this child, or can you form any judgement upon it, whether it was born dead or alive?</p>
               <p>Abel. I would rather think it was born alive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I awaked in the morning and found there was a child; that frighted me very much. I was not sensible what I did. I can give no account how I did it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Say at Mary-le-bone. On Wednesday morning, the 24th of May, between two and three o'clock, the coachman and footman came and alarmed me that some thieves were about our house. In a little time after they came and told me they saw a man, and they would go and call the watch. I got out of bed, put my window up, and saw three men, one was a thick-set man, he was upon Mrs. Ridley's vault taking the lead, and the other two standing below to receive it. He threw the lead down, jumped down, and went into a stable; the other two carried the lead in after him and shut the door. They were there till the coachman and footman with the watchman went and took two of them. The pri soners are the men.</p>

            . I am coachman to 'Squire Say. On the 24th of May, I brought my master from Vauxhall in the chariot. When I came to the stable, after my master was gone to-bed, I heard somebody whisper these words, The light is not out yet. I came into the house and asked the maid to let us be in her room: the footman was with me. I looked out at the window after the day was broke, and I saw a fellow with white stockings, and also after him a tallish man, and then a little man. They went to the stable door and looked through a hole, and said, The light is all out. They then went about twenty yards farther; the little fellow scaled the wall, and began stripping the lead from Mrs. Ridley's vault. I and the footman agreed to stand true to each other. We went out, he with a poker and I with a broom-stick. We got the watchman to go with us. We went to the place where the lead was thrown down. The maid called to us, and said they were in the stable. We went in. One man ran out at a back place, and got off. We took the two prisoners; one way lying on the ground, the other standing up behind the door. They both said they were sleeping. We found the lead lying by them, about two hundred weight; we secured them, and they were committed.</p>
               <p>The footman gave the same account.</p>

            , a young man that was there for picking pockets. I told him to go to a ward No. I. and when he was unlocked, he should see him. After he had seen him, he went out at the gate, and returned again in about five minutes; at the same time I observed the other prisoner about an hundred yards from the gate. After Fannen came out from Matthewson again, he and Trippet went away together. I said to Matthewson, What did he want with you? he said, Nothing. I said, I thought by Trippet's shoes (they were all over country dirt) that he had been thieving. He said, Fannen had got a watch, and Trippet was waiting for him. I called a boy and a man to assist me, and we went in pursuit. I saw them in St. Jame's Park upon the grass, about fifty yards a-head of us, looking at something. We apprehended them. I found a silver watch, a chain, and a seal, in Fannen's coat pocket. Carrying them to Bridewell, Trippet's pocket hit against a young fellow's leg. He said, There is something in it. We searched him, and found a pair of silver shoe buckles in his left hand coat pocket. When we got them in, we searched both their pockets; and in Trippet's pocket we found one silver knee buckle and a sleeve button. I examined the watch, and found it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280032"/> was made by Job Trip, King-street, Westminster. I applied to him, and there I found the prosecutor lived opposite to him, and that he had not been at home all that night. I found by Mr. Trip that the watch belonged to Mr. Jones.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I did say so. But I do not know whether I lost them there or not; but in regard to the watch, I looked at it before I went to sleep, and I know I had my buckles on. (The things produced in court.) I was not possessed of the watch and seal above three or four days. The shoe buckles are mine; I have had them some time; and here is a small key that hangs to the watch chain, which fits a little lock that I have at home, I believe that to be mine. The letters on the seal are E. J It was made on purpose for me. I bought it of Mr. Trip.</p>

               <p>I am a waiter at Vauxhall at this time. I pressed this young fellow ( meaning his fellow prisoner) to come and see me. He came on the Tuesday night, about nine. We went to the tap-house, and had a pint of beer together: then I said I could not stay any longer. I went into the gardens immediately. He asked what time I should come out again. I said it would be late, I believed about one or two. I came out about two, when there were two ladies asked me whether I could get a coach. There was never a one. I told them I believed there was a boat. They said they did not chuse to go by water. They asked me which way I was going. I said I lodged in Lambeth. I told them I would oblige them in seeing them over the Bridge, if agreeable, and that there was a young man waiting for me in the taphouse, so that we four went together as far as Charing-Cross: there a coach was going by, and the ladies hired it, got in, and ordered the coachman to drive to the New Buildings near the Middlesex Hospital. They gave me a shilling. Then Fannen and I went up the Haymarket, and had some beer and victuals, and staid some time; then we walked towards the Bridge. I think it was by the third or fourth bench that Fannen saw that watch lying on the ground, and the buckles within half a yard of it, and an odd knee-buckle, and a sleeve button. I went then towards my lodging, but could not get in, and we walked about to pass the time away. We went about two or three miles, and came back towards Vauxhall again. Fannen said to me, You may as well take a walk along with me over the Bridge again. I went with him. He said there was a fellow-apprentice of his in Tothill-fields Bridewell, and being so near, he would call and see him. He went in, but I stopped about an hundred yards from the gate: when he came out we went away together.</p>

I had hung my bags on my horses to let them feed. I shut the door and went to sleep, but the prisoner awaked me by pulling the watch out of my pocket: He turned about, and ran. I jumped out of the coach and followed him. The watchman was crying the hour one. My big coat came between my legs and threw me down. A watchman pursued and he was taken. I know the prisoner is the person that took my watch, for I saw him as I was in the coach. He had a striped waistcoat, and a blue coat on, the same he has on now.</p>

            . On the 3d of this instant, betwixt six and seven o'clock, I was standing at my bar, talking to a neighbour, when in came the prisoner Smith. My neighbour asked me how long that man had used my house. I said I did not remember I had ever seen him before. He went in and out of the room two or three times. My neighbour said, If there is any thing in the house, he will certainly take it. My servants were all out. Soon after Smith was gone, my maid went up stairs and found my room door open. I went up and found my bureau open. I looked in a place where I put papers, and there were six spoons unmarked taken from thence. I pulled out a drawer where there had been six or seven more, they also were gone; they were all table spoons. I lost some tea spoons also. I ran to my neighbour that had been with me at my bar, and told him what I had lost. He and I went about to the pawnbrokers, to give them all the account we could.

Haliburton told Smith, who was there, he had a warrant against him for taking some spoons from the Salutation; then he pulled out another warrant, and said, I have another warrant against your tenant. Wood said, Andrews brought three spoons there, and she gave her 5 s. 3 d. for them. She readily gave them up. Then we asked where Andrews was. I think Wood said she would send her girl with us to her. The girl went with us to White-horse-yard. The little girl went in and beckoned with her finger. Then the constable went in.

             is my husband. On Monday the 22d of May, near one o'clock in the night, I was going for a pint of beer to the Angel at Islington, when the prisoner and another man took hold on me, one of one arm the other the other, and dragged me along by the wall. I struggled with them some time, and cried out. I said, I am a married woman, and have three children. The prisoner put his hand in my pocket, and took out my snuff-box, an iron one; then he took my pocket with my handkerchief, and 5 d. 1/4 in copper and 6 d. in silver: the other held me the while he took the things. The watchman who came to assist me, they took his staff out of his hand.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of May this woman came to me, and told me she had seen one of the men that robbed her two or three nights before. I asked her if she was sure it was the same person; she said she was. I told her to go and look again; she went, and, in about a quarter of an hour, sent her little boy to tell me she was sure, and desired me to come directly. I went: they were walking along by the New River side, by the King of Pruffia's Head: she pointed to the prisoner, and said, Mr. Wilson, I give you charge of that man; that is the man that robbed me. I took and carried him before Justice Girdler. The prisoner said he had never seen the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. Did you tell the justice the prisoner took the watchman's staff away?</p>

I had left two pieces on the counter when I went up, and upon hearing what he said, I looked, and said they have taken the best. Upon which he went in search of them, but could not find them.

             the evidence, came into our shop and asked to see some soosea handkerchiefs. I had two customers in the shop at the time. I desired them to wait a little: they said they would. They went to the counter, about four yards distant from where I was serving. The prisoner set a child on the counter, and then the evidence tied the prisoner's apron behind by the two corners with something in it very tight. In a minute's time the prisoner said, Pray, Sir, serve us, we cannot stay any longer. I immediately left my customer and went and shewed them some soosea handkerchiefs. They asked the price for each of them one. I told them 2 s. 2 d. They bid me 20 d. I said I could take no such price. They said they were poor girls, and could not afford to give any more. I did not like the appearance of the girls, so I took the handkerchiefs off the counter, and they went out immediately. I just stepped to the door and looked after them. Seeing they did not call in at any other of the shops, but walked on remarkably fast with a child in their arms, which gave me a strong suspicion they had got something; I immediately turned to the counter, and found one very remarkable piece of linen was missing. I know it was there not five minutes before: there were three or four or five and twenty yards of it; but they do not run all alike. I rang the bell for Mr. Webb to come down. I told him I had had two thieves here that had stole a piece of fine Irish. I went to the door, where was a poor woman standing: I asked her whether she saw two girls go out, and which way they went. She said straight down the road. I went in pursuit, but could not find them. The next day,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280036"/> I went through Field-Lane, in order if I could see any thing of the girls. I saw the prisoner standing with another girl at the One Tun. I went to some of the neighbours, and asked where a constable lived. They sent me to the prisoner Pain, he is a broker and keeps a cook's shop in the lane. I went and told him I wanted him. He went and fetched his staff. I shewed him the prisoner, and gave him charge of her. She went away with a barrow. He let her get near three parts of the way to Hatton-Garden before he would take her in charge: he took her in charge with great reluctance. Then we brought her to my master's. Crosier's father brought her to our house.</p>

            , and she asked me to go along with her to Smithfield. When we came to Mr. Webb's shop, she asked me to tie her apron behind. I knew there was something in it, but did not know what. I did tie it. She asked for some handkerchiefs, the man asked 2 s. 2 d. a piece. She bid him 20 d. He said he could not take it. Then we came out of the shop to the Cloysters; there she shewed me the cloth. We walked pretty fast, and went to Holborn: then she said she would go to Pain in Field-Lane and sell it. We went there; she went in and came out again with half a guinea and a shilling, and said he had given her six-pence a yard for it, and that there were twenty-three yards of it. She gave me six shillings all but three pence. I had a five-and-three-pence, and the rest in half-pence. I had seen a woman in Field-Lane, who told me she had seen Mr. Webb, who told her he would give her half a guinea, if she could tell where we were to be found, for the cloth was worth four pounds. Then Mary Kynaston said, We will go to Mr. Pain's, and ask him to give us half a crown more. We went, and his wife was at home. Kynaston asked him: he said he had given her enough already, and would give no more, for it was a very thin cloth. Mrs. Pain bid us go about our business, and said there should be no more given there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taylor. What was the cloth worth?</p>

            . On the 17th of June I was going by Mr. Lucas's shop, and I saw the prisoner in it. I had a mistrust he was going to steal something. I saw a pair of buckles in his hand. I thought he put them in his pocket. When he was gone out, I stepped into Mr. Lucas's shop, and asked him if he had lost a pair. I could not stay for an answer, because the prisoner had set upon a run. I followed him into Lime-Street, took hold of him, and desired him to come back. He asked me what I wanted, and made a kind of an attempt to strike me. I evaded it. He set up a run again, I followed, and called, Stop thief! He was stopped by Rood-Lane. I bringing him back, he made a shuffling at his pocket. I said he had got them about him. I looked and saw the buckles in his pocket. I took them out and put a mark upon one of them. Here it is. (The buckles produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) There were two other pair of buckles found upon him, which have been delivered to the right owners.</p>

            . I am a goldsmith in Newgate-Street. On the second of June the prisoner brought this pepper castor to me to sell. He said he brought it from a poor woman that was going into Dulwich Almshouses. I weighed it, and gave him fourteen shillings and eight-pence for it. A person came into the shop, and said he knew that pepper castor to belong to Mr. Mo rris. I sent for Mr. Morris, and asked him to describe the castor, which he did before I shewed it him. The prisoner was then secured and committed. (Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

One took my handkerchief from my neck, and another my watch from my pocket. They used me very ill, and beat me with sticks, and said they must have what money I had got. I said I had none (for I had none). They beat me terribly. One ran after me after I was gone, and would have beat me terribly, but was prevented by the post. It was dark. I cannot swear to the men. I think one of them was in a waistcoat. I went home as well as I could, but cannot tell which way they went. I was very sore and ill. This was on a Saturday night. I went and advertised it on the Monday. The watchmaker that made my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280039"/> watch, drew up the advertisement. I have not seen the watch nor handkerchiefs since.</p>

I asked him to whose house; he said he did not know, but there was a man waiting there for it. After some prevarications I told him he must expect no favour; he was the first I had caught, and I having been robbed several times, I would punish him. At last he said, It is a folly to deny it, the fact is too plain, and go I must, and I'll tell you the truth. He then said, It is your malt; I stole it out of your barge. I'll go with you and shew you which barge it is. He went with me in the same boat, and shewed me the particular place in the barge where he took them from, and there they were missing.

I had been out on the Thursday before Whitsunday, and when I came back I missed my watch from a nail where it used to hang. I asked my boy who had been there; he said nobody but a boy (meaning the prisoner) with a piece of lead to sell, and that he had staid in the shop about ten minutes. On the 29th of May a man came and asked me if I had not lost a watch; I said I had, and described it to him. He said he saw a boy, which was the prisoner, have a watch which he sold to a man that is gone out of town. I got a warrant of suspicion, and took up the prisoner. I took him before a magistrate. After the justice had talked to him he fell a crying, and said, A man threatened him if he would not steal my watch; that he did steal it, and sold it the man for half a guinea. I found that man went into the country that very same 29th May, and I went as far as Fenny-Stratford after him. As my watch used to hang, the boy might see it through the glass door when in the street. The watch is in pawn in Nortonfalgate, at Mr. Delforce's: I saw it there. My errand boy is but nine years old.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the boy at the bar; going to the justice he denied the fact, but when before the justice he confessed, that one of the men, where the boy works with his father, (carpenters) gave him a piece of lead, and bid him go into the shop and sell it; but the master not being at home he left it. The man asked him if he had brought the watch; he said, No. The man said, Go again, and give the errand boy a button out of your sleeve for some tin, and while he is stooping run away with the watch. He went again, and said, Here are two or three pieces of tin, I will give you these buttons for them, and while the boy was stooping for the tin, he went and took the watch, and the man offered him half a guinea for it. The boy said that was too little for a watch. The man said, If you do not let me have it, I will tell your father. Then he let him have it; but was so frightened, that he went and threw the half guinea into the river Thames.</p>

I had left it in a bason, covered with a paper, on the table. I had a susspicion of him, and charged him with it: he denied it for three hours, but afterwards he acknowledged the fact, and produced nine guineas of it. He is but seventeen years old.

There is one house between the prisoner's and mine, but as my porter was taking down the shutters about half an hour after six this day seven night, he said he thought he smelt fire as he came by the prisoner's house. I thought I smelt it very strong. I saw some smoke come out of the prisoner's house. I instantly ordered the shutters to be broke open; then the flames burst out. After the smoke began to clear away I could discern the fire to proceed from under the stair-case; that seemed to be on fire first. I looked at my watch, and it wanted exactly twenty minutes of seven. The house was soon burnt down, all but the wall. I saw a window of Mr.

            . I live three doors beyond where the fire was in the Charles Street. I was going out between six and seven, when at my door there was an alarm of fire. I went to the prisoner's door; the smoke came out at the window, and there was a cracking within side like a bon-fire in the street, when it is about half lighted. A person knocked the door open with a hammer, and the fire gushed out very much from the stairscase. They immediately pulled down the shutters, and broke the glass. The fire issued out from thence, and got a-head prodigiously, and destroyed the inside of the house from top to bottom. I saw the roof of Mr. Wells's house on fire.</p>

            . I lodged in the prisoner's house, in a three pair of stairs room. On Sunday the 25th of June, about twelve at noon, I was dressing myself to go abroad, when on a sudden my door opened, which was locked on the inside. I was greatly surprised at it. I turned round and there was the prisoner. I asked her what she wanted. She said she thought I had been abroad. Then she said she should be obliged to me if I would go down to answer at the door, for she did not care to see any of her acquaintance that day. I was to inform them that she and her children were gone out. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280046"/> went down, but no body was at the door. I went up again, and went out with my child a little after twelve, and returned about two. Then the prisoner asked if I should be at home or abroad. I said I was not certain. She said she was going out, and I was desired to let her in. (The lock of the street door was out of order, and the key would not open it on the outside.) I did not go out. She came up between eight and nine to light a candle. She said she was in a bad neighbourhood, but she had taken care of herself. She went away, and desired I would let her in at ten. She came home a little after twelve. I let her in with another woman with her: that woman had a lighted candle in her hand, and a whole one not lighted, seemingly of about four in the pound. The prisoner took and lighted the whole candle by the other, came in, and wished the other woman a good night. She shut the door, which I bolted and double locked, left the key in it, went up stairs, and left her standing at the door to go into the parlour. I saw her no more till the Wednesday morning, before Justice Miller. I was awaked in the morning by the cry of fire: my husband was in the bed with me, and my child about three years old. He got out, and found the room full of smoke; he looked out at the window, and the people called to him to come down: he opened the door and went to the top of the stairs, and the smoke met him, so that he could not go down: then he said, We are all gone! He then went to the child that was asleep, and took and laid her out at the window in the gutter; (there was a parapet wall;) he then took me in his arms and lifted me up, and assisted me to get out into the gutter, and followed me. I then had the child in my arms. We were only in our shirt and shift. I with the fright found myself fainting, upon which he took the child, and pushed me on my side towards the tiles, so that I should not fall over; he went with the child over the top of one house and carried it to the top of another; it is a flat roof; he left the child, and came and assisted me up to the child; but we saw no way to get down. After we had stayed some time, there came somebody out at a trap-door, and we went down into the house, where we got some clothes. There was no body in the house when I let the prisoner in but she, my husband, self, and child. On the Sunday morning there stood a mahogany table by the shop window with a large feather bed upon it, and behind the door stood another with a feather bed upon it. She had two children and a niece that she kept in the house then, but when she came up to light her candle, between eight and nine, they were gone.</p>

I suppose you have heard of your misfortune. No, said she. I said, Did you not hear your house is burned down to the ground? Said she, Good God! I hope not. What next affliction is to come upon me? She immediately burst into tears, and said she could not stand. Then the gentleman asked her to come into the shop. She went in. I said to her, If you can walk, I should be glad you would go down there, for people said very uncivil things of you. Go, and satisfy them you had no hand in it. When we got to the end of the street, she sat down, and said she could go no farther. We went in at a public-house in King-Street, but the crowd was so great, we could not get along.

               <p>Q. What is the nature of your business?</p>
               <p>Ward. We buy a good many ingots of jewellers. Here are two that the prisoner brought us (producing them) on the 25th of May; one is nine ounces four pennyweights, and left in order to be valued.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they?</p>
               <p>Ward. They are gold and silver partings. The quantity of a pennyweight I took from one end, to try it. One I paid him six pound eight shillings and eleven-pence for. Here is another that never was bought. On the 26th he came for the money, about one o'clock, when our foreman said the prisoner had made use of base means to deceive. Then I took a piece out of the middle and sent it to Mr. Bradbury to be assayed; that bore but two shillings and sixpence an ounce; the other was fourteen shillings and a penny. This was delivered to us as being all of a value. Finding this difference, and that the prisoner was gone, I imagined he would come again in a little time. On Wednesday the 31st of May, a person, who said he was foreman to he prisoner, came with another ingot, and in cutting the ends off, we found it was alike at the ends, but the middle was much like the other. We told him we found a difference in the ingot, and should be very glad if Mr. Lutmore would come himself to know how such an affair should be settled. I think the day after he came, and seemed to be greatly surprized there should be a difference in the ingot. I told him there was, and I was surprized to think he should use us in that manner. He said he was sorry it was so, but if we would melt the ingot down, he would pay the difference, saying he had it of a German Jew. I told him, if he did not produce this German Jew, he must expect the consequence of the law, and added, I was surprized he could take things of a German Jew that he knew nothing of till they were tried. I asked him how much he thought he had defrauded us of within these twelve months; he said about five or six and twenty pounds. I desired him to wait till Mr. Plumb came. When Mr. Plumb came, then the prisoner said he would bring the German Jew, but he never came. We received a letter that he was absconded. I went to enquire, and found he had absconded in a very base manner. Mr. Cox, who has another ingot in the like manner, which he had of the prisoner, he took him up, and brought him to our compting-house. It being late that Saturday, nothing could be done. He was taken before Mr. Alderman Kirkham on the Monday, and asked to give an account in what manner he came by this ingot, or how these ingots came to be in that manner, the ends good, and middle of a base composition. He produced no Jew, nor gave any account. We expect they should be of equal value, the ends and the middle. If they are rightly cast, they must be so. We never try but at the end, except we have a suspicion.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280049"/>Q. What do you imagine the middle of this bad one to be a composition of?</p>
               <p>Ward. I imagine the middle to be tooth and egg, and a little silver put into it. Each end is very rich; they amount to fourteen shillings and a penny an ounce; and the middle not above two shillings and six-pence. It is always understood they should be alike. We have tried the ends and middle of two since, and they were within a farthing an ounce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bradbury. I had a piece of this ingot sent me to assay on the 25th May, from Messrs. Plumb and Brown; I assayed it, and reported, that at the ends it appeared to be very good, and the middle very bad. (He takes the pieces in his hand.) The ends appear to be much richer than the middle.</p>
               <p>Ward. When the assay came home, it weighed after the rate of fourteen shillings and one penny an ounce. I cut a piece out of the middle, which when that came home the difference in value was eleven shillings and ten-pence an ounce, or thereabouts.</p>

The prisoner came to me on Saturday the 3d of June, between the hours of six and seven, and said he came from Mr. Barnes, on the top of Moorfields, and that his master desired his compliments and requested I would send two pair of black silk stockings, for Mr. Barnes was going into mourning for his uncle. I went into the counting-house, and looked out a couple of pair. I said I did not know the size of his master's leg, but there were two pair, one much bigger than the other. I delivered them to him. He came again on the Monday in the evening, and brought a letter, and delivered it into my maid-servant's hand. She brought it to me, and said the man stays for an answer. It was read to this purport:</p>
               <p>"June 17, 1769.</p>
               <p>"Sir, I received on Saturday two pair of stockings</p>

               <p>"the other pair fitted my wife. I should be</p>

               <p>Then he said his master was extremely sorry he had not time to write, but desired I would send eight or ten pair of coloured stockings, of different mottles, for second mourning, for him and his relation to chuse out of. My servants all knew the prisoner, and that he lived with Mr. Barnes. I looked out eight pair of silk stockings, mottled as expressed, I tied them up in a paper, and delivered them to the prisoner at the bar. After he had got them under his arm, he said, Madam, I must have the two pair of black silk stockings, as the letter expressed. I told him I had none of that sort, but I would get a couple of pair, and send them the next morning. I got t wo pair, and sent my porter with them to Mr. Barnes. When he came back, he told me Mr. Barnes said he knew nothing of the matter, and that the boy that came was a good for nothing sort of a lad, and had been gone from him some time. Then I got a warrant to take him up. My servant and another person found him somewhere by Bagnigge-Wells.</p>
