               <p>on the 2nd of Oct—the prisoner Phasey was our laundry-maid—we left her in charge of the house—the prisoner Berry was a charwoman, and had worked as such at our house a short time before we left town—on coming to town, Phasey told me my wardrobe had been left open—it stood in my bed-room—on examining, I missed from it a diamond brooch, a pair of diamond earrings, an emerald hoop ring, and a new purple watered silk dress—these articles were left in the wardrobe when I left town—I told Phasey these things were missing—she said she was sorry to hear it, or something of that kind; and said it was her opinion the charwoman, or a man named Edward Payne, had stolen them.</p>

Before we went out of town, I was desired by mamma to put her things away in the wardrobe, and to lock it, which I did—I did not open the boxes of jewellery, but I saw the boxes in which they are usually contained—they were in separate small boxes—I locked the key of that wardrobe in another wardrobe in the same room—I am perfectly sure the lock caught, for I tried it—I also tried the second lock—I carried the key of the second wardrobe into the country, and gave it to mamma—put it on a bunch of keys while in town, which I carry in my pocket—there are folding-doors to the wardrobe where the diamonds were, with a bolt at the top and bottom—I secured both bolts, and the lock shot into the bolted half of the door—on coming to town I found the wardrobe in which the jewels had been, not unlocked, but the bolts were undone—the key had not been turned, so that the bolt of the lock was not back but, the bolts were undone—the doors were closed together, but not fast—I did not find any appearance of anything having been introduced to prise the door open, or raise the bolts—it is a patent key, and I believe a Bramah, a small round key with a small catch in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Berry's Defence</hi>, I went to Mrs. Goldie's soon after Christmas; pre<lb/>vious to that I had worked nearly two years for a Madame Francis, of No. 26, Castle-street, facing the back of the Princess's Theatre; unfortunately she is now in France, or she would come forward to prove that I was ac<lb/>customed to go with her linen backwards and forwards to different places, and to none but French people; and when they could not pay, I had been accustomed to pledge things for them; I had pledged for a lady named Davis, in Gilbert-street, No. 16, or 15, which made me make use of that name; on account of breaking a china jug of Mrs. Goldie's, which Phasey said I must match before the family came home, I went and tried to do so at several shops; among others I went to a large china shop near Gilbert-street, to try to get it matched; I have the piece at home, which I took with me; I then went to Gilbert-street with the brooch; when I came home she said, "What a little, you outfit to have got more;" I have been in the habit of fetching things out of pledge for Phasey, and paying the interest for her; and I have pledged different things that have been proved to be her own; when I was having these things to pledge, I did not know they were of the value they are, neither did I know but they were her own, as she is a person that has good clothes of her own, and always appears respectable on a Sunday, so much to, that she told me herself that the cook said one day, when she went out, "That can't be Elizabeth, I thought it was Mrs. Goldie!" and I did not doubt but what I was doing was right—one morning in August, as near as I can recollect, when I went, she said, "Oh dear me, I am in a good deal of trouble;" I said, "What is the matter?" she said, "That stupid Edward, I sent him up stairs to get one of the boas, to go out in, and instead of going into the</p>

               <p>back room, he has gone into the front room, and opened mistress's press;" I said, "Is it possible?" she said, "Yes, what shall I do?" but she said she locked the door, and kept the key in her possession, as she owned to Mrs. Goldie afterwards; but previous to that, when the house was re<lb/>paired, the second floor was all papered alike; and when I was cleaning the young ladies' room where the boas were kept, there was a chest of drawers with a small press on the top: I said to the man who was paper<lb/>ing, "Will you help me to move this press back? "he pushed it back, and the doors flew open; I immediately called Phasey up stairs; when she came up, she said, "Dear, dear, what a thing it is;" she put her finger unfortunately, and pressed the lock back again; she was sorry afterwards that she did so; she then locked the door; on the Monday after, she was very uneasy, and said, "I wish I could get a key to get the press locked; I will ask Mr. Dent," who is an upholsterer, that Edward lodged with; I said, "Well, if you feel so uneasy, shall I try to get you a key, if I can borrow one?" she said, "Yes;" I borrowed some keys of my landlady, having none of my own, and brought them to Phasey; when Phasey re<lb/>turned them to me again, she said there was ne'er a one that would fit, but since that she said she found one on the bunch that locked the press, but she took it off, and flung it away; on the Sunday after the family came back, she told me, out of the back window that looks into the laundry, to go to Mr. Dent, and beg of him not to say anything about the key or keys; I said, "Very well;" I went, but neither Mr. or Mrs. Dent were at home; I went on the Monday morning, and left word with his wife; I did not see him; the last thing that I pledged was the dress; I was then going out to work where I had been the day the officer took me; it is Mr. Matthews, a grocer, at the corner of East-street, and I was to go there next day. My husband is a coach<lb/>maker, and there is a particular sort of paper which they use; there are only a few shops which sell it, and I went to one in Goodge-street, and I pledged the dress as I went along. When I came home it was nine o'clock; I thought it was later; I knocked at the street<lb/>door; Phasey came up to me, and said, "O, what brought you back to<lb/>night? George is not gone, (who is a respectable young man, belonging to the Life Guards,) will you come down?" I said, "No, not to<lb/>night, I am going out to work to-morrow." I gave her my purse, a dark one, with yellow clasps; she said, "How much have you got?" I said, "30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" she said, "Very well, that will do." I gave it her; and from that time I never saw the purse but once. I did not go the next day, but the day after. I said, "Where is my purse?" she said, "O, it is a pretty purse," looking at it; "I will give you another for it;" but she has never given it.</p>

On the evening of the 30th of Oct., about half past eight o'clock, I left my par<lb/>lour, and went up stairs for about five minutes, leaving my little girl, four years old, in the parlour—she called out, "Mother, some one has opened the window"—I was coming down stairs at the time—I directly went to the parlour<lb/>window, and found it partly open—it was quite safe when I went up stairs—I saw a pillow, a bit of a coloured counterpane, and a piece of a mattress, hanging partly out of the window—they had been lying on the foot of the bed, which was against the window—I missed all the articles stated—I opened the door, and picked up a jacket of my hus<lb/>band's, which laid at the door—the witness, Mendy, came up with my little child's frock—he went in search of the prisoner—I afterwards went to the station, and saw the prisoner there—I had never seen her before—I also saw two blankets, a quilt, and handkerchief, all my property—they were lost at the same time as the other things—the bouse we live in be<lb/>longs to a Mr. Huxtable—he does not live in it, nor do any of his servants—it is a lodging-house, and each person lives in his own part, and has a key—there is one door for us.</p>

I was going along Cambridge-place, and met the prisoner about ten yards from my house, and about 100 yards from Mrs. Goodwin's—she had a lot of these things dragging after her—she slipped when I came along, and she said, "D—the things"—my daughter was with me—she picked up a frock—I heard a cry of, "Stop thief," and went towards Mrs. Goodwin's—I afterwards went in search of the pri<lb/>soner, and overtook her in the main road with the things—I said she was the very person I had been looking for—she said, "Me? I have just left work"—I caught hold of her, and held her till the policeman came up and took her in charge—she dropped the things at her fett.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sworn constable, on duty at Nichol<lb/>son's-wharf. On Saturday, the 26th of Oct., I was on duty, and in the course of the afternoon I saw a person named James Corney in a state of intoxication, whom I thought it my duty to take into custody for drunk<lb/>enness and a disturbance, and causing an obstruction to the business that was going on on the wharf—I proceeded to take him to the station in Tower-street—a mob began to collect at the south side of Thames-street, at the top of the gateway, near Billingsgate—the mob followed us to St. Mary-at-Hill—I saw Vaughan and Clow before we got there—they both said something—Clow said I had no business with the prisoner—I told him that I had—Vaughan was a little further on at that time—Corney was very violent, and tried to get away from me—Lloyd, a policeman, came to my assistance, and he laid hold of Corney on one side, and I on the other—Clow kept saying I had no business with him, I ought to let him go—when we got to a hoard at the bottom of St. Mary-at-Hill, Cor<lb/>ney laid hold of the hoard, clung to it, and tried to get out of my custody—the mob then made a rush upon Lloyd and me, but it was not success<lb/>ful—there was a truck in the way—Corney clung about the truck—we got him away from it—he said he would go with the officer if I would let go of him—I just let go of him for a minute, to see if he would go, but he would not, and I then took hold of him again—we got on to the upper end of the hoard, and he clung to it again—at that time I had got hold of him by the left arm, and Clow came, jumped on my arm, and broke me away from Corney, who got away from my grasp; at the same time Vaughan passed between me and Corney—I was then quite separated from Corney—the mob then became very violent to me—I was knocked down by some one, I do not know who—I saw Vaughan before I was knocked down—he was not a yard from me—he said I had no business with the prisoner—he likewise said that he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for me—I was then either pushed or knocked down, and while I was down I was kicked about my body—as I was in the act of rising, Sadd kicked me on the outer part of my right thigh—I knew Sadd by sight, and said to him, "I know your face well, and I will have you as soon as I get out of the mob"—he said, "Go on, go on, kill the b—b"—he then seemed to bear down the hill through the mob, and I saw no more of him—Vaughan still kept exciting the mob on to me—he said, "Kill him"—he shook his hand in my face—I did not see him strike me—he had one of his hands in a sling or handkerchief—I was then knocked or pushed down again by the mob, and kicked all over my body while down—when I got up again I saw Vaughan and Clow—Clow said something, and struck me a violent blow on my face with his fist, I believe—I did not see any instrument—Vaughan was saying something at the same time, but I could not distin<lb/>guish what it was—the blow which Clow gave me knocked me down; I was almost senseless, and while down I was kicked again—I had produced my staff before this, when they broke me away from Corney, after Clow jumped on my arm—somebody came to my assistance, and I got into the Blue Anchor public-house by some means; I do not know how I got in—it is very near the spot where I was knocked down the third time—my cheek was cut by the blow Clow gave me, and bled very much—I was blind with my right eye—I afterwards went with Corney to the station, and gave him in charge—I then went, in company with Webb, who is a person employed at the wharf, to Mr. Smith, the doctor's—I afterwards saw Sadd—I went to him, and said, "You are my prisoner; I told you I should have you"—he tried to escape—Webb was with me and he ulti<lb/>mately</p>

               <p>secured him—after we had secured him he said, "Don't take me, and I will tell you who it was struck you; it was Clow struck you"—he was taken to the station—he there said it was Clow that struck me, and said he did not, he was not there at the time—I had some more conversation with him afterwards—he said if I did not do anything to him, he would be as a witness for me—the same evening I found Clow at a public-house—he said he knew what we were after, after that job in the City, and pointing to me, he said, "I gave that fellow a slap in the face; I should not have struck him if he had not hit me with that brass ornament"—I had had my staff in my hand—I could not get it into my pocket—I did not hit him with it—I was afterwards attended by a doctor—I spit blood from the injuries I received—I had not known Vaughan before—I did not strike any of the prisoners with my fist or staff.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in New-walk, Whitefriars, and am clerk to Mr. Peter, a barrister. On the evening of the 29th of Oct., about eight or nine o'clock, I was passing through Hyde-park, and saw the prisoner between Cumberland-gate and the Serpentine—I was going towards the Green-park—the prisoner was in his regimentals—he spoke to me, and said, "It is a cold night"—we walked together side by side—he asked me if I was going out at one of the upper gates—I told him I was going out at Grosvenor-gate, and he then laid his hands on * * * outside my trowsers—that was very soon after I told him I was going out at Gros<lb/>venor-gate, I cannot tell how long—he then said, "You had better come this way, it will be nearer to Grosvenor-gate "—we then got under the barriers, to go the nearer way—I turned from the way I was going, to go the way he suggested—that was after he had done what I have described—the barrier is a railing which separates the path from the grass—we were nearly by the Serpentine then—when we had got under the barrier, and got on to the grass, he snatched my stick from my hand, and collared me—this is the stick I had—he then said, "You b—b—, you shall not go till I have had something from you "—I told him I had nothing to give him—he said he would search me—he still kept hold of my coat, and collared me tight, and he searched my pockets—he took out of my outer coat pocket a red silk pocket<lb/>handkerchief, and from my waistcoat pocket a penny, two halfpence, a farthing, and a gold enamelled shirt-stud—he said I had a watch—I told him I had none—he then said I had money in my hat—I took it off, and showed him that I had none—he had still got me by the collar—he then said I should not go, until he had had my outer coat off my back—I told him he should not have it—he again said he would have it—I wrestled, and got from him, and called for the police—I ran away from him—after I called "Police" he ran after me with the stick—he did not reach me—I called "Police" a second time, and he then ran away—I heard the policeman spring his rattle, and call out, "Follow him" "—I did follow him, and the policeman followed me—I followed the prisoner some distance—I cannot say how far—he was running towards Bayswater—when I had followed him some distance, I saw another policeman coming in a cross direction, and he caught the prisoner—after he was caught, I saw the other policeman, Kemball, pick up the stick, which the prisoner had dropped—I did not see him drop it—he picked up the same stick the prisoner had taken from me, and I saw him pick up a silk handker<lb/>chief—it is not mine, it is my master's—I had taken some things to be cleaned in the handkerchief in the course of the day—the prisoner was taken to the station, with the handkerchief—I know this halfpenny (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) by its battered appearance—it is one of the halfpence the prisoner took from my waistcoat pocket.</p>

"—I asked her twice over before she answered me, and she told me it was catchup—she did not say where she had got it from—I said, "Jane, when I have fish I shall know where to come for sauce"—she never told me in the prisoner's presence where she got it from—I then went down, and came up again about half an hour afterwards—the prisoner was then sitting on one side of the fire, and she on the other, the same as before—they had no light then—I took my own light up then—I could see then that there was something in the bottle—it seemed to be about half full of dark-coloured liquid—it was a dark bottle—any liquid would look dark in a dark bottle—I did not take it up to look through it—neither Gregory nor the prisoner took up the bottle—there appeared as if there had been some poured out into the tea-cup—I went up to the table with my light—it was a dark colour in the tea-cup—it was a dark green cup—it was dark green inside—I could not very well judge of the colour of the liquid—it looked to me like catchup—it was such a mark as would be left in a cup by catchup, but not quite so thick—Gregory asked me if I would go out with her when Alfred was gone—the prisoner was there then—I told her, that if it was not too long I would go with her, but if it was too late I could not go with her—she repeated it over again, and said, directly after Alfred was gone she should go—she told me, that against I got myself washed, and got my bonnet and shawl on, she would be ready—I then went down with my candle, and washed myself—before I went down I asked her whether she did not want a bit of light—she said she did not care about a light when she had a fire in the room—when I returned to the room the door was shut—I called "Jane"—she told me to stop a bit—the prisoner was not gone then—he said, "Mary, wait a bit"—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards she opened the door, and said, "Polly, come up"—the prisoner was standing by the side of the fire, and the deceased was tying on her bonnet—I said, "Jane, it is so late, I shall go in-doors, I can't go with you, it is ten o'clock"—the prisoner took out his watch, and said, "It is not ten o'clock, it wants ten minutes to ten"—the prisoner took the bottle off the table, and put it in his coat-pocket—he took it out again almost directly afterwards, and put it on the second shelf in the cupboard—we then all came down together—we went together as far as Cock-lane, or Boundary-street, and there the pri<lb/>soner left us—I saw him part with Gregory—he said, "Good night, Jane"—she said, "Good night, <hi rend="italic">Alf</hi> "—they shook hands, and he kissed her—he</p>

               <p>said to me, "Good night, Polly"—I said, "Good night, Alfred," and he ran away—she called after him, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>, what time shall I see you to-morrow?"—he said, "Stop till to-morrow comes, and I will tell you"—he then ran away—he appeared to be in a hurry—he said he was going some<lb/>where, where, and he could not stop—I then went with the deceased down Shore<lb/>ditch, Old-street Road, and afterwards to Hoxton, as far as the Britannia public-house—she afterwards went into the Britannia, or next door—I did not go in with her—I left her there—while we were going there she complained of feeling very sick—that was, as near as I can tell, about half an hour or twenty-five minutes after we had parted with the prisoner—we had gone down Shoreditch, and up Old-street Road, to go to the Britannia—we had not gone two miles—she complained of sickness, of an inclination to vomit—she did not do so, she only spat—it appeared to be like water—she ap<lb/>peared to try to vomit—she did not seem to retch, but as though she wanted to retch, and could not—what did come was like water—it was very little—she said she had a pain in her stomach—she had nothing to drink while I was with her—I left her there—she went into the Britannia, not into the public-house, but into the part where the play is—there is an en<lb/>tertainment there, and she went into the theatrical room—I left her there, and came home—I ran all the way home—it was eleven o'clock when I got home, and I should suppose it was about twenty minutes to eleven when I left her—I saw her again next morning, about a quarter past ten—I went into her room—she was in bed, alone and undressed—she appeared to me as though she was dying—she spoke low, but was quite sensible—I ob<lb/>served her hands—her fingers were contracted, and were quite black, and her face was as black as her hands—I laid hold of one of her hands, it was as cold as could be—I could not open her fingers—I asked her what was the matter with her—she said, "Mary, I am dying"—I said, "Jane, what have you been drinking?"—she told me she had not drunk anything except the brandy-bitters—she requested me to send for her brother—there was no one in the room but myself at that time—I saw Sarah Russell in the room afterwards—I sent her for the deceased's brother—soon after Russell had gone the prisoner came into the room where the deceased was lying—she still appeared to be suffering—he said to her, "What is the matter?"—she said, "Alfred, I am very bad, I am dying"—he said, "What have you been drinking?"—she said she had not drank anything but the brandy-bitters he had given her last night—he coloured up very much, and said, "Never"—that was all I heard him say—I then went for the doctor, and left him in the room—Charlotte Scott, Caroline Watson, and several other young women, were in the room—I was not absent five minutes—I ran all the way there and back—it was to Mr. Wildbore's, in Shoreditch—when I returned the prisoner was gone—Mr. Smith, Mr. Wildbore's as<lb/>sistant, attended her—he advised her to be taken to the hospital—I did not tell Mr. Smith that I thought she had been poisoned—I did not know it—on the Tuesday before this Thursday I went up to the top of the stairs, and went just inside the deceased's room—I saw the prisoner there, and the de<lb/>ceased—I did not go into the room, and did not hear what passed between them—they were having a few words—I cannot say how long they were together—I came down stairs then, I thought it my business to do so—I did not want to hear what they had to say—I went into my own room, and did some needlework—I saw the prisoner come down a few minutes afterwards—the deceased came down directly he was gone, and she was then crying.</p>

I went into the deceased's. room after she was dead, and on the mantel<lb/>piece found a piece of paper with a small quantity of quicksilver in it—I afterwards put it into a small pill-box—on the Friday evening I went to the house of the prisoner's father, No. 9, Haberdasher's-place West, Hoxton, about half a mile from the deceased's house—I was there shown a bed-room, which I searched—I found, in a small drawer of the looking-glass, a small white powder, which I now produce, in this piece of paper, which I have marked "No. 3, white powder"—the prisoner's sister then showed me a cupboard in the kitchen—I there found a small paper parcel, which I now produce, written on it, "Sugar of lead, poison"—that paper was damp and mouldy—it ap<lb/>peared as if it had been lying in the cupboard a long time, the dust had got over it, and it had a very mouldy appearance, from the dampness of the cupboard—I put that into another paper, and marked it, "No. 1, sugar of lead, poison"—in the same cupboard I found a piece of brown paper containing a white substance—there was no writing on that brown paper—I afterwards inclosed it in another paper, and numbered it "No. 2, sugar of lead"—that had no dust on it, like the first paper—I also found in the cupboard a small blue bottle, which I now produce, with fruit-ker<lb/>nels in it, which I took possession of—there was a very small quantity of liquid in with the kernels—I afterwards left that bottle with Mr. Smith—I received it back from him—I marked the quicksilver "No. 4"—I after<lb/>wards delivered the packages marked 1, 2, 3, and 4, with the purple bottle, to Dr. Leeson—I afterwards received them back from Dr. Leeson—I was present with Mr. Smith on Thursday, the 17th of Oct., at Shore<lb/>ditch church, when a coffin was opened—it contained the body of the deceased—I had seen her shortly after her death, lying on the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and was assistant to Mr. Wild<lb/>bore, of Shoreditch, on the 19th of Sept. last. I visited the deceased on the morning of the 20th, about eleven o'clock—I found her in a very pro<lb/>strate state, suffering intense pain about the stomach, on pressure, with a low, weak, and fluttering pulse—her skin was very dark, very discoloured—her extremities were cold, and the hands were contracted a great deal—they were rather rigid—I thought she was labouring under poison, particu<lb/>larly larly after I saw the bottle—the appearances and symptoms led me to sup<lb/>pose so—I asked her the cause of the pain, and she pointed to the bottle—she was able to articulate, and perfectly sensible—on asking her some questions my opinion was confirmed—I poured some of the contents of the bottle into a cup, and tasted it—it bad a very disagreeable taste, very pungent—I spat it out immediately, for I expected it was poisonous—that is the best definition I can give of the taste—it was pungent and strong—it tasted of brandy flavoured with bitters, brandy bitters—I went home in order to prepare some medicine, and whilst there I heard she was dead—she was almost in the act of death when I saw her first—she was in a very prostrate condition, and I expected her to die shortly—there was inflam<lb/>mation mation existing in the stomach and bowels—the deceased's brother after<lb/>wards gave me the bottle, and I gave it to Dr. Leeson—I first of all poured some out into a phial, and took it to Dr. Leeson, and afterwards gave him the whole bottle—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body on the following night, the 21st—I examined the stomach—there were appear<lb/>ances ances of inflammation, and likewise dark-coloured spots, very character<lb/>istic of poison, particularly at the cardiac or upper extremity next the throat—much inflammation had existed there very recently, I should say for a few hours only—the small intestines were inflamed—the large intes<lb/>tines were not so much inflamed—the lungs were perfectly healthy, and the rest of the body in a healthy state—the brain was congested, but there were no morbid appearances about it—there was general congestion—I observed that the kidneys were congested—nothing beyond that—the bladder was contracted and empty, but there was nothing remarkable in</p>

               <p>is, to a certain extent, an irritant poison—if taken in sufficient quantities it would produce such symptoms as I have described—the metal itself would not, but a compound, such as acetate of lead, carbonate of lead, and many other preparations of lead—acetate is what is commonly called sugar of lead, and carbonate what is commonly called white lead—I have seen the effects of sugar of lead on several persons—we had a case in St. Thomas's Hospital on Monday last, where a person had taken a large quantity of sugar of lead; and hi that case, in addition to the symptoms I have already noticed, there was great blueness of the gums—that would be the effect of any preparation of lead—that patient has re<lb/>covered, and they generally recover—if that blueness of the gums existed during life, it would not disappear in death—there would still be the ap<lb/>pearance after death—I never saw the body of the deceased—I examined the stomach, and observed that it was in a very inflamed and congested state at the lower portion of the cardiac extremity; that is, the portion of the stomach immediately adjoining the <hi rend="italic">oesophagus</hi>, or throat—there was but trifling inflammation, in comparison, in the lower portion of the stomach—the state of the stomach was indicative of inflammation pro<lb/>duced by an irritant poison—that partial congestion of the coats of the stomach is not usual, except in the case of an irritant poison—it does sometimes exist in cases of <hi rend="italic">gastritis</hi>; that is, of acute inflammation, but it is then generally more diffused—<hi rend="italic">gastritis</hi> is a disease very often conse<lb/>quent upon <hi rend="italic">miasma</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">typhois</hi> poison, and a variety of things.</p>

I met this female in Crown-street, and asked her to go there with me, which she did; we came out again together, and the constables seized me. As soon as the landlady saw this young woman, she said, "You are the girl that we have got another young woman in trouble for. "I am quite a cripple; I had my left hand in my pocket, and do you think, if I had four counter<lb/>feit shillings in my possession, I could have passed them out of my hand, with three constables by me.

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live in Dudley-court, Crown-street, Soho. On Wednesday evening, the 30th of Oct., I was in the Kentish-town-road, about a quarter-past six o'clock, and heard a person halloo out, "Hoy!" behind me—I turned round, and saw a woman just in front of a horse and cart—she was in the act of crossing the road—it was a tilted cart with two wheels, drawn by one horse—I saw there was a woman and a man in the cart when it came up to me—I could not see who was driving—the woman was run over by the cart—she was knocked down, I think, by the horse, or by the shaft, I. cannot say which—the cart went</p>

               <p>on, and went right over her—I could see that it knocked her down—I had got out into the middle of the road—I ran after the cart, and told them they had run over the woman, why did they not stop—they did not stop at all, but went on—they went at about the rate of eight miles an hour—I told them to stop, but they would not—I then went back to the woman—they were just in the act of the she was dead—she died in the doc<lb/>tor's shop—it was not a very light night, nor very dark—there were six lamps just where it happened—there are three gas-lamps belonging to the Wire's Head public-house, and three gas-lamps belonging to the street, close on the spot—it was at the parting of two roads—I should say I could see the cart twenty or thirty yards off, from the light there was, and I should say you might see a person walking twenty or thirty yards off.</p>

I was in the cart on this evening with the two prisoners, coming along the Kentish-town road, towards London—Cloke was driving at the time of the accident—when we had passed the Wire's Head a good distance I observed a woman in the road, but it was very dark—she was crossing the road—she was quite close to the horse's head when I first saw her—Liman cried "Hoy!" three times very loud—she did not seem to hear him—it was loud enough for her to hear if she had her hearing—she was knocked down, and the cart went by, but I am not sure they were aware that it went over her—I did not feel the cart rise up after she was knocked down—it did not stop—they were not aware of the accident—they stopped first at Cumberland-market—I do not exactly know how far off that is—it is a good distance—it had gone faster that distance than it had before the accident—when we got to Cumberland-market, one of the prisoners looked out—I did not get down there—one of them said that there was no one coming after them, they were all right—I do not think they were aware the woman was run over—they knew she was knocked down, but not that the wheel went over her—I forget whether they said anything about the woman before they go to Cumberland-market—one said he was afraid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250062"/>
               <p>she had been run over—the other one said he did not think she was hurt—after they had stopped a little while in Cumberland-market they went on—I went with them as far as the New-road—they did not say why they went by Cumberland-market—I do not know whether it was their straight way home—we were not going very fast before the accident.</p>

Cloke had been in my service some little, time, and had left, I think, on the Saturday previous to the accident—on the 30th of Oct. Liman was in my service—I sent him on an errand that evening, with a horse and cart, to different places, to Kentish-town, and as far as Highgate—Cloke had been my shopman, not a driver—Liman had been in the habit of going out with the same horse and cart on former occasions—he got back that evening about half-past six o'clock, or from that to seven—he did not mention that he had met with any accident—he was perfectly sober—I was not aware that Cloke was to have gone with him—it was not a very fast horse, and perfectly quiet—it is not very easy to pull up—it is rather hard in the mouth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of driving? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Occasion<lb/>ally—I should not think seven or eight miles an hour a fast pace—he would go that pace—that is his pace, and you could not force him to more without getting him into a gallop—that is the best of his trot—it is very difficult to pull him up on an instant, and perhaps it would be more so if he was going towards home.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in this house—the first I heard of this was Brugger asking for money for the clock—I heard Mrs. Keene say they had none for him to-day—I was in my room, which is next to theirs, and only a thin partition between them—I next heard one of the parties call them scheming swindlers—the moment after that I heard a disturbance—Keene hallooed out to me twice, "John Ladd, John Ladd," as if calling for assistance—I went to the door, and saw the four fighting together—the two prisoners, Brugger, and Rock—I did not see anything done to Mrs. Keene till she came out of the room—Rock held her by her hair, and dragged her down the first flight of stairs—I did not see further—I did not attempt to part them, but stood still and witnessed it—I did not see any poker or hammer used when they were fighting—the last thing I saw was a last thrown at Brugger—it struck his head—I do not know whether it cut it—I am not acquainted with the prisoners, only as a neighbour—I went to Guildhall.</p>

RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If blood had flowed from Brugger's head, must you have seen it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should—I do not say there was no blood—I saw the last hit his head, and he put up his hand—there was no blood till after he took his hand away—there was considerable blood then, and he turned to go down stairs—I did not follow him down, and do not know what blood there was—there was a stream of blood on the stairs, as far as I saw, but I never went from my door—the stream of blood came from Brugger, but I cannot say what part of his head—he was standing by the banis<lb/>ters when the last was thrown at him—it must have hit him in front—I saw no blood before the last was thrown—if there had been any, I think I must have seen it—I think I can swear there was none till then—I saw Mrs. Keene dragged down stairs, and did not interfere to protect her, or call murder or police—I stood quietly.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 13, Bouverie-street, Fleet-street. I am not in a situation at present—I was brought up as a chemist—on Sunday evening, the 10th of Nov., I had been to Portland Chapel, in Little Portland-street—I left there at half-past eight o'clock—I went from there to the end of Portland-place, towards Regent's-park—I turned down Regent-street and met the prisoner—I had never seen him before—he said, "It is a fine evening," looking round at me—I caught his eye—I said, "I beg your pardon, I fancied I recognised your face "—I walked on towards the City, towards home, and noticed the prisoner several times—he was by the side of me—he addressed some remarks to me, which I replied to, and in that manner I arrived in Fleet-street—I went into the Johnson's Head—I did not see anything of the prisoner before going in—I did not expect him to follow me in—I went to the end of the room—as I walked up the room, I did not see him till he took his seat by the side of me—I did not know he had followed me—when he took his seat, he turned round, as if looking for the waiter, and then remarked that he should, have a glass of stout—I turned my head, and, seeing the waiter coming, I requested him to bring two glasses, or, rather, two half-pints of stout—the prisoner made some re<lb/>marks respecting the number of "Punch" which was on the table—he merely said, "This is the Lord Mayor"—I believe be mentioned the concerts that were had at Johnson's Tavern, and asked if I was fond of music—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Friend, do you play any instrument?"—I said, "Yes, the piano"—at this time, two glasses of stout were brought—I threw down a half-crown, the waiter gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and 1 returned him a penny of it for himself—the prisoner had not said anything about his paying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the reason you paid for the prisoner's stout? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not my intention to do so—I threw down the half-crown, the waiter took it up, and delivered me the change, and as it was a very trifling sum, I took no notice of it—I did not mention it to the prisoner—I drank my stout, and so did he—after I bad drank it, I asked him to allow me to pass him, to go out—he got up, and I passed him—I had no con<lb/>versation whatever with him before I passed him—I did not invite him to follow me—when I got to the end of the passage leading into Fleet-street, I noticed that he was still with me—I said, "I am not far from my lodging, I shall therefore wish you good-night"—I then passed across to Bouverie-street—I did not notice which way the prisoner went—I walked straight to my lodging—it is very near the bottom of Bouverie-street, on the right-hand side—Bouverie-street is a very dark street at night, and not well lighted, particularly at that end of the street—there are two or three</p>

               <p>steps leading to our door—I had a pass key—there were two other lodgers, who had keys as well as myself—I did not notice anybody in the neigh<lb/>bourhood bourhood of the door when I opened it—I found some difficulty in open<lb/>ing the door, in consequence of the latch-key being very much out of order, of which I had complained to the landlord a few days previously—I ultim<lb/>ately opened the door—I cannot say what the time was—I walked in, and I heard some one on the steps, and he came in almost immediately be<lb/>hind me, but I did not take any notice of it, as there are other lodgers in the house, who come in at various times of the night, and I fancied it was one of those parties—it was quite dark—I walked to the bottom of the stair-case, and then took off my boots and coat, which I laid in a chair, just at the entrance to the parlour, as I usually do—I went up the stain, I suppose about twelve or thirteen stairs, towards the window where my light was usually placed—I took one of two candles, and a box of lucifer matches, struck a light, and lighted the candle—I was quite in the dark until then—the candles are left there for the purpose—when I had lighted my candle, I turned round, and saw the prisoner—on seeing him, I went on straight to my bed-room, for I was so suddenly alarmed, so much taken by surprise, that I was scarcely conscious of what I did—I went on to my bed-room as if from habit—my bed-room is the second floor back-room—as soon as I had got into the room, on turning round, I found the prisoner behind me—he came in immediately after me—he then turned, shut the door, and locked it, and said in a suppressed tone of voice, "I demand 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I immediately said "For what? I do not understand you"—"Oh," he said, "you know very well what for; you know what you have done"—he then went to the bed, threw himself at full length with his hat on, and said, "Here I shall remain for the night, and make myself comfortable unless you give me that money "—he then got off the bed, and, I believe, I was standing somewhere near the mantel-piece, but I cannot recollect now, for it produced so much fright—he then came up, and said, "Well, if you can't give me the money, I must have something equivalent to it," and he took the pin from my scarf, a diamond ring from my little finger, and a cambric handkerchief out of my coat pocket—there was a paper parcel on the floor, tied up—he cut the strings of that, to see the contents—he then went to the dressing table drawer, and turned over the things there—he then went to the washhand-stand drawer, and from that he took an old blue silk handkerchief—there were two or three things in that drawer, some rags that I had been accustomed to use in applying poultices to my hand in a case of erysipelas, and the blue silk handkerchief I had used to secure the poultices to my hand—he took that handkerchief out of the drawer, held it up, and said, "Oh, this will do for me"—he then said, "Now I am in a hurry; I want to be off" and he said, "If you give me a £10 note, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in exchange"—I did not make him any reply—he asked me for my watch and chain—he then said, "Well, perhaps you will give me a promissory note for the money "—I looked round the room as if looking for writing materials—not seeing them, I requested him to follow me down stairs—I went into the back sitting-room—I saw ink on the table, but no writing paper—I said, "I have writing-paper up stairs," and under that plea I went to call Mr. Chadwick, who is an inspector of police, lodging in the same house—I informed him of it, and gave the pri<lb/>soner in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I acted as clerk to the Justices at the Police Court, Bow-street—on the prisoner's examination on this charge, he was asked if he had anything to say—he made a statement, which I took down in writing from his lips—after I had done so, I read it over to him, and Mr. Jardine, the Magistrate, put his name to it—this is the examination.—(Reading—" The prisoner says, 'He has charged me wrongfully; I never saw him before last Tuesday week; I then went up and spoke to him, taking him for a friend of mine whom he resembled; I said, "How do you do, sir? you know me?" he said he did not, and ran away. 1 said, "O, nonsense, you do;" and his running away induced me to think that he was the man; and 1 followed him—I became satisfied that he was not the person whom I took him to be, on his passing me twice yesterday; he then came up with a policeman, and gave me in charge. I told him that I had never seen him before, to rob him; he said I had, and gave me in charge.'")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was standing outside the Bank, waiting for a friend of mine, when the prosecutor came up and gave me in charge for robbing him: I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250087"/>
               <p>declared I did not know him, which I did not at the time, till I got to the station-house; and I should not have known him then had I not seen his porter, which made me think it was the man I had spoken to on the 5th of Nov. He gave me in charge for robbing him, which I declared I was innocent of. He says he met me on Sunday night, the 6th of Oct.; that he was waiting for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Tottenham-court-road; that I came up and addressed him, and asked what he was waiting for; that he told me, and that I said there were no omnibuses, but plenty of <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>; and with that he called one, and asked me to get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>. Is it feasible that a gentleman should ask a stranger to get into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with him? How<lb/>ever, he says he asked me to do so, and that we rode to Piccadilly; and as we were going along Piccadilly, I should use some rough language to him inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and say I wanted some money from him, that I asked him for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to go to the station-house? He says he told the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to stop, got out, gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and ran down half-moon-street; that I followed him, and asked him for money, and that he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and his watch and chain. Now, is it feasible that any gentleman would give any lad his money like that, or his watch and chain, under such circumstances as that? With that, he says I told him to go one way and me the other; and he says he went in his fright, and never saw anything of me till the 5th of Nov. I was then coming through the City with a friend of mine, and 1 said to him, "There goes a gentleman that resembles a man who owes me something;" he said, "Why don't you go up to him?" which I did, and said, "How do you do?" I could not see him clearly, not his features; he said, "I don't know you." I said, "Yes, you do know me, sir;" with that be ran away as hard as he could, which made me think it was him; he ran into the office, and nearly slammed my fingers in the door. I waited till the porter came to the door, and said, "Can I speak to the gentleman who has just gone in?" he said, "Which gentleman? there is one just gone out" I said, "No, the one who has just gone in;" he said he did not know who it was. I described him as well as I could; the porter went up stairs; whether he spoke to him I do not know, but he came down again, and said he was gone, and if I wanted him I must come to-morrow; as he was talking, I saw the prosecutor come down with a light; I then had a good view of him, and he turned to the door at the left. I said I would come to-morrow, but I did not go near the house since; and the next time be charged me with robbing him. If I was the man, why did he not know me on the 5th of Nov., and give me into custody then as well as a fortnight after? He says I had a white coat on; they have been to my lodging, and I never bad a white coat; and if I rode in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with a gentleman for only three or four minutes through the streets, and had a white coat on, would not that make a great deal of difference in my ap<lb/>pearance? How would he know me a month after, in a black coat, so well as that? I have my master here, Mr. James, a shoemaker, whom I work for.</p>

               <p>that time—he was lodging in Gough-street, on the 6th of Oct., with me—that I swear—he was lodging with me about that time—I do not know exactly to a day, because I do not bear those things in mind—the last time I saw him was the first Sunday in Oct.—the last time I saw him when he left my lodgings was on the first Monday in Oct.—he came home very tipsy on the Sunday night, and I told him he should not come home any more, for if he could find money to get drunk with, he could find money to pay me—he did not lodge with me after that—he has not been there since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and keep the Half Moon public-house, in Smithfield. On the 7th of Nov. my family consisted of myself and my servant, Alice Boile—I had no other servant. About half-past eleven o'clock that night a man came in and requested a bed—I told him he could have one, and asked if he would like to walk into the parlour, or if he would like a candle, and go to his bed directly—he said he would like a candle, and go to bed directly—I then called Alice Boile out of the bar, and asked her to stop in the tap-room while I went and got a clean towel—I asked her for a candle, to go up stairs to get it for the bed-room—I left the man and Alice below—I came down immediately—I did not find them together then—the man had just stepped out—he came in again directly—Alice took the candle off the bar, and lighted him up stairs to bed, and I saw no more of him—he had his hat over his eyes, an I leant in a leaning position, looking at the clock, therefore I had not a full view of his face—I am not prepared to swear to the prisoner as being the man—I have a very great belief of it, from the leaning position of the head—I have a strong belief that he is the man, from the stooping position of his head and neck—he generally stands in that position—I have seen him at Guild<lb/>hall,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250090"/>
               <p>and his manner of standing is like that of the person—I do not swear positively to him—the girl came down directly—the house was shot about five minutes before twelve by the clock, and about five minutes after twelve by the clock I went up stairs to my own room—at that time I had only two other inmates, who were cousins of mine, man and wife—they lodged on the second floor, the same floor as myself, in the opposite room—the man was to sleep in the third floor front room—I have a side door, as well as a front door, to my premises—that was bolted, and the front door waslocked, bolted, and barred—when I went up to bed I carried up 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in a yellow canvas bag, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a small tray—there were eight crown-pieces, twelve half-crowns, forty shillings, and twenty sixpences—I put the bag and tray on a chair by my bedside—it was there when I re<lb/>tired to bed—I did not lock or bolt my chamber door, it was only hasped—I was awoke about a quarter-past five in the morning by the ringing of the side door bell—being market morning, I thought they were ringing the bell for me to get up, but finding it continue ringing, I felt alarmed, threw a shawl over my shoulders, and went down stairs—I saw a police<lb/>man at the bottom of the house, and found that he had been ringing the bell—I found the side door open—I immediately ran up stairs into the lodgers' room, and found he was gone—my cousins were in bed—I then went down stairs again, and looked round the bar, but missed nothing from there—I felt ill, and sat down for a few minutes—I afterwards went up stairs for the money for the till, and found the bag containing the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was gone—the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the tray was not gone.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250091"/>
               <p>asked me, about ten minutes to six o'clock, whether I had lost anything, and I said, "I am in very great hopes not;" but I had not then been from my bar—I did not say I had not—I did not tell him I had been awake longer than two hours—mine is a square room, with two windows in it—Alice Boile had been a month in my service—I do not think she saw me put any money in the tray, and take it up with me that night—I could almost swear she did not, for I had it in my apron—she went up with me, and into my room with me, but I generally carry the money rather secretly, under something—she might know it was my habit to carry up money every night, but I do not know—she is not always at the bar when I clear away—she always goes up with me of a night, but I do not put the money away in her presence—I take it up in her pre<lb/>sence—I sence—I very frequently lay it down, and throw my pocket handker<lb/>chief over it, till the servant is gone—I do not sleep with a light in my room—the man had gone up about ten minutes before eleven, and I went up about five minutes past twelve—he could know nothing about my money being in my bed-room, without he was <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> there—no one had any light in their room.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mrs. Lee's service on the 7th of Nov. last, About ten minutes past eleven o'clock that night she called me down to her—there was a man with her—the prisoner is the man—I feel sure of it—I was in his company about ten minutes before I went to bed—I then, by my mistress's desire, lighted him up to bed, and left him in his room—I went up with my mistress, and helped her to undress as usual—I did not see that she carried up any bag of money with her, or know of its being in the room—I did not know whether it was her habit to carry up money into her room—I did not know anything about it—I assisted to make the front and side doors fast—they were made fast—next day, by my mistress's desire, I went with Trew, the policeman, to No. 124, High-street, Wapping—I had observed the dress of the man over night—he had on a blue pilot coat, and a crape hat-band round his hat—he wore his hat over his eyes a good deal—I saw his features—I saw enough of him to be sure of him—when we got to the house at Wapping the front door was knocked at—no one came to that door, but a female servant came out at a side door, and after that the prisoner came out—he had no hat on—as I was going towards Wapping I had given Trew an account of the man who had slept at the house over night—when the prisoner came out I looked at him three times before I was sure of him—I then said, "That is the man that slept at our house last night"—I do not know whether the pri<lb/>soner could hear that—I said it to the policeman—the prisoner was close by—I then said to the prisoner, "You are the man that slept at my mis<lb/>tress's tress's house last night"—he said, "Me sleep at the Half Moon on Mon<lb/>day night?"—no one had mentioned the Half Moon till the prisoner mentioned it—this was on Friday, about half-past twelve o'clock—I am sure he said Monday night, and I said, "No, it was last night"—he did not say anything more—he then went into the house, and the policeman said to him, "Who said anything about the Half Moon?"—he said, "The servant did," meaning me—I had not said so—I had said, "My mistress's house"—he was then taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a City policeman, No. 26. At the time in question, I was No. 455. On Friday, the 8th of Nov., I went with Alice Boile to Wapping, to No. 102 I believe—Child, the beadle of Tower-hill, went with us—on arriving at the house, Child knocked at the door, and some time afterwards the prisoner came out—Child came out of the court, and the prisoner followed him—I saw the girl look at the pri<lb/>soner—I was on the opposite side of the street at that time—I crossed over immediately, and she said, "That is the man that slept at our house last night"—the prisoner was close by her at the time—I then said, "Will you walk inside, sir, if you please, I want to speak to you"—I was in private clothes—in going up stairs he turned round and said to Boile, "What do you say, I slept at the Half Moon, last night"—I then stated that there had been a robbery at the Half Moon in Smithfield, and he was suspected of committing the robbery—no one had mentioned the Half Moon before the prisoner said, "What, do you say I slept at the Half Moon last night?"—I said to the girl at the time, in the prisoner's hearing, "Have you mentioned the sign of the house?" or "the Half Moon?"—I will not be certain which I said—she said, "No"—I then said to Child, "Have you heard it mentioned, Child?"—he said, "No"—and I said, "Nor I"—when I told him the charge he asked me when it was—I said, "Last night"—he said he could prove, by two gen<lb/>tlemen, tlemen, that he was at home last night—I searched both him and his pre<lb/>mises—I</p>

I was on duty at Ealing, about five o'clock at night, on Tuesday, the 12th of Nov., and met the prisoner with a few potatoes in his pocket—I was afterwards engaged in helping to search the prisoner's house—I found there three bushels and a half of wheat, and two sacks—I afterwards searched the prisoner, and found on him a bunch of keys, one of which unlocks Mr. Griffiths' barn-door—the wheat I found in the prisoner's house has some beans in it, and there were some beans in the wheat in the prosecutor's barn, where the prisoner had been at work.</p>

I never kept the box concealed; it was out before other persons; I would not let my friends know, or I would have subpœnaed Mrs. Eaton's mo<lb/>ther, to prove that she has brought me the box repeatedly; my intention never was to keep it.</p>

I am shopwoman to Mr. James Peet, a straw<lb/>hat manufacturer, who lives at Hammersmith—about eleven o'clock, on the 26th of Sept., the prisoner Miller called and ordered some bonnets to be sent to No. 2, Peter's Cottages—there was to be a choice for his lady and her child—I forgot to send them, and the next morning, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner Dawers called and said a gentleman had ordered some bonnets—I said, Yes, and 1 had for<lb/>gotten to send them—(she brought me a card in the name of Miller, but she now calls herself Dawers)—she said she would like to select the bon<lb/>nets that she wished sent, and pointed to one in the window that she would like for herself—I brought it to her, and she ordered me to send that and some others for some young ladies about twenty-six years of age—she selected thirteen, and ordered me to send them and a few others to No. 2, Peter's Cottages—I told her I would send them immediately—she said I need not send them for one hour, she should not return before—I then packed them up and sent them by a boy, and a young person to wait on her—the young person returned, and said the lady was not at home, and she was to call again at seven o'clock—at seven, I sent again, and the servant refused to give them up, and said the ladies could not decide about them till the next morning—I got no bonnets back, nor any money—I sent seventeen bonnets for examination and selection—this is one of the bonnets, the one Dawers pointed out, and said she should like for herself—there was no price put on these bonnets—she did not ask the price—I have never been able to get the other sixteen.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Hammersmith. On the 3rd or 4th of Sept., about the middle of the day, Miller came to me, and said he had taken a place at St. Peter's Cottages for three years, and he wanted some furniture for his best room—he said he had been in business in the silversmith line, and had given it up to his nephew, who would send things for his other rooms—he said he wanted no credit, he paid at the end of every month—he called again when I was not at home—he called again, and I saw him—I showed him the things, and he agreed to have them—they were in an unfinished state—the chairs were not stuffed, and the car<lb/>pets had to be made up—I said it would take nearly the time he named to get them done—he said, "You must get them done by the 27th, or you will not have your money for another month"—he had fixed on a car<lb/>pet, and said I could go at any time, as his housekeeper was always there—I took the carpet, and I thought I would ask the housekeeper a few questions—I saw Edge, and asked her if she knew much of Mr. Miller—she said she had known him for eight years—she said he had been a sil<lb/>versmith, and was retiring, and giving up his business to his nephew, and that Mr. Miller and his wife were going to live there, that he had taken the house for three years, and if he had ordered any things I need not be afraid about the money, as he always paid his money at the latter end of every month; he was a very honourable man, and a man of good pro<lb/>perty; he was sometimes very close in his dealings, but was sure to pay what he had agreed for—through hearing such a good account, I cut off the carpet, and cut it out that day, and took it down to fix it, and got the other things sent down—I did not ask for any money when I took the carpet to fix down—it was a trust for everything till the money was paid—the other things were sent in—I think the last article went in on the 23rd or 24th of Sept., and Edge said Mrs. Miller wished her to order two more pillows, and they were not to be later than the Thursday, and to send in the bill, and they were to be paid for on the Friday; but on the Friday morning, before six o'clock, they were all gone—I trusted Miller on the good account that Edge gave—I could not ask for money in my business before the things were sent home.</p>

Miller came to my shop, and ordered me to make some slippers for him to look at—on a Saturday, two or three days afterwards, ha called again, with a person be called his nephew, a man who is now called Samuel Edge, but who then gave the name of Taylor—they ordered me to make a pair of boots for each of them, and a pair of slippers for Taylor, to correspond with his uncle's, and they were to be sure to come home on the following Thursday, as they wanted to go into the country particularly—on the following Wednesday or Thurs<lb/>day Miller came to my shop, and ordered me to take some boots for the ladies to try on—I took a bag<lb/>full, and when I got to the house I saw Char<lb/>lotte lotte Edge—she asked me in, and I was shown into a nice room, well fur<lb/>nished—I thought it looked very respectable—she took the boots up stairs—she said the ladies were not up, or were dressing, I forget which—I gave her the bag full of boots, and she came and said they had selected two pairs—she brought a little girl with her into the parlour, and said, "Now fit this little girl with a pair,"which I did—they had selected two pairs of boots up stairs, and one pair for the child—Edge told me to come at six o'clock, and bring some slippers—I do not think I had told the price of the boots, but I trusted for them till six o'clock.</p>

"—I did not see Miller for a day or two, and I wrote him a note—I afterwards gave him possession of the house—I should not have let him had it if I had not had that account from Samuel Edge—the day before Miller quitted the cottage I saw Samuel Edge in the garden with Miller.</p>

I saw the prisoner at No. 16, Ladbrook<lb/>terrace—I met him as a gentleman—I took a number of pocket-books, and he selected some for a young lady who was going to boarding<lb/>school—I wished for payment, and he said, "Oh, you can leave them till Monday and I will select from them "—I left three till</p>

I am in the service of Richard Cook, who has two shops, one in Constitution-row, and the other at Pindar-place—I am ser<lb/>vant at the Pindar-place shop, which is a fishmonger's—the other shop is a cheesemonger's—Rackham was my master's errand<lb/>boy, and was em<lb/>ployed ployed at both shops—my master's stable is at the back of the Pindar-place shop. On Wednesday, the 30th of Oct., I hung up in the stable a basket which had nothing in it—the next morning I found the basket hanging there still, and it had six herrings, and some bacon and lard in it—on the Friday morning I showed the articles to my master—the basket was hanging still in the stable—I looked over my stock, and missed seve<lb/>ral herrings—the bacon and lard were not under my care—about a quarter past ten o'clock at night on the 4th of Nov. I saw Smith standing at the corner of the gateway, and he and Rackham went down to the stable to feed the horse—my master was then on the opposite side of the way, and I was at the corner of the shop—in about twenty minutes I saw the pri<lb/>soners come out of the stable, and Smith had the basket with him—each of them bid one another good night, and Rackham went into the shop, and Smith went away—I called him back and asked him what he had got in the basket—he said he had got nothing—I took it from him, and found these things—I asked him where he got them—he said he bought them in the street—I brought him back to the shop and my master came in—Rackham owned to his guilt, and Smith said he had received things on two different occasions before from Rackham.</p>

I saw Jones come to my master's cellar<lb/>door with a gallon can, and hand it down to Adams, who was at work in the cellar, making a drain—Adams filled it with porter, and handed it up to Jones, and he took it away—Caton was in the cellar with Adams at the time—I went up to clear some bricks away—I went into the cellar in two or three minutes, and Adams had a half-gallon can—there was a bottle there, and the pot-boy was pouring it into the bottle—Caton was in the cellar—Mr. Dennis's brother came down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Moor-gardens, Moorfields. I was at the Parr's Head on the Wednesday, and heard about this fight—I was not talking to Wood about the watch, but she called me to the passage, and while I was talking to her, Smith came to the passage, and said to her, "If you keep your tongue still, and do not say any more than what you have said, I will reward you"—he then called me aside and said, "I have got the watch, and it is all right; could you direct me where I could get a solicitor for George?"—I said, "I do not know any one but Mr.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Sexton—he keeps a tailor's shop in Compton-street. On the night of the 26th of Nov., the prisoner came home with my husband, who was in liquor—the prisoner appeared to be sober—he wished to have some clothes—I begged him to come at another time, and have dealings with my husband, as he was then in liquor—he said he had ten sovereigns in his pocket, and he wished to have some clothes that night—he said he had become a neighbour, and had taken the house next door—I asked if it was Mr. Bradbury's—he said it was—he again said he wished to have the clothes that night—I took a satin waistcoat out of the drawer, and put it on the counter—he took the waistcoat up—I then said, "Have you taken possession of the house?"—he said, "No, I live at No. 30, Compton-street, and I have lately come from Bexley, in Kent"—I was then afraid that he was the person who had duped us out of a suit of clothes some months ago, and I laid the waistcoat in the window—our present landlord's son then came in, and knowing that the suit of clothes which we were duped out of was tried on in his house, I ordered him away—I went to the door to order him out, and my husband took the coat off the block—he laid it on the counter, and it was on the prisoner's back, and he was off with the coat and waistcoat in a moment—he had put the waistcoat on over his own waistcoat, and put the coat on, and left his velveteen jacket behind him in the fright.</p>

               <p>Sarah Brown says, "On Saturday night I went to sell these bolts at Mr. Armfield's; I gave him these bolts into his hand; he put them into the scale; he had no sooner done that, than the constable entered, and he took the bolts from the scale, and held one in each hand; the constable said, 'Hand them over here; I am a police-constable;' he then said to me, 'Where is the money he has given you?" I said I had none, and he said he would swear he had seen him pay me, and how much was it; he paid me none; but he was to have paid me eightpence for them; I had my hand in my pocket at the time the constable spoke; I showed him what money I had; I had three half-crowns, four shillings, and fourpence three<lb/>farthings; farthings; I had not a sixpence about me; he then said, it was all d—d non<lb/>sense; he knew better; he then went round the counter, and wanted to know if Mr. Armfield had any more stowed away; he turned up a bag, and said, 'Oh, I see you have no more of them;' he said he was sure I had been carrying on the game a long time; he then said, 'Come down to the Poplar station with me;' I then did as he said; I offered him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. not to take me, as I had never been in a station-house before in my life; in going along, he pressed me to know how much Mr. Armfield had given me for them; I told him I had not a sixpence nor eightpence in any way; he told me the inspector would not keep me in the station-house; he told me to say that the man had bought them, and the inspector would let me go; he then said, 'Did he pay you for them?' being in hopes I should not be locked up, I said, 'He did;' and it was fear alone made me say so; but I never received a farthing from him; I told him my husband worked anywhere, and I gave him the direction at the station-house; I took my money out, and he laid it on the table."</p>

The greater part of my life has been spent in business, and having some small resources for old age, I thought I was independent; but in consequence of calami<lb/>ties, one of which was fire, I was reduced, in forty-eight hours, from ✗ ence to penury. I was unable to follow the profession I had been in, and was engaged as commission-agent to two gentlemen of the highest respect<lb/>ability. ability. Mr. West employed me to find out parties that he gave me in<lb/>struction had property in the Court of Chancery. I had to walk very often from one part of London to the other to find the right parties; if I found them I had a small commission; if not, I had my labour for my pains Mr. West lives at No. 18, Throgmorton-street, and I do not consider I am the responsible person in this case. I only acted according to my instruc<lb/>tions, and am entirely innocent of any guilty intention, in reference to the orders that are given me by my employer: through not being able to In<lb/>verse, I have not been able to get Mr. West and other witnesses for my defence; I came here not prepared for my defence, Mr. West having employed me. I made numbers of applications, and where the party has not been the right heir to the property, it has been no charge or expense to them. I do not know whether they are entitled to the property or not; that has to be proved, according to the nature of the case. I beg to state, that the answer to each of the cases that have come this morning is to be given in Nov., and without waiting for the expiration of that month, I was brought here without witness or evidence, or even the evidence of Mr. West. I am brought here like a man bound hand and foot, and am rendered totally defenceless. If I had employed a party to embody these particulars, I could prove I am not guilty of the charge. I leave my case for your consideration. I solemnly declare I had no intention to wrong any individual; and I trust you will give me the benefit of your merciful consideration.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Royal-hill, Greenwich. On the 15th of Nov. I was in Nash's beer-shop—the prisoner came in, and said, "Mrs. Nash, I have got an order for six pots of beer, from a young man named Bush, who works opposite the Circus"—he produced a paper, but Mrs. Nash still doubted it—she had only a gallon can—she said, "This can will not hold it; you have a half-gallon can at the building, you ought to have brought that with you"—he said, "Oh, that will hold it"—she put four pots and a pint into the gallon can, and desired me to take the rest down to the building with him—when I got to the comer of the Circus, he said, "Stop; do you see that man going up the plank on the scaffolding, that is our foreman; I do not want him to see us, so you go round that way, and you will find young Bush at the further end; tell him to come round to the back of the building to me;"'and when I got to Bush, he was astonished—the prisoner took the can of beer down to his lodging, instead of going to the back of the building.</p>

               <p>"There is no name signed to the paper, and what can they make of it?"—on going to the station, he said he took the beer home to his own lodg<lb/>ing—that was the day after it happened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The prosecutor would not wait till I received the money for it on Saturday night. At half-past two o'clock, on the Friday, Bush gave me an order for three pots of beer; the rest of the men said, "Are not you going to send us a drop?" I said, "I don't know." I was intoxicated, and not capable of writing. I met a young man, called Roving Dan, who 1 was very happy to see, understanding he had been killed in the tunnel. I said to him, "Go back to Bush, and ask him to make this order into six quarts of beer." I thought he went to him, but it seems he did not; he returned to me with this paper. 1 did not know it was not Bush's writing. I went to the public-house, and told the publican I had an order for six pots, and the man came with me with the three pints. I told him to go to Bush and say I had received the six pots of beer; but he did not return, and I went home with it to my lodging to treat the young man. I was willing to pay for the beer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bailey, a plumber, and live in Beresford-street, Woolwich. A female took my furnished lodging on the 14th of Oct., and the prisoner came and resided with her as her husband—they staid six weeks—on the 5th of Nov. I missed the articles stated from their room—I afterwards saw the female and the prisoner in the policeman's presence, and said I should like to see if my property was safe, for I had my doubts—she was confused—I said, "Probably you have made away with them "—she directly laid the duplicates on the table, and the policeman took possession of them.</p>

I hung out some clothes in my yard, and saw them safe at nine o'clock at night—I fastened the back door, and at that time the copper was safe in the back-kitchen—the door was only latched—the policeman brought the clothes to me at near two o'clock in the morning—they they were the articles stated, and are all my husband's property—the pri<lb/>soner was then in custody—I missed the copper—it had been fixed with mortar and bricks—it has since been refixed.</p>

On the 24th of Oct., I was disturbed about half-past one o'clock in the morning, and beard a something rumbling in the passage between my house and the prosecu<lb/>tor's—it sounded to me like copper—I got but of bed, threw up the window, and saw a man who had just passed my window a little to the left—I then saw a second person, the prisoner, come out of the passage—I hallooed out, "Halloo, mate, what is <hi rend="italic">up</hi> there?"—he made no answer—I sprang my rattle, and the policeman flew to the corner—the prisoner was met by the police in less than five minutes, and brought back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live at No. 117, High-street, Southwark. The prisoner came to my shop on Tuesday, the 19th of Nov., to examine some pins—he looked at some diamond pins, and selected one, on which he left 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit, stating that his brother would call in the morning and pay the difference—the price of that pin was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after he had left the shop we looked over the cushion and discovered a pin of the value of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. missing—he came again the following morning to look at some more diamond pins—my suspicions were naturally aroused, and I counted the number, which was eighteen, and placed them on a cushion before him—during the time a customer came into the shop, and entered into conversation—the prisoner also entered into conversation with him—while the gentleman was in conversation with me, the prisoner took one diamond pin from off the cushion, and secreted it up his sleeve—I saw him—immediately after he had done so, he called my attention to one of the pins which he had previously been looking at, and wished me to send that pin to his brother's house—he particularly wished I should bring it myself with the pin on which he had left the deposit the day before—I took down the address which he gave me, "No. 5, Mary Ann-place, South<lb/>ward bridge-road," which I afterwards discovered to be a fictitious address—I counted the pins after I had seen him put the one up his sleeve, and there were only seventeen—while taking the address down, I rang the bell for my assistant—the prisoner still had the diamond pin up his sleeve—I could not see it up his sleeve, but I am quite positive he put it there—I called my assistant twice after that, and while calling him the prisoner dropped the pin from his sleeve on to a ledge on the counter—I am quite positive of that, and I am quite positive the pin had not been there pre<lb/>vious to my calling my assistant, for I bad distinctly seen the spot where the pin was afterwards found, and there was nothing on it—I did not hear the pin fall—I charged him then with having taken the pin, and also one the day before, and I said in a hurried manner, "If you will give me back the one you took the day before, I will not send for a policeman—he denied it, and I immediately sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—I went to No. 5, Mary Ann-place, and they knew no such person as Mr. Henry Dixon—the landlord said a Mr. V. Jay did live at the house, but no Mr. Henry Dixon—the prisoner had said I was to take them to Mr. V. Jay, and ask for Mr. Henry Dixon, who was his brother—I have nobody here from that house.</p>

               <p>had time to do so—they were placed one, two, three, four, and five, so that I could count them—I counted them five or six times while on the counter, expecting every time to miss one—when you had put the pin up your sleeve I had an opportunity of looking along the ledge where you afterwards placed it—I could see it was not there—you were going out, and I was anxious to prevent it—I could not see the ledge when I was behind the counter—the gentleman had left the shop before you put the pin there—I did not see you put it there—I saw you put it up your sleeve—I did not count the pins at the time I took them out of the window the first day, or I should have discovered it—it was the second day—there was eighteen—I did not count them the first day, but one particular pin marked 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was gone—that is how I know it was missing—the depositions were not taken down in Court before you on Wednesday—when you were taken up I asked Mr. Cottingham to be kind enough to remand you that I might go round to the trade, thinking I might discover some other case, and I found you had taken two pins from Mr. Hayes, of Farringdon-street, and had only come out of prison four days—the officer from Giltspur-street gave me that information—I counted my pins at the time I gave you into custody, and told you there were only seventeen—no pin was found on you—I saw you place the pin up your sleeve—I did not see it when it was up there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I would first call your attention to the manner in which the prosecutor acts towards me when he accuses me of felony. He first endeavours to extort money from me by threatening to give me in charge for felony, and because I would not compromise the matter for 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he gives me in custody. He says himself he offered to compromise it; surely you cannot believe that that man comes here for justice, for he offers to compromise the matter; does he want justice, or to compromise jus<lb/>tice? if he is a respectable man, and no doubt he is, as the keeper of a jeweller's shop, does it show respectability on his part to attempt to com<lb/>pound a felony? I know nothing of the law myself, or perhaps he would be liable to punishment for it. I shall leave it in your hands. My friends are respectable and monied persons, but I did not wish them to know where I was, or to have my name in the public papers, which induced me to give a false name when I was taken up. I can refer to Davis and Company, furriers, Bull's Head Court; they know my father very well. I wrote to my father, saying that I was in difficulty, but have not let him know where I am. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court. I fully expect if I am brought in guilty, that I shall be transported; the officers of Newgate have many of them told me so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames police—the de<lb/>ceased wan my father—he was a waterman, and had been so many years—he was sixty-six years of age. I was on the Surrey shore on the 25th of Oct., about ten minutes before ten o'clock in the morning, and saw him leave the Surrey shore about thirteen or fourteen minutes before ten, with four persons in a skiff with him—it was a boat of such a size as he could manage properly—I was standing on the causeway at Church-stairs, Ro<lb/>therhithe—the tide was nearly half flood—this was in the Pool—after he had left I noticed the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer, No. 6—it was coming up with the tide, and going at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour, in my opinion—the proper rate for steamers navigating the Pool is about five miles an hour—the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> is a Woolwich boat—at the time I first saw the <hi rend="italic">Water<lb/>man</hi> coming up, my father was, I should say, better thun two-thirds across the water, and about 150 yards from the steamer—I lost sight of my father's boat on my attention being called to the steamer—there was a tier of ves<lb/>sels between my father's boat and the steamer—there were about six</p>

               <p>vessels in the tier at that time—there were no vessels whatever obstructing the channel of the river—the steamer seemed to be making a straight course for the Upper Tunnel-pier—that is not a slanting course from one pier to another—they take their course from below the Lower Tunnel-pier, in general—supposing she was coming from there, she would have to cross the river—she was going straight towards the Upper Tunnel-pier from where I saw her first, which was off King Edward's-stairs—that is, at the lower side of the Lower Tunnel-pier—the Tunnel stairs are on the Middle<lb/>sex side—when I first saw the steamer, her bows were slanting towards the Tunnel-pier—King Edward's-stairs are lower down the river than the Tunnel-pier, and on the Middlesex side—I observed the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> No. 6 making a very heavy <hi rend="italic">careen</hi> on one side, leaning on one side, and I ob<lb/>served a skiff come under her stern momentarily afterwards, and saw three or four persons struggling in the water from the skiff—that was just above the Lower Tunnel-pier—they were going towards the Upper Tunnel-pier—there are two Tunnel piers, which are near about 100 yards apart—there was a schooner moored just above the Lower Tunnel-pier—I did not ob<lb/>serve the position of that schooner either then or afterwards—I went off in my own boat, came up to the skiff, and found it was my father's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman. On Friday, the 25th of Oct., I was on the Lower Tunnel-pier, and saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, No. 6, coming up the river—she was going at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour—I do not know whether that is her full speed or not—there was a schooner moored to the Lower Tunnel-pier—I had moored her there some time before—I saw a skiff and a man rowing—the steam-boat struck it—she was not above her own length from the skiff when I first saw her—she was just on the point of striking—I did not see whether it had at all altered its direc<lb/>tion before it struck the boat—the skiff was twenty-one feet long—the speed of the steamer was not diminished to my sight—I had seen the steamer before—at the time I saw the skiff the steamer was going in the same direction as she had been before—she had not altered her course from the time I first saw her—when I first saw her she was about 150 feet from where I stood—it was not half a minute between my first seeing her and her striking the skiff—I have been acquainted with the river for some time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is, in your judgment, the proper rate for going in the Pool? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four miles against the tide, I think it is; and six miles with it—I dare say the tide itself would drive a barge along at the rate of four miles an hour, with a person just now and then to straighten her or turn her round—in my judgment there ought to be an increase of only two miles an hour put on by the steamers—the schooner that I had moored caused some eddy; but at the time the skiff was overturned she had not come within the influence of that eddy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master mariner, belonging to the schooner <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi>—on Friday, the 25th of October, she was lying at the Tunnel pier—whilst there I saw the skiff and steam-boat, and saw them come into colli<lb/>sion—the steam-boat was going, I should think, at about eight miles an hour, as near as I could judge, when she was passing our ship—when the boats came together I was, I should think, between eighty and ninety feet from them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were on board the schooner when this happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the quarter-deck—I had run ashore that morning—at the time in question my vessel was just lifted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250202"/>
               <p>astern, but was hard and fast by the head—her stern projected about ten feet beyond the Lower Tunnel-pier, as near as I can calculate—there were ropes made fast to the Tunnel pier—she is one hundred tons burden—her canvass was all struck and stowed—her boom projected about four feet over the stern—it is a smooth stern—we went there about high water about three o'clock in the morning, from some accident—we were going to discharge, and another vessel came and took her anchor up—about nine or ten in the morning we were lying with her stern right athwart the stream—I observed the steamer come up—I did not see the skiff till she was close to the steam-boat—she was about seventy or eighty feet from us, higher up the river, between the Upper and Lower Tunnel-pier, inside of us—there was a very strong eddy created by the position in which my schooner lay across the tide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the effect of that eddy, on a small boat, coming from the southward to the northward, if it got into it, be to carry it out again into the stream, instead of enabling it to go to Wapping Dock-stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes, and it would affect a ship as well as a small boat—I was in it no later than this passage up—if it had not been for the eddy I think the skiff would have made the stairs easily enough—I saw the skiff when she turned round in the eddy, towards the steam-boat—that was the effect of the eddy on her—that eddy would not be perceivable to a vessel coming straight up the river, not till she got past us—the schooner's stem would shut out the ap<lb/>pearance of the eddy, all the way above it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, in your judgment, from the effect the eddy had on the skiff, could the accident have been avoided by the commander of the steamer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the accident was all occasioned by the eddy—if the boat had not turned round towards the steamer, I think she would have cleared it—the eddy was the occasion of turning it round—I do not think the master of the steamer could have avoided the accident—he could not have per<lb/>ceived the eddy until he came past us—I did not observe the helmsman starboard the helm when the small boat was seen—I could not see any negligence or carelessness on the part of the captain—I am in no way in<lb/>terested in steam-boats—they are as much injury to me as they are to any person—if the small boat was coming in the direction that has been stated, the effect of the eddy would be to catch her head, and <hi rend="italic">cant</hi> her round, and saw that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you think the master of the steamer could not have avoided it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not from the time of my seeing it—they were that close together when I saw them, that he could not have avoided it—I should think they were not more than the length of the boat apart—I think there was—not then sufficient time to back the steamer—if she had been coming at the rate of but five or six miles an hour, I do not think it could have been avoided, they were too close together when I saw them—they were almost in the act of striking—there is, perhaps, about 200 fathoms' breadth between the Tunnel-pier and the tier of vessels on the other side of the river, but the steamer was coming to the pier where she was going to land her passengers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, employed by the Tunnel-pier Com<lb/>pany at the Lower Tunnel-pier. On the 25th of Oct. I saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No</hi>. 6, coming up before ten o'clock in the morning—I saw a skiff with persons in it—it was about forty or fifty yards from the steamer when I first saw it—I saw some man in the boat, get up and wave his hand to the steamer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the position of the steamer and the skiff at that time, could the steamer, in your opinion, have avoided it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if he had altered his helm, by starboarding the helm, or stopping the engine, might have saved it—there was nothing to prevent them taking a left-hand course—I saw a man on the paddle-box—if he had been looking out he must have seen the boat—he sung out to them, "Hoy, hoy"—he did not stop the steamer at all—he kept on his course—I saw an eddy from the schooner that was lying aground—that eddy could not have affected the skiff at all—she was away from it—she was in the tide's way—if she had been in the eddy, the steamer could not have got at her at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is a rival company, is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they are in conjunction now—they go to different piers—there is no opposition now—the two com<lb/>panies have agreed together.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, till you got beyond the end of the schooner you were protected from the tide running up, in some degree by the pier and schooner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by the eddy—the schooner was between me and the main run of the tide—when I got beyond the eddy the tide turned my head out—I had three passengers at first—neither of them are here—it had more effect on the boat then, but it acted differently as we were going a different way—the heavier the boat, the more power the eddy would have upon it—she would be deeper in the water, and the eddy runs quicker under the water than on the surface.</p>

                  </hi>. I was master of the <hi rend="italic">Orana</hi> steam-boat, running to Ipswich—I was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> No. 6 steamer, on Friday morning, the 25th Oct.—I saw a schooner lying aground by the Lower Tunnel pier—I saw a skiff after we passed the schooner—I did not see it before because my attention was not called to it—I cannot ex<lb/>actly say what distance she was from the steam-boat as we passed the schooner, it was so momentary—she was not above her own length and a half from the steam-vessel—my attention was called to her by the master calling out to ease the vessel, as soon as we got abreast of the stern of the</p>

               <p>schooner—that order was instantly obeyed—the schooner occasioned a very great eddy—the skiff was in the eddy, and seemed unmanageable altogether with it—if I had been in command of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> myself, in my judgment I could not have avoided the accident, nor could any other man on the river.</p>

I was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer on the 25th of Oct.—I saw the schooner aground by the Lower Tunnel-pier—I was standing on the starboard side of the pad<lb/>dle-box, just before it—I saw the skiff, I should suppose, about half a minute before we rounded the schooner's stern—as soon as I saw the skiff, I heard the orders, "Ease her," "Stop her," and "Turn her astern," given by the master—those orders were given in succession; I suppose, in half a second, as soon as he could repeat them—the skiff was in the eddy when I saw her—the eddy had a great effect on her—nobody has the power of pulling in a boat when it gets into an eddy—she was quite un<lb/>manageable—she was turned round towards the steamer, not exactly round—in my judgment, the eddy, and nothing else, caused the collision—I can give no other account—had no schooner been there, and nothing to cause the eddy, the boat would have gone into the stairs before the steamer found her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate on board the Waterman steamer, No. 6. I was on board on the 25th of Oct.—I saw the skiff when I was abreast of the schooner's stern—the first thing I did was to hail the skiff.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR J.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250208"/>
               <p>her, stop her"—I believe those orders were obeyed—I ran to pick up a boat-hook for the purpose of defending the boat off if she came nigh us, which she did—I saw the boat fly out into the eddy, and then ran, and picked up the boat-hook—I could not keep her off—I was there in time to do so, but the boat rowing towards us, and coming out in the eddy rapidly, and our boat keeping way at the time, I had no power to keep her off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear any orders given about altering your course? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The word "Starboard" was given—I believe that was before the words "Ease I her, stop her"—I believe the man at the helm put the helm a starboard by the course I saw her come—I was not looking out, I was looking at the boat at the time, but judging from the head of the boat, and the way she went, I judged the helm must have been starboarded, otherwise her head would not have come out from the shore as it did—the boat would have gone under the wheel before, had it not been for the man pulling with one hand and stopping the other—that was a proper direction to give in order to avoid a collision.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he called out, "Starboard" just before "Ease her, stop her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, we were then so close to the boat that by the time I got up the boat-hook she was striking against us, at the time the helm was starboarded the boat was about her own length from us, about twenty-three feet—the object of starboarding the helm was to clear the boat if possible—if that had been done when we were fifty yards off, we might have got further out of her way, her head could have been thrown more off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if at the time when you hailed the boat, when she was unman<lb/>ageable, your helm had been starboarded, your vessel would have cleared her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The boat was not unmanageable at the time I first saw her—she was rowing down fair in the tide—she was not in the eddy when I first saw her—I do not think we should have got clear of her if our helm had been starboarded at the time I hailed her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you tried to do that at twenty feet which would be impossible in fifty yards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If it had not been so we should have struck the boat in the other bow, by backing we threw her head rather more in shore, whereas we should have struck her on the other bow had it not been so—I believe I was the first person that called out—I did not notice that the prisoner called out or took any notice of her—the first I heard him say was, "Starboard the helm"—that was too late, because the eddy had then taken the boat's head—if there had been nothing but the true tide she would have cleared us, had we been going as fast as we could pos<lb/>sibly</p>

                  </hi>, I am a surgeon, and live at 38, Stamford-street, Lambeth. I knew Mrs. Brenton, the deceased—I was called to attend her about the 17th of Aug., and I attended her in the delivery of female child on the 20th of Aug.—she left her bed after that at about the ordinary period—she had a very good time—it was quite a natural labour—I believe it was not her first child, but I never attended her before—after leaving her bed she was attacked with rheumatism—I think she left her bed about the third week, or probably rather before—I do not know how long after leaving her bed she returned to it—I think several days, but I was not there all the time—I merely called in occasionally to see how she was, after being attacked with rheumatism—my attendance then recommenced—she was then keeping her bed—I left town on the 25th of Sept. I think, and left the case in charge of Mr. Saunders—I returned on the 10th of Oct., and on that evening I saw the deceased with her father, whom I was then introduced to, and Mr. Saunders—she was then in a state of almost insensibility—she was paralyzed in the right arm, and the left leg appeared paralyzed—she had spasms of the muscles of the jaw, producing what is commonly called locked-jaw—she had a very low feeble pulse—she could only be aroused to answer a question or two, not a sequence of questions—I was shown a wound which was then sloughing on her back—it was about two inches long and one wide—it was a slough in the centre with a red margin, and shading off to the natural colour of the skin—it was on the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>, over the lower bone of the back, not quite the lowest—Mr. Brenton returned with roe to my house for medicine, and he said, seeing I was returned, and being his wife's medical attendant, he thought it right to state to me what had occurred on that particular even<lb/>ing in question, that he was desirous of having intercourse with his wife, which she resisted, and thinking it arose from ill temper, or words to that effect, he had persisted, and was exceedingly sorry for the results—I think he remarked that he thought it rather extraordinary the bruise on the back</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250211"/>
               <p>had not been discovered by the medical men on their first attendance after the 3rd—I am not certain whether it was at that period, or on any future occasion, that that occurred—Mrs. Brenton died on the 19th of Oct.—I was not present at her death—she was dead when I called that day—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the morning of the inquest, the Monday following, and the day previous—it occupied many hours—we took a portion one day, and a portion the next—Mr. Saunders was pre<lb/>sent with me on the first day, and Mr. Fisher, Mr. Saunders, and myself on the second day, the day of the inquest—the father of the deceased was not present—I believe he was in the house a portion of the time, but not in the room—(<hi rend="italic">referring to his minutes</hi>)—I first opened' the skull—on removing the skull, I saw nothing of any importance on the outer surface of the brain—there was an effusion of about two ounces and a half of serum in the arachnoid sac, which is one of the cavities of the brain—that was more than the ordinary quantity—there were no external marks of injury on the head—the vessels of the brain were in a turgid state, more particularly on the left side, where there was a slight degree of adhesion of the membranes of the brain—there was about two drachms of serum in the ventricle—that was not material—that was all I saw the first day—on the second day's examination, I saw external marks of sloughing over the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>, which I have spoken of as having seen when she was alive—the vessels of the spinal cord, or the marrow, were congested, having patches of red on the top—there were coagula of blood at different portions of the spine, that extended, in different places, from the last dorsal to the cervical ver<lb/>tebree, that is, from the bone of the back to the bone of the neck—then were two dark marks under each knee—the spinal marrow was in a state of inflammation—the symptoms I have mentioned would indicate that inflam<lb/>mation, mation, and others, which showed themselves previously to death, tender<lb/>ness ness progressing up the spine, and pain, evidenced by flinching on pres<lb/>sure, up the spine externally—I first discovered that tenderness at the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>, and some portion of the <hi rend="italic">os nominata</hi>, the bones which form the inside of the hip, or the smaller bones of the pelvis—it extended then up to the first dorsal bone of the back—on further examination I found that it extended further up the dorsal—the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi> bone was exceedingly tender, so that she could not bear pressure on it, and flinched whenever it was touched—inflammation was the cause of that tenderness—the bone was also enlarged—I attribute that, also, to the inflammation—after death I found that the surface of the bone, immediately under the slough, was dark, as if it had lost its vitality, as if it had been mortified during life—there was a degree of <hi rend="italic">cares</hi>, or softening of the bone immediately under it—that state of the bone was decidedly connected with the wound that I had observed externally—they acknowledged the same cause—I attribute the death to inflammation, or irritation of the spinal cord—I presume when it extended as far as the origin of the phrenic nerve, the nerve by which we breathe that that was the immediate cause of death—there had evidently been pressure on the spinal marrow from the coagula which was formed there—when the phrenic nerve is affected, life will very soon become extinct—if the phrenic nerve was paralyzed it would cease to act on the diaphragm, and then the diaphragm losing its power, instant death would happen—I suppose that was the cause of death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you tell what would be the difference between a person dying from apoplexy and from concussion of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, if I attended from an early period, I could, no doubt, form an opinion—the appearances of the deceased's head did not indicate sufficient symptoms of apoplexy—the great mischief here was in the spine, and my previous knowledge of the case made me suppose so the more—I saw nothing in the head to produce apoplexy—when I observed the wound on the spine I did not attribute it to the effect of disease—not at any time.</p>

I am a nurse—I attended Mrs. Brenton from the 19th of Aug. up to the time of her death—I remember the night of the 3rd of Oct.—I left Mrs. Brenton at eleven o'clock that night—I left Mr. Brenton in the bedroom with her—I went into the front parlour—they were in the back parlour—I slept in the front parlour that night—after I had been there ten minutes I heard Mrs. Brenton say, "You may pinch me, or take pieces out of me, but I will die before I will give in to you"—I heard a scuffling first of all, and that expression directly, at the tame time—the scuffling continued about an hour, from eleven till twelve—I did not hear Mr. Brenton say anything—I heard no other remark from Mrs. Brenton in that hour—they were quiet for a little while, and then I heard them begin again—that was about a quarter after twelve—I heard her call him, "You wretch," and "a beast"—she said, if she had had Cobley, he would not hare used her in that way—I heard nothing else—that was the last I heard—I heard no sounds or any groaning, that I swear—I have never stated so—the baby, six weeks old, was in the room—it was crying in the course of the night, two or three times, and I heard Mr. Brenton speak to it, and hushing it—he was crying "Hush"—about half-past six or seven in the morning I knocked at their door—Mr. Brenton told me to come in—I leant over and took the baby out of the bed—Mr. Brenton was in bed at the time—I saw Mrs. Brenton—I asked her what was the matter, but received no answer—she was in an insensible state, but I had seen her so several times—after this I left the room, and went into the front room with the, child—I prepared the breakfast at eight o'clock, and took it in—Mrs. Brenton did not get up to eat any—she was not well enough to take any—Mr. Brenton got up about a quarter to eight, and went into the front parlour, and took breakfast at the same table with me—I did not put any question to him about Mrs. Brenton—I did not say a word to him about what I had heard—I am married—I attended Mrs. Brenton all this time—she was in a very weak, debilitated state, and had been so during the eighteen months I had at<lb/>tended her—Mr. Brenton went out about nine that morning—I told Mrs. Baker, the landlady, what had taken place, as soon as he had gone out—it might be twenty minutes after he was gone, I cannot say exactly—Mrs. Baker did not send for a medical man on seeing her—she did not do any<lb/>thing—we had a medical man, who always came, every day, about twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>or twice in that time, but not more—he then went away again, and re<lb/>turned in a fortnight—he then slept with Mrs. Brenton—this happened within a day or two after the six weeks—the first night he came home after the month, she wished me to go home and sleep, because Mr. Brenton was coming to sleep with her—I did not sleep in the parlour that time—there are very thin folding-doors between the parlours—she was always ailing—at the time Mr. Brenton came home at the end of the month I asked her whether she was in a fit state for him to sleep with her, and she said the was as well as she ever was in her life—I went to her mother's to sleep for three nights before this happened, as she wished me—the first and only night I slept in the front parlour, when Mr. Brenton was sleeping in the back parlour with his wife, was the night this happened—he had been home some nights before, sleeping with her, and I was away from the par<lb/>lour lour on those nights, because Mrs. Brenton desired me—she told me her hus<lb/>band was coming to sleep with her, as she had said before—I did not speak to her about her weak state then—I thought there was no, occasion—she got the black eye by tumbling down when intoxicated—she got so very often during the whole time I knew her, except when she was confined—I do not suppose she ever went a day without having six or seven quarterns unknown to her husband, end when I would not fetch it, she would send her little girl, nine years old, and when she was not at home she would send the potboy—that was not while she was at Mrs. Baker's—she had not been at Mrs. Baker's above three weeks before she was confined—she did not get drunk while she was at Mrs. Baker's—she left it off when she was confined—there was nothing in the scuffling I heard which induced me to suppose any violence was used—it was nothing more than might take place between husband and wife—I did not like to interpose as I was not called—had I heard any blow given, or anything of that kind, I should have gone in directly, but I did not—the first place at which she was liv<lb/>ing, where she used to get drunk, was at No. 18, Woodbridge-street, Clerkenwell, and the next was No. 24, Windsor-terrace, City-road.</p>

               <p>in the evening—I was there at eight o'clock—I understood he was coming to see her that night—she was treated for concussion of the brain that night—this was on Friday—nothing particular occurred until the fol<lb/>lowing Monday but a progress of the diseased action—I saw her twice every day during the whole of her illness—on Monday I found that there was a morbid action of the bladder and rectum, a paralysis of the two muscles which contain the matter of those parts; and on seeing her endea<lb/>vouring to move her leg, I found there was a particular contraction of the left leg, so that she could not turn it over—it was a morbid action—I could not account on the first day for the locked jaw, because that arises from a different cause to concussion of the brain; but when I saw that same action of the leg, I then concluded that there was something the matter with the back—I mentioned that, and I heard the prisoner, on hearing me do so, desire the nurse to tell me that she had a sloughing in the back—I then had her turned over, and examined the back, and there I saw a morbid action about the size of a crown-piece, or not so large pro<lb/>bably, perhaps about as large as half-a-crown—there was a vesicle, and the morbid action of sloughing was going on—from the appearance of the parts, and knowing that the locked jaw, in all probability, arose from some injury of a remote nerve, I concluded at once that a blow had been in<lb/>flicted on that part, the left leg and thigh being in the same morbid state as the locked jaw; and I beg to observe, that a paralysis of the bladder and rectum always accompanies an injury to the spinal marrow at that part of the back—it was on the lower part of the back, on the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>—that is a part of the <hi rend="italic">lumbar</hi> region—a concussion cannot take place without a blow—I have seen many concussions of the spine, but I never saw one without a blow—the very term itself signifies that—it is a shock—a concussion necessarily implies external force.</p>

                  </hi>. I attended Mrs. Brenton, in place of Mr. Laver, when he was out of town—I saw her on the 3rd of Oct.—she was better on that day, and I recommended her to leave her bed—I do not re<lb/>collect whether she expressed any intention of doing so—she made no complaint to me on that day of any bruise or wound on her person—I called professionally, about one o'clock, on the 4th of Oct.—she was then lying in bed, in a state of insensibility—I had been partly informed by the landlady that there was a probability of her having taken laudanum—Mr.</p>

               <p>Brenton was not at home, and the nurse was not there—I had not sufficient information, in a medical way, as to what had occurred to bring Mrs. Brenton into that state, for me to act upon—I called again about seven or eight o'clock in the evening—I then met Mr. Houston—we did not exa<lb/>mine her body then—she was very pale, in a state of collapse, the pulse rather small, and the pupils of the eyes not acting—there were symptoms of some shock to the nervous system, and upon that I acted—I saw her again early next morning (Saturday)—I saw her on the Monday—the wound was not pointed out to me till the Tuesday—it was a dark, disco<lb/>loured surface of skin, with a vesicle or blister upon it, but not a decided wound—I attended the case for seven or eight days altogether—I saw her occasionally after Mr. Laver's return, but not regularly—the wound was on the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>—there was tenderness of the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>, the result of inflammation, and a redness from the wound—it appeared a wound of recent origin—I should have thought it had existed two, three, or four days, possibly, pre<lb/>vious to the Tuesday, but it is uncertain to fix a time—the inflammation gradually extended up the spine—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exa<lb/>mination—the spine was then opened—we found symptoms of previous inflammation, and there was blood extravasated on the <hi rend="italic">dorsal</hi> vertebree more than elsewhere, in fact, there almost alone, principally there, and up<lb/>wards towards the neck—there was congestion—the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi> bone was rather soft—I attributed that softness to the inflammation consequent on the ex<lb/>ternal sore—the inflammation of the spine might have arisen from a blow to that part, or, in fact, to any part of the spine, or its course—Mrs. Brenton was a woman of very feeble constitution, which would decidedly make a blow take the greater effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, looking to the state in which the spinal marrow was, and look<lb/>ing at the whole case before and after death, are yoa of opinion that a blow had been struck on the <hi rend="italic">sacrum? A</hi>. I am of opinion that there was a certain shock to the nervous system—how produced I am not fully pre<lb/>pared to say—looking at the state of Mrs. Brenton's health on the 3rd of Oct., I think some severe struggle or conflict might produce those appear<lb/>ances—it must be a shock, a very severe injury to the head or spine—it must be a very severe conflict—striking and beating would concuss the spine, in her weak state especially.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine the viscera of the stomach? I did, it was healthy—she was a person of very weak constitution—she was of a rheumatic habit, and of a delicate habit altogether—the liver appeared to. lerably healthy—there was nothing about it to excite attention—there was nothing at all in her appearance to indicate a person in the habit of drink<lb/>ing—I ing—I did not notice it—I examined her principally with a view to ascer<lb/>tain the cause of death with relation to the wound, and the stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attended this case the greater part of the time from the 7th Oct., and was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination the last day—I first saw the bruise on Mrs. Brenton's back on the second day of my seeing her, on the 8th—in my opinion it might have existed about three or four days, or it might have existed longer—I am of opinion that it was caused by violence—I have seen many wounds—I form that opinion from the symptoms combined, from the appearances previous to death and afterwards—I recollect the Saturday on which she died—she stated to me on that day that she believed she would not recover, I was questioning her—I wished to ascertain the state of her mind—her father was present—we were to meet with Mr. Laver, who did not keep his appointment—I was alone with her part of the time, and her father was with me a portion of the time—at the time she made a statement to me I was alone with her—I wished to ascertain her state with respect to her sanity, and to know whether she was sensible enough to answer my ques<lb/>tions, to ascertain in what state her health was—I asked her questions about her state of health—I asked her where she was in pain—she said, "In my back"—her father put the next question.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250218"/>
               <p>she was in pain—she "In my back"—her father immediately came✗ in and said, "Who did it?"—nothing more took place when I was alone✗ with her the second time—nothing was said after I asked her if she thought she should recover—nothing else was said when I was alone with her, only with her father—something else was said before she shook her head and said "No," but after that, nothing was said either to me alone, or to myself and her father—I never heard her speak after that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was that saying "No" after anything that she said in her father's presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a minute—he asked her something, to which she replied—he then went out, leaving her alone with me, and then I asked her if she thought she should recover—that is a very usual ques<lb/>tion for me to put to my patients, particularly when we find them in a state of insensibility, or collapse—we wish to know the state of the mind, whether they are sensible to answer any questions—I asked her that question to ascertain the state of her mind, and when she said "No" and cried, that satisfied me of the state of her mind, and I asked her no more questions—it is my common practice to put that question to persons in a weak state—I do not know whether it is of service to the patients, or whether it tends <hi rend="italic">to</hi> keep up their spirits—I asked her that question to ascertain the state of her mind, to know whether she was sensible or not, in answering the questions I had put to her before with regard to the state of her health.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask her whether she had slept well, about her pain, and several other questions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she answered some of those questions reasonably, and some she did not—I asked her where she was in pain three times over—the answer that she gave me once was, "I don't know," and the next time, "In my back"—she answered my questions so that I was in doubt as to the state of her mind—I had some doubts as to whether she was in a sound state of mind or not, and I have some doubts at the present time—I asked the last question to ascertain whether she was in a sound state of mind—she answered, "No," and cried—that answer still left me in doubt, and I cannot now tell whether she was in a sound state of mind or not—I do not know that that question more than any other had a tendency to show whether she was of sound mind or not—I did not think it an unkind or cruel question to put—perhaps it might have been, upon second consideration—I commonly speak cheerfully to my patients, but it is a very frequent question, "Well, do you think you shall recover?"—it depends upon how you express it—I do not think it shows that you think them in danger—I do not know how long this was before she died—Mr. Baker was not present at the time—I think she did expect to die, but I doubt whether she was in a sound state of mind.</p>
