I came to the chambers very soon after nine in the morning, and about half-past nine, I

             a draft upon Messrs. Gosling, for 209l. 11s. to pay the draft; I put the draft upon the desk before the prisoner, desiring him to go at four o'clock, and not before, to Messrs. Gosling and Sharpe's, to take the money and carry it to Esdailes' to take up the draft that had been presented at my chambers; I then went to the House of Commons, and returned between five and six in the afternoon; the prisoner was not at the chambers, nor ever returned after.</p>

I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at Bow-street, on the 3d of June, in custody; his dress was then totally changed, and his hair cut off, which made a very material difference in his appearance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You have said, you intrusted me with drafts for small sums - did you not send me into the city to receive a bill for 250l.? - A. The question put to me was, as to sending him to my bankers; I certainly did send him into the city, with a draft of 250l. which he brought me back, and another time with 160 or 170l. that I think was two days before this happened.</p>

            (To Davis.) Was that one of the numbers that was given him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Atkins. He told me the next morning where his lodgings were; I went there, and found thirteen guineas, twenty half-guineas and sixteen seven-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140004"/>shilling pieces; he told me he had got the guineas, half-guineas, and seven-shilling pieces in change for the notes he had received from the bankers, or Bank, I am not sure which; he said, he was always afraid of carrying them about him, except of an evening when he employed girls of the town to get them changed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive from him any directions respecting any box in London? - A. I did, at Bow-street; in consequence of which, I went to Southampton, and got the box; I found in it two 10l. Bank-notes, No. 8632, and 8633, and also two 5l. Bank-notes, No. 8720, and 8725.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the carman here? - A. No, it was my aunt's cart, he only drove the cart for that day, and he is ill; I saw the two prisoners take some coffee out of a cask, and put it into Tyler's hat, they both held the hat; then they went from the cart down to a gateway, into an area, and I saw Tyler put the coffee into Lucas's shirt; then they came up to the cart again, and I went up to them, and told them to go away; they both laid hold of my arm, and told me to say nothing; I told them, if they did not go away, I would have them taken up; I had seen the street-keeper just before that, and I went to him, and he came and took Lucas opposite the cart; I then went to the cart again, and saw Tyler taking another hat-full of coffee; he imme<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140005"/>diately ran away with it, he was taken up about five or six days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure these are the two men? - A. I am sure of it; I know them both well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lucas. Q. Did you not take a guinea from another man you caught stealing coffee? - A. No, I did not; I caught a man before, and was offered a guinea to let him go, and I would not take it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive him pressing upon you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you did not see him till about a minute after the watch was taken from you? - A. He had the watch in his hand.</p>

            Was the pressure while the watch was going or before? - A. It was after the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you could distinctly perceive Charles Williams press upon you, or did you only conclude he was one from seeing the watch in his hand? - A. He pressed upon me very much after the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear distinctly you observed the prisoner press upon you after the watch was gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to stick to this, that you saw him distinctly press upon you after the watch was gone out of your pocket? - A. Yes, while I was attempting to lay hold of one of the gang, immediately the crowd pressed upon me.</p>

            About five or ten minutes after the balloon went up, or it might be rather more; there was a narrow passage between the carts where the people had to pass through, and there were four or five of them on each side of that passage, close to each other; I saw them pushing and huslling people about; the prisoner was in front; I observed a silver watch in his hand.</p>

Yes, I am sure of it; I then followed the prisoner, and laid hold of his collar; I was then immediately knocked down, and received several blows on my back; I called to the patrols behind me to take care of him; upon that a scuffle enfued; I recovered myself, and got hold of the prisoner again, with one of the patrols; after I got hold of him, endeavouring to bring him up Baker-street, he asked me to let him stoop down, and pull his shoe up at heel; and, in stooping down, I saw him throw the watch away; I ordered James Munyard, one of the men with me, to pick it up; I saw him pick it up.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the patrols; I was in North Baker-street at the time the balloon went up; Mayhew called out to me to lay hold of the prisoner; Mayhew had laid hold of him, and I saw him knocked down; I immediately caught hold of the prisoner; I had not bad hold of him two minutes before I received a blow from a stick; the prisoner then sung out, serve it out, you b - r, serve it out.</p>

            Afterwards; the patrol came up immediately, and dispersed the mob; I laid hold of the prisoner, and Mr. Mayhew laid hold of him; and, as we were taking him to Bow-street, he stooped down, and I saw him throw this watch down, (producing it;) he threw it, I dare say, four yards behind him; I immediately stooped down upon my hands and knees, and picked it up.</p>

            (To Ward.) We have heard of some carts standing there - was that the place where you lost your watch? - A. No; I lost it upon the bridge at the top of Baker-street, North, which leads to a field.</p>
               <p>Mayhew. This bridge is close to where the carts were; they were drawn up close to the side of the ditch for the people to see the balloon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the Monday morning, I went, out of curiousity, to see the balloon; and, on my way home, coming over the bridge, somebody said there was a mad bullock, and there was a great press and a cry of thieves; upon which a scuffle ensued, and they all got away, and I was then taken; there was another watch produced at Bow-street, and an officer, of the name of Lloyd, swore that I had taken that watch from another man; and the man said, I was not the person; Mr. Justice Ford asked him how he could take his oath that I had taken it from the man, and then he said, he had not taken his oath.</p>

To a house in Suffolk-street, Pentonville, on Saturday, the 26th of June, where I had a view of the prisoner's house, No. 4, Charlotte-place; the prisoner's, Rodgers, himself told me he rented it.</p>

A little after eight o'clock, I went to the house in Suffolk-street; there were only two rooms in the house; I noticed that the windows of the upper story had cloths before them, about half way up, and the upper part of the windows were exceedingly dirty, so that I could have no view whatever of any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140008"/>that was done in the upper part of the house, but any person that went up stairs I had a full view of; I was waiting from half past eight till two o'clock, no person went in or came out of the house during that time; about two o'clock, the prisoner, Mary Rodgers, came down stairs; a little after I saw her wipe her hands and arms with a cloth; she then went out, and in a few minutes returned with a pot, which, I suppose, contained beer; she looked very much about her when she came out, and also when she returned; she instantly went up stairs, and no person went in or came out of the house till four o'clock; about four o'clock, the prisoner, Horn, came to the house; how he opened the door I do not know, but it was opened instantly, and he went up stairs; no person went in or came out till after five, then

               <p>Q. Did he see Holland return? - A. No, he did not; then we concluded that was the time to get into the house; I desired Holland to rap at the door, because the maid knew me;

             opened the door, and endeavoured to shut it again when she saw us; I then started in; Horn and Mary Rodgers were below; she called out, here they are; I ran up stairs, and desired Holland to take Horn and Mary Rodgers; I caught Rodgers upon the window endeavouring to get out; upon which Holland brought the other two up stairs, and we secured all the three; there was a half teaster bed in the room, rather inclining towards the window; the first thing that struck my attention, was a furnace made of brick in the chimney-place; that furnace had a fire in it of coke, and also a quantity of coke lying in the fire-place; there were a number of crucibles, some lying upon the side of the furnace, some upon the mantle-piece, and some upon the floor; some had the remains of metal in them; here is one of them new, that has never been used,(produces it;) the next thing I observed, was a little bench fixed under one of the windows, so that a person could sit at work at it; it was fixed to the wall, and upon the bench I found these sciffars, files, and plyers, (produces them;) there was also this child's hat, containing these blanks, which adhere together, (producing them;) there are some of different coin; I found these things, with some metal upon the point of them; from the appearance of them, they are used for the purpose or lifting the melting pots off the fire; the next thing that struck my attention, was a flask, which is used in coining, and a sort of trough, in the corner of the room, containing a quantity of sounder's earth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been used to these sort of things, so as to know the common use of them? - A. I have been very much; in my hurry in taking up the flask, I found the founder's earth coming out of the flask; the earth is put into these frames, and beat with a mallet till it is a pretty hard substance; the oil and lamp black are put over it to harden the earth, in order to receive the fresh metal more easy; the impression is generally taken from good coin; the metal is poured in, and takes the impression without the assistance of a dye or press, and they can take the impression of the coin of different kingdoms all at once; I found some founder's earth where I found the flask; close by that trough was hanging these two sieves, (produces them,) which are used for sitting the earth, and putting it in a proper state to be used; the room was exceedingly black, so black that there was the mark of the sieves where they hung up; here is a composition for hardening the day, which is made of black lead, and lamp black and oil, which is burnt; I found that in the same room, in a cupboard; this is a piece of coke that was found by the fire-side; I found a quantity of sand-paper, some used, and some not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gleed. 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person128">Q. </persName>
            What is the use of the sandpaper? - A. To take off the rough edges after the sciffars had been used to cut them apart; they are taken with a small pair of players, and filed, and then the sand-paper is used to take off the rough edges; I found this pipkin, (produces it,) with some oil and some cotton, which is used to burn this compositioin, which is put into the flask to harden the earth, and make it fit to receive the impression; the next thing I found was, on the bed, this dirty apron, which contained this money and this piece of cork; the cork is used for smoothing the money;(produces a large quantity of unfinished coin;) here is a remarkable piece adhering together, they have J. S. upon them; I found that in the child's hat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140009"/>upon the bed; here is another, in a more finished state, with 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person129">J. S. </persName>
            upon it, which I found upon the bed; a person could sit upon the bed working at the bench, and place the money, some on the bench and some on the bed; here is one that was in a state sit for circulation at the time I found it, and so were these three shillings and a sixpence, (produces them,) but they are discoloured since; they are all copper; it is but a common wash, and is very soon discoloured; the utteres generally keep them in papers separately.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020714-8-person131">Q. </persName>
            Would that mixing it with the others tenders take off the colouring? - A. Yes; I also found on the mantle-piece this paper, containing white vitriol, (produce it,) which is used to give a sort of dimness to the silver; I also found a paper, containing white arsenic, which is for mixing with the copper; it is in consequence of the white arsenic being put in the crucible with the copper, that it comes out quite white; I also found this apron by the bed-side, which smelt very strong of aquafortis; I also found these pieces of copper cut into pieces, to put into the surnace. (Producing them.)</p>

            Were all the prisoners in the room at the time you found those things? - A. Yes, they were present when every thing was found, and I desire the to take particular notice; this was on the Saturday evening; on the Sunday morning, I went to the house to make farther search; Mr. Springall had the key, and, in the back shed, I found this brush, (produces it,) which smelt very strong of aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That shed was not locked up? - A. No, it was belonging to the house; you could not get at the shed without passing through the house; we found, on the Sunday, also a quantity of black ing and black lead, and things mixed up for burning, and other things.</p>

               <p>Q. In what condition did you find their persons? A. At the time I went up stairs, Joseph Rodgers was on the window with his waistcoat on, but no shirt, and this old apron. I could see his arms all the way up, they were yellow, green, and black; at the time that Horn and

             were brought up, I looked at their hands; they were both of them very duty, with some sort of dirt, but only about the palm of the hand and the fingers; I desired Holland to take particular notice of the prisoner's hands; I said, they had been at work; they said, they had not; Horn said, he had only been in a few minutes, that he came to see them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person136">Q. </persName>
            Would aqua-fortis give that appearance? - A. It would; Horn afterwards acknowledged that he had been there from four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were his hands dirty when he came to the door at four o'clock? - A. I cannot tell, I was at such a distance; he then had an apron of the colour of this upon him; on the table below there was a bason with some water, which some person had washed their hands in.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me aqua-fortis was a necessary ingredient in the colouring of base metal? - A. Yes, it is a very material ingredient.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q. In cases where silver is put into the composition, in order to throw the silver on the outside, aqua-fortis must be used; but here there is no silver in the composition? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person137">A. </persName>
            Aqua-fortis is necessary in every process that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. As to this shilling upon which the indictment is framed, did you, at any time, shew it to any persons belonging to the Mint? - A. I shewed it to Mr. Powell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you got that shilling from the house of the prisoner before you shewed it to Mr. Powell? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person138">A. </persName>
            At the examination, on the Thursday following; I had them locked up in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thursday were they in the same state as when you found them? - A. No, they were much discoloured; they appeared many of them passable, but on Thursday much discoloured.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the last process through which they pass, is to have them dulled? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this appear to you to have passed through that process? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person139">A. </persName>
            It was in that state, that a man, who was not a good judge of silver, would have taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say any common tradesman would have taken it? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person140">A. </persName>
            Many common tradesmen would have taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this shilling to be altered between the Saturday and the Thursday? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person141">A. </persName>
            It was very much dulled.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you, that on Thursday it was passable when it was seen by Mr. Powell? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person142">A. </persName>
            In my opinion.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020714-8-person143">Q. </persName>
            Horn said he had been there a few minutes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was true, because he had been out just before - how far was the house where you were concealed from the house where the prisoner lived? - A. I suppose fifteen or sixteen yards; the windows up stairs were half blinded, and a large blanket hung up, so that it was impossible to see any thing that was going on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person144">Q. </persName>

            And they were not examined till Thursday?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140010"/>- A. No; on the Monday the King went to the Parliament-house, and the Magistrate was attending at St. James's, so that it stood over to Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. You, I believe, with Rodgers, were looking from some window which commanded a view of the house of the prisoner? - A. We were.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020714-8-person146">Q. </persName>
            You were particularly directed to observe the prisoner, Horn? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What observations did you make? - A. I saw the prisoner, Horn, come out of the house, and I followed him; upon his first coming out, he looked in a very suspicious manner about him, as if he was looking to see if any body was about; I saw him go into a wine-vaults; I went in after him, and saw him having some gin put into a bottle; there were two doors to the house; I thought it very singular that he passed one door, and went in at the farthest door, and he came back the same way; he looked about, as he had done before, and then he went into the house from which he had first come; Rodgers then followed me into the house where we were watching; after waiting about half an hour, the prisoner, Horn, came out again, and looked about him in the same way; he returned in a short timet, and looked each way again, and then went into the houset; in about ten minutes after, he came out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Rodgers and Holland came up? - A. Yes; I saw the prisoner, Rodgers, lift up the fash, and throw two bags out of the window, which fell over into the garden; he was going out too, till I told him to retire, or I should knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in point of fact, get out? - A. No, he came in; I then went into the garden, and found these two bags, (produces them,) one of them containing a number of good pattern shillings, and the other pattern six-pences.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any one in particular? - A. Yes; here is one which exactly corresponds with the impression on the counterfeit. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. By pattern shillings, you mean shillings to cast from? - A. Yes.</p>

            Can you explain the use of these implements? - A. I can give no further explanation than Rodgers has given; he has given a very correct explanation. I can only say, that the whole of the apparatus is such as is used for the process that seems to have been adopted on this occasion, except the aqua-fortis, which is necessary to the colouring; these blanks contain no particle of silver whatever in them; I have tried them, therefore the mode of colouring them would be by doing them with a solution of silver in aqua-fortis; I have one in my pocket, which is one of the blanks found at the house of the prisoner, and which I had coloured myself. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean that you have not found in this house that by which this process must have been compleated? - A. There was no solution of silver found.</p>

               <p>Q. There is no solution nor any vessel with the remains found? - A. No, but there is not one instance in twenty in which we do find them; they only prepare so much of the pickle, or of the solution of silver, as they immediately want.</p>

               <p>Q. In what state did you observe it? - A. I was confident it had been coloured, and an incautious person certainly might have taken it; I am positive it had been coloured; it had lost part of its colour, but even then an incautious person might have taken it.</p>

               <p>Q. You consider that as the pattern of this shilling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the graining at the edges is very full? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of that dye so worn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140011"/>as to lose the grain? - A. I cannot say; here are two letters upon it, which makes it more remarkable, J.S.</p>

I answered, what cheer? upon that, he immediately lifted up his fist, and gave me a violent blow, which cut me in the ear, at the same time he had my watch-chain in his hand; I immediately gave him a blow, and tripped up his heels; one of the others then struck me, and I sung out murder, robbery, watch, as loud as I could; the watchman then came up, I had treated him with a glass of gin but a minute before; I told the watchman this man had attempted to rob me, they had broke my watchchain, and when the watch - man came up, the prisoner threw down the chain by his feet, and they all ran away; the watchman picked up the chain; I never lost fight of the prisoner; two other watchmen came up, I told them if they would guard me, I would guard the man; I did not like to let go my hold.</p>

I saw the prosecutor; he was very fore in liquor; he challenged the watchman; he would give him a glass of gin, and went into the sign of the Sun; I saw him come out of the Sun; after that, I saw the prisoner come rushing past against this man, and by that means he called it a robbery; I was not a yard from my own door; I went to assist him, and then he called out watch, and that was near a quarter of an hour before the watch came to his assistance; when the watchman came, I took his lantern from his hand to see what was lost; upon that a woman or two cried, there is the chain down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140015"/>there; I picked it up, and conveyed the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner make a snatch, or attempt to take the property at all from the prosecutor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give the chain to? - A. To the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the prosecutor was drunk? -

            Did you see him, before that time, in the company of the women? - A. Yes, he was with several women of the town; he would not pass any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other men there? - A. No, none but women.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had been in company with other men, must you have seen them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q. Did you go to the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What led you to go to the watch-house? - A. By being a house-keeper; I thought he might be guilty or not guilty.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020714-17-person222">Q. </persName>
            Then the watchman did not ask you to go? - A. He insisted upon my going.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020714-17-person223">Q. </persName>
            Then why did you say you went to the watch-house because you thought he might be guilty or not guilty? - A. That I don't know any thing about.</p>

            Tell me what you went to the watch-house for? - A. To protect the man that was robbed.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020714-17-person225">Q. </persName>

                  <persName id="t18020714-17-person226">Q. </persName>
            But to protect the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, turn to the Jury, and I ask you again why you went to the watch-house? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-17-person227">A. </persName>
            There was nobody to keep guard of this man but me and the watchman; I went to the watch-house to give such evidence as I could prove, but there was no proving of the kind; there were no questions asked, and therefore I never was asked a question.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020714-17-person228">Q. </persName>
            Then you were not desired to go? - A. I was desired by the watchman to go.</p>
               <p>Inch. I never desired any assistance at all, because the prosecutor had kept his hold of him.</p>
               <p>Russell. There was another man came up, and went to the watch-house.</p>

               <persName id="t18020714-17-person240">A. </persName>
            Because the man called watch close to my own door.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020714-17-person241">Q. </persName>

            Tell the Court what you know of this? - A. I was preparing for bed; I heard an uproar in the street, I took no notice of it till I heard my husband's voice; I then came to the door, and saw the prisoner with the prosecutor on one side, and my husband on the other; there was a cry of watch, and the watchman came up, and my husband delivered the man up to the watchman, and took the watchman's lantern and picked up the chain; some women came past, and said, this man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140016"/>has been drinking about the neighbouthood all the afternoon, and he had liked to have lost his watch once before.</p>

I don't know; I did not observe any thing in his hand, but my head was violently cut, which obliged me to let go my hold, I got my hat knocked off in the struggle; the prisoner then took different ways; I pursued M'Donald into Drury-lane, the watchman came up and took hold of him; he was taken to the watch-house, and I gave charge of him; on the Monday morning following, as we were going to Bow-street with him, he told the constable where Cart was to be found; I went with the constables, and when we had got within a few doors of the house, M'Donald pointed out Carr, and said, that is the man that struck the gentleman's head, he was then taken to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any of them strike you? - A. No, they only gathered round me, and shoved me backwards and forwards, I struggled with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they lay hold of your hands? - A. No, only round my body.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you thrown down at all? - A. No, they felt round me, but not finding any thing there, they whipped my handkerchief off my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you struggle with them? - A. I made a blow at one of them, and fung out for the watchman.</p>

            There was a moon was there? - A. I cannot swear to that, it was quite light: the prisoner was rather in liquor; I ran after him, and knocked him down, and held him till the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running or walking? - A. I cannot say, I delivered him up to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your handkerchief since? - A. No, it was a tall man that run away with the handkerchief, in a pair of trowsers and a light coat.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not force you up the gateway? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person come up to the gateway while you were there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the account you have always given of this transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look if that is your hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before Mr. Conant the Justice? - A. Yes, and there was a gentleman there said, there had been three or four robberies committed in that place, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. I will read the account you gave to Mr. Conant - John Smith says, that last night, passing through St. Giles's, he met with the prisoner Collyer, and two other men, who asked him to drink with them, and when he got to the corner of the gateway, they violently pulled him up the gateway, and knocked him down, but some people coming up they ran away? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-32-person398">A. </persName>
            They asked me to drink with them, and I would not go.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell Mr. Conant they dragged you up the gateway, and knocked you down, and upon some people coming up they ran away, and now you have told me they did not drag you up the gateway, that they did not knock you down, and that nobody came up? - A. I have told nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say before the Magiftrate, that you knew I was not the man, and if I would pay you for your day's work, and for the handkerchief, you would not prosecute me? - A. I told the Magistrate I was a poor man, and could not stand a prosecution.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going through St. Giles's, I had been to receive some prize-money, and this man charged me with having robbed him; I never saw him with my eyes till he collared me.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th of July last, were you in Whitechapel with any cattle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were you going? - A. To Rumford.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-35-person424">A. </persName>
            About ten o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of bullocks had you under your care? - A. I had sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at Whitechapel, did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; I did not see him then.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him? - A. Just by the London Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do? - A. He went into the drove, took one out, and took it down Duckingpond-lane with his hand upon the rump of the beast, and a knife in his other hand; after that, he came into the drove again.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the beast he took out? - A. That bullock returned into the drove again after some time; he then said to some of his companions, draw your chives, that is, knives.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of companions had he? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-35-person425">A. </persName>
            Twenty, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them draw their knives? - A. Yes; I saw three or four knives drawn; I cannot tell exactly the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he drive the second bullock? - A. It was the same bullock again; he drove it towards Whitechapel; I sent my dog after it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do when he got a second bullock from the drove? - A. He followed it some rods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you raise any alarm? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, did any persons come to your assistance? - A. A great number.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and they pursue him? - A. I did, myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came hear him, what did he say to you? - A. He made a stop, and then made three stabs at my left breast with a clasp knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the knife penetrate it? - A. No; I felt my breast painful three or four days after; he then took to his heels, and before I could recover, he got a few yards from me; then I went after him, and called, stop thief, and when he found he was near being taken, he sat down on the but end of a tray with his knife out; he then said, the first b-r that comes in the way, I will let his b-y intrails out; upon that, some gentleman threw a brick-bat at him, struck him on the side of the head, and knocked him down, and then I seized him, and took him away to the Police-office.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards recover your bullock? -One Mr. Young did for me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. These bullocks belonged to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day you were driving them from Smithfield? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe the prisoner in Smithfield? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of coming into Smithfield frequently? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very wanton, but I believe a very common thing, for people of the description of the prisoner to drive bullocks out of the drove for amusement? - A. Yes, they do; I don't know what they mean by it.</p>

               <p>Q. The first bullock returned to your drove? - A. Yes; and it was the same bullock that he took out again.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner did not continue to pursue the bullock? - A. No; they all dispersed.</p>
               <p>Q. The bullock has been returned to you again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the middle of the day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Coming down Whitechapel-road, Mr. Harper said to some of the chaps, he would treat them with half a pint of gin, because the beasts belonged to a very good master; he knows very well it was not taken with intent to steal it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Harper.) Q. Do you know who this man is? - A. No; he goes by the name of Belcher, being a resolute man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what way of life he is in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see him before? - A. Not to my knowledge; I have heard a great deal of talk of him. <rs id="t18020714-35-verdict190" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am a warehouseman in Round-court, in the Strand; I was coming down Jermyn-street, and saw the prisoner at Mr. Newton's door; I saw him take this dress, and put it into his cap; I followed him, and delivered him to the serjeant, while Mr. Newton was looking for a constable; Mr. Newton took the things from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home from a fieldday, and met with a comrade just come home from abroad; he said he wanted to buy a dress for his little boy, and going by this gentleman's door, he said he thought it would do; the pin came undone, and, in stooping to pick them up, my cap fell off; this gentleman came up, when I had my cap in one hand, and the dress in the other, and said, I had been stealing it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who had known him seven years, and gave him a good character as a soldier, but could not say any thing as to his private character. <rs id="t18020714-40-verdict211" type="verdictDescription">

My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - With that submission and respect which I am aware is due from a person in my situation to this Court, and that candid impartiality which is the characteristic of an English Jury, I presume to state some facts which may take off some degree of the weight which my prosecutor wishes to impress upon your minds with respect to me; I have been brought up under a rigid, but respectable, worthy, and honest, parent, who has ever taught me the paths of rectitude, honour, and propriety, and given me a liberal education; at a certain period, I was placed under the care of an affectionate uncle, who gave me an extensive property, with a house of forty guineas a year; having met with the greatest duplicity from those whom I have called my friends, and particularly that society which was held at Mr. Knight's house, as well as others, I had lost between four and five hundred pounds; those injuries I could have borne without regret, but this last injury has stung me to the quick; with these repeated losses I left business, and retired with the remainder of my property, which I had carefully deposited in the hands of an honest relation; the book in question, which the prosecutor alludes to, I had under my arm on the afternoon of the evening I went to his house, for the purpose of getting some little money due to me at Black wall, and to a house of the same description; I went there, and drank several pints of porter, and some shares of sixpenny-worths of rum and water; in passing this house, I knew the house, and I can bring respectable witnesses to prove that I have been many times at his house, I went into the house, and in that state in which a young man of my description ought not to have appeared; I was in a state of some intoxication, and from the admonition of my friends I had made a now not to go into a lodge-room again, having sustained so much injury from these clubs; I went in, expecting to see some persons who owed me money; I asked the girl for Mr. such a one; the girl said, she did not know the names of the persons who were there; I waited till the lodge was closed, and after it was closed, I went up stairs, and met with some persons that I knew; I went up, and had some rum and water with them; it was proposed by them to go down stairs; I went down stairs, and I know not why we should be introduced into the bar, in preference to any other part of the house - a part of the house which I should not have presumed to have entered, and there we had more rum and water; they wanted to drink some ale, but I gave my negative to that, chusing rather to drink porter, and I know not from that time who came in, or what time they went out; by this time I was in a great state of in oxication, I found that I was so, and as a proof of it, if I were placed upon an oath, which I would not forfeit, I should say I did not know the time of the night, whether it was eleven, twelve, one, or two, nor did I, upon my oath, were I put to it, know in what manner these people, whom they may call my friends, left me; I was accossed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140032"/>by Mr. Knight, telling me it was time to go home; I got up, and knowing I had this book, I asked for it, he said, I had left it up stairs probably; he went up stairs, and said, it was not there; I told him it was of great consequence to me; they begged of him to look for it, as being at a publichouse, it was the more likely to be lost in the morning; I begged of him, and he was, as I then though, kind enough to go to several parts of the house, but his endeavours were fruitless; in coming down stairs, he said, I will take care of it if I find it, and wished me to go home; I went out for the purpose of going home, and he said, I have to speak to a watchman to call some one up, and, says he, you can go along with me; I went with him, and took hold of his arm, thinking him a friend, and walked with him; but instead of being in my own road to go home, I actually crossed a road almost uninhabited, which was the direct contrary way to my own home: My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I did not know that I had any thing in my pocket at the time, and when I came up with him to the watchman, he said, you have a pot of mine in your pocket; when I offered to wish him good night, I was astonished, and asked him if he was serious; I put my hand in my pocket, and found one, I put my hand in my other pocket, and found another; the measure was in my waistcoat-pocket, there was a large hole in it, and the measure went through.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes; after they had taken my handkerchief and money, they ran away directly to the boat, I staid three hours upon the same spot; I was sick by the stroke I got upon my head, I could not go any further, I was neither drunk nor quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that all this happened? - A. It all happened at Deptsord, alongside the windmill.</p>

               <p>Q. It would be very much frequented from seven o'clock till nine o'clock of the Saturday night? - A. Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>Q. The men leave work at that time, and there are a great many passing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for a person to lie there three house, without being noticed? - A. I should think not.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he drunk with liquor given him by the captain? - A. The captain did not give him any.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q. Do you know how he was paid? - A. He was paid in Bank of England notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the sums? - A. I think ten, five, and two, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go away? - A. No, I believe I was below.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the course of the evening? - A. To the best of my recollection, the last time I saw him was about four o'clock, and then he appeared to be more in liquor than he was before he received his wages.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Mr. Saunders's house; I saw the prisoner standing against the water-tub at the bottom of the kitchen stairs, about six in the evening; I asked him what he was doing there; he said, he had got a sister in the house; I said, if so, you have no business there; I saw him with the pipe in his hand under his coat; he instantly laid it down, and ran up stairs; the cock was fixed to the pipe; he was stopped in the passage by a little boy; in a few minutes after, I carried the pipe and cock up stairs, and gave it to a woman who was in the house; but I know not to whom, through the hurry; I do not remember ever to have seen the man before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Is not the house you speak of a lodging-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN WARREN sworn. - On the 30th of June, I was going to the Haymarket; there was a great row at the door of Mr. Sauncers's house; I found the prisoner in the house, and took him in custody; some person gave me this pipe; it appears to be wrenched off, as the two parts exactly answer.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of the prosecutor: On the 5th of July, I went to Robinson's and Brown's, Shoreditch, to buy some cloth and other articles; I then went to Mr. Lewis's, to buy some stockings; while I was bargaining for the stockings, I missed my bundle; I suspected the prisoner, as Mr. Lewis had found stockings on him which he had missed; he said, if I would go with him to the Pewter Platter, I should have my bundle again; he had it not about him; I asked him to deposit money for the cloth; he came back, and brought me the cloth, and demanded his money; I let him go; by that time he was taken into custody; he stood in the shop all the time I was bargaining for the stockings; there was another man with him; the other went away.</p>
               <p>- LEWIS sworn. - I saw the man bring the linen back; another man came with him, stopped a minute or two, and went away.</p>
               <p>- MESSENGER sworn. - I took the other man into custody first, and afterwards this man, about four o'clock in the morning.(The cloth was produced, and identified by Mrs. Norris.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to buy a pair of stockings at Mr. Lewis's; my neighbour followed me quickly, and was immediately gone; I denied knowing any thing of the cloth; she desired me to deposit the money for the value of the cloth; I pursued the man, and said to him, it is time to take back the cloth; I thought no more of it.</p>

I took out 145l. 8s. including eight guineas, with me, from home, and a 20l. note I had received of Mr. M'Allister, a customer of mine, in Holborn, making together 165l. 8s.; when I received the 20l. note, I took the other out of my pocket, and wrapped it round them, and put them altogether in my right hand breeches pocket; I then went to the house of John Barker, a customer of mine, who keeps a liquor-shop in High-Holborn; I had a bottle of wine, in company with some persons in the back parlour; there were eight or nine gentlemen there; one of whom was the prisoner; I sat down, and he was at my right hand side, next my pocket in which the notes were; I stayed there about three hours, and got up to go a little before five; a coach was sent for, and my son and myself, and a gentleman who was acquainted with Mr. Barker and myself, got into it; they called him, Mr. Ellis; and he went as far as Cheapside, where he got out; at which time I had not missed my property; I discovered I had lost it, when I got to Messrs. Were's, the banker's; the notes were gone, but the guineas were left; I said, I was robbed; and Mr. Taylor, who is a partner in the house, went back with me to Barker's; I found partly the same customers there, but I believe the prisoner was not there; he was there when I went away, and was very 10th for me to go; I told the company of my loss, and went away some time after; I have seen the Bank note which I took of M'Allister, and which was produced to me at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were three hours in this public-house? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many in company were there? - A. I think, eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink more than one bottle of wine? - A. I think me and the rest of the company drank three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. You had received the 20l. note of M'Allister? - A. Yes, a few minutes before; I took the other notes from my house, to pay into my banker's, with what I should collect, and I rolled that 20l. note round them.</p>

               <p>Q. A person named Ellis, went with you in the coach? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did curiosity induce you to look at the notes, before you went out of Barker's? - A. No; I neither pulled them out, or looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the time you lost them you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they were taken in the coach, or not, you do not know? - A. It was impossible for them to be taken out of my pocket in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a hackney-coach? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body open the door to let you into the coach? - A. Yes; but I don't know who.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drank so much, that you don't recollect? - A. Not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. You never missed them till you got to Were's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Ellis here? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep the house Mr. Martin has spoke of? - A. Yes, the Coach and Horses, in High Holborn: On the 9th of July, the prosecutor came between one and two o'clock, and sat down in the parlour with several gentlemen who had dined there; the prisoner was one of the company; and Mr. Martin sat next to him; there were three or four bottles of wine drank; and after Mr. Martin had stayed three or four hours, I sent for a coach for him, and saw him into it; Mr. Ellis, who is a farmer, at Elton, near Stilton, in Huntingdonshire, went with him; the prisoner remained some little time after them in the room; when he got up, he said, he was going away, but would forfeit a shilling, if he did not return in ten minutes; in about an hour after, he did return; but I do not know whether Martin had been back then, or not; but he did come with a partner of the Bank, and said, he had lost his property; and went away soon after; when he was gone, there was some conversation about the notes; and they said, it was a reflection upon the company, as it was lost in the room; it was proposed for them all to stand search; and by their desire, I fetched the high-constable, Mr. Bell, who came; and Mr. Jones, the prisoner, after opening his waistcoat, pulling out a shilling, and some loose papers, said, I will not be searched by any man, pray who are you? to Mr. Bell; say Mr. Bell, here is my authority, and I'll search you first; which he did; and in his left hand coat pocket, he found a 20l. Bank-note; then I took a coach, and fetched Mr. Martin; and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner frequented your house, I believe? - A. Yes; and has for four years.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a good deal surprised at this charge against him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was one of the last persons in the world you could suspect? - A. Indeed he was; he always behaved genteelly, and with the greatest respectability.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Martin say he would have a coach? - A. He did; and I thought a coach would be better for him, old and feeble as he is, and his condition being such.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by such a condition? - A. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140047"/>is a seeble old man, and considering the distance from my house to his, and he having had a glass or two of wine, I thought a coach would be better.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. When he went away, did he not say, he had lost something? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of the party were gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he is a tradesman, and keeps a shop? - A. I have always understood so.</p>
               <p>Q. It is nothing uncommon for a tradesman to go away for a short time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return, as he said he would? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. You say, there was a general agreement to search? - A. They all agreed to it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was rather drunk? - A. I rather think he was not at all; he had a pint of ale first, and then part of a bottle of wine with Mr. Martin; and he had dined there; he said, he would be searched by no man, when the constable was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all know he was a constable? - A. All, except Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the note rolled up in a little lump? - A. I did not see it at all.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. An iron-founder, in Cross-street, Wilderness-row, Clerkenwell: I was at Barker's, on the 9th of July; the prisoner and Martin were there, and next to each other, except a little boy, who stood between them most of the time; we sat on chairs, and I don't think he had a seat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your attention called by any thing you saw done by the prisoner at the bar? - A. When Mr. Martin was told the coach was at the door, and after a great deal of shaking hands between the prisoner and him, he went; I thought both of them were a little overtaken; it was frequently the case that Martin was offering his hand to Jones, and Jones to him, with particular familiarity; when Martin rose, Jones rose with him, and they were shaking each other by the hand very cordially, and I was not very well pleased with it; for I had rather a suspicion, as I thought I saw Mr. Jones draw his hand from Mr. Martin's right hand breeches pocket, but did not see that he took any thing; I believe he did not at that time; Martin directly after left the room; and Jones stayed a very short time, promising to return in ten minutes, or he would forfeit a shilling, which he threw on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was gone, did you communicate to any one of the company what you thought? - A. I did, to Mr.

            . I and five or six more were in another room, when Mr. Martin returned; and I did not see him that night, but I heard him; the prisoner, I think, returned in about three quarters of an hour, when Mr. Barker came into the room, and announced the loss. I was present when the constable came, and saw the prisoner searched and the note that Mr. Bell said, in the prisoner's hearing, he had taken out his coat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have known the prisoner some years? - A. I have, and been many times in his company; I entertained the highest opinion of his honesty up to that time, and was very much surprised at this charge; I never met with greater uneasiness than to find such a charge against a man, whom I had the highest esteem for.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they what you call mellow? - A. They were in liquor; they seemed to be old men, and easily affected by liquor; I thought they were in liquor, from the observation I made.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you high-constable of that district? - A. Yes. On the 9th of July, in the afternoon, I was sent for to Barker's house; I went into the back parlour where the prisoner was, and five gentlemen beside; I said, I am come to make a search, but I don't know that I am altogether authorised, without consent; they said, they would esteem it a favour, if I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all say that? - A. All but Mr. Jones, who said, he would not be searched by any man; I then shewed my staff, and said, sir, I shall begin with you first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him, what he had about him? - A. No. In searching him, I found this 20l. note in his left hand coat pocket, (produces it); rumpled up much as it is now; I asked him, how he came by it; he said, it did not belong to him; but, before I had done, he insisted upon my returning it, for that it was his property; I asked him, how he came by it, and he said, he took it of Mrs. Sowden or Snowden, a persumer in the I say market; I said, the note was safe, and I would take him into custody, which I did; he very artfully endeavoured to make his escape, but when he found that would not do, he was violent, but not with any effect; he had a large stick, which he began to use, till I took it away; then he began to kick; and I have now a blow on my leg, which he gave me; at last I was obliged to knock him down in the street, more than once.

               <p>Q. We have been told, he was a little intoxicated - have you ever arrested a drunken man before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You hardly ever took a drunken man, charged with felony, who was willing to go? - A. I never took one before.</p>
               <p>Q. This Bank-note was found concealed, but loose in his coat pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said of whom he had taken it? - A. Yes; but I cannot find such a person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Martin.) Q. Look at that note, and say, whether you received it from Mr. M'Allister? - A. Yes; I know it by the endorsement of Mr. Hall, and E. M'A. the initials of M'Allister.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM COOMBE sworn. - I have gone from top to bottom of the Hay-market, and made every possible enquiry for Mr. Sowden, or Snowden, a perfumer, but no such person lives there; I enquired at almost every shop on each side of the way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I beg leave to say, that I had that morning taken a little drop of ale, and calling at Mr. Barker's, where this unfortunate affair seems to have arisen, I stopped to dine with some gentlemen; instead of drinking three or four bottles of wine, I am confident we had eight or ten; I believe Mr. Martin paid for five, being the wine-merchant of the house; I was in a state of intoxication; and when I went from Barker's, I went home, which is a distance of three quarters of a mile at least; I took a 20l. note in the shop that evening, which, fortunately, I believe, a gentleman in Court can prove, who assisted me with part of the change; with respect to Mrs. Snowden, whom they have mentioned, it is a plain proof that I was very much in liquor, for I never knew or heard of the name before; and I think it is very hard a man cannot take a 20l. note, as I took that, without being tried for it.</p>

            Where do you live? - A. At No. 11, Exeter court, in the Strand; and know the prisoner very well: I called at his shop on Thursday evening, to see him, but did not; on Friday evening, the 9th, I called again, and saw him, some time between five and seven; I don't know what he came home about, but while I was waiting, he came in; and presently a decent dressed person came in also, and asked him for change for a note, but what the value of it was, I did not then know; he said, he did not think he could change it, without they would purchase something, he not knowing him; and the person laid out some money, perhaps four or five pounds, or something of that kind, in combs, I believe; I thought Jones was a litte tipsey; and he asked me if I could lend him any change; to oblige him who was a person I was very intimate with, I did lend him some, sooner than he should loose the sale of his goods, I think it was nine pounds, for I received a 10l. note afterwards from him, and I gave him a 1l. note; - it was three 2l. notes, and three 1l. notes; now I perfectly recollect; I understood the note he wanted change for was 20l.; I did not see the amount of the note, or the value of it; I did not pay much attention to it, and I suppose it was not above ten or fifteen minutes about; I have known the prisoner two years off and on, and I should have trusted him with any sum of money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you? - A. I have been an officer in the navy, but am not at this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you ceased to be so? - A. Since I was wounded in the West-Indies, about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been on half-pay ever since? - A. No, I was a warrant officer, a gunner, doing Lieutenant's duty.</p>
               <p>Q. What business have you been in? - A. I made a good deal of Prize-money, and I have a good deal of business in the navy agency way; I am agent for a number of officers, whose powers I have now in my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a house? - A. Yes, I do, and voted for Lord Gardner at the last election.</p>
               <p>Q. When this person came for change, Mr. Jones could not do it, unless he would take goods? - A. I believe that was it.</p>

I heard of the robbery, and knowing where she lived, I went to her place, and searched the room, where I found this mallet and gimlet, (produces them); I said, old girl, what did you do with the rest of the tools you had in the sack this morning; she said, it was paper; I searched her, and she took something out of her pocket; which she wanted to put into her mouth, but I stopped her, and it appears to be the duplicate of these planes; she wears breeches, and in her breeches pockets I found this book and other duplicates. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was going over Westminsterbridge, I asked a man for work, and he said, he wished I would pawn the planes for him, and he would give me 4d. which I did; I went down the area for the purpose the man has stated, but never touched a plane.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had two shillings in my waistcoat, which was gone, and I only took the cloaths up to see if I could find it, when the landlord asked me what I was doing with them, I said, looking for my money.</p>

             sworn. - I am a soldier; and was on guard down at Limehouse-hole: At nine o'clock. I saw the prisoner coming out of the fourth story of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140052"/>warehouse, down the ladder; when he got down, I examined him, and found twenty pounds weight of nails; I took them and him to the guard-room; going along, he said, he had a wife and family, and hoped I would let him go; he said, somebody had put the nails in his basket, he did not know how they came there. (The nails produced.)</p>
               <p>- REED sworn. - These are a sors of nails we use at the New Docks, and they belong to Mr. Wharton, the carpenter; the prisoner had worked there about twelve months, and was a steady man; our regular time is till seven o'clock, but we were in a hurry, and allowed the men to work as long as they could see.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have only to say, I am entirely innocent of the crime; how the nails came into my basket, or by whom they were put there, I cannot tell, unless the soldiers in the building put them in, and then gave notice to below, to extort money. The soldier called to me, saying, you have got nails in your basket; and if I had been guilty, I might have gone up the ladder again, and put them out; but being certain of my innocence, I gave the basket to be examined, and to my great surprise, saw the nails; the soldier was drunk at the time, therefore what credit will you give to him, particularly, as since my confinement, he had made an attempt to seduce my wife, and threatened he would break open her room-door; but promising, if she would grant him a certain favour, he would save her husband: to prove which, I can call respectable witnesses.</p>

            , junior: On the 5th of June, the prisoner came to me in Town-court, Cheapside, about five o'clock in the afternoon, saying that he came from Wells and Co. Fleet-street, and wanted apiece of mode, at about five shillings per ell; I told him, I had not got one at that price; and he wished to see one as near the price as I had got one; I let him see one at 4s. 3d. per ell, which he said, would do very well; and he wished to take it with him, because it was wanted immediately; he was asked what his name was, and he said it was John Hall; he took with him, a piece of mode, about 62 ells, making about 77 yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to part with this property? - A. He said, he came from Wells and Company, who are customers of our's; it is very customary in the silk trade, for gentlemen to send a porter, or some other person, without a note.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you parted with your property, believing the person came from Wells and Company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear positively to my person? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN GILCHRIST sworn. - I am partner in the house of Wells and Company, haberdahsers, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any other house of Wells and Company, in Fleet-street? - A. There is no other house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner? - A. I knew him about four years back, I bought some fans of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him at any time, about the 5th of June, to Smith and Clay, for some mode? - A. I never did, at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Or give him any directions for that purpose? - A. Never.(
