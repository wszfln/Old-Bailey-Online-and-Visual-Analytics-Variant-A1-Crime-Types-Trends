I reside at Sudbury, near Harrow, and on June 26th, about 11 a.m., I was walking along High Street, Shadwell, and felt a man put his arms round my neck—there was the ordinary traffic about—then the man came to the front and snatched my chain away—I did not see his face then, but I turned round and followed him until he got to the Docks—I called out "Police "and a dock constable came out of the dock gates and ran up one street while I ran up another—I did not see the prisoner caught, as I lost sight of him for about a minute—I next saw him when a policeman was handing him from the roof of a house into a livery stable yard—I lost my chain, but a little girl picked up the bar—my watch was left in my pocket—I was not injured.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective, City.</hi>) I have had the prisoners under observation since June 23rd—I saw Fisher on that day about 8.40 a.m. in Telegraph Street, Moorgate Street, by himself—he was loitering out<lb/>side the doorway of No. 1, which is known as the White House—it is a block of offices with a facing of white enamelled bricks—he subse<lb/>quently joined Smith in Basinghall Street, and after speaking to him went into the doorway of No. 10—he came out again and spoke to Smith, and after loitering there for a few minutes they both of them went away—I lost sight of them in one of the back courts off Aldermanbury—the next occasion I saw them was June 27th, about 9 a.m., when I saw Smith leaving his address, 25, Fitzroy Street, Fitzroy Square—I followed him into Euston Road and then he went back to the house again—about noon I saw him again in the neighbourhood of Red Lion Square with Fisher—they walked into Princeton Street, which leads from Red Lion Square into Bedford Row—they parted, Fisher going into Bedford Row Chambers, Princeton Street, which is the last house before you reach Bedford Row, on the left, and Smith walking to the corner of Princeton Street by Bedford Row, waited until Fisher came out—Fisher then joined Smith and they both walked across Theobald Road into Great James Street—they loitered in the neighbourhood for about half an hour and met a stranger—they all entered a public-house—I last saw them that day in Holborn by the corner of Warwick Court—on the next day, the 28th, I was watching 25, Fitzroy Street, when I saw Fisher enter the house at 7.50 a.m.—he knocked at the door and was admitted by someone whom I could not see—he only stood for a minute on the doorstep and was admitted within a reasonable time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190507240008"/>
               <p>not so quickly as if someone was standing behind the door to let him in—he was in the house about an hour—he then came out with Smith and I followed them to Portland Road, Holland Park, where they entered No. 5—this was about 9.58 a.m.—I had to return to Guildhall Police Court, so I left them there to two other officers—on June 30th I had them under observation, and also on the day of their arrest—on the 30th I saw them in Red Lion Square together, about 10.30 a.m.—they went to Bedford Row Chambers, Princeton Street, again, and were there about half an hour—Fisher entered Bedford Row Chambers while Smith waited outside at the corner—just before noon on July 1st I was with Detective Read in Red Lion Square, when we saw the prisoners coming to the Square from the direction of Theobald's Road—Fisher went into Bedford Row Chambers, leaving Smith outside again—Fisher remained there about fifteen minutes as near as I can say—he came out, carrying a small portmanteau, which he subsequently left at a coffee shop in Red Lion Street—I had them under observation up to the time of their arrest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave evidence at the Police Court—I was not examined as to my observation of the prisoners on June 30th and July 1st, so I did not say anything about that—the next witness was called and I stepped back, thinking that my evidence was finished—my evi<lb/>dence was read over to me—I commenced watching on June 23rd, about 8 a.m.—both the prisoners' addresses were unknown to me at the time—I watched 25, Fitzroy Street, on the 27th until Smith left, commencing about 7.30 a.m. and leaving off at 9 a.m.—I did not see them that day after 2 p.m.—on the morning of the 28th, when they came out of 25, Fitzroy Street, together, they went to a coffee shop and had some refresh<lb/>ments, which took about twenty minutes—I had them under observation that morning from about 7.50 till 10 a.m., when I left them—I did not see what coin they paid for the refreshments in the coffee shop—they did pay—on the 30th of June I kept them under observation for about four hours—Smith was arrested first, in the street, and Fisher some time after<lb/>wards—when at Gray's Inn Road police station later in the evening Smith said that Fisher had nothing to do with it—Fisher was at that time charged with being concerned with another man in uttering counterfeit coin on two occasions.</p>

I was with the last witness keeping observation on the prisoners on June 26th at 25, Fitzroy Street at 7 a.m.—Smith came out alone at 8 a.m. and we followed him to various places—at 9.15 a.m. he met Fisher in the gardens of Red Lion Square—we kept them under observation till about 1.30 p.m.—I followed them to various places—during that time I followed them on three occasions Fisher went into the doorway of 9, Warwick Court, and Smith remained some distance away; then he came out and Smith joined him again—I followed them to Princeton Street—when Fisher went into the doorway Smith</p>

               <p>would remain about five or ten yards off—on each occasion between those three times they returned to Red Lion Square and sat down and had a short conversation—I lost sight of them at the Tube station, Chancery Lane—on June 30th I was keeping observation at 25, Fitzroy Street, when I saw Fisher arrive there at 9.30 a.m. and knock at the door, when he was admitted by someone—he remained there about ten minutes, when he came out with Smith—they went to Bedford Row Chambers, Princeton Street, Bedford Row, and it was there that Detective Garrett joined me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am quite sure that Fisher went into a doorway in Warwick Court; they met together in Red Lion Square—it struck me as being important—I gave evidence at Bow Street on July 3rd with my note book to refresh my memory—I did not say anything about that then—I merely answered the questions put to me by counsel, whose name I do not know—I was trying to associate these two men together—I was merely asked whether I had seen them at such and such a time in the morning until 1.30, and I answered in the affirmative—I had furnished the solicitor with the whole of my notes on some day previously—I have conducted cases of this sort before—it struck me as odd that I was not asked anything about my seeing Fisher go to Smith's house at 9.30 a.m.—it is a matter of opinion whether it was important or not; I think it is—there was not a word said about it at the Police Court—my evidence there is only a few lines.</p>

On July 1st I went to Fitzroy Street, Fitzroy Square—acting from instructions I had re<lb/>ceived, I took under observation No. 25, about 7.30 a.m.—the house seemed to have been closed during the night—I saw the prisoners leav<lb/>ing the house about 9 a.m.—I followed them to a coffee shop close by in Euston Road, where they had breakfast—they were there about half an hour, when they came out and walked from there to the Albany, Great Portland Street—on coming out Smith went away for about half an hour and Fisher went down a mews close by—Fisher came from the mews and remained in the vicinity of the public house—Smith returned with another man about half an hour after their first arrival there—they re<lb/>mained together for about a quarter of an hour, all three men in con<lb/>versation; they picked this man up by some mews—they walked a little way down Great Portland Street and came back again towards the Albany; after a quarter of an hour the prisoners left the other man and walked together to Red Lion Square—I followed, and Smith appar<lb/>ently went into a doorway of the Sunday League office, Fisher remain<lb/>ing outside—Smith came out and joined Fisher—they then went to Bed<lb/>ford Row Chambers, Princeton Street, and Fisher went inside while Smith remained outside walking about until he came out—they then walked through various streets to Seven Dials, where they entered the Grapes public-house—they left there and walked to Cambridge Circus together—they then retraced their steps and went into the Bunch of Grapes</p>

               <p>another public-house, which is also in Seven Dials—they came out to<lb/>gether and walked up Shaftesbury Avenue through various streets to Bury Street, Bloomsbury Square—they walked past No. 12, Bury Street, which is a tobacconist and newsagent's shop kept by a Mrs. Hunt—after they had passed, Fisher handed something to Smith, who walked back and went into the shop, Fisher standing about thirty yards below the shop, close to the corner of Bury Street—on Smith coming out he joined Fisher, who had been apparently looking round and scouting during the time Smith was in the shop—they walked from there through various streets to Theobald's Road, which is two minutes from Princeton Street—Fisher apparently again handed something to Smith, who retraced his steps again and went into 132, Theobald's Road, a tobacconist and newsagent's kept by Miss Binning—Fisher was about thirty yards below the shop, looking down in the direction of the shop where Smith had gone—Smith came out of the shop—with Detective Read I went and saw Miss Binning; I had a conversation with her and she handed Read a coin which he examined and marked—when Smith came out I directed two City officers to keep the prisoners under observation with a view to arrest—I went back to Mrs. Hunt at 12, Bury Street, and had a conversation with her, when she produced to me this coin, which I found to be a counterfeit florin—I marked it—on leaving there I went to Red Lion Square, where I anticipated these prisoners would be—I was accompanied by Read, and I saw both prisoners together in Princeton Street—before we got up to them Fisher went down Princeton Street, while Smith went up Red Lion Street at right angles—with Read I followed Smith and caught him just as he was entering a coffee shop—I said to him, "I am a police officer, and I shall arrest you for uttering counterfeit coin"—I tried to search Smith on the spot—as I was dis<lb/>guised very much as a rough, the crowd thought I was trying to take a liberty with him, so they became rather hostile—I took him to the station, when I found two counterfeit florins, one in his right side waist-coat pocket and one in his top left waistcoat pocket—the one in the top left waistcoat pocket was wrapped in very soft tissue paper—I also found 14s. in separate shillings, nineteen sixpences, sixpence in bronze and also two unopened packets of Wills' Gold Flake cigarettes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Chief Inspector, New Scotland Yard</hi>). On July 1st I went to Gray's Inn Road police station, where I found the prisoners in custody—on the afternoon of that day I went to 25, Fitzroy Street, Fitzroy Square, in company with Carlin and Gillard, where I saw Mrs. Date, who pointed out the ground floor back parlour to me—I, with. The other officers, searched the room—in the grate, in which there were ashes from a recent fire, I found a piece of worn emery cloth (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and a piece of white metal and this hook, such as is used to hang coins up while in the bath (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—on the front of the fender facing the room, there was this splash of white metal (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is a small fender round the grate—in a cupboard underneath a washing stand I found this black bag, which was locked (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I unlocked it with a key I had seen found on Smith and found these three crucibles (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), one containing melted white metal, and a piece of melted white metal (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), a pair of pliers showing marks of having been blackened by the fire, I should suggest, while taking off the crucible, a number of loose pieces of tin or metal hooks, similar to the one found in the grate—I searched the cup<lb/>board in which I found the bag, and found fourteen moulds similar to this one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), with the impressions scraped out, a large quantity of broken pieces of mould, a quantity of what I have called polishing rags, and a quantity of loose plaster of Paris which had not been used, a knife bearing marks of plaster of Paris, a spoon also with the same marks, and a tin containing a substance which looked like powdered brick dust—I also found a bottle labelled "Poison "(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), containing a liquid of which I poured some out—I dipped a halfpenny into it, and it had the effect of silvering it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I examined the iron oven range and found that this bottom plate (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) bore marks of plaster of Paris—I found four packets of unopened Wills' Gold Flake cigarettes (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and fifty pictures taken from, I believe, Wills' Gold Flake cigarette packets (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I took these fragments of mould, to the office at Scotland Yard, and by carefully sifting them through our fingers, we took out some thirteen pieces of what appear to be milling, of which I produce two, and we also found three pieces of plaster of Paris, which were apparently parts of the mould of a florin—Sergeant Deacon took some photographs of some of the pieces, which he enlarged—he also photographed two of the counterfeit florins—I have compared the pieces containing portions of inscriptions of a florin, and find they correspond with the counterfeit florins—during the time he was in custody at Gray's Inn Road police station Fisher gave me his address, 5, Portland Road, Holland Park, telling me that he occupied the top floor back room in the name of Charles Roberts—when charged he said his name was Charles Robert Fisher—I went with Sergeant Carlin to his address and found in his room twelve small files, a pair of pincers, a wooden wedge and a receipt for a deposit in Parr's Bank, Notting Hill branch, for £200—I found no cash, good or bad—I then returned to Gray's Inn Road police station about 10 p.m.—I heard Gillard make a statement, and the prisoners were charged together with uttering counterfeit coins and possessing implements for coining—Gillard described his observations of the prisoners and their arrest, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190507240013"/>
               <p>when he mentioned that be saw Fisher and Smith come out of 25, Fitzroy Street, Fisher said, "I did not sleep at 25, Fitzroy Street; you did not see me leave the house"—Miss Binning then made a statement with regard to the prisoners, to which neither prisoner said anything—the charge was then formally read to both of them, to which neither made reply—about a minute after, Smith said, "This man (Fisher) knows nothing about it. I acknowledge the passing and I acknowledge possessing the im<lb/>plements, but they were for making keys, not coin. I have not made any"—on the way to the cells Fisher said to me, "They did not see me give him any counterfeit coin. I might have given him some good money."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was with reference to Gillard saying that he saw something pass between Fisher and Smith that Fisher said, about ten minutes afterwards, "They did not see me give him any counterfeit coin"—nearly all the things I found in Smith's room were hidden in the washstand—I do not think files are much used for coining, except to file off the end of the metal called the "get"; emery paper does just as well—with regard to the files found in Fisher's room, I do not think they were used for coining—I do not remember Fisher saying that he had only known Smith fourteen days; he could not have known him much longer than that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> They were both together when Smith was asked his address, which he refused—Fisher gave his Address at once—I handed the four counterfeit florins, three handed to me by Gillard and one by Read, to Deacon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Walter Date, a printer's reader, of 25, Fitzroy Street, Fitzroy Square—on May 17th Smith came and took a back parlour on the ground floor at 8s. a week, for which he paid me 4s. in advance—I let the room to him in the name of Raven; he simply said he wanted a room; he did not tell me what he was—I employed Elizabeth Smith at my house as a charwoman, and during the whole of the time that Smith had the room she was at work in that capacity—he had a fire in his room while he was there to July 1st—he used to order his own coals, which he kept in the back yard—I saw Fisher once when, he came to the house; it was raining—it was between 3 and 4 p.m., but I cannot say what the date was—he knocked at the door, but Smith was not in, and he went away again—my husband was going to let him in, but I would not let him in, as he was a strange man—I saw him on another occasion on the opposite side of the road, waiting—Raven, that is Smith, went over and met him, and they walked in the direction of Goodge Street—my lodgers have a latchkey, and they come in and out when they like—Smith had a key—if anybody called at 7.30 a.m. I would not open the door; I should not be up—if Fisher came very early, Smith would open the door to him—I have heard voices in the next room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 37, Upper Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square, with my husband—at the end of last May I was employed by Mrs. Date as a charwoman, going to her house every day—Smith occupied the back parlour on the ground floor—I knew him by the name of Raven, and I attended to his room—I laid a fire for him, but I did not light it—the mornings after I laid it there were ashes—on most days it had been lit, but there were some days in between when it had not been lit—with the exception of two or three days I laid the fire during the latter part of June—on the last week before he was arrested there were a few days on which I did not have to lay the fire; it might have been three, but no more—I have noticed when taking out the ashes that there were some white splashes similar to whiting between the bars of the grate and the oven door, and there were three packets of what appeared to be whiting in the cupboard of the washstand—on emptying the basin I have seen some sort of white sediment at the bottom—whilst at work there a gentleman came on two occasions to enquire for Smith—I am almost sure it was Fisher—I saw him in the place; I did not answer the door to him—on the first occasion I saw him coming into Smith's room and on the second occasion he was coming out—the first time was in the afternoon, and the second in the morning, I cannot tell the exact times—I usually got there at 9 a.m.—it might have been 10 a.m. when I saw him in the morning; he did not stop long—in the afternoon he might have been there forty-five minutes—I have seen this black bag in the washstand; it is Smith's—when I handled it it was heavy and was locked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Fisher's face, but I did not take particular notice of him—there are quite a number of boarders who have friends coming in and out—I cannot give you any idea of the dates when Fisher came—I should say it was a fortnight before Smith was arrested that Smith came the second time—last Monday I was taken to the police station to identify Fisher—I saw twelve men, but I did not pick him out from amongst them—I cleaned the step at about 9.30 a.m. every morn<lb/>ing—about 9.15 a.m. on July 1st Smith left the house alone—I did not see him join anyone outside—Fisher remained ten minutes on the first occasion that he called; I saw him go into the house—I could not identify him at the police station, but the more I look at Fisher the more I think</p>

               <p>he is the man—I could have identified him, only I was not quite sure—I was at the Police Court on one occasion more than an hour when I saw him in the dock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I saw him in the dock at Bow Street I really could identify him; I was almost sure that he was the right man—I first heard of the prisoner's being in custody a week after he was arrested—I can remember Saturday, July 1st, particularly, because that was the day on which I left Mrs. Date's employ—as near as I can say, it was between 9.15 and 9.20 a.m. that morning when he let me in—he had been out already and he came across to the door and asked me if I would like him to let me in, and he opened the door for me with his latchkey—he then went off—I saw him at the corner, before I got to the door, go into a laundry in London Street, which is only just across the road—I came along London Street to get to the house, and he came along behind me—I did not see anyone else besides him.</p>

               <p>not like absolutely to say that they are coin moulds, because the centre pieces have all been scraped out—they are the shape of the ordinary kind of moulds, and moulds are always made in plaster of Paris—I have seen bent pieces of metal, which are to hold the coins in the bath in what is called the dipping solution, without the aid of a battery—the bottle labelled "Poison "contains cyanide of potassium and nitrate of silver, which is used for silvering purposes without the aid of a battery.</p>

               <p>coming from the direction of Wembley—I had previously been to a fire in that direction, and knew what had happened—I was standing still when the prisoner approached me and bid me "Good-morning"—he was not calling out "Fire "or anything of that sort—he had some pieces of hay and seeds on his jacket—I said to him, "It looks as if you had been among the hay somewhere"—he took a seat on the coping of a wall, and in a few seconds said, "I may as well tell you the truth; I set the stack on fire"—I told" him I should take him to the station—he said, "I cannot get any work, and I might as well be in prison"—a little farther up the road he said, "I am on the Crimes List and am well known at Brixton prison, and this will be enough to get me twelve months"—at the station, after making my statement to the officer on duty, the prisoner said he wished to make a statement, and it was taken down—he was quite sober to my idea—when charged he made no reply—I went to a field at Wem<lb/>bley, where the stack was on fire and also a waggon—several people were in the road—the stack belonged to Mr. Carpenter, of Church Road, Willesden—it was not completely burnt out, but the waggon was—nothing else was damaged that I saw.</p>

"I would give it to her, only she has gone to fetch a policeman; I would sooner go down for it"—Glover's friend had gone for a policeman—I saw 4s. 3d. in White's hand.</p>

I am a costermonger of 60, Britannia Row, Essex Road—between 9 and 10 p.m. on June 19th I was in Chapel Street, Clerkenwell, sitting outside the Market public-house on a barrow when the prisoners came up and said they were going to do the same as the brothers Stratton to Vince, who was sitting by me—I have known them all my life—they are costermonger and I carry on my business in the same street as <hi rend="italic">them</hi>—I had a row with their brother two years ago about some rabbits—I have not had a row with them since—in the winter I sell rabbits at my barrow and in the summer, fruit—Vince is a costermonger and goes to the meat market as well—they had had enough to drink—I told them to clear out—the wife of one of the prisoners came up and the prisoners walked away—<hi rend="italic">me</hi> and Vince went in and had drink and came out—as I was going home William Sewell came up from behind and stabbed me in the back—I saw Edward had a knife also—this small Knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was left sticking in my back—I was also stabbed in the neck, and I have still got the marks—I fell to the ground and was taken to the hospital—I went in on the Monday and came out on the Saturday week—both prisoners stabbed me, William stabbing me first.</p>

I am a meat porter, of 11, North Street, Clerkenwell—between 9 and 10 p.m. on June 19th I was with Grady outside the Market public-house in Chapel Street, when the prisoners came up and said, "We are going to do the same <hi rend="italic">that</hi> the brothers Stratton <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done. We are brothers together, and we are going to kill a few in Chapel Street"—they did not seem to me to be drunk—William Sewell's wife came up and said to him, "Why don't you go away?"and I said, "Me go away; why should I go away? I am going to stop here"—Grady turned round and said to the prisoners, "Clear out of it"—we were sitting on someone's barrow—they then left us—Grady and I had a glass of ale together—we then came out and he left me at the barrow and went down the street—all of a sudden somebody at the side said, "Look out; he is going down the street"—I ran after Grady, but before I got up to him Edward Sewell struck him in the back with a knife—Grady cried out, "For God's sake, whatever you do, pull it out"—Edward Sewell and he then both fell to the ground—I pulled out the knife from Grady's back—amongst the crowd that collected were Edward Sewell's and Samuel Sewell's wives, and they started sticking me with hatpins</p>

               <p>as I was trying to get Grady up, and I had to <hi rend="italic">cock</hi> my leg up to push them away—I got Grady to his feet and helped him to the bottom of Chapel Street—William was right behind Grady at the time of the stabbing—I did not see him do anything—another <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> and <hi rend="italic">me</hi> got Grady into a cab, and he was driven to the hospital—I cannot say where he was wounded.</p>

I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—Grady was brought in with three wounds down the left side of the back of his neck, and one over his shoulder behind, and he was bleeding rather severely—the wound at the top of his neck was a deep one, and I tied an artery there—he had lost a lot of blood, and his shirt was soaked with it—the wound at the top of his neck was a serious one; it had not gone through any very big vein, but it was in a dangerous place—I think either of these knives could have produced the wounds—I think he was in the hospital about a fortnight, bat I had nothing to do with him whilst he was in—I saw him when he went out; his wounds were quite healed then.</p>

On July 1st I saw the prisoners detained at Gray's Inn Road police station—I afterwards went to 25, Fitzroy Street, with Carlin—we searched the back parlour on the ground floor, which was pointed out to us—in the fireplace I found this piece of used emery cloth, and this piece of metal in the fire<lb/>grate in the ashes, where there had been a recent fire—the metal is used to hold the counterfeit coin in what is called the bath to plate it, while it is dipped in the solution—the small fender round the grate was splashed with white metal—in the cupboard of a washstand I found this locked bag—I unlocked it with the key that had been found on Smith, and in it I found three crucibles, one of them with metal inside, and a bar of soft tin, also a pair of pliers, showing marks of having been recently used in the fire by the black on them, a knife with marks of white metal on it, some plaster of Paris, a spoon with similar marks, and containing powder which is used for polishing, and some similar metal was found in the fireplace—in the same cupboard I found fourteen moulds with impressions of coins scraped out—these are two parts, and there were a large quantity of fragments, apparently scrapings of the moulds, and a quantity of plaster of Paris; also a bottle containing a liquid acid—I afterwards placed this halfpenny in the acid, with the result that it is now silvered after being dipped in the liquid—I found other articles (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I took out the bottom plate of the oven, and found traces where a quantity of plaster of Paris moulds had been placed to dry—I found four packets of Gold Flake cigarettes, and fifty new pictures similar to this—I after<lb/>wards</p>

               <p>examined carefully the fragments of plaster of Paris and broken moulds, and took out thirteen pieces of what appeared to be the milling of coin, and three pieces bear the lettering of coin—those have been sub<lb/>mitted to experts for examination, and I had a photograph taken of one florin, which has the impression of the letters "<hi rend="largeCaps">RITT</hi> "on it—these are enlarged photographs (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I afterwards went to Fisher's resi<lb/>dence with another officer, and made a search there—I found no counter<lb/>feit coin, and no coining implements—I found this hand vice, and twelve very fine files, also a gimlet and fourteen keys—the files bear no marks of coining—there was also a deposit note for £200 on Parr's Bank, Notting Hill branch—after the search I again went to Gray's Inn Road police station, where, the prisoners and myself being present, Gillard said that he had been to Fitzroy Street, and saw two men leave Fitzroy Street about 9 that morning—shortly afterwards Fisher said, "I did not sleep at 25, Fitzroy Street; you did not see me leave the house"—Miss Binning also made a statement as to the uttering of the counterfeit florin at her shop—the prisoners were then charged, and the charge formally read over to them—a minute or two afterwards Smith said, "This man knows nothing whatever about it. I acknowledge everything; I acknowledge the passing; I acknowledge the possessing of the implements, but they were for making keys, not coins, and I have not made any"—on the way to the cells Fisher said, "They did not see me give him any counterfeit coin; I might have given him some good money"—Fisher gave me his address as 5, Portland Road, Holland Park—he said he occupied the top back room in the name of Charles Roberts—these photographs are enlargements of the originals.</p>

I don't know anything about the pawnticket"—I then told him the charge was "being concerned with Wood, also with receiving the property, well knowing it to be stolen"—when charged he said, "I don't know anything about that; all I know is that the man took the boots off and gave them to me to sell."</p>

                  </hi>. I am now in a situation in Scotland—in June, 1904, I was lady's maid to Mrs. Caryll, at 3, Curzon Street—the prisoner was employed there as a general servant—her name then was Hilda Cheney—she has since married—at that time I had a house at Putney in which I had invested my savings—I left the service at the end of July or the beginning of August and took apartments at 12, Quebec Street—about August 12th the prisoner came there and told me that my late mistress had missed a lot of things and jewels and she blamed her for it—she came again on another day and said that my late mistress blamed me for it as well—it was little diamond brooches one day and clothes another—the prisoner said that she would be taken to prison and I as well, if the money for the things was not found before a certain hour of the day, but that she would not tell the mistress where I was and would keep me safe—I think it was about £30 that she wanted—I did not know where to go for the money, so I went to my solicitor, who kept the deeds of my house, and got £30 from him, which I handed to the prisoner to give to her mistress—she told me there were detectives waiting till she came back with the money—I had not taken any of my late mistress's things—the prisoner came a few days afterwards and said that Mrs. Caryll missed some linen—the prisoner said that £10 would cover its value, so I gave her £10—she said she would not ask me for any money, only her own solicitor was out of town—she came again later and said there were some more jewels missing and also that Mrs. Caryll said that she had given me £25 in notes to pay a dressmaker's bill and that I had kept the money and not done so—there was no foundation for that state<lb/>ment—I was frightened; the prisoner trembled so that she made me tremble—I knew it was not true, but at the same time I thought one never knows what they will say, so I got £40 from my solicitor, of which I handed the prisoner £30—this was on August 29th—the prisoner gave me this receipt for £70, but I had forgotten a £5 note I had handed to her—it should have been for £75—the prisoner and I went to my solicitor's and as we came out he came behind and heard the prisoner say to me, "If I were you I should clear myself; it would be much better for you and myself"—I said I should not clear myself, I should do what I could to help her in getting out of prison—at the end of August or the beginning of September I went abroad, but before doing so I said to the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190507240036"/>
               <p>"What shall I do with my luggage? I shall have to leave it here in my lodgings or else I must store it"—she said, "I will take it away and put it in Day's house and take great care of it; it will be as safe as gold" I was pleased with that arrangement and agreed—there were two trunks, and this is a list of the things in them as near as I can remember—I went off to Belgium—I gave my solicitor instructions to sell my house, which he did, and I received a remittance from him while I was abroad—I wrote to the prisoner once or twice while I was away and wrote to her that I was coming back—she met me at the station—I had in my posses<lb/>sion a draft for £190—this was December 29th—I asked the prisoner if everything was over and she said, "No; the case is coming on next week"—she asked me if my solicitor had sent me the rest of the money for my house—I said, "Yes"—she said that the detectives were still after me and that there was a description of me in a paper and that wherever I should be they would catch me if I showed up—I said, "What shall I do? I have a cheque, but I have got no money"—she said, "Don't go to the bank; I will change it for you, because they would not go by your name; they would go by your figure as you are described"—I believed what she told me—she asked me where I was going to—I said, "I have got a room at Prince's Road, No. 7"—she said, "Don't go there, because the detectives have been there and they will go there Again and find you"—she added, "I have a nice room at Clapham Junc<lb/>tion"—I said, "Very well; I will let the people know I am not coming"—she said, "I will see to that; I will write"—she said I had better go by "bus, because if I went in a cab they would very likely stop me—I went to the address she gave me at Clapham Junction—when there I handed her the cheque, having endorsed it—she said she would go to the bank to-morrow morning soon after 10 and probably be back about 12—I gave her the cheque to change and to give me the money the next morn<lb/>ing—while in Belgium she wrote me that things had smoothed down—soon after I handed her the cheque, I saw her again—I said, "Where is my money?"—she said, "I could not change the cheque"—I said, "Let me have the cheque; Mrs. Prior will change it for me"—she said she had put it in her trunk and that her trunks were locked up by the detectives till the case was over—I wrote her several times—she sent me £1—she afterwards said that she gave the cheque to a gentleman to change and that he had never come back with the money—I asked the prisoner for an acknowledgment—she said she would make it good, as she had several houses coming from her mother, only the business could not be settled, as she had a foster sister who claimed the money and it took the solicitor some time to settle it up—she gave me this acknow<lb/>ledgment—it is described there as a "loan," but it was not—she has not given me the money—she gave me this letter to take to the manager of a bank where her money was supposed to be—I went there, but the manager said he knew nothing about it—later on I went to Mrs. Caryll and then communicated with the police—on June 21st last I went with Sergeant Haines to 74, Honeywell Road, where the prisoner had been living, and found there one of my trunks empty and with the lock broken</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner frightened me so that I dare not move out of my lodgings—I quite believed what she said—I could not think she was telling me a lie from the way she trembled—I told her I did not want any trouble and I would try and borrow the money from my solicitor—I told my solicitor that Mrs. Caryll had missed the things and that there were two detectives and that I was frightened, and I believe my solicitor said, "I should not give her any more money if I were you," and that I said to him, "I am quite sure it is true from the way she said it"—I did not tell him everything, but sufficient to make him understand why I wanted the money—I got the money to help the prisoner out of her trouble as much as I could—I was supposed to have been in it—it is not true that I lent her the money to start a boarding house—I know what "lending" is—I have not lent any money—she said if I went to the bank the detectives would be after me, so I let her go with the cheque and she said she would bring the money back at 12 o'clock—there was nothing of much value in the trunks, but there was a jacket which cost £7 10s. and a skirt which cost £2 10s.—I did not tell the prisoner that her husband's daughter could have the jacket—I did not give the jacket away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I left the boxes with the prisoner they were fastened by locks—I had the keys and kept them—the prisoner had no means of opening the locks except by breaking them open or getting another key—there is no foundation for the statement that I gave her any of the things—I was frightened because I thought I was going to be arrested, although innocent of any charge—I wished to avoid that—after I had been at Clapham Junction for three or four weeks there was a suggestion in a letter about managing a boarding house—that was three or four weeks after I had parted, with my cheque—it was quite a new thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired business man, principally dealing in real estate of late years—before I retired I was general manager of the Electric Lighting Company at Porte le Prairie, Manitoba—since retiring I have principally been living in Toronto and the town of Porte le Prairie—in February of this year I was in this country—on February 21st I went to the British Museum, and was looking at some articles from South Sea Islands when the prisoner, who was a stranger, said to me that he had seen some of them in Australia or the South Seas—he asked me if I was from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190507240040"/>
               <p>America and I told him I came from Canada, and he said he thought so; that his name was Johnston; that he was born in California; that he was a mining engineer by profession, and was visiting London for a short time—we sat down on one of the benches and talked for over half an hour or more—in the end he walked to my lodgings, 4 and 5, Montague Street, a residential hotel, and wished me to meet him at the Jermyn Street Museum next day—he called for me next day and we went to the Jermyn Street Museum—I was in his company that day for at least two or three hours—he said that he would like me to go to the Natural History Museum in Kensington the next day, and we parted, he having arranged to call for me next day, Thursday, February 23rd—the next day he came to my lodgings at 10 a.m. and asked me to go with him and meet a friend of his at the Russell Hotel—we went there and met a man coming down the steps of the hotel, whom the prisoner intro<lb/>duced to me as "Mr. Harvey, from Australia"—we then started to go towards Euston Station for the Kensington Museum, and I told them they were going in the wrong direction, but they thought it would be better to go over and take the Underground from there—we got as far as St. Pancras station, where Harvey asked us to wait and he would go and buy the tickets—it was my first visit to that station—on his return after a few minutes the prisoner suggested that we should go into the St. Pancras Hotel and have some refreshment—I do not know whether Harvey brought any tickets back; he did not show them to me—we were walking out by the drive round to the front of the hotel when the prisoner drew my attention to the fact that a letter had been dropped; this was in the archway of the premises of the railway—I saw a letter on the ground and picked it up while the prisoner and Harvey called to a stranger, who was walking out of the archway, that he had dropped the letter—he turned round and I handed it to him—he thanked us sincerely and asked us to go into the hotel and have some refreshment with him—we went with him into the hotel and sat down on the main stairway and he called for refreshments—he thanked us again and said that the letter was not of much consequence, but that it was from a friend who had written to him a few days before that—he then told us after a few minutes' conversation that he was from India; that his uncle had died there and left him and his brother £800,000 between them, and that he was going to live in England and Ireland, as the climate of India did not agree with him—after a few minutes he told us that he had had quite an experience the night before, a lady having introduced herself to him at the Empire, and that he had gone home with her, where she had introduced her nieces and a gentleman to him; that he had got gambling there and had lost some money—we advised him not to go there again, as he intended to do, but he said they were all right; he seemed to me to be a very simple-minded man—the prisoner whispered to me that we should accompany him to this place and protect him, but I told him that I did not wish to go—finally the stranger agreed that he would not go, as he said he began to realise that they were bad people, and he thanked us very much in the matter—he introduced himself as Burke—he said the letter did not</p>

               <p>amount to anything, and as he was going out to the lavatory he said, "You may read it if you wish; it is not of very much consequence"—after he had gone Harvey read the letter aloud and it ran, as near as I can remember, like this: "Dear Friend,—I am very pleased to hear of your great wealth, but sorry to hear of your uncle's death. You are now a very rich man, and I hope you will make good use of your money. You made one mistake before leaving India, but I hope in time it will be over-looked," and then it went on to say that the writer would be pleased to meet him on a future occasion—when he came back either Harvey or the prisoner asked him what the mistake was that he had made in India, and he told us—Burke then asked the prisoner how much money he could command in the City and he said, "About £800"—he then turned to Harvey and asked him the same and Harvey said, "About £600"—he asked me then, and as I hesitated he said, "I will tell you my reason for asking in a moment if you will tell me"—I then told him I had £500 I could command—"Well," he says, "my reason for asking is that I want to see if you are men of any substance. I am most thankful to you for your kindness in this case, because these people might have robbed me and killed me, and I will give you the use of £2,000 each for five years"—the prisoner and Harvey thanked him very much, but I said I did not want any of his money, as I was tolerably well off without it—he said that I might have it as well as the others as long as I gave fair security for it—he then went into the lavatory again, and the prisoner and Harvey told me I had better take the money as well as they, as they really wanted it, saying they could double the money in that time as well as give fair security for it—I said that if it was a benefit to them I would take it and that I could give good security too—Burke came back in a moment or so and we thanked him for his offer—he said he would give us the money if we produced the amount of money that we said we each had in an hour or so in the same place—the prisoner said he had his money in a bank down the Strand, not mentioning any name, and he went off—Harvey and I went off, and he left me, saying he had got his money at a certain street of which I forget the name—I went into Lloyd's Bank in Lombard Street, where I had my credit, and drew out £80, which was all the money I had there at the time—they told me if I wanted more they would cable to Canada for it—I went back to St. Pancras Hotel with the £80 and met them all there—I told them that £80 was all the cash I had at the bank and that I should have to cable for more, and that I did not wish to do so—in the meantime I said to Harvey that I did not wish to go to the expense of cabling to Canada till I knew that Burke had the money to lend—Burke turned round at once and handed to Harvey a bundle of bills and said, "This is £60. You keep that. It is a pledge of good faith until Blake gets his money to-morrow"—I am not well acquainted with English money, but they seemed to be bank<lb/>notes—I went out and telephoned to Lloyd's Bank for them to cable for he for £400—in the meantime I arranged with a friend of mine, a Mr. Dawson, in the City, to lend me £220, and the next day he and I went to his bank and got the £220—I also got from my bank the £400—I</p>

I am a licensed victualler and keep the Woolpack public-house, Bermondsey Street—I only know Perry from observation of him on the night of the robbery on April 7th and the previous evening, when I saw him from about 7 to 8 o'clock in the private bar—the plan produced is correct—I am not so certain about Snell—on Friday, April 7th, between 8.30 and 9 p.m., I saw them in my</p>

               <p>bar—I left the private bar for a time and went into the bar parlour, from where I can see the bar—Perry and his companion were sitting near the flap—they had ordered two drinks and had the glasses in front of them—I think Snell was the other man—I remained twenty to thirty minutes in the bar parlour—I saw Perry for about ten or fifteen minutes, when Ellen Burnes, a barmaid, came into the bar and the men wore gone—she was so white I thought she would have dropped dead—she seemed very much frightened and made a complaint, and I went upstairs to my daughter Harriet's room on the second floor at the top of the house—I found the chest of drawers burst open, where I kept money as Treasurer of the Forester's Loan Society—between £30 and £40 had gone—I had last seen it on the previous Tuesday, when the Court had met—I kept it in my daughter's room because she is a better scholar, and kept my accounts—the drawers were kept locked—I went into my own bedroom on that floor—I missed my watch and Albert chain with a £2 piece on it in a gold case; it was a presentation watch when I was fifty years of age, and other articles to the value of £60, which I kept under lock and key—the wardrobe was forced open—I had locked it myself in the morning—that is where the watch and chain were—I next saw Perry at Westminster Police Court on June 23rd, and picked him out at once—there are two staircases, the ordinary one and a spiral one—customers use the lavatory on the first floor—they use either staircase—the ordinary one from the four-ale side is an old-fashioned staircase—the spiral staircase is used for gentry to go and dine in the club-room; it leads from the front of the house to the dining room—either can be used for the lavatory, but not beyond, and we have a gate on the old staircase with a catch so that people cannot make a mistake—beyond the first floor nobody has a right to go.</p>

I am a barmaid at the Woolpack—on April 6th I was serving in the bar from between 7.30 and 8 p.m.—Perry came in between 8 and 8.30—I had never seen the prisoners before—Mr. Shepherd and several other gentlemen were in the bar—Mrs. Shepherd and two other young ladies were serving—I saw the prisoners in the saloon bar—they were served by the <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>—I served them about half an hour after they came in—they stayed till after 12—when I served Perry he laughed and asked me how I was, and then I was called to serve another customer—afterwards Perry was looking round, and he said, "Are they bells up there?" pointing to two bells and something like a button round the bells—I said, "Yes, I believe they are"—he said, "Do you think they are fire bells?"—I said I should think they were—I believe they lead to doors—Snell was reading—Perry paid for the drinks—he said, "Is that your mistress?" pointing to Mrs. Tucker, the manageress—I said, "Yes"—the prisoners sat in the bar that evening for about four</p>

               <p>hours—I missed one or the other occasionally—about three times I noticed that—I saw Snell go to the door, and come back with a paper in his hand—he came from the street—the next evening they came into the same bar about 8 or 8.15—the mistress served them, and afterwards I served them—in about fifteen or twenty minutes they began laughing, and talking about one thing, and another—I noticed Perry had gone out, and I said to Snell, "Is your friend gone?"—he said, "Yes, he won't be long"—he said he had taken medicine, and I came to the conclusion he had gone to the lavatory—Miss Burnes, one of the barmaids, went out—as she was going through the door Perry said, "Is that young lady going out for the evening?"—I said, "Yes, I believe she is"—it was after that that we had the conversation about the medicine—I did not see Perry in the bar after that—the last I saw of Snell was when he went to the door with a book in his hand—on the Friday night they drank stout and mild, and mild and bitter, and they left half of it in each glass, which is very unusual—Miss Burnes came back—I next saw Perry at Westminster, when I picked him out without any hesitation from about six or seven others—I saw Snell about four days afterwards.</p>

I am a chemist and druggist at Princess Road, Kilburn, and I have a branch business at 67, Fernhead Road, Kilburn—on May 10th, 1904, I was advertising for a manager for that branch and I received this letter, dated May 20th, by way of application—it enclosed certain testimonials which purported to be from two different people in whose employment the writer had been—I answered that application and finally received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which has been proved to be in the prisoner's writing—as a result of that the prisoner entered upon his duties at my branch shop at Fernhead Road on May 28th, 1904—the terms were £2 a week—the shop was stocked as an ordinary chemist's shop is, and amongst other things poisons were kept—the prisoner was manager of that shop down to January 27th, 1905—on January 2nd I had to give the prisoner notice, the reason I gave him being that the sales had not been quite up to expectation—there was the usual month's notice, at the end of which he was to leave.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him about twice a day—I saw Stanley once or twice, and I believe I saw the twins once, outside the shop with the prisoner's wife, who was just going out—I do not remember ever noticing that the prisoner left his keys behind in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Shelley Road, Harlesden, and am agent to the landlord of some newly erected houses in Milton Avenue—No. 60 comprises two flats, one on the ground floor and one on the top floor, led to by a common door—the house had been occupied prior to December, 1904, but it was unoccupied in that month—shortly before Christmas, 1904, I remember the prisoner calling upon me in relation to taking a flat in Milton Avenue—at first he gave no name, but afterwards he gave me the name of Egerston or Egerbaston, I cannot remember which—I showed him over more than one of the flats, amongst them being No. 60—about Christmas Eve he came to see me just before mid-day and settled on the upper part of No. 60 and gave me a deposit—he said he</p>

               <p>wanted it for about six weeks, as he had already taken a quarterly house with a friend, and he wanted to move out in February—he asked me to keep the lower floor empty for him, as he had got a little boy and did not want him to mix with other children—I agreed to that, as I thought it was reasonable—he moved into the flat about December 31st, his rent being 7s. 6d. a week, which then became payable—Mr. Perkins was agent for the rent—I was always a good deal in Milton Avenue looking after the property—I had seen Mrs. Devereux out with the twins and I had seen Stanley—I did not get any notice when the prisoner intended to leave the flat—I remember being in Milton Avenue on Tuesday, February 7th, about 11 a.m., and seeing a van standing outside No. 60 and some boxes being placed on it—I went across and asked the prisoner whether he was going to shift away—only five weeks were then up—he told me he was only shifting a few boxes into furnished apartments, but he did not intend to go away for a day or two—he did not say what was going to happen to the the boxes—no furniture was placed on that van—the same evening I was again in the Avenue, and outside No. 60 I saw another van and I went and asked the prisoner about the rent—the van was being loaded with chairs and tables and other furniture—I said to the prisoner, "I thought you said to me you were not going away for a day or two"—he said he had got a place and he thought he had better shift out at once—he meant that he had furnished apartments and he thought he had better move out at once as he had settled on a place—there was a week's rent owing at the time, and he told me that when he got his money for the furniture which was to be sold he would pay me out of it—I walked with him and his little boy in the direction of the Royal Oak—there was a lot of conversation about the expenses of the milk for the children—he said they cost a lot of money and he spent half a sovereign a week in milk, and also he said that he would not be pestered with his mother-in-law, and that he had threatened to blow her brains out with a revolver if she came on his doorstep again—he said he had been troubled with her a great deal, and he would clear out of the way so that she would not find him again—he said that I might be troubled in a day or two with his mother-in-law trying to ascertain where he had gone, but I was not to say anything—he did not tell me where he was going and I did not know where he had gone—I asked him about his letters and said if any letters were left under the door I would save them for him if he liked to call for them, but he said all his arrangements as to letters had been made and he did not suppose there would be anything important—there were one or two, probably a circular, which I gave to the postman—the prisoner and I went to the Royal Oak, where he paid me 7s. 6d., a week's rent—I had the key of the house—that same evening I had some communication from Mrs. Wells, who lives at 58, Milton Avenue, in consequence of which I went to the back yard of No. 60 in order to see if there were any traces of tire or any danger from fire—there were indications that there had been a fire, but I just trod on it and left it—it was just smouldering—next day I went all over No. 60—in the back bedroom I found some sealing wax and screws, and a piece of board was in the front room—I told my little boy to take the screws home as they might be</p>

               <p>handy—the sealing wax was red—three or four weeks later I paid another visit to No. 60 with Mrs: Wells—I was going in to take a man to clean it down and Mrs. Wells followed me in—that was about the first week in March—I went into one of the rooms, I cannot remember which, and saw some bottles on the mantelpiece—they were labelled "Prussic Acid" and "Poison"—the poison label was a white one—I did not touch the bottle—there was something in it—we said to one another, "There is enough there to poison anybody"—I had not seen it the first time I went—I had taken Mrs. Gregory over the flat three days after the prisoner left—she would dot be satisfied until I took her over it—the house has now all been done up and is occupied—I have traced where the rubbish was put, but I cannot find the bottle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was three or four days after I had my last inter<lb/>view with the prisoner that Mrs. Gregory came and would not be satisfied until she had seen over the house to see if there were any marks—she did not insist on going over the house, but she asked me if I would take her—I sent her away once—she came back three or four hours after<lb/>wards and said she would not be satisfied unless she looked over the place, I said, "Well, I do not mind if it is for your curiosity"—all Mrs. Gregory found was a little bottle labelled "Toothache tincture"—when she called I said there was nothing there except a dirty mess and rubbish, and the place was not fit for anybody to see—I did not try to choke her off going there, but I did not encourage her—both Mrs. Wells and Mrs. Gregory drew my attention to bottles—the bottle of prussic acid was pointed out to me after the toothache tincture—Mrs. Gregory took the toothache tincture and put it in her pocket—when Mrs. Gregory came to see me I knew she was the prisoner's mother-in-law and what he had said about her turned out to be true—Mrs. Gregory could not find anything in the place <hi rend="italic">barring</hi> a bottle of toothache tincture—I am up and down the avenue all day—I think the prisoner made the remark that nobody could get away except that I was about to see it—I did not notice whether Mrs. Devereux used the downstairs fiat, because I never went into the place and the blinds were drawn so that I could not see—nothing was said about their using the bottom flat, because I should have ob<lb/>jected—when I went into it afterwards I found rubbish there—it must have been the prisoner's rubbish, because the place was swept up before he went in—it must have been used by somebody during the tenancy, and I found several articles belonging to the Devereuxs there—there was some paper and a broom and other articles—the principal subject of conversation on February 7th was the prisoner's mother-in-law, and she seemed to be the person he seemed to have the greatest possible objection to—I know that other people speak in terms not complimentary about their mothers-in-law—when I spoke to the prisoner about his mother-in-law I was rather sympathetic and said, "They have no business to interfere with young married people; they ought to leave you alone; a mother ought to leave the daughter alone; they ought to know when they are comfortable and looked after"—the prisoner did not say anything against his wife—I understood the reason he was going away was to</p>

               <p>get away from his mother-in-law—he gave me the impression that he had already had more than he wanted of his mother-in-law—he did not say that she had lived with them for a considerable time; he said she always followed them from one situation to another—he said he shifted from one situation and she came after them again—he said, "She won't find me for some time now, because I have threatened to blow her brains out on the doorstep"—he did not say when he had said that to her—I have seen Stanley playing about—the prisoner seemed very fond of him—I have seen him with Stanley, but not with the wife and other children—he always seemed to treat him with great kindness—before taking the flat he said he wanted to speak to his wife about it and would come again and let me know.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When Mrs. Gregory called on me she made enquiries with regard to the prisoner, but I could not give her any information—on February 7th, when I was walking towards the Royal Oak with the prisoner and Stanley, the prisoner said the children cost him 10s. a week for milk—the bottom flat had never been occupied except for rubbish—the blind was drawn down, so that I could not see.</p>

               <p>left the yard and went into the house, and I heard Stanley call out, "Daddy, are you going to cook the dinner?"—I heard no answer—I remember seeing Stanley on one occasion playing in the street; he went to the front door of No. 60 and rattled at the letter-box as though wishing to get into the house—somebody came to the door and he called out, "I want to come in"—the reply was, "You cannot" or "You can't," I am not sure which—I never saw anything of Mrs. Devereux or the twins after I heard the noises of moving furniture—I heard the the twins crying in the house several times, but after the noises commenced I did not hear them crying—I cannot say when I last heard cries or when I last saw them or when I last knew that they were alive—on Tuesday, February 7th, I saw a van at the front door with the name of Banister on it—it was loaded up with boxes and driven away, the prisoner and Stanley driving away with it—the same evening another van was at the front of the house which was loaded with furniture, and again the prisoner and the little boy went away with it—about a week or ten days afterwards I received a visit from Mrs. Gregory—it was about February 14th or 17th—she came to make certain enquiries—a short time after that I was in No. 60 when Mr. Garfath was there, and I saw a bottle on the mantelpiece with a red label with "Prussic Acid" on it—I left the bottle where it was—I did not pick it up, but Garfath did and replaced it—it was on the mantelpiece when Garfath and I left and I never saw it again—it was on that occasion when I saw this piece of Wood there (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it was in the front room, the same one adjoining to where I heard noises coming from—on Saturday, January 28th, I was at home between 10 and 11 p.m.—we occupy the whole of the house—the front room downstairs was our sitting-room and the bedroom was upstairs and adjoined the prisoner's room—I cannot say if I had gone to bed on that Saturday between 10 and 11, I heard no sounds of quarrelling coming from the next house that night—I should have heard any loud sounds—I never heard any sounds of quarrelling while the prisoner was my neighbour.</p>

I accompanied the van to 92, Harrow Road, and after<lb/>wards we went to the Warwick public-house. Prisoner was with us. The van was then paid for and 5s. was presented to Willoughby.

We drove to the Flora public-house and had some drink and prisoner left us. We took the box to Mr. Banister's. A mark of a cross was put on the box in chalk in the yard. Two days afterwards, 9th February, I again saw prisoner. He spoke to me. He said, 'I want to know if I can see the box at any time, because I am going to sell it as soon as I can get a chemist to buy it.' I told him it was in the top warehouse. He gave me a shilling. The little boy was with him. H. Allingham."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The top flat was composed of a front room, two bed-rooms and a kitchen—all the family slept in the front room—there was a crib for Stanley, a swing cot for one of the babies, and a cradle for the other, and a bedstead for the prisoner and his wife—the room behind that was the living room, where they had their meals—the room behind that was Stanley's playroom—it had no furniture in it, only toys—they did not use it much—the cooking was done in the kitchen—the boxes were stored in the back room in the bottom flat, and the perambulator</p>

Dear Sir,—I note your advertisement in the "Chemist and Druggist," and beg to offer myself for the berth. I am thirty years of age, 5 feet 11 inches tall, and possess the minor qualifications. I am now disengaged and require £50 as salary I have been during the past five years with Mr. Taylor, of 479, Harrow Road, and was formerly with the late Mr. Marshall, of Sloane Square, and Streatham Hill, S.W. Any further particulars I shall be pleased to give you upon application. I have just left my last berth to make room for my employer's son. I am, Dear Sir, Yours truly, A.

I much regret not having been able to come yesterday, but as Mr. Taylor was called away suddenly owing to the serious illness of a relative I had to go back until Monday morning to oblige him. I sincerely hope and trust I shall get on well and remain with you as, indeed, I think I shall.

I am stationed at Westbourne Park—on April 13th, in the afternoon, with other officers I went to Banister's at Buller Road and saw this tin trunk bound with a leather strap and pad<lb/>locked—there was string through the loop of the lock and through the eyelet holes of the strap doubly sealed—I had heard statements that it was supposed to contain books and chemicals, but on shaking it there was no vibration, so I ordered it to be opened—from some keys which I had I found one which fitted the lock—on opening it I found a kind of inside wooden lid—the lock of the box was a cheap one; there is a rim round the box which acts as a ledge [<hi rend="italic">The witness then reconstructed the inside lid of the box as found by him</hi>]—some piece of wood are now missing, as I took them to Sir Thomas Stevenson—when I found it the wooden lid covered the whole of the top of the box, and hermeti<lb/>cally sealed it—it looked to me like another box formed of wood—it was air-tight and very completely done; in fact, the sixteenth of an inch thickness of glue which was over it bad hidden the joints, and formed an additional surface to the wood—the glue surface was against the aides of the box right round so as to conceal the contents—pieces of the wooden lid were screwed down to cross pieces with eighteen screws; the holes are there now—when I opened the box I could smell glue—I then unscrewed nine screws, and with a jemmy forced the others; there was no smell then—I saw a couple of table cloths and a quilt, which were glued together and covered over with a lot of glue—on gulling that away I put my hand down and felt a child's head—the quilt was tucked right into the sides of the box, and it had stuck there with the glue; there are some traces there now—directly I found the child's head I sent another officer to wire to Coventry and another to the Coroner—the bodies were not disturbed in the least, but were taken to the mortuary, where we had them photographed—that evening I went with Sergeant Cole to Coventry, and on the morning of the 14th I saw the prisoner at the police station at Coventry, and told him we were</p>

I had in my mind at the time a recent case, but the cement in that case was bound to give way, but I thought of a better plan"—he then asked who was going to hold the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> and we told him Professor Pepper and Dr. Robertson—I felt rather sick then and want to the other side of the carriage and left Cole to continue the con<lb/>versation—he was very cheerful in the train—I got a luncheon basket for him—he enjoyed himself—I gave him a cigar and he was laughing and chatting—he was taken to Harlesden Police Court, and before he was charged I said, "You have time to make your statement," and I provided him with ink and a pen, and he sat in the room and did it—I and Sergeant Cole were in the room—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Metropolitan Police, Harlesden Station, April 14th, 1905. I, Arthur Devereux, hereby declare that one evening towards the end of January or beginning of February last, after having been out for a few hours with my child Stanley, I returned to find my wife and twins lying dead in their beds, evidently, to my mind, Wing died from poison taken or administered. Rather than face an inquest I decided (with a recent trial fresh in my mind) to conceal, the bodies in a trunk which I had had in my possession for about two years. This I proceeded to do at once. I missed some poisons (chloroform and</p>

               <p>morphia) which I always kept in my writing desk after leaving my last situation, in the event of my wishing to end my own life rather than face starvation. The room smelled strongly of chloroform, so I concluded that my wife had administered it to herself and children, probably also the morphia. I had had a violent quarrel with her previously to going out; also many times quite recently and during the past twelve months. I make this statement quite voluntarily, without any threats having been made or promises held out to me. I wished to make it when first detained at Coventry, but was advised not to do so. Arthur Devereux. Witness, George Cole, P.S. 14th April, 1905."—I saw the prisoner write that; he wrote it slowly without any hesitation—I found no correction; he punctuated it as he went along—I took possession of it and he was shortly afterwards brought before the Justices, after having been charged with causing the death on or about February 1st—he made no answer to the charge—the justices were then sitting and I gave a portion of my evidence and a remand was ordered—on the 14th and 16th Mr. Pepper and Dr. Robertson held a <hi rend="italic">port mortem</hi> examination on the bodies—the prisoner was remanded from time to time—the first detailed hearing before the Magistrates was on May 12th—the Coroner held an inquest and an adjourned inquest, the prisoner being present on each occasion—I was also present—the second occasion was on May 17th, when Brazier gave evidence in the prisoner's hearing—that same day the prisoner said, "Brazier is a fool: there is no other woman at 60, Milton Avenue, only my wife and her mother, Mrs. Gregory. I can now recollect the day I went out with my son Stanley for a walk and returned and found her and the children dead. It was on Tuesday, the 31st of January last.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant X.</hi>) With Inspector Pollard I went to Banister's on April 13th and saw this box opened, and also the false wooden lid in<lb/>side, and the glue covering the quilt and the counterpane underneath—the rivets in the front of the box go right through the metal, and the inside points of the rivets are soldered round, which makes it airtight, and the same underneath the hasp—I also noticed one or two places where ap<lb/>parently something had been attempted to be soldered at the side of the box, and some solder has dropped on to the floor of the box—I went with Pollard to Coventry and received the prisoner from the Coventry police on April 14th, and then we all three got into a railway carriage to come up from Coventry by the 12 o'clock train—shortly after leaving Coventry the prisoner was told, as he had expressed a desire to make a statement, that he could then make it—he was cautioned that it would be taken down and might be used in evidence against him—he said, "There is plenty of time before we get to London; I want to think first, as I am not sure of dates"—shortly afterwards he said, "My conscience is per<lb/>fectly clear as to their deaths, but I was wrong in concealing the bodies"—he afterwards said to me, "Did you find any smell when you opened the lid?"—he was told "No"—he said, "You never would; the glue was treated with boric acid, which prevented fungi from growing, which would have allowed the smell to come through"—he then asked who would make the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I told him Dr. Robertson, the police surgeon, and pos<lb/>sibly Professor Pepper—he said, "He will have no difficulty in finding the cause of death; there is no doubt about that, but that does not say that I have administered it"—a little later on he said he would make his statement—he was again cautioned that it would be taken down, but the fountain pen gave out, and I began to write in pencil and ho said he would rather make it in ink—I had not taken anything down; I had simply begun to make the preface—he said, "I would rather have it made in ink, and I will wait until we get to London"—he was brought to Harlesden Police Court and supplied with pen, ink and paper, at his request, and before he was charged—he then made this statement (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he was brought into Court and remanded—amongst his property which we received at Coventry and brought to London was this basket, with some papers inside it, and some little books, a letter written by Mr. Tebboth, some certificates as to the prisoner's qualifications as a chemist, some pawn tickets, referring to articles pawned at Mr. Smith's, and a number of photographs, including the one of himself, and of his wife and child—I was present at the Court on April 20th before the Justices—the prisoner spoke to me before going into Court and, referring to the photographs, said, "There are some of myself, wife, and twins; they were taken one day on Hampstead Health. You will find them in an envelope; I shall want them for my defence"—I said I would look for them—I produced them before the Magistrates—the pri<lb/>soner said, "About that receipt of Willoughby's, I have fixed the date it happened; it was the night before the milk was left for the last time</p>

               <p>Stanley drank that; it was on a Tuesday, just a week before we moved"—on May 17th I was present at the adjourned inquest, which was the final one, when the prisoner said that his reason for wanting the photo<lb/>graphs was to show what a good family man he was, and he went on to say, "Brazier has made a mistake; there was no other woman there, and I think he is wrong in his dates. It was on a Tuesday, the week, before we moved."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was anxious to make a statement—I did not take—this statement down from his dictation; I made my note after I reached. Harlesden—he explained the action of the boracic acid; that it would, prevent the glue from perishing—he discussed it as a man who had some knowledge of it—from the time I first saw him at Harlesden till he was before the Justices at Harlesden he seemed to treat the matter rather lightly—he was cool and collected the whole time, and smoked a cigar in the train, but he seemed to realise his position when in the train—I do not say he was merry and chatty—he was talking nearly the whole way, sad in rather a light-hearted way, but I should hardly say with unconcern as to the consequences to himself—he stopped talking at times, and seemed to be in thought—I was present when he wrote his statement at Harlesden—he wrote it off fairly freely—it had no corrections, except one slight scratch—he showed no reluctance in discussing the whole question, but rather forced himself upon us—Pollard got rather sick of it, and went to the other side of the carriage.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am official analyst to the Home Office—from Baker on April 17th and 18th received twelve jars, separately labelled and sealed, the first four containing portions of the body of a woman, marked with t he name Ellen Beatrice Maud Devereux—four con<lb/>tained the duodenum, the liver, the lower bowel and the kidneys of the woman.—the other eight related, four in each case, to the organs of the two children—on April 18th I received some additional jars, containing some portions of the flesh taken from the three bodies, and also a packet containing glue,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190507240082"/>
               <p>two handkerchiefs, a table cloth, portions of a sheet, and a coloured duster—I examined the glue, and found that it had been treated with boric acid—boric acid, or boracic acid, is an antisepic, and would prevent the invasion of the glue by fungi that would arise from the decomposition of a corpse, or from the air—if the glue were poured over the wooden surface it would render the substance air-tight—the table cloth had glue and boric acid marks upon it—the handkerchief and the smaller things which I examined I attributed no importance to—the handkerchiefs were stained with bloodstains, and mucous and epithelia cells, apparently from the mouth—they might have been used for wiping the mouth either before or after death, and there was a small stain of blood upon the coloured glass cloth, or duster—I could not say what age that stain was, but I should say some weeks; it might be months—the organs of the woman's body were decomposed, but not so much but that I could see that there were no signs of disease upon them—I made an exhaustive analysis of the different organs, and found in the stomach, the abdomen, the liver and the kidneys, morphine, or morphia which is a vegetable poison; it is the game thing, the official name being morphia—in the stomach and abdomen there was 14 of a grain, in the kidneys 16 of a grain, and in the liver 82 of a grain, making a total of 112, or 1 1/8th of a grain-morphia is extracted from opium, and is almost insoluble in water—there are several common forms—it is combined with an acid and a salt, and those are the forms in which it is used in medicine, that is as an alkaloid—the ordinary use of the silt in medicine is for injection in 1 per cent solution, and it is given internally in 5 per cent.—it is used for injecting under the skin hypodermically—this form of morphia is not ordinarily found in a chemist's shop—it is used in chemists' shops for testing, but not for being sold—the morphine in the body had probably been used in a salt, but in what form it had been administered I cannot say—the alkaloid would remove the acid, and leave morphine in the body—the 1 1/8 grains which I obtained was morphia itself, which would form 1 1/2 grains of a salt of morphine—many chemists keep the alkaloid of morphia, but it is only used in the process of testing substances—it is not in our pharmacopoeia, and I believe it is never used, or extremely rarely given in medicine, but always in a salt, became it is soluble—the employment of it is almost invariably in salt of morphine—the alkaloid is kept by some chemists, and the salt in its different forms by all—stout would be a liquid in which the salt would be readily soluble, but of which the taste would be easily concealed from the person who took it—the slight bitterness of the morphine would be covered by the stout—morphine would spoil the flavour of milk, rendering it slightly bitter, and the same with water—in my experience I have known of several cases of a grain of salt of morphine being fatal to an adult—the 1 1/8th grain found in the three organs of the body, in my opinion, does not represent the whole amountll of poison taken—I estimate from my experience that there were four grains at least in the body-the effect of four grains probably would be that there would be a slight transitory excitement—a pleasant feeling, quickly followed by a tendency to sleep—the time at which sleepiness would appear would depend on the condition</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190507240083"/>
               <p>of the person, and the form in which it was taken—an empty stomach it would probably affect quickly; in five minutes the person would be gradually getting sleepy, and in twenty minutes, or at least half-an-hour, he would be aroused with difficulty. Respiration would fail; there would be profuse sweats, a ghastly appearance of the body, and death would occur, after four grains, in from three to six hours, it may be much less—the person would be asleep before twenty minutes, but the sleep of death would come on in about that time—if the patient were to be aroused, you could do it within half-an-hour, but not afterwards, and death might supervene in from three to six hours, or life might be prolonged for eight or ten—the, <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances usually show signs of asphyxia, congestion of the brain and lungs, and to the right tide of the heart and liver—I have heard the description given by Professor Pepper of the brain, heart, and lungs in this case; they are such as would be found in death after morphia—there were no indications in the organs which I examined of chloroform having been taken through the mouth—if it had been taken through the mouth the condition of the stomach would be different from that which I found—there was nothing to suggest or refute the fact that chloroform had been inhaled except that chloroform might show certain conditions which would be common to it and to morphia—I think it would be well nigh impossible for a person who bad herself taken such a dose of salt of morphine as I have described, to administer chloroform by inhalation to herself—certainly after the sleepiness had come on it would be impossible—if the chloroform had been administered by the dead person herself after taking morphine, that could not have caused death—if she had died quickly from the chloroform the morphine would not have been distributed in the quantity I found in the liver and other organs, it would have remained in great part in the stomach—the quantity" I found in the liver enables me to say that the morphia had been taken some time before death, because it would first of all have to be absorbed into the stomach and blood, and then passed to the liver, and be deposited there, and as I found about six times as much morphia in the liver as in the stomach, some time must have elapsed; it would not be the case of a few minutes—I cannot say how long, but I should not expect that condition within half an hour—when a person is about to be anaesthetised there is generally a resistance for the first few minutes. when you administer chloroform on a handkerchief or pad, for a few moments the patient will generally try to resist, and try to remove the cloth—chloroform is very volatile, and evaporates with great rapidity, and if its effects are to be of use it would require to be renewed from time to time in order that it should be kept effective, except occasionally, if the pad is placed over the mouth, and the person is asphyxiated at once; but for the purpose of keeping it up it must be renewed from time to time—I do not think it would be possible for a person who had taken such a dose of morphine as this to be able to renew this evaporating spirit except immediately after, and putting an excessive quantity, and being suffocated at once, but in that case the poison would not have been absorbed from the stomach in that time to that large extent—in this case there had been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190507240084"/>
               <p>a very great absorption into the liver, and if it had got into the circu<lb/>lation it must have produced its narcotic effects—I examined the viscera of both of the children, and satisfied myself that the same poison had got into their organs, but not in such a large quantity, but in sufficient quantity to destroy their lives in my opinion—it is my opinion also that the poison was the cause of the woman's death—I cannot say if the children would die sooner than the adult, but they would die from a very much smaller proportion, and even a smaller proportion relative to the body weight pound for pound, a smaller dose would kill—children are very susceptible to morphia—I think 1/8th to 1/10th of a grain might perhaps kill a child twenty-one months old—there would be no difficulty in getting a child to take a dose: put it in half a teaspoonful of water, put it at the back of the throat, and it is sure to go don.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was nothing inconsistent about the handker<lb/>chiefs and dusters with their having been used before death—the whole evidence which I have given with reference to the general effect of morphia applies equally whether self-administered or whether administered by another—it would take time, for morphia to reach the liver, but there was a larger proportion in the liver as compared with the portion in the stomach—the length of time for a dose of 4 grains of morphia to absorb would depend upon the state of the stomach as regards food—by what ever avenue it gets into the body when it gets into the skin some portion goes to the stomach and is excreted—if death took place within three hours, I should expect to find a considerable quantity distributed through the body—I do not think that if a small quantity of morphia was administered the distribution would be much slower—a large portion had been absorbed and still remained in the circulation, but the time would partly depend on the quantity originally adminstered—if you administered 4 grains as distinct from 1 grain, the condition of the stomach being the same, you would find a larger quantity in the circulation than if you administered 1 grain—I do not know that if there is more it is more rapidly circulated—there would have to be a larger absorption to produce death; I do not know about more rapid absorption—you must have a certain amount in the blood to produce a fatal effect—in this case there was five times as much in the liver as in the kidneys or stomach—if the quantity that had been administered had been less than it was, the propor<lb/>tion would probably have been different, a larger proportion in the circulation—if the total dose had been 1 grain instead of 4, I should have expected to find about a quarter of a grain in the liver—in my experience I find the proportion in the liver is about one third of the whole circulating in the body; that is in about an hour—where the dose which has been taken is known, that in the liver is multiplied by four and that in the stomatch added to it which gives you the whole amount, but after a long time the absorption decreases—I said I thought there were at least 4 grains, because I know if I take four times 82 you get practically 4 grains, I put that as a minimum—it may have been greater; I do not know how much had been excreted before death took place—if greater the operation of the poison would be surer, and probably it might have been a little quicker—my experience teaches me that if you add what is in the stomach and the</p>

               <p>bowel to what is in the liver that gives you the whole dose—I have never had an adult die from 80—a case of my own died within thirty-five minutes—I have edited a good many editions of "Taylor's Jurisprudence," where a case is mentioned where a patient died in about half-an-hour—I do not know if there was any evidence of any subcutaneous injection in this case, as I never saw the body—there is a form of opium poisoning in which a considerable time elapses before death, and then there is the form in which death takes place with frightful rapidity—in "Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence" a case is quoted where death took place within half-an-hour, but that is not my edition of the book; it was one of my own cues—it was a case of administration in my own hospital by mistake; the nurse went for the house physician and I was subsequently sent for, I think, and the times are not very accurate—it was not discovered until a few minutes elapsed, when the woman was dangerously ill—I do not think 4 grains is an exceptional dose, as people who die from morphia poisoning generally take far more than sufficient to produce death—I do not dispute the possibility of a person, such as this woman, dying in less than three hours after a dose of 4 grains—I do not think I can give you the minimum time which would be possible under those circumstances—I think it is possible that it might be two hours, but I do not think it likely—it would be possible for a person who had self-administered morphia to saturate a pillow with chloroform and then lie down, and he would be likely to become subject to the influence of the chloroform slightly in advance of the effect of the morphia, but probably the chloroform would go off by the time the morphia effected, then the morphia would come into play and the person would die from morphia, not from chloroform, but pouring chloroform on the pillow it would soon evaporate and I do not think unconsciousness would be produced—it would evaporate even more quickly on a pillow than on a small surface—the more porous the substance the more quickly it would evaporate—if a person wore a cap or a soft hat with a handkerchief inside it, overlapping the face, saturated with chloroform, it might produce for the time being unconsciousness, but it would be a very ineffective way of doing it; the part over the face would not be sufficient, and to get insensibility you would have to put more on—if your object was to produce unconsciousness, which would endure only until the morphia, which you had previously taken, had begun to operate, it might have some influence, but a person taking a large dose of morphia would be almost immediately in a pleasurable condition and they would go off to sleep—if a person was bent on suicide they might try the two things—people do sometimes resort to alternate methods, in case one fails—there was no evidence in the case of the children or of that of the mother of chloroform being administered at all—if the chloroform had been merely inhaled I should not expect to find traces of it after that space of time—there was nothing to show me whether the children had the poison administered to them earlier than the mother or not—my position on that point is purely neutral—there were no bottles of chloroform or morphia brought to me—morphia is used largely in connection with what are called soothing syrups and with powders for sending children to sleep—I have known cases in which</p>

Since I have been in London I have been living at 10, Elgin Avenue, Notting Hill—in 1891, I think it was, the deceased called upon me at Oakley Crescent, Camden Town—she had a little baby with her a few months old, Stanley—she asked me for her father and I said he was not at home—I asked her to come in—she came in—it was not at all a good day, so I know it was winter time; I have not at all a good memory for dates—we talked about babies first; I had my youngest boy there—she said she was in very great trouble about her mother—she said bad it not been for her mother she would not have been able to get through this baby, and all the trouble she had had since its birth—what she really came for, I gathered, was to try and get some money from her father for her mother—she said her mother was in great trouble—she wan very much depressed, and I was depressed too because I was in trouble abort that time—she said that her father had recently gone through the Bankruptcy Court and a terrible disclosure had been made about him living with a servant and having three children, and it had nearly killed her mother—she left her visiting card on the table—I had it for a long time afterwards—it said "Mrs. Arthur Devereux, Professor of the Pianoforte"—she said that nothing would make her do the same as I had done or a certain person, saying, "I would rather commit suicide and take my child away; I would never leave my child to the mercy of the world—she meant that she would rather commit suicide than commit adultery or immorality—that impressed itself on my mind terribly, because I had to give my little children up; I had one little boy then—she was very nice and quite charming, but she was morbid and depressed, and in great trouble, I thought.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This would be in the year 1899, because Stanley was quite a small child in arms—I have looked for the card everywhere; I thought it might be amongst some of my old luggage, but I have not been able to find it—we were talking of immorality in connection with her father and her servant—I was not actually living with her father then; I was living in the same house—I was a married woman at the time—I eventually left the roof and went and lived elsewhere with her father—she came to see her father, not me—she talked with me for about an hour—I did not think much about it until I heard of this case, and then it came back to me—since that time I have been three or four times confined in an</p>

               <p>asylum—I do not remember the last time; it might have been in May of this year—I do not scarcely remember when I came out—I remember being found wandering at Talbot Street, Strand, and taken to the Endell Street infirmary—I remember only too well being taken at Nottingham and having been certified as insane, remaining there for something like nine months, October 11th, 1902, to June 20th, 1903—I was in an asylum in York, and very likely remained there until February 6th of this year—again in May of this year I was found wandering and was confined in an asylum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I expect it would be after I had paid a visit to Mr. Pierron (<hi rend="italic">the solicitor for the Defence</hi>) I was in this further trouble; any upset or fright will make me lose my memory entirely, but it comes back again—I wrote to Mr. Pierron, telling him what I knew, and I called on him at his office.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 90, Livingstone Road, Battersea—on Wednesday last week I was at home and about to go out—I was standing with my wife just inside the front door, when a Mrs. Stannart came up the steps and struck me in the mouth—I had asked her to go away—she had previously threatened me that she would stick a knife into me as far as she could, if I put her away on a summons which was then pending—I caught hold of her, when she fell down in the struggle—I sent for the police—my wife shut the door—a crowd collected outside—after a while the door was burst in—I left the woman on the ground to go to the door, when she jumped up and ran away—I ran down the stairs at the back, then the prisoner ran after me and came up to me—he caught me round the neck and struck at mo three times as hard as he could on the left side of my head—he then ran away—on the previous Friday I was outside my house when the prisoner came up—there was a policeman there and several other people—the prisoner said "You and your lot <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done some<lb/>thing for that man; I shall pay you before I have done with you. I shall put you through it"—he referred to a man named hedges, who was sent to prison for assaulting my daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Stannart was not friendly with me—I did not raise my stick to her—while she was on the ground she screamed out "Murder," but there was no reason for it—I did not see what the prisoner struck me with, but it was something sharp.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness's wife—on Wednesday of last week about 7 o'clock I was with my husband at home—we were standing at the door waiting to go out—Mrs. Stannart came along and threatened my husband—she came up the steps and struck my husband in the face—he stepped back and she followed him—he drew back and shut the door and sent for a policeman—the door came open and we shut it again—it was burst open again and the prisoner came in—Mrs. Stannart disappeared down the stairs—the prisoner rushed by me and said, "Where is the f—man that is knocking the woman about? I'll give him something"—he fol<lb/>lowed my husband down the kitchen stairs and caught him at the door—I saw him holding my husband's head and arms and banging him in the face—he had got him round the neck, and with the other hand was punch<lb/>ing him—the prisoner then went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon for the Battersea district—I examined the prosecutor at the police station on this Wed<lb/>nesday—he bad two wounds over his left eye, one was a clean cut, incised wound about 3/4 inch long, cutting down to the bone and being deeper at the back than the front, showing that it had been inflicted from behind; the follicles or roots of the hair were cut through; there was an entire absence of bruising, all of which showed that the wound had been inflicted with some sharp instrument—the wound in front was similar in character—I also examined his hand and found the bone was broken through—I also examined his eye and found that he had an injury to the pupil of the left eye, the pupil being irregular in shape and refusing to act in response to light, the eye itself being bloodshot—in my opinion he had received a severe blow in his eye—I should suggest that the wounds were done with a small pocket-knife—there were also two scratches on his cheek—the injury to the eye is likely to be permanent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say he had received a blow in the eye with a knuckle or fist—I had not heard the blows described as being given with very considerable violence—they were glancing wounds, being deeper it the back than the front—they were given from behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that he lived right opposite the prosecutor's house; that he had never spoken to him in his life; that he did not know anybody in the street, having only been there eight or nine weeks; that he was looking out of his window when he saw a row going on and heard a screaming "Murder" and "Help"; that he went to the place and went inside as the crowd had burst the door open, when the prosecutor caught hold of his (the prisoner's) arm; that he (the prisoner) struggled to get away; that he had no knife and did not go there with the intention of injuring the prosecutor.</hi>
