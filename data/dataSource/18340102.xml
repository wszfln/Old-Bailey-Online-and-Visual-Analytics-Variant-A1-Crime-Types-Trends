               <p>JOHN FOOTMAN re-examined. The other three prisoners were searched at the station-house - I found 3d. in copper, and 6d. in silver on Joseph Pearce - I apprehended them between four and five o'clock on the Sunday afternoon - when I saw the prosecutor he was not drunk; he appeared as if he had been drinking, but quite capable of stating what had occurred.</p>

I was in the public-house with my brother - Scott and Farrell brought this man in to have half a pint of gin; and after that they had a pot of ale; and afterwards the man paid for a pint of beer himself; and after drinking that they were an hour together - Scott and Farrell went out of the house - my brother and I were in the house and heard a man say, "Pull your hand out of my pocket: I am robbed" - we went out, and Farrell had his hand in the man's pocket, and Scott had hold of him by the two arms - they both ran away - we went a different way - the man said he had been robbed - I walked gently up the passage, and asked Footman if he had seen my brother - I asked which way he was gone; and I went to find him - I touched nobody - I am perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>John Pearce's Defence. Scott and Farrell brought the prosecutor in to have some gin - he met us, and asked if we would go and take part of it - we drank it - we had some ale afterwards; and the man put down 1s. to pay for the gin - the landlord took the whole of it out of the man's shilling; and about an hour after drinking, the man was intoxicated; and Scott and Farrell took hold of his arms, and led him outside, and said, "Come along, old fellow;" and as soon as they got out, I heard the man say, "Take your hand out of my pocket" - when I got to the door I saw Scott holding his arms, and Farrell's hands were in his pocket - Scott ran away - I was frightened, and I ran away and passed the policeman.</p>

On Sunday, the 8th of December, I had occasion to leave my house about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon - I left nobody in the house - I left it all safe - the place where we live are rooms over a coach-house, and there is an internal communication between the coach-house and our rooms - I locked the room-doors - the coach-house door was fastened only by a bar inside, and the other door by a padlock outside - it was fastened when I went away - I returned at half-past nine o'clock in the evening, and found the door open - the stable door was open which I had gone out at and locked - the staple of the lock had been forced. I went up stairs, and missed a metal gilt watch, four plated decanter-stands, a ring, and two thimbles; a gold pin, two pepper-castor tops, two pair of gold ear-rings, a silk gown, a silk petticoat, a silk shawl, and a silk handkerchief - I then missed another metal gilt watch, two table-cloths, six damask napkins, the top of a small smelling-bottle, and I think I missed 3s. 7d., and there was a pair of plated snuffers - the things in the house appeared a good deal disturbed - I imagine the robbery was done by more than one person, from what I heard - I saw the prints of nailed shoes on one chair - it was only the shoes of one person - I don't know any of the prisoners now at the bar; I know Allum - he had lived in our service nearly four months- I received information from a person who is not here.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HORSFORD. I am a policeman. I went to search the house of Thomas Preston on Tuesday night, the 10th of December, at 34, Little North-street, Lisson-grove- the prisoner Jones lives there with him - I knew he lived there before; I went between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; Preston was not at home, Jones was at home; she was in the back parlour - I asked her where Tom was - she made no reply; I said, "Where is Preston?" - she made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020005"/>no reply - I asked her again; and she said, "I don't know what you mean" - I said, "I am come to search your place"- I searched, and between the bed and sacking I found twenty-seven skeleton keys - I also found a plated decanter-stand concealed between the bed and sacking - the landlord said to Jones, "I thought you were very poor, and you have silver in the room" - she said, "It is only plated" - I searched further, and found a gold ring in a card box, and a silver thimble also - there was a small file in it which is used to file keys; also, two packs of cards, and under the cards were three cards of "Mrs. Stopford Jones" - In a cupboard I found a chisel, and over the fire-place I found two pictures, which are not part of this charge - I found nothing on her person - I said she must go to the station-house - she began crying, and said she had not brought the things there - I then fetched a constable to take her to the station-house - I found fourteen duplicates at Preston's house - I went with Fursey to the Hercules public-house, Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove, and there found the prisoners Preston and Slough, sitting in company in the room - I took Preston, and the constable took Slough - I searched Preston, and found on him the duplicate of a handkerchief pawned at Trail's.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FURSEY. I apprehended Slough - I found 4s. in silver on him, 2 1/2d. in copper, a silver thimble, the tops of two pepper castors, and a smaller top of something.</p>
               <p>DAVID TRAIL. I am a pawnbroker - this duplicate was given at my shop to the prisoner Preston, who pawned a handkerchief for 1s. 3d. on the 10th of December, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon - I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>ANN HOWARD re-examined. I know these tops found on Slough - they are part of the property I lost on the Sunday evening - the handkerchief produced by the pawnbroker is ours - I have had it a long time - my name is not on it - I generally mark my handkerchiefs - I can't say whether this was marked when I lost it, but I can swear to it by its general appearance; the decanter stand is ours - I have had it about three years - I have had the handkerchief about two years - this silver thimble is mine - it is bent - I know it by a mark which is on it - I am sure of it - it is part of the property lost; the gold ring is mine - I have had it some time - it is set with stones - we lost two packs of cards - these are like mine, but I can't swear to them; I lost two silver thimbles - the one found in the card-box I know by a crack, and can swear to it; this watch was found at Trail's, and is one which I lost.</p>
               <p>DAVID TRAIL. The watch was pledged by a female on the 9th of December - it was not by Jones - I gave her a duplicate - she gave the name of Mary preston - It is not among the fourteen duplicates produced.</p>
               <p>Preston's Defence. My Lord; I saw Allum once before; I saw him on the Saturday as the robbery was done on the Sunday; that was the first time I saw him, and how I came to see him was, he was with Slough; we had a pot of beer together, and Allum was inquiring if either of us had an old pair of shoes to lend him - I said I had an old pair - he said he wanted to pawn his, for they were full of nails, and he had somewhere to go; I lent him a pair, and he went and pawned his nailed shoes for 3s.; he came back - we had two or three pots of beer, and I did not see him again till the Wednesday as I was taken into custody on the Tuesday night; on Sunday evening I was at Mr. Porter's - about half-past nine o'clock Allum came in and spoke to Slough and me; he said he had been up to where I lived, and left a bundle there, and he should fetch it on Monday morning; he did not say what it was, and I saw him give Slough something, I don't know what - we had a pot of beer together - I never saw him afterwards till I saw him at Marylebone office; when I went home Jones told me a young man had been there and asked for Slough, and left a bundle, but I never looked at it till Monday morning when he was to come for it; I looked at it then, and there was the false keys in a handkerchief, and decanter stand, a thimble and ring; they were in the decanter stand; I went out immediately down to the Hercules, where I thought perhaps he might come; and I went for him to take the things away - I had no idea they were stolen - I could not find him - I went everywhere to find him, but could not, and on the Tuesday I put the keys under the bed in the decanter stand, and put the ring and thimble in a box - as to the handkerchief, I was in want of the price of a pint of beer, and about half-past four o'clock on Tuesday I pawned it for 15d. and I had 1s. 4d. taken from me when I was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Slough's Defence. On Sunday evening Allum came to the Hercules - we had a pot of beer or two together - he gave me two tops of a pepper box and a thimble, and said if I would sell them he would pay me 5s., which he owed me, and I kept them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. Between eight and nine o'clock on Sunday evening, Allum knocked at my door, and asked if Slough was there - I told him no - he said, "Do you know where I shall find him?" - I said "No, I dare say you will find him at the Hercules, for Thomas is gone there;" he said, "Let me leave this bundle," I took it of him - he said,"I will come for it to-morrow morning, and if Thomas comes home, tell him I left it" - I never saw Allum in my life before.</p>
               <p>Nicholas Woodford, 48, Paddington-street; William Farmer, and Richard Cooper gave the prisoner Slough a good character.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HORSFORD re-examined - Dorset-mews is in the parish of St. Marylebone.</p>

The prisoner was in my father's employ, as footman, in November last - my father came to visit me about the 14th or 15th of November, I know he was there on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020006"/>17th - the prisoner was there with him during the whole time my father was there - he was in the house as footman - he brushed my clothes and cleaned my boots - sometimes he came to my bed-room for my clothes, and sometimes the maid-servant came for them - On Sunday, the 19th, Mr. Keily paid me a 20l. note and a 10l. Bank note - I put them into my pocket without looking at them, as he paid them to me in the road - I did not return home for an hour or two - I had no other notes in my pocket; when I went up stairs to dress for dinner, I looked at the notes, and observed it was a 20l. and a 10l. note - I put them into my trousers pocket - I wore the trousers until I went to bed, with the money in my pocket - this was on the 17th - I gave the notes to my sister that evening, and she returned them to me on the following Sunday, the 25th - I did not open the parcel, but they were in the same state as when I gave them to her, they were wrapped up very small - I put them in my waistcoat pocket, and when I went up to dress for dinner, I changed my waistcoat, and am not certain whether I took the notes out of the waistcoat pocket, and put them in another or not - I don't know whether I afterwards had them about my person, or had left them in the pocket - next morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, upon a clerk coming to the office, I missed the notes and made inquiry: on the Thursday following, I caused further inquiry to be made - I went to the Bank on the Monday week following, on receiving a notice from the Bank - I had stopped payment of the notes - I afterwards went down to Maidstone and saw Myers there, and after that went to my father's house, which is in the parish of Maidstone, at Pennington heath - I took a 10l. note and a letter to my father's house, which I had from the Bank - I could not recognise the note myself - I saw the prisoner at my father's in the butler's pantry - I asked him to step into the servants' hall, and there I charged him with having changed that 10l. note (which I produced) with Mr. Myers, and receiving ten sovereigns for it - Myers keeps a shop at Maidstone - I asked the prisoner where he got the note from - he said, "It is mine" - I repeated the question, telling him to be cautious what he said, and he repeated, "It is mine."</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE (for the Prisoner). Q. Did you make any sort of promise or inducement to him? A.Certainly not - I did not say I would forgive him, or that it would be better for him - I did not say he had better tell me all about it, nor anything of the kind - I did not say I would forgive him if he would tell me all about it, nor anything of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. WALESBY. Q. What did he say? A. He then said, "I found it in the hall of your house," alluding to Clapton - I then scolded him for having changed the note, saying, it was very curious for a servant to find a note in a house and not mention it, and I asked him what he had done with the money; he said he had spent part of and said he would make it up out of his wages - I told him the money was of very little consequence, it was more important to make out who had taken it - I then asked him if he found anything else; he said, nothing - I told him to be very cautious what he said, as he must be aware, from the trouble I had taken in coming down from London, I must be aware of more than he thought of - I told him he did not tell me the truth, for where he found the 10l. there he must have found the 20l., for they were both wrapped up together; there was some little hesitation, and I threatened that I would send for a constable if he did not tell the truth; unless he produced the 20l. or told the truth about it; he then said, he had found them, or the notes, or similar words to that - I asked him what he had found - he said a 20l. note - I asked him where it was - he said it was up stairs, and he would go and get it - I said, "No you won't, John, I will go with you;" I desired him to go first, and I would follow him - I got up to his bed-room within two or three minutes after this conversation - I went into his bed-room, it was about half-past seven o'clock at night; when I got into his room, the candle was out - I met him in the room - I brought a light with me, and I asked him if he had found it - he said, "No;" he was then searching the pockets of the clothes in his drawers, and, after some little time, he pulled out a small piece of paper from a pocket, and inside that paper was this 20l. note, which I produce - I could not at that time recognise it as the one I had lost - I told him he could not possibly be allowed to remain in my father's service, and he had better give notice to leave that day month - I told him I would not tell anybody about it that night - I subsequently had him apprehended; he did not continue in my father's service; he was had before my father the next morning, and Mr. Bean, the clerk at Maidstone; he was desired to go to the Mayor, to clear himself, and he went out of the house and ran away; this was on the Wednesday, 12th or 13th of December, it was the day after I went down - I went before the Mayor, and search was made after him - I saw him at Worship-street, on a Monday, in custody of a turnkey of Canterbury gaol. My father continued on his visit at my house with the prisoner till the Wednesday morning - I had lost them on Monday, but did not quite ascertain the loss till the Thursday.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. It was in consequence of your having said, unless he told the truth, and produced the note, you would have a constable, that he produced the 20l. note? A. Yes; I threatened to fetch a constable, and soon afterwards he produced the note; when he produced it I had no idea of having him taken into custody, not at the time; nor would I wish to prosecute him now if I could avoid it - I am an unwilling prosecutor; my object was to get rid of the business - I carried the notes rather carelessly about my person; it was not the business of all the servants to go up to my bed-room - I had an idea that I missed the notes on the Monday morning, but I fully ascertained the loss on Thursday, as I had an idea I might have paid them to a gentleman who was gone from town, and he returned on Thursday; it is possible I might have dropped them in the hall, but it is not very probable.</p>
               <p>MR. WALESBY. Q.You missed them on Monday morning? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MYERS. I am a pawnbroker living at Maidstone - on the 29th of November the prisoner came to my shop to change a £10 note (looking at one), this is my handwriting - it has "Goodwin, at Tyssen's Esq., Pennington heath," on it - I did not know the prisoner, but that was the name he gave me - I gave him ten sovereigns for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020007"/>note - my brother afterwards paid the note away - Mr. Tyssen, jun. brought it to the shop about a week afterwards and showed it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He gave you his correct address and name? A. I don't know whether that is his name or not.</p>

            , the drawer - he is treasurer to the Hackney Church of England Grammar School - I produced the cheque at Barclay's, and received three £20 and four £10 Bank of England notes - I saw Mr. Tyssen the following day, which was Sunday the 17th - he was just coming out of his house and I was going up to see him - I gave him a £20 and a £10 note which I had received at Barclay's - I have the other two £20 notes in my possession now (producing them), I have paid away the three £10 notes - on the 28th of November Mr. Tyssen sent his clerk to my house to know the numbers and dates of the notes - I had at that time two £20 and two £10 notes in my possession - I gave Mr. Tysson's clerk at that time a memorandum of the notes I had left; he is here to-day - I do not know the numbers and dates of the notes I paid to Mr. Tyssen, but I received them at Barclay's with the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any other notes in your possession? A.No.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARNES. I am a clerk at Messrs. Barclay's banking house, Lombard-street - on the 16th of November last I paid a cheque for £100, here is the entry in my book in my own handwriting, and made at the time - I find I paid a cheque of £100, drawn by Powell, as treasurer of the Hackney Church of England Grammar School, with three £20 and four £10 notes - the numbers are entered, but not the dates - the £20 notes are 15485, 5890, 19763 - when we pay cheques we only enter the numbers, but when the notes come into the house, we enter the dates, and I have ascertained the dates from that first entry - the £10 notes were Nos. 4761, 4762, 18407, 18406 (looking at the £20 note found in the prisoners pocket,) the number of this is 15484 - this £10 note is 18406 - I see on the back of the £10 note the figures 10 and 11 in the handwriting of one of our clerks - I know the handwriting - the other two £20 notes correspond.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TAYLOR. I am principal turnkey of Canterbury gaol - the prisoner was brought to me from Dover, I brought him to London - I took him to Worship-street, and delivered him to Garton.</p>
               <p>MR. TYSSEN re-examined. My house is in the parish of St. John, at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard nothing of the loss of the notes till the prosecutor came down to me - I changed the £10 note, and gave him up the £20 - he said if I picked them up he would forgive me, which I did - he said he should not name it to his father, but I had better give a month's warning and leave, as he should not like me to come to his house again, as he should always be uncomfortable if I was there - I had picked them up in the hall - he said nobody knew he had lost them but his sister - I told him I would make up the remainder - he said he would forgive me and not name it to his father if I gave notice to leave; but next morning he named it to his father, who spoke to the magistrate to detain me; and being a stranger and having no one to defend me, I went to Dover, where I had friends, and was taken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TAYLOR re-examined. He was delivered into my custody on Saturday night, December 14th.</p>
               <p>MR. TYSSEN. I have known him about four months while in my father's service; his brother was in my father's service before - my father had an excellent character with him from a lady at Dover - he had been with some person two years and a half; whether it was that lady or a gentlman at Ramsgate I don't know.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.After you missed the money, and made inquiry about it, do you know whether the prisoner knew the inquiry was made? A. He could not know of it - I merely mentioned it to my father's clerk - it is possible he might have heard that I lost them, after the Thursday, as I caused bills to be posted about the parish - the hand-bills were posted on the Tuesday week after the loss; and I advertised it in the Times and Herald.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MYERS. He paid me the £10 note on the Friday.</p>

I heard a cry of "stop thief," on the evening of the 21st of December, between six and seven o'clock - I saw the prisoner running towards me, Mrs. Sarbourg was pursuing him - I stopped him - I took hold of both his hands - he requested me to release one - I did not, but took him into the public house, and asked what he had got - he said, "I have two saltcellars" - I took them from him - these are them - they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>MRS. SARBOURG. I know these, they are chipped - I have had them near upon two years - I have sancers which they fit in at home - I never found the decanters - somebody must have got out before him - the decatnters were in the front room - I had seen them on the Friday evening about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. SARBOURG. When I let the gentleman out, the front parlour-door was shut - I did not try whether it was locked, but I am certain it was shut. I know these salts.</p>
               <p>MRS. SARBOURG. I felt the drift coming in at the street-door, about three minutes before I went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg most respectfully to acquaint you, that on the night named in the indictment, business called me to Gloucester-place, Regent's-park; as I went up May's-buildings, I met three men running in an opposite direction - they knocked me down, and, on getting up, I met a policeman, who took me to a public-house, to search me. I told him I had only a pair of glass salts, which I had bought about fifteen days ago; I had bought them to present to a person to whom I was engaged in marriage. I was never in custody before. The prosecutrix may easily be deceived by others of a like description.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL THOMPSON. I am a policeman - I was going my rounds, near Mr. Harvey's house, on the night in question, and observed the area-gate, which leads to the tap-room window open from the wall, and the tap-room window drawn down half-way - I went my rounds, came back to the house, and stood by a door leading to a court - I heard a noise inside, and footsteps of somebody come towards the side door, as if to listen, then return and go back to behind where he made a noise; the footsteps came back again, and I heard the bolt drawn gently from the door; the noise went back again, and then went up to the parlour; and I heard a loud noise within - then the footsteps came towards the door, as if he was walking on the top of his feet; a constable came to my assistance - I placed him at the door, and I went to the front door and gave the alarm; and after some time, a female answered me from the first floor window - I told her to make haste and open the door - I heard that the thieves were escaping at the back of the house, and, in a few minutes, the prisoner was taken - I heard a cry of policeman, and found him in custody of Parish; Mr. Harvey came down dressed - I am sure it was the prisoner that was found that night - I have known him a long time; another constable took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know if he saw any marks of violence on the shutters? Witness. I saw marks of violence on the window and the sash, as if it was fresh broken - I went on the lead flat afterwards, and found the spoon and sugar-tongs.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I heard the rattle spring - I immediately ran to the place, and took the prisoner into custody inside the house - he was inside the door, outside the bar - I found no property on him - I took him into custody, and he immediately dropped down, as if very drunk; but I believe he was sober: he walked as steady to the station-house as I did; and as we went along he put his hand into his pocket, and dropped some money out of his pocket - after putting him into the station-house, I brought a light, and picked up two half-pence, and two farthings, on that place.</p>
               <p>MR. HARVEY. I know the spoon - there is no particular mark on the tongs; but they are like mine - he did not use any violence to me - I think it very likely the fall down stairs might have made him sober - I think when I first laid hold of him he was intoxicated - I have seen him intoxicated before - I believe he has no command over himself at those times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."On the day stated in the indictment I had been drinking freely all the afternoon - I went into the Duke of Clarence public-house late in the evening, for the purpose of going to the water-closet, where, overcome with liquor, I unfortunately fell asleep, and remained in that situation until I heard a noise, which awoke me - I endeavoured, after I found myself in this situation, to get out and make my escape over the leads - the landlord found me making the attempt, and challenged me - I went towards him - we went down stairs, and he gave me into custody of the police, from whence I was taken into the station-house - after searching me, nothing was found upon me; nor do I know anything of the articles found by the policeman - I entirely throw myself on your merciful consideration and humanity - I am innocent of the crime, and was unfortunately found on the premises through the circumstance I have stated - I leave my case for the mercy of the court, and place myself entirely in their hands."</p>
               <p>CHARLES FREDERICK FIELD. I took the prisoner on the 2d of February last, for stealing a quantity of sharouts, value 5s. - he was tried here - I produce a certificate of his conviction - (read) - the prisoner is the same person.</p>

               <p>The deposition being read, stated the evidence of Abraham, as detailed above, and stated that the prisoner in reply said, "I admit it to be true."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Abraham has sworn I told him I took the money from Mr. Fisher for the purpose of going to a gambling house, which I deny; I never told him any such thing - I must leave my case to the merciful consideration of the Judge and jury.</p>

I went about an hour afterwards to see how the work went on, and missed him - I did not see him till seven o'clock in the evening, when he was coming out of the public-house door on Saffron Hill; he was drunk - I asked him for the keys to shut up the house; he said, "Here they are, go about your business;" he was then talking to a man with a cab at the door; I went to the house and shut it up; I went into a room in the house, and found the attic window taken off and thrown down on the floor - it was very easy to get from there to Davis's house; I could see by the footsteps somebody had been on the tiles; I went to the prisoner afterwards, and asked him what business he had to take out that window, because he had broken the hinge, - he said, "Why to dry the room to be sure;" there was no occasion to take it out, and he was not to work in that room.</p>

               <p>JAMES Mc CARTHY. I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live at No. 2, West-street, Spitalfields. On Friday the 20th, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in a beer-shop, on Saffron-hill - Powell came and asked if I would go and pawn a couple of handkerchiefs for him, and he would give me a trifle; he gave them to me - I asked where he got them from - he said, "What has that to do with you, so as I pay you?" so I went with them to Gray's-inn-lane, and pawned one at one place for 2s. - the other at another place for 2s. 6d. - I gave the money to the prisoner - he went with me and gave me something for doing it - I pawned four more for him the same day, three in St. Giles's - I can't say how many handkerchiefs he had - I went with him on the Friday night, about seven o'clock, to Monmouth-street, to a Jew, and sold twenty for a sovereign - he did not tell me where he got them - he said nothing about them that I heard - I was examined before the magistrate - oh yes, I remember, he told me he got them of Mr. Davis, and he said, "You have no occasion to say nothing" -"No," said I, "I won't:" and all the while I was in prison with him, he said, "If I said anything, he would say all he could to get me into a scrape myself - he said he got out at the window where he was at work, and got into Davis's and took them - he said, when he was before the magistrate, when we were both locked up, that he would endeavour to get me into the scrape.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH KING. I am a widow, and live in Newcourt, Saffron-hill.

            . I am a policeman of the G division. I apprehended the prisoner, and took him to the station-house, on Saturday the 21st., Davis was with me- I did not hear him say anything to Davis; at the station-house he said he was innocent of the crime, but as we went along, he said, If Davis would give him till to-morrow at eight o'clock, he would give him information where the property was - We had told him what we took him for - I was present at the prisoner's examination before the magistrate.</p>

             re-examined. I was present at the examination, and I know Mr. Laing's handwriting; this is Mr. Laing's hand-writing - I did not see him write it, it was read over to the prisoner - I heard what he said - he was called on to say what he had to say to the charge - I don't think he was told he need not say anything unless he chose - the clerk read over to him what was taken down in my presence, and the prisoner said, Mc Carthy was as much in it as he was - I heard him say this myself - he said, he had nothing further to say, except that Mc Carthy was as guilty as he was, I am sure he said so - I don't recollect his saying anything more - the magistrate asked him if he understood what was read over to him - he said, Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am quite innocent of the robber; Davis can give me a seventeen years character.</p>
               <p>DAVID DAVIS. He has been working about different premises of mine for about sixteen years in the neighbourhood - I never heard anything dishonest of him - I buy the handkerchiefs in lots, at about 32s. a dozen - we sell them at 36s. a dozen - they might not all have been taken at one time (looking at one of the two handkerchiefs) - there was two dozen of this sort, which is a misprinted handkerchief, and sold as a misprint - I saw this among five hundred, and I said this is one of the six dozen - the other one is mine -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020012"/>there are eight handkerchiefs altogether - the pawnbrokers gave them up at the magistrate's, sooner than have any bother about them - they are all mine.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Have you had the whole of your property back again? A. I have had only about nine, the others have been disposed of, and the tickets thrown away; and he has sold one man twenty, and another sixteen, among people that I shall never get them back again.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody on the 21st of December, at seven o'clock in the evening - I am a patrol of Farringdon-ward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence (written)."My Lord and Gentlemen, in answer to the charge laid against me by the prosecutor, for wilfully and feloniously taking from his premises goods to the amount of 25l., I have briefly to state that, on Saturday, the 19th day of December, between the hours of seven and eight o'clock, I was on my direct road to Walworth, where I had employment in view, I met a gentleman, whom I supposed to be a merchant in Bolt-court, who asked if I would go and bring a parcel with him from his office - that he would give me a shilling for my trouble; I accordingly followed the gentleman up Bolt-court till I arrived at the prosecutor's house, which the supposed merchant had described to be his office. On approaching the house I was desired by my employer to step inside and bring a parcel, which was at the bottom of the stairs, and meet him at the end of the street. Accordingly I innocently obeyed the order, and found the parcel as described by the gentlemen, at the bottom of the stairs; I was proceeding with the said parcel on my shoulder in the public street, leisurely walking towards my employer, when I was suddenly stopped by a man who accused me of stealing the said parcel, there being a gentleman with or near him who then and there identified the parcel as his property, immediately charging me with this robbery, and gave me in custody of patrol. I momentary informed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020013"/>the prosecutor by whom I was hired, where I was going, where the gentleman was waiting for the parcel who hired me; I also begged and entreated of the prosecutor to accompany the few steps with the patrole to apprehend the guilty party who hired me, and was then waiting at the bottom of the aforesaid court; whereas he, the prosecutor, unfeelingly and unjustly refused, allowing an officer going with me to apprehend the very man who laid the plot of robbery for his own advantage, and wilfully exposing the innocent to the severity of the law. It is therefore, my Lord and Gentlemen, under this important consideration that I humbly beg you may be satisfied of my entire ignorance of violating the laws, or having a wilful intent to defraud the prosecutor of the said property.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner said he was carrying them to a man at the bottom of Bolt-court, but I met him in Gough-square going quite in a contrary direction - he was about thirty yards from the door when I met him - he then said he was going to take them to a gentleman named Spiven, who was waiting for them, and a few minutes after he said he did not know who he was, and afterwards that it was a gentleman named Spinks in Fleet-street - the door is usually on the latch - there is an inner door that can be opened - the work is sold at 14s. a copy to the public - the difference between that and the published price is not 50 per cent. - they are worth more than 5l. - 25 per cent. is the difference between the two prices - the copies are perfect - the printer looked them over, and found fifty perfect copies - I did not see him count them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure the titles are there? A. Yes: they are here - they were packed up as complete, having come from the printer's - there is written on the paper "50 Woodlands."</p>

            . I am an officer - I took charge of the prisoner at Mr. Blackmore's - I observed the state of his clothes - they had what I considered to be leather-dust on them - they were soiled as a person would be who had carried leather; at the Compter I took his hat off in consequence of what Pallet said, and showed Pallet his hat, which was all over mud - he said, "That confirms my opinion, for his hat fell off;" he was asked if it was his own hat, and he said it was - it was quite wet, as if it had fallen in the road - it was a very muddy evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Where did you ask me to own my hat when you had me in custody? - A. In the first place, I asked if it was your own in Mr. Blackmore's warehouse, and in the Compter again; and you acknowledged it was your hat; and you had it all over mud - I know nothing about your hat falling off; but after what I heard from Pallet, I took it off in the Compter, and held it to Pallet in the Compter - I saw the dust of the skins on your clothes in Mr. Blackmore's warehouse - I told you it was what I called leather-dust; but I understand it was the bark of the leather.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.State what passed at the Compter? - A.When we got into the Compter, I took the prisoner's hat off, while the officer was untying his hands - without saying a word to any individual, I took it to the window, and examined it, and said, "Oh, that satisfies me;" which was all that passed - it was not very much soiled - it was all over mud - the prisoner made no observation about it that I recollect - no question was put to him about the hat in my hearing - I had not called the officer's attention to the state of the hat before I got to the Compter - it occurred to my own mind when I got to the Compter - I walked with the officer to the Compter - I walked behind him; not side by side - I did not remark on the hat till I got to the Compter.</p>

            . I had occasion to remove some property last November - I employed the prisoner to take five trunks, containing clothes and linen, from No. 238, Oxford-street, to my solicitor, Mr. Gibbs, No. 42, Jermyn-street - I don't remember on what day it was - I went to Mr. Gibbs' in the evening, but they had not been taken there - when I saw the prisoner he said they were taken to Mr. Gibbs - he then said they were at Mr. Fisher's, in Park-lane - he then said they were in Fleet-street, in the City, and somebody had laid an attachment upon them - I did not go to any of these places, because he afterwards told me that they were at Oxford-street, that the weather had been so bad he could not take them away - when I took him into custody he said, "For God's sake don't do anything against me: I am a married man, and I am willing to give them up" - that they were in King-street, somewhere by Grosvenor-street - the officer found them there and took them away - I took the prisoner into custody - I got him through Piccadilly, and by Hyde Park he leaped over the bars, and ran away as hard as he could - I cried, "Stop thief," and a countryman stopped him - the prisoner said, "It is all a joke," but another man stopped him, and the officer took him - I have received the property, one of the trunks is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known this man? A. I had known him before on the Continent for a short time - I had only met him two days before this in London - I had not been intimate with him - I employed him to remove my goods, as I had no servant but a man who minded my horse, and a girl - I had lent the prisoner 4l. or 5l. before - I am not in his debt, upon my oath - I gave the landlord a written notice to quit, and I sent 13l. odd shillings by the prisoner to pay the rent, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020016"/>he paid - I did not go with him to pay the rent, because the prisoner frightened me from one place to another, and got me arrested for a debt, because he instigated a person against me - he did not arrest me; Mr. Clarke, a tailor, arrested me for a bill of my own, which was not due- I don't recollect the amount of the bill - I accepted it about four months ago, it was for 32l., it had about two months longer to run - I state that the prisoner instigated a man to arrest me, because through him they only could know my residence - I kept my lodging private on account of the bill, which was not due - I owe other debts in London - I was keeping out of the way of my creditors, because the prisoner frightened me; he said, "For God's sake leave your lodging, there are sheriff's officer's after you," and that was the only reason because he drove me away, and it was only to get my luggage into his hands - I have no ill will towards the prisoner, nor no anger against him - I was angry when he got my clothes, but I have got them back, and I don't care - I am angry that he went to my creditors; no one knew where I lived but the people at my lodging and the prisoner - I had been at Dover and round Kent since May, but I came to London about July - I had only been in one lodging and the hotel - I had only kept my lodging secret for two days - I can't tell how many persons the prisoner went to - I have two or three creditors - I don't know how many creditors I have - the prisoner said I should have my trunks again, but he had a claim on them, and when I paid him what was due, 17s. 6d., I should have them; but he was in my debt 4l. or 5l. - he had had money of me; and the day he took my trunks I gave him money - I had not given bills for all my debts - I gave the prisoner a sovereign when I was in a cab in the Park - I have been to law respecting my wife's property; she is an English lady - the prisoner met me and my lady in Park-street; he told me the luggage was gone to Mr. Gibbs, and, if I looked sharp, I should catch it; but the luggage was not there - I can't say what situation the prisoner was in; he borrowed money at different times of me in London, about four days before he removed the goods; I can't recollect exactly the time - I gave him 4l. or 5l. - I presume if he borrowed money he was not in a very glorious state - he was nothing when he was on the Continent - I don't know how he got his living; he was not a companion of mine; he did not pass as a gentleman, quite different - I gave him a dinner, in London, at my table and my lady's; he was at first respectable on the Continent, but not so afterwards; and when I met him in London he said he was in difficulty, and had not much money; I said,"If you want a dinner, you may come to me," so he came; he dined with me once or twice - I took the prisoner when I was in a cab in Park-street - I took him into the cab - I said, "Come in, don't make any row" - I said, "For God's sake come in;" and when he got in he wanted to get out, and I took him by the arm in the cab; my lady was sitting there; when he was before the magistrate he made a claim on me of 17s. 6d.; he did not claim 5l. 18s. 6d. - I had never been in England before this - he did not tell me if I had anything against him to give him in charge.</p>

               <p>MR. DOANE. Q.When you took him into the cab it was to prevent his escaping? A. Yes: he did not say a syllable about this claim of 17s. 6d. before he was in custody, and he had before that given me the different accounts of where the things were - I did not owe him this 17s. 6d., on the contrary, he owed me money - Mr. Clark's bill was not due, and had not been presented - I paid it when it was presented, and 10l. more - it was by the prisoner's representation that I kept away from my lodging.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you swear that to the best of your belief nobody but the prisoner and your wife knew where you were? A. Yes: the prisoner said it was not safe that I should stop longer in my lodging - I had not employed the prisoner in any other transaction in London - he borrowed 5l. of me - I had not had any intimacy with him abroad.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You have most grossly perjured yourself: was it not agreed between you and I that the goods should be removed to Grosvenor-square in my name? Witness. No: Mr. Cobbett did not know my lodging - I gave you £4 or £5 at different times out of charity to you and your wife - you were not on the Continent on my father's business - you did not always dine with him - you were not detained in town on my business, seeking a lodging for me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square - prisoner was brought to the office - I found the property at No. 2, King-street, Park-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not tell you where they were? A. Yes: he was locked up for re-examination - I went to him and asked him where they were, and he told me without hesitation.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS called</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMS. I am landlord of the house No. 238, Oxford-street, where the Count lodged - I have an order in the Count's handwriting for the delivery of the goods.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not state to you that they were only going to Park-street? A. No: I did not know where they were going - the address of the witness is to this order - I delivered the goods to you, and you paid the rent - you slept there one night, but I believe that was after the Count was gone - Mr. Cobbett had a bed-room there which the Count paid for - I think the Count meant that Mr. Cobbett did not know where he lodged during the two days he was away from my house - when he lodged at my house he was known, and tradesmen were coming to him continually.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the Count attempt to conceal himself? A.No: I received a large sum of money from him, and I knew he had sufficient property.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Was the prisoner in the habit of dining there? A. He came backwards and forwards several times, and might have taken dinner with them.</p>
               <p>COURT to the Prosecutor. Q.You say, nobody knew where you were; did you allude to those two days? A. Yes; I was at the Elephant and Castle; when I was in Oxford-street, every one knew where I was.</p>

            . I went with the prisoner to witness the delivery of the goods from Mr. William, they were taken to my father's at No. 2, King-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.What did I say to you? A.He said the things did not belong to him, but to a Count, who owed him a little money, and he felt himself justified in detaining the things until such time as the money was paid.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What are you? A. A servant; I have been out of place about nine months.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his defence stated, that he had been put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020017"/>to considerable expense in travelling and hiring lodgings in London, while he was engaged in going to different solicitors and tradesmen on the prosecutor's business, which had left a balance in his favour of 5l. 18s. 6d.; and that he had detained the property till he had an opportunity of seeing his solicitor, as he had lost money by the prosecutor's father, and he knew that if he had given up this property he should not have received a farthing; in the mean time the magistrate, (before whom he had voluntarily surrendered,) decided against him - he had stated without hesitation where the goods were, and there they were found; and if he had done wrong in detaining them, it was from an error in judgment, but with no criminal intention - he had told Mr. Ford that he only wanted the room for a day or two, and he had told the carman the goods were to go the next day to Jermyn-street; and that the prosecutor had told him to keep them till the next morning, and take them away by day-light, as it rained so fast he could not take them that day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; I told you whether it rained or not to take away my luggage, that I might not begin a fresh week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I live on a small annuity, derived from my wife, about sixty guineas a year - I went to the Continent purposely on business for the Count's father, and was with him three months at Antwerp.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My father is at Paris, the prisoner could not live with him, that I will swear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What was the value of the property in your trunks? A.About £300 - the prisoner knew what was in them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. The prisoner was the cab-driver? A. Yes. I did not know the other two men - I knew the prisoner by his coming there of a night; it was the other man took the coat and went out, and the prisoner followed him - I had seen persons wink before - I have often heard persons say, when they were going, "I am off."</p>
               <p>Q.You say the prisoner turned his back to you, now be very careful, did he wink before he turned his back? A. Yes. I never said that he first turned his back - I did not tell the magistrate that he first turned his back and then winked - I have no doubt that the prisoner got into the cab.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner hear you charge the man with taking the coat, and call "Stop thief?" - A. Yes; they made no answer, but drove off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How far had the cab got before you stopped it? A. I suppose one hundred yards; it had not stopped till I stopped it - I can't tell whether there had been time for any one to jump out - I suppose the cab had not been half a minute in running the hundred yards; it drove at a pretty good pace - I saw no other man in the road - I heard the witness state that the other man got into the cab, but I saw no man - the policeman was at the head of the horse, but we were so close together that I can hardly tell who stopped the cab - the prisoner did not pull up; there was a cry of "Stop thief."</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear that the prisoner did not himself pull up? A. I was at the back of the cab; I could not see his hands - I will not swear that he did not pull up.</p>

             (police-constable G 114). I was on duty in Castle-street - I heard the cry of "Stop thief," about a quarter past eleven o'clock - I came in front of the cab, which I saw coming down - the moment I arrived at the horse's head, the prisoner, who drove it, pulled up; and before I knew what the charge was, he said, "I have not got the coat; search the cab;" Mr. Ashman and Engley came up; they had pursued the cab from the house - in consequence of me and my brother-officer coming up, I rather think the prisoner pulled up in a measure, but not sufficient to stop the horse - there was no man in it but the prisoner; it had got seventy or eighty yards, or more, from the house; the night was dark, and another man might have got out in the dark part of the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose if two men got into the cab at the public-house, and only one was in it when you stopped it, it is a direct inference that the other man must have jumped out? A. He was seen to jump out, but not by me - I searched the cab, but the coat was not in it; the prisoner stated the truth when he said he had not got it - I believe the prisoner pulled up, for the horse slackened his pace.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.What age are you? - A.Sixty-eight - my sight is not very good - I only saw the person when he asked me for No. 2, and when he came back and took my bundle - I know he had a fustian dress on, as he crossed two or three yards from me; and it was pretty light there - I had never seen him before.</p>

            . I was standing at a coal-shed in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020020"/>Sugar-loaf-court - I heard the old lady cry, "Stop thief" - I looked down the court, and saw a man come up the court with a bundle - I would not swear to the prisoner; but as he passed me the colour of his dress seemed the same as what the prisoner has on now - when I heard the cry of"Stop thief," I cried, "Stop thief," and the man dropped the bundle, which I took up - he turned down Swan-street - the prisoner was brought back in a few minutes - he seemed to me to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was there any light near you? - Yes, from the coal-shed, and from the gas-lamp - I had but a moment to observe the prisoner in, and would not swear he is the man - the court I was in is the next to Mr. Bailey's.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL TAYLOR (police-constable H 83). I was on duty at the end of Swan-street, and saw the prisoner running from that court, and some persons after him - I stopped him - he said, "Let me go, he has run up the street;" I took him back to Sugar-loaf-court, and asked what was the matter - they said a woman had been robbed of a bundle - and Godfrey said the prisoner was the man - he said, "You cannot swear to me;" she said, "I can, by your dress;" he had a fustian coatee on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were there not a great many people running? A. There might be a dozen, but chiefly women and lads: there might be one or two men - the prisoner was the first who was running - I had been about a minute at the corner, no person could have run past for the space of two minutes without my seeing them; the prisoner said he was not the man; the prosecutrix said she would not give charge of him if I would give her her property; I did not press her to give charge, nor did I threaten to take her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Well-street - there was a cry of "Stop thief," and the officer took me - the woman said, "As I have got my bundle, let him go;" but the officer said, "If you don't give charge of him, I will take you."</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TREWIN. I was at work in my brother's shop, and while he was bargaining for the truck, Penfold said,"Say 25s., and a drop of gin, that is little enough."</p>

             TAYLOR (police-constable S 82). I was on duty, and took Hunniburn - he said the truck belonged to him, but he had rubbed the name out because he was going to sell it - I said I thought it would have looked better with the name on - he said he supposed he could do as he liked with his own property - I found on him a pepperbox and saltcellar.</p>
               <p>Hunniburn. Q. Where did you take me to? A. To the station-house - you took hold of the truck, and said you would take it to the station-house, and I said very well - you could not have got away.</p>
               <p>Q.Had I not been to you before, and told you the man would not give me the truck, and ask you to go with me to get it? A. No: I had not seen you.</p>
               <p>ALGRRNON SMITH. I took Penfold - he said that Hunniburn had hired him to move some goods, and had taken him with the truck to King's Cross; and then Hunniburn said he would rub the b-y name out, that he took it to the broker, and there was some dispute, and he went off.</p>
               <p>Hunniburn's Defence. I went to move some goods - we left the truck at the broker's, and he would not let me have it again - I got the officer to get it away; and then he said that I should go to the station-house - there was no name on the truck at all - the prosecutor said, before the magistrate, that he had not seen the truck the whole day before - I did not intend to defraud him, nor was it offered for sale; if it had, it would not have been left there for two hours, as it was - the reason this broker appears is because some parties stole some lead and a copper, and it was sold to him, and I have often threatened him with it.</p>

               <p>JOHN COPPICK. I was with the prosecutor - I can corroborate what he has said - I knew nothing of the transaction till he said he had lost his watch - he dropped his umbrella, and pursued, and took the prisoner - the prisoner denied having the watch till the officer came up, and then he gave it to the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am a policeman - on the 4th of December I had occasion to apprehend Colefax, and on his person I found a duplicate - I had heard of this robbery, and took the prosecutrix to the pawnbrokers, who identified the linen that was pawned to be her property - it was at Mr. Till's, St. Alban's-place, Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HALL re-examined. That duplicate refers to the linen I produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.What is the duplicate for? A. A piece of linen pawned for 3s. - it was not written by myself, but by a lad who is in our shop - he is not here, but I took the linen in myself, and can swear it is the ticket I saw him make, and I pinned it on the linen.</p>
               <p>EDWARD JAMES LEVY (policeman). I had information that Abel was wanted, and apprehended him in Black-lion-lane - I told him I wanted him for felony - he said, "Very well," and walked a few yards with me; then said, "I have been had a few hours ago by a policeman, and am now going home, being discharged" - I found his statement false.</p>
               <p>MRS. STORTON. This is our linen.</p>
               <p>Abel's Defence. The pawnbroker told the magistrate he did not take the linen in, but his fellow-servant did; and he could not swear to the person.</p>
               <p>MARY WILLETT. I am married - my husband is a bricklayer, and lives at Kensington - I know the prisoner Colefax - I was present some weeks ago when he bought some cloth - it was fine linen cloth, very good - about a fortnight after he bought it, he took it out to pledge - I did not see him pledge it, I saw him take it out of the house - he was going to pawn it to get some money to go to market with- he bore a very good character indeed - he lives in Pell-street with his parents - he has lived there fourteen years- I never heard anything against him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What is he? A. He goes to Portman-market, and Covent Garden - he goes about the street, selling fruit - he does not keep a donkey - he sells fruit, or fish, in a basket - I know he bought the cloth at the door of a hawker - it was a remnant - he paid 7s. for it - there was about five yards - I don't know whether that is the linen - I should not like to swear to it - this is the colour of the linen - it was bleached, and was white.</p>

               <p>John Orchard, of Grafton-court, Marylebone, and Mary Topping, of Kensington, gave the prisoner, Colefax, a good character.</p>
               <p>Abel. I was taken to Marylebone Office on the night of the robbery, and was discharged that very night, and afterwards taken again.</p>

The things all together were above the value of 5l. certainly; there were two £5 notes in the purse, besides other things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q.Are you a military man or a naval officer? A. A military man, belonging to the East India Company's service - I am married - Mrs. Grindlay was at this time indisposed, and I slept in a spare bed-room - nobody slept in it besides myself - there are two bed-rooms adjoining my room - I have three female servants - the female servant came from the room immediately adjoining.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a door besides the outer door between your room and your servant's room? A. No; as far as I can describe to you, there is only one door to each room, and they are close together, so that persons cannot come out of both doors together without coming in contact with each other - there is only one door to each room - they open close together - the female servant came out of the door immediately next to mine - her name is

            , or something like it - I have a female-servant named Kellet- she sleeps in the same room with Sherold and the housekeeper, three of them together - Kellet was in my service at the time the prisoner was - I am not aware that the prisoner was courting Kellet - I know nothing of it one way or the other - my room was not fastened - I don't think even the latch had caught - any servant in the house had access to my room at any time, by day or night.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you mean by asking the prisoner if any persons were concerned? A.Because I wished to know if there were others, that we might look sharp after them - I rather addressed the question generally to the prisoner, and to the police I said, "Are there any more? let us look round" - I did not expect to get any answer from the prisoner - I certainly did not allude to any persons in my own house - I did not suspect any of my establishment - When the prisoner left me, he requested I would give him a good character - I discharged him with great reluctance, because I found he had acquired a habit of drinking, which all my endeavours to prevent were fruitless - I found him so excellent a servant in other respects, I wished not to part with him - I gave him three or four warnings, and he promised to give up that habit; but he did not, and I discharged him- I don't think he has been in service since - I have given him a character two or three times, but I believe he has not been in service.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you given him a good character? A. Whatever questions a person puts to me, I answer sincerely, in the presence of the servant, that he may not fancy I have said anything against him without foundation - about three months ago he requested me to give him a character - I said yes, but I insisted on the prisoner remaining in the room at the time - which might be thought extraordinary, but I was determined to abide by it.</p>
               <p>RICHMOND MOORE. I am a policeman - about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning of the 1st of January, I was walking down North-bank, Regent's-park, on duty - my attention was attracted by a noise which I heard on Captain 
               <persName id="t18340102-53-person473">Grindlay</persName>
            's premises; and, while I hesitated whether I should go and see what was the matter, the prisoner made his appearance out of the front gate without his shoes, attempting to make his escape; on which I ran in front of him, and asked him who he was - he told me he was Captain 
               <persName id="t18340102-53-person474">Grindlay</persName>
            's servant; on which he said, "I dare say you know me well enough" - I told him, I had no right to know any man coming out of a gentleman's house at that hour in the morning - upon putting his hand into his pocket, he said "Here, take this - it is Christmas time; the Captain won't let me go out in the day, and I am going out for a lark" - I told him unless he would go back with me to Captain Grindlay, and be recognised as being his servant, and he sanctioned his going out at that hour in the morning, I should take him as a prisoner - he then said, putting his hand out again, "Here is plenty to make it all right; and you are a d-d fool if you don't take it" - with that attempting to speak to me, he, at the same time, gave me a blow on my head, he put his foot out and threw me over on the ground, on my right shoulder - by the time I got up he was ten or fifteen yards in front of me, making his escape - I saw him throwing something from his pocket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020026"/>as I supposed, a pocket-handkerchief - he dropped five successively, and told me to stop and pick them up - upon which I got very near to him, and told him I should not be bought with silk handkerchiefs, and that I would not be bribed by any man, for I was determined to do my duty; and told him if he did not surrender I would strike him on the head - he did not seem willing to surrender, and I struck him three blows on the arm with my staff; but, being injured a little by the fall, the blows made no impression on him; on which he closed in on me and we both fell to the ground - I held him as long as I could; but in a short time he made his escape a second time; and by the time I got up he might be twenty yards distant, but still in sight - on which I hallooed, "Stop thief;" and my brother constable,

            's, and as I went back I picked up the five handkerchiefs in the same place where I saw him throw them - he was searched at the station-house, and a gold watch, a guard-chain, a seal, a purse with two £5 bank notes and the two sovereigns and a half, a snuff-box, a ring (which Captain 
               <persName id="t18340102-53-person477">Grindlay</persName>

               <p>CAPTAIN GRINDLAY re-examined. I have the ring on my finger - it is mine - this is my watch - these are two £5 notes, which I believe to be the same I received at Coutts' the same morning, but I have not the numbers; but they were in my own purse - this pencil-case belongs to a memorandum-book which was returned to me before the magistrate - these are my handkerchiefs - the two sovereigns and a half were in the purse with the notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not break into the house, nor steal the articles named in the indictment - the articles were given to me by a person in the house - I had been out with a person living in the house for two or three hours in the evening, and I went outside at eleven o'clock, and when part of the servants were gone to bed, I returned, and one person came down and let me in, a person who I believe my counsel has named to Captain

I believe it is fruitless to say any thing more, but that I leave it to your Lordship and Gentlemen of the Jury. Several gentlemen I have lived with, had I time to have let them know, could have given me a character, but the time has been so short nobody but the servants know I am here - I was only committed on the 1st of January.</p>

On the Sunday before the 14th of December I was left alone in the house, and went out about a quarter before seven at night- I left nobody in the house - I made the house fast - I did not look at the windows, but for what I knew they were fast - I shut the back door, and latched it, but did not bolt it - I shut and double-locked the front door, and put the key into my pocket - I was absent about a quarter of an hour - I then returned, and on getting to the front door, and putting the key in the lock to open it, the door flew open all in a moment - it opens inside, and two men came out - the prisoner, Davis, was one of them - I ran after him, and caught him before he got out of my sight - he never was out of my sight from the time he left the door- I threw him down - a policeman came up, and he was immediately apprehended - when I was going in at the door the first man struck at me with something in his hand, and Davis hit me in the face; and when I overtook him he struck me two or three times over the head - he was taken to my brother's house and searched, and two coats, two decanters, a shirt, a handkerchief, a timepiece, found on him, and a skeleton key - I did not try it to the front door; after searching him, I went up stairs to my brother's room, and found all his drawers open, and the things taken out - I observed no marks of violence on them, but two screws were forced from the lock of the bureau, and there were marks of violence on that - I went into the front room two pair: all the drawers were open there, and the things scattered about the room - a box, which had been under the bed, was drawn out, and the things taken out - the prisoner was taken to the station-house - Ferne took the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. I think you said you don't know what parish the house is in? A. It is in Shoreditch - I don't know the name - the front part of the house is a broker's shop; nothing more - I was left in charge of the house - I went out for a quarter of an hour - I merely walked into the City-road, and thought it might be safe - I went out at the front door - I went out into the yard to the horse and fed it, and shut the back door, but did not bolt it - that was directly before I went out at the front door - I did not take any pains to secure the back door - I shut it - I did not turn back to look whether it was fastened - I can't swear it was fastened - it always latched when I put it too - I did not bolt it - I swear I shut it - I don't know whether I turned back to see if the door had latched or not - I cannot swear the back door was latched - I took and slammed it to, and cannot swear whether I did or did not turn round to see if it was latched - I went out directly after at the front door - I was not in a particular hurry - I was only going out to take a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020027"/>walk - I double-locked the front door, and took the key with me - I swear it was double-locked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came back you put the key into the front door - had you unlocked it before it opened? A. No, I had not.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I assisted the last witness in apprehending the prisoner Davis - I searched him at Mr. Dawson's house, and produce the articles I found on him - here are two coats, which were both on his back over his own - he had three coats on - two decanters, which I found in his own coat pocket; one dial in his coat pocket; one skeleton key in his waistcoat pocket; and where he fell down, two or three yards from where he was struggling with Dawson, I picked up a crow-bar - I examined the front door of the premises, and perceived marks of a crow-bar - it had been forced open by a crow-bar - the box of the lock was forced off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q.How far from him did you find this iron instrument? A.Three or four yards - I tried it to the marks - they corresponded exactly with it - it is impossible the marks could be produced by carrying in furniture or things.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live at No. 17, Old-street-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. These two coats are my property, and were safe when I went out on Sunday morning, and this timepiece I saw that morning - I had not noticed the other articles - they are my property - besides these articles I missed eight silver spoons, five tea and one caddy spoon, and two salt spoons - four necklaces, two of coral, and one of hair, and one of beads - seven gold rings - a silver watch - silver sugar-tongs, and various other trinkets, the value altogether would be about 12l. - I did not see 
               <persName id="t18340102-54-person488">Davis</persName>
             that night- on the Monday morning I met Ballinger in New North-street, about eleven o'clock - he said he heard that I had had a loss - I said "Yes, I have" - he said, "How much do you think you have lost?" I said, "No great deal;" and I said, "I have just been saying to my boy (who was with me) that I was sorry such a thing should have happened, and if I could get my trinkets again, I should be very sorry to have any trouble about it" - he said, "I suppose you don't wish to prosecute" - I said, "I did not know anything about that, that the things taken were found on Davis, and I certainly must swear to my property" - he said, if I could get it put off at Worship-street till tomorrow, he thought we should have more time to talk about it, and I could receive my property - I said, "Certainly, I should like to have my trinkets again" - I had been to Worship-street, and was returning home - he asked how long I should be before I went to Worship-street again - he said, "I am only an agent in this business - I am employed by the father of the young man" - he mentioned the young man's name, but I don't know what it was - Davis was in custody - whether he meant the father of Davis, or the other, I can't say - he said he would go to the young man's father, and he asked if I was going home- I immediately said "Yes" - he said he would return to my house and see me in a short time, in an hour or so - I went home, and he came in about half an hour, and asked me how he was to bring the trinkets to me, and where - I said he could send them by some person, if he thought proper, and lay them in my shop - he said he would bring them himself, and give them to me - he asked if I could not go to some house and receive them - I don't know the sign - I said, "No; if I receive them, I will receive them at home" - he said he would go and fetch them - he immediately went away, and I went immediately to the station-house and asked what I was to do - I immediately returned and stopped in the shop some little time, and Ballinger came past, and thinking he had the trinkets I walked up the road, he appearing rather frightened to bring them in - he asked me again how he should get the trinkets to my house - I said he might send somebody with them - he went away and said again that he would bring them himself- I never saw him any more, till I saw him at the corner of Finsbury-square, where I went in consequence of a message, and there I saw Mr. Ballinger and his wife - I said to him, "Have you got the trinkets?" - he said, "Yes; my mistress has got them," meaning his wife - he immediately said to her, "Give the man his trinkets" - she took them from under her cloak and gave them to me, and the constable came and took him into custody, by an arrangement made beforehand with me - I immediately gave the trinkets to the officer - they were part of the articles which I lost on the Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you have known Ballinger some years? A. I knew him by sight - he has been a broker several years - I did not know where he lived at this time - he told me he was a mere agent, acting on the part of the father of the young man- after he had delivered the trinkets to me, I went to the Star public-house, as I delayed the time till I could see the officer - after receiving the trinkets, I went to a public-house with him - I don't know the sign - I had some drink with him, and I paid for it - we then went to the Star, and I said, as I had treated him he must treat me - I saw a policeman coming up, and gave him into custody - I have got all my property except a trifle.</p>
               <p>Ballinger's Defence. I did enter into conversation with Mr. Dawson, but I was actuated by feelings of humanity and not gain, having known Mr. Dawson for some years - he knows I am a broker - I met him at sales - I saw him the first thing in the morning, and did not mention anything to him then, because I had not a knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAWSON re-examined. I saw Ballinger on the Monday morning before I met him in NewNorth-road - he said nothing about it then, but hung about the door.</p>
               <p>Davis's Defence (written)."I beg leave to say that this is the first time in my life I was ever charged with any offence against the laws of my country, which can be proved by several respectable persons in the court, that up to this time my character would have borne the strictest scrutiny as to honesty. Another circumstance I must state, in jus<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020028"/>tice to the prisoner Ballinger: I can assure you that he was an utter stranger to me, until I saw him in custody in the prison of Clerkenwell. I now throw my case, and my future destiny into the hands of a merciful Judge and an enlightened Jury, who will be as lenient as the circumstances of the case will allow, for the sake of my wife and infants."</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did the old man direct Ballinger to do anything? A.He asked Ballinger to go and interfere with the prosecutor, as his son was in trouble - I think Dawson's name was mentioned.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did Ballinger agree to go and see him? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it at all unusual for a woman to be involuntarily delivered; I mean delivered when they have not even known the fact themselves? A.I cannot think that they could not know the fact.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose her to have these pains of labour with a first child; would not those pains to an uninformed person be like a disposition to discharge foeces? A.Undoubtedly so - I am informed there is no water-closet in the Mews.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It is a common thing, I believe, for persons to go to a place for a certain purpose, and be delivered? A. It is not at all uncommon - I believe she is about eighteen years old - she was in a very weak state.</p>

             re-examined. I took the prisoner into custody at No. 20, Portland-street, in bed - I searched his clothes and found three duplicates, and a key which opened his chest-of-drawers in the room; and in these drawers I found three books, a pair of scissors, and some strips of blue cloth, and some pieces of patterns besides - I found a waistcoat in a bag - he said nothing to me.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the house the prisoner lodged at, in Portman-street, Soho - on the morning of the 28th of November, he came home a little after five o'clock - he brought a large bundle home with him - I gave the policeman a bag and a waistcoat - the bag had been left by the prisoner in a neighbouring public-house, and brought to me by the man from the public-house.</p>

               <p>GEORGE FARMER. These are the three tickets from our shop, one of them I gave myself to the person, the other two are in the handwriting of persons in our establishment, and are for goods pawned there.</p>
               <p>MR. RANDALL. The great coat is mine - the two pair of trousers pawned on the 28th of November are mine, and the coat pawned on the 29th, and the three books; and the pair of scissors belong to one of my men, and were taken from the house that night - I lost such blue cloth as this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. With humble submission to your lordship, and, gentlemen of the jury, I appear before you, feeling very much the embarrassment I necessarily labour under, in addressing a court constituted as this is - it does in a great measure hold in their hands the destiny of a fellow-creature; but I trust you will not consider any inaccurate observations of mine as a contempt of court, but that you will over-rule the objection, attributing it not to want of courtesy, but to the extreme feeling which actuates me at the present moment. I am charged with a crime, which in itself is the worst of all crimes, as it is in some measure a breach of confidence, the prosecutor being my late master; and I know full well the laws of my country will support themselves and sustain the dignity of man. I know well I have committed an offence as far as the indictment goes, but I know the prosecutor knows the exact position in which I stand; I hope he will do justice to my character, as he knows the extreme circumstances under which I laboured before this; and I am sure he will be guided by proper feelings, in doing me justice, if I call on him to speak to my character. And now, gentlemen of the jury, you have all heard fairly, and your superior judgment will weigh every subject you think proper. I am not going to deny the existence of the crime; I leave it entirely in the exercise of your judgment. It may be said to be superfluous in addressing the court, as every word I say tends to convict me - admitting that, I know well there is such a thing as poor Misfortune feeling the lash of Vice. Some of the jury are fathers, and will feel for me - a poor orphan as I am, and have been all my life suffering extreme hardships. Many is the time I have been without a roof to cover me, and taking shelter under the piazza of Covent Garden; and during the inclemency of last winter I suffered almost unheard-of sufferings. I have no father nor mother, nor friend, to whom I could apply; and with the precarious state of trade, by my extreme difficulties, I have had recourse to the piazzas, and two or three nights together I have been without a roof to cover my head, and three and even four days have gone without food; and I am sure the prosecutor knows it is the first time I was ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020030"/>charged with an offence; and up to that moment, for which I am charged, I bore an irreproachable and unsullied character; I hope you will be inclined to weigh the circumstances in a manner to do honour to your characters. I feel it a great privilege I have in addressing a jury composed as this is. You, gentlemen, are called on to decide my future interests, and I depend on your verdict; am I to be cut off from all the lovely and sociable relations of life? and I tell you, if there are but a few, still there are a few whom I value and esteem. That I have broken the

             do not for a moment deny, nor should I have pleaded"Not Guilty;" it is not to avoid the ends of justice: no; if I have come within the pale of justice, let me suffer as a man; still I call on you to the exercise of this peculiar property which has stood the test of ages, and which is the palladium of public liberty. The eyes of not only the individuals in court, but all the world are looking at me, as I well know - and as you know - and as my worthy prosecutor knows - that up to this very moment I bore an unsullied character - and I regret I did this in an evil hour - and I don't call on the jury to pronounce a verdict of "Not Guilty;" I admit my guilt - in an evil hour I certainly did it! goaded on by poverty, I was in want of food, and when I applied to my friends, I reasoned with them, but they were callous - they were deaf to Reason's voice: I argued with them as points of humanity, and sent them letters. I had not offended them: they could not bring any thing against my moral character; but they would not listen to the voice of humanity. What was left for me? Day succeeded day, and night - night. It is true, through the humanity of Mr. Stewart, I had a roof to cover my head; but still there was a time that before his heart melted with pity at my condition, I have been without a home: and where is the man in the court who does not feel for me? I don't come here as a hardened culprit - I never offended the law before; I feel the sanctity of those laws, and my prosecutor knows I was actuated with a most religious feeling for the laws; if he will condescend to leave that monster- Prejudice, out of the case; and I trust, that having broken my country's laws, and forfeited the protection it would otherwise place on me in the condition the prosecutor stands. The law protects him, and, I hope, also protects me. My lords, I am sure, feel for me; they have children of their own, and they must pity me: during the inclemency of last winter I had no food - I had nothing to quench my thirst but the cool spring water, which my Lord- my Creator, gives me in the construction of the earth; and I leave myself entirely in the exercise of your humanity - you are called on to-day to decide my future interest. And let me speak to you, gentlemen, as between man and man; there is a great chasm between you and me - I may appear to have broken the laws, under whose banner I have long cut; they protected me, and I appeal to you. I have no voice but myself - my wrongs speak - my heart speaks: I don't wish to avoid the ends of justice, but I hope you will, in the exercise of your judgment, remember mercy. Many individuals, I am sure, would be pleased to do me a service, but they are all religious people, and though I speak of it with respect for religion, they are so prejudiced against my crime they will not speak. I have received a most cutting letter from a very respectable one, who will not assist me; they said, because I have broken the laws of my country, they would have nothing to do with me.</p>
               <p>MR. RANDALL (re-examined). The prisoner was formerly an apprentice of mine, and left me about four years ago - up to the time he left me I have nothing to allege to his charge - he did not conduct himself very regularly with me - I had a very hard task with him for six years, and at the end of that time he ran away, and I gave up his indenture when he was brought back.</p>

            . I am a headborough of St. Luke's, Old-street, and live at 129, White Cross-street - on Wednesday evening, the 11th of December, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoner pass my shop-window, in company with two other boys - I suspected them, and followed them to Play House-yard, and passed them about the middle of the yard - when I came up to them, I heard the prisoner say to the other boys, "Look out, while I go in" - he went into the shop, and took something from under his coat and offered to sell it; but the party shook their head and would not buy it - I saw him come out, and stopped him, and asked him what he had got there offering for sale - he said, a pair of shoes which his mother had sent him to sell - I asked him to let me look at them, and saw they were a new pair; I told him I thought he was telling me a falsity, for his mother would not send him to sell new shoes - he asked me if I would be so good as to go to his parents with him, and they would soon satisfy me that they had sent him to sell them - his father lived in Golden-lane - he was not at home, nor his mother - he sent out for his father, who came - I asked if he had sent his son to sell that pair of shoes - the father said no; they never sent him to sell them - the prisoner said, "No; mother sent me to sell them: father, if you will send for her, she will tell you she sent me" - the mother came in at the time, and denied it, the same as the father - she said she knew nothing about them - I did not see that the others had anything with them.</p>

             - some things were taken out of my box that night - a coat, waistcoat, trousers, braces, and handkerchief - there is a back-door to the house, leading into the yard - the front door opens into the street.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE ISHERWOOD. I live exactly opposite Sinfield's house - on the Tuesday evening about six o'clock I was sitting by the fire and heard a knock at Sinfield's door three separate times - I then went to the window of my room up stairs, I had no candle - I saw three young men standing in the street - it is a very narrow street - there was a good light - the moon was shining in the opposite side where they were, and there was a light from the shop below, and a gas light at a small distance. I did not know any of the men - I saw them at the door - I now know them, but I did not know them before - two of the prisoners I know, I can't swear to the third - I can speak to Codey and Hardwick, but not to Lewis - when I first looked I saw them looking to the opposite side - two of them went towards the Curtain-road, and one towards Paul-street - they came back in about five minutes - the two came back, and the other was there directly after - when they came back they stood looking at the opposite side for a minute, and then they were on the step of the door - Codey then turned round, and the door opened - they opened the door - it was fast before I know, because they knocked at it - the moment it opened, Codey took a light from his pocket, and the others followed him into the house - Hardwick went first, and the other one went after him - they shut the door- I stood at the window, and saw them all three come up stairs with a light - the stairs are opposite the window - I saw them come right up into Sinfield's front room, next the street, on the first floor - they walked across the room with a light - I immediately went down stairs and gave an alarm to Mr. Dodge and to Cox the policeman - they went across directly - I just went into Sinfield's house afterwards and looked into the parlour - I was so very agitated at the time I saw Hardwick sitting in a chair; and I mentioned him as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020032"/>Codey - I was much agitated, and I thought it was him, but I was mistaken in that - I said it was Codey, but I was mistaken; it was Hardwick - I had never seen either of them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This rather agitated you? A. Yes: certainly - I did not mistake one man for another at the office.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DODGE. I live in Luke-street, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch - Isherwood gave me an alarm- I, and Cox the officer, ran over - I could see a light in the front room - I knocked at the door three times, as hard as I could, and I then saw the light was put out - I gave an alarm of thieves - my brother and others came over, and I saw Hardwick come out of the front door of the house - I stopped him in the doorway and held him - Cox laid hold of him also - we held him a short time - we took him into the house, and he was taken to the station-house without being out of custody - he was searched by Cox - I did not notice what he found - I found, just within the street door of Sinfield's house, a watch, all but the outside case - I found it as soon as he was taken to be searched - it was lying at the entrance - I afterwards went up-stairs, and saw Mrs. Howlet take up a crow-bar, just within the front room door, where I had seen the light - I took it down into the parlour and asked Hardwick if he knew anything of it - he made no answer - I gave it to Cox - my back was towards the door - I did not see anybody else rush out at the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN COX. I am a policeman - I was present with Dodge, and seized Hardwick, and kept him in custody - he was coming out into the street from the front door of Sinfield's house - I have tried the crow-bar to the box upstairs which was broken open - it fits exactly - I am fully persuaded it was used to break it open - I found a key, a knife, and handkerchief, on Hardwick - it is a skeleton key, and will open the front door - he was kept in custody.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BAKER. I am a policeman - I was called on to assist, on the 17th of December - I was at the back part of Sinfield's house, and saw two or three men at the back door - they appeared trying to make their escape - I was on the wall - they saw me, and rushed back into the house again - I followed them; and followed two of them out into the street, and took one, that was Codey - I did not lose sight of him at all - he ran about five or six hundred yards - I took him to the station-house - he was searched, and eleven skeleton keys, a snuff-box, and three halfpence, found on him - I gave up the snuff-box and three halfpence to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Did you search him at the station-house? A. Yes - I felt the keys in his pocket before, but did not take them out.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN DODGE. I was alarmed, and went with the last witness to the back of the house - I returned back through No. 4, and followed Lewis - I was a distance off, and when I got to the front door, he was a few yards from the door, running down Luke-street - I followed him, and hallooed, "Stop thief" - I lost sight of him - I came up afterwards, and found him in the custody of another man - I cannot positively swear to Lewis being the man I followed - he seemed a little agitated, as if he had been running - I took him back, and let him go, as the people round said I was not an officer, and had no business to detain him - I am sure it was

            . I pawned the things in St. Martin's-lane - the prisoner was my master; and his wife sent me to pawn them - he was not at home at the time - I took them at different times - he was never at home when I took them - I pawned them in Mrs. Roy's name.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS JAUNAY re-examined. The handkerchief does not belong to me - this linen belongs to me; the two napkins, table-cloths, and cannon belong to me - these spoons are mine - here is a mark on one of them - I had no conversation with the prisoner about them - I have not seen him since; he was in custody before they were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I do not see a mark on the spoon? A. One mark was put on one by my servant - it had been scratched by the bar-maid - I know the linen perfectly well: there is no mark on it - I do not find any marks - here is one napkin with my name on it; and here are two others with marks - they are marked F. J. - when I first discovered this I had the wife apprehended, as she had the duplicates in her possession.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STONE re-examined. I found the duplicates in a chest of drawers in the kitchen - the prisoner was in custody at the time - Hobbs was with me - it was on the 19th of December.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS. I am a policeman - Stone and I went to the prisoner's room together, and asked Mrs. Roy to let us look at the duplicates which we had seen the day before - she said they were in the drawer, all safe - I said nothing to the prisoner about them.</p>

               <p>John Rogers, boot-maker, of No. 18, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-square, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

About half-past eight or ten minutes to nine, I was going to call on Sorrell, and met him in Milton-street - I told him I was going to his house - he said, "Come along, I am going there" - I went with him; and had been there ten minutes when the policeman came up and took us into custody - is it not possible, at the moment I came to the cart to speak to Sorrell, that the soap might be taken out without my knowledge? - you must consider the evidence circumstantial - I leave myself to your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020034"/>decision, being certain your verdict will be the result of mature consideration.</p>
               <p>Sorrell and Shaw made no defence.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITTLE (policeman G 200). I produce a certificate of Bayley's former conviction - I was present, in September, 1832, when he was tried here - he is the person described in the certificate - I can't exactly recollect which court he was tried in; but he is the man.

I did not know what had happened, till I got out of the crowd and heard the cry of"Stop thief."</p>
               <p>JAMES HALL. I am shopman to Robert Plant, of Aldgate, a hosier. I was in Aldgate, and saw Eagles surrounded by four men, and saw the prisoner pull his watch from his fob - he handed it to a man in front of him - I seized the two men in front - the prisoner was one - it was then handed to the one behind, and they got away from me - I had sufficient opportunity of observing the prisoner to be certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.About what time was it? A.About five o'clock - it happened opposite our shop-door, where I stood - I could see plainly - I did not take another man, and say he was the man who took it- I am quite sure of it - I had seen the prisoner before this - I told the magistrate so, I am quite sure - I don't know whether that was taken down - my deposition was read to me - I don't recollect whether that was taken down- I cannot tell when I had seen him before that - I see so many of them - I have seen him in the neighbourhood - I cannot tell where - the officer took him, but not in my presence - he was taken in Black-horse-yard, as the officer told me, that is not twenty yards from the spot - I did not say it was one hundred and twenty - I said under twenty - I was never a witness before.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PATRICK. I am a constable. I was in Aldgate, and saw Mr. Hall holding the prisoner - when I first observed him, the prisoner wrested himself from him and ran away - I followed and took him into custody in Blackhorse-yard, not twenty yards from the spot - I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALL re-examined. I took hold of the prisoner when he was pulling the watch from the prosecutor - he was one of the two in front who I laid hold of, and he got away from me.</p>
               <p>EDWARD EAGLES. This is my watch - a young man picked it up.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MAULKIN. I picked up the watch, and produced it to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BANNISTER, of No. 5, Longdale-street, Cannon-street-road, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PATRICK. I have frequently seen the prisoner in company with five or six others, whom I know by sight.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.How far were you from me when I took it? A. The width of Bishopsgate-street - it was about a quarter after four in the afternoon, quite daylight - you were dressed in a brown frock coat and a red comforter - I took you myself - a young man stopped you, and I took you into custody - I never lost sight of you - I was watching you in Bishopsgate-street - I took you at the entrance of Camomile-street - you were stopped, and I took you - the young man who stopped you came to the station-house.</p>

                        targets="t18340102-63-off351 t18340102-63-crimeloc353"/> - on the night of the 17th of December I was in the street, near my house, and saw the prisoner enter my shop, and take the weighing machine off the potato-bin - he came out as far as the gutter - I went towards him - he saw me, and put it down, and ran across to the churchyard - I called "Stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020035"/>thief;" and he was brought back by the policeman - there was a light in the shop, and I saw this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. At what hour in the evening? A. After dark, and before eight o'clock - it was not a very light street - the light in the shop was not gas - the light was a very short distance from the machine - I was standing in the private door, nearly close to the shop - when you were brought back by the policeman I nearly fainted; but I was positive of you - I am not aware that my husband put any questions to me - he said, "Do not swear to the man if you are not certain;" and he said to the policeman, "Let him go:" but I am certain of you.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CARTLIDGE (city-policeman, No. 56). I was in Old Fish-street on the night of Tuesday evening, the 17th of December, and heard Mrs. Rawlinson cry "Stop thief" - I took the prisoner at the bottom of Five-foot-lane, not a hundred yards from the prosecutor's - when I first saw him he was running out of St. Nicholas Olive Church-yard - I fell down when I got within ten feet of him, and lost sight of him for a moment; but he was seized and brought back - he was the only person running before me when I fell; and I observed that he had a dark coat on, and white all down the back of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How far was I from the prosecutrix's house when you heard the cry of "Stop thief?" A. Not above three houses - I observed you in the churchyard seven or eight yards from me - I fell down in the lane; that is, about forty feet from where I stopped you - I did not stop you - you were speaking to a person when I came up.</p>
               <p>Property produced and sworn to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is generally said a prisoner pleading his own cause has a fool for his advocate; but necessity compels me to adopt this course - being out of a situation, it was necessary I should call at the places where one was most likely to be found - I had been to a house of call at Clerkenwell, and then to Aldersgate-street; then to Bermondsey-street - I came down across Fish-street, Friday-street, down Five-foot-lane; and there I was walking - a person came and asked if I had seen anybody pass that way? - I immediately replied, "No;" and the policeman came up and said, "Oh, I dare say this is the man," and took me back to the prosecutor's house - when I got there I denied all knowledge of the robbery - the husband said to the wife, "Can you swear to the man?" - she said at first, "Yes" - then she was in such a state of agitation, several persons cried out, "Take her into the parlour" - the husband said, "Can you swear to the person? - do not lock him up if you cannot swear to him" - I do not know her answer; but he immediately said, "No, she cannot swear: let him go" - the policeman replied, "No, I will keep him till the morning; then perhaps you will know him better" - I believe it was the duty of the policeman to take me before the inspector; and if so, in all probability I should have been discharged entirely, but in the morning the prosecutrix swore to me, and I was committed - and now, gentlemen, I leave my case in your hands, with a full conviction of receiving an impartial verdict, free and unshackled by oppression or prejudice.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CARTLIDGE re-examined. I did not say,"Perhaps this is the man" - as soon as I got up to him I said, "You must come back with me" - he was talking to a person who had asked him if he had seen a man go that way - the person had stopped him on hearing me cry"Stop thief" - he was asking him that - the person with him said he had asked him if he had seen anybody come that way - the person did not appear to know the prisoner - I am positive I am not mistaken in the person I was following; for I had so good a view of him by the gaslight - he was in the church-yard when I first saw him; that is forty yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH RAWLINSON re-examined. I saw him coming up the hill as I stood at my door talking to a neighbour, before he went into the shop - I speak to his face, and observed his hat was torn all down; and he appeared to have a dark coat on - I saw his face in the shop, and as he came out - I have never had a doubt that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the officer one question on the situation of the night and the hour.</p>
               <p>W. CARTLIDGE. It was between six and seven o'clock in the evening of 17th December - the gas-light was three doors from the shop - I do not know what sort of a light the prosecutrix had in her shop - I think it possible to recognise a person at that hour in her shop - I think I have seen the prisoner's face; but not on that night - I only saw his back.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long had he been in the service? A. About four years to my recollection - he is married, and has three children - he occasionally receives 20s. a-week - I believe his wages were 22s. - it is customary for servants to have any goods they wish by paying for them, with permission of any person in the warehouse - he was not taken into custody before he had time to mention it to the clerk at the desk - I was concealed there three quarters of an hour - another clerk came in, and the prisoner was sent out on a short errand, while I came out of the closet - the officer was not there when he returned - the officer came about five o'clock - there was no inquiry made of him till the officer came - the warehouse was light- it was daylight - I was about ten yards from him - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020036"/>could have given an account of it to me afterwards, as I had come out while he was on the errand, and was in the warehouse when he came back; and he could have given an account of it to the clerk who sent him out - it might be more than an hour after he returned that he was taken into custody - he was kept in the warehouse - I cannot say how he was employed - he was in the warehouse more than an hour- he was sent out by Mr. Weedon a second time - the officer was then outside, and took him into custody - this article is lace or bobbin quilling - they are the same thing- there is bobbin net quilling - it is all one - I don't know why it is called quilling - it is net work - bobbin net is a wider description of the same thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it not lace without any edge to it? A. Without any embroidery.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it known in the trade by the name of quilling net? A. It is bobbin quilling net, and quilling net.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANLEY. I am a constable of Worship-street - in consequence of information from Mr. Weedon, I stationed myself opposite the house on Friday, the 13th of December, and saw the prisoner come out of the door from the warehouse - I suffered him to go eight or ten steps to the corner of Goldsmith-street, and laid hold of him - he said, "What do you want?" - I said, "I take you into custody on suspicion of committing a felony" - I took him to a warehouse below Mr. Weedon's, and in one breeches pocket I found this piece of quilling wrapped in blue paper, and in the other pocket the other piece - I asked him to account how it came there - he was very agitated, and gave no answer; but as he left the warehouse he said to Mr. Weedon, "I hope you will think of my wife and three children" - he had not said before whose property it was - Mr. Weedon shook his head - I don't think he made a reply - on the way to the office in a coach, he said to Mr. Weedon, "Mr. Weedon, I hope you will forgive me."</p>
               <p>Mr. FRANCIS WEEDON. The prisoner has been in my service as <rs id="t18340102-64-deflabel358" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you any other Christian name? A. No; nor any partner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look at the parcel from which the net was taken? A. I did, and found the quantity deficient- this piece corresponded with what was in the parcel, and makes the quantity correct - the property is mine.</p>

               <p>EDWARD WATTS. I know Mr. Jerard - he is a customer of my master's, who is a butcher, in Leadenhall-market - on the 24th of December I left two pieces of beef, weighing nineteen pounds, and one pound of suet, at Mr. Jerard's - I did not fetch it back again, nor did anybody from our house; it was left for Mr. Jerard to consume in his family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons are in your master's service? A. One besides myself; he is not here - he is not my brother - he is twenty-five years old - he is not related to me - I did not fetch the beef back - I was going out with meat all the evening; what the other shopman might have done while I was out I cannot tell, whether he might have gone to fetch the meat again I cannot tell - I am not acquainted with the prisoner - I have seen him, and I think I may have spoken to him- I knew him about eight years ago, and I may have spoken to him since - I do not know that I have spoken to him within two years - I should be sorry to swear I have not spoken to him within six months; but eight years ago I lived near him - he was a butcher when I knew him - I have had no concerns with him within six months; not spoken to him to my knowledge - I cannot swear either way, because I am not certain - I have had no concerns with him, within eight years, that I know of - I knew him by living at a place - I do not remember speaking to him - I have not been in his company, I will swear, within six months - I do not think I have spoken to him - I did not say I had not spoken to him for eight years - I said I knew him then - I knew him when he lived with Mr. Scales, in Whitechapel. My fellow-servant is in very good health - I did not weigh the beef, nor was I present when it was weighed - I was sent with it - I know the quantity by the book - I left it at Mr. Jerard's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been mistakes made in the conveyance of meat to different customers? A. At times we make mistakes - I do not know that one shop-boy has been sent to rectify the mistake - if I have left it in mistake, I have gone to change it, and sometimes a fellow-shopman has been sent instead of me, I being sent elsewhere - master ought to know whether my fellow-shopman was sent to fetch the beef away.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE ROGERS. I am servant to Henry Jerard - I recollect the beef and suet being brought by Watts - in half an hour, the prisoner came to the door - I know him perfectly well - he said his governor had sent him for the piece of meat which the young man had left by mistake - that the young man had taken the wrong piece off the block - I went and told my mistress, and she said it was quite right - I came down, and told the prisoner my mistress said it was quite right - he said it was not right; that it was another person's; and he would take it and bring another in exchange - I let him have it - he took it away, dish and all - I saw no more of it, nor the dish - I cannot be mistaken in the prisoner - I am positive of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you known the prisoner before? A. I never saw him before in my life - I have not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020037"/>been in town long - I observed him - I did not take a fancy to him - I knew him when I saw him again - I looked in his face, and knew him again - I had no suspicion of him then - he is a particular-featured man - I should know him anywhere - I should know Watts again - I observed the prisoner, particularly his features and his dress - I had no reason for observing him - it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; after dark - he stood at the door - there was a very strong gas-light at the door, that shone on his face exactly - I went down to the door to him three times - I received the messages from him, and went to my mistress and told her - I took no particular observation the first time; the second time, I gave the message, which took about a minute - I observed his features and dress - I should know him from all the men in the world - he has particular features - I did not observe that he was pockmarked; he might have been so, without my observing it - I cannot positively say what coloured stock he had round his neck - he had a light jacket - he had neither a cap nor hat on; I am sure of that - he had not a board on the top of his head - he took it away in the dish - he was not bald - I did not observe that he was - I cannot say whether he was - I know him by his features - I had never seen him before - I was not quite a minute the second time - I went down to him three times - I only took the meat down and gave it him the third time, which took a second or two - I have been about three months from the country - I was never in London before.</p>
               <p>HENRY JERARD. I saw nothing of the transaction - the butcher lives about the one-eighth of a mile from my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Has your butcher sent different men to your house? A. Yes; certainly he has, for years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it all to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Abraham Keyner, publican, Bethnal-green, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Was it not in May, 1832, she came into your service? A. I will not say the date particularly, it was in the early part of the year - I left her with three children - she had the care of the family and the room where the property was kept - when I went into the country I left her a sovereign to begin with, and I was in the habit of coming to town - I cannot say how soon I came to town again - my children were ill with the fever, and the prisoner said she had been ill with it - she was very kind to my children - I gave her some money when I came to town again - I cannot say how much - she did not say she had been obliged to part with anything to get money - I do not know when she pawned these things - I cannot say that she had not expended the money on my family - she sent the duplicates to her brother about six months ago, and he sent them to me - I did say to her sister, (in hopes of finding her,) that if she sent me the duplicates I would not hurt her - she never told me she had expended the money she got for these things on my family, but she said she had intended to save money and get them again.</p>

               <p>ROBERT NICE. I am foreman to Messrs. Farmers. On Saturday, the 30th of November, I left the mill between six and seven o'clock in the evening - I had taken stock that day, as I do every Saturday - the property was all right then - I went again on the Monday morning, about six o'clock, and missed two sacks of flour - on the 11th of December I went with the officer to Mr. George's orchard and garden - I found part of a sack of flour buried in the orchard in a sack, and part buried in a sack in the garden - one sack was Mr. Grattan's, and one Messrs. Farmer's- on the 13th I went again with the officer and examined the granary - I found some flour in a sack buried in some oats - we then went to the coach-house, and found some flour mixed with some lime - we afterwards went to Pluck's garden, and found some flour buried in the garden, and some in a barrel - there was a sack, marked "Grattan," covered over the flour that was buried - it was in consequence of what Whitebread said on his examination, that we went and found the flour in those places - I have some of it here - it belongs to my master I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Have you compared them? A. Yes; flour is very much alike, but there is a difference between best and second flour - my employers sell a great deal in sacks.</p>
               <p>- HARTNETT. I am in Mr. George's service - on the day before the prisoners were apprehended I found some chaff in the stable-bin - it was mixed with something white - I cannot say what; I saw Pluck bring it in - I told him he had put something into the oats that looked white - he said he had cut up a mouldy truss of hay.</p>
               <p>DR. CRESSWELL. I am a magistrate of this county - I took the examination and confession of the two prisoners - it was made voluntarily, and they were told it would be taken down, I signed it.</p>
               <p>JOHN MEAD. I am a constable - I took the prisoners - I found the flour in the garden, the orchard, the coach-house, and other places.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's confessions were here read as follows.</p>
               <p>"The said J. Whitebread freely and voluntarily confesses and says, That in the evening of Sunday, the 1st of December instant, between five and seven o'clock, I went into the mill through the bake-house - I went to the first-floor and took one sack of flour; I divided it into two parts: I then took a second sack and divided it in the same way. I put the flour into four sacks, two of which were Messrs. Farmer's. I then removed the four sacks from the mill one by one into Mr. George's stable. On Monday, I heard that the two sacks of flour had been missed. On Tuesday, between three and four in the morning, I and William Pluck, the watchman, removed the flour from Mr. George's stables into his loft. On Wednesday or Thursday morning, between five and six, I and the prisoner Pluck removed the flour from the loft. I carried part of it away and buried it in Mr. George's orchard, and I wheeled another part of it away and buried it in Mr. George's garden; and the remainder of the flour I threw, part of it into the river, and stowed some away in Mr. George's granary; one half-sack I put among some lime in Mr. George's coach-house; William Pluck, the watchman, had the rest."</p>

               <p>The said William Pluck says, "I am servant to Mr. George, who lives in South-street, in the parish of Enfield, close to Mr. Farmer's mill, and am employed to watch Mr. George's premises at night. Full fifteen months since, soon after I entered into Mr. George's service, John Whitebread, who lives in South-street, said to me, 'I can put you in a way to get a few shillings as the other watchman and I have done before.' Soon after this he gave me half-a-crown, which I understood to be to induce me to take no notice if I saw him fetch anything out of Mr. Farmer's mill. Between that time and the present I have seen him many times during the night leave Mr. Farmer's mill with sacks, sometimes pig's victuals, part of which he generally gave me, or the money instead of it. About 7 o'clock on the evening of Sunday se'enight I saw him fetch four lots of flour from Mr. Farmer's mill, and put them into Mr. George's stables: on the next morning there was a stir about the flour having been stolen. On the next Tuesday or Wednesday morning, before it was light, I saw

             remove some of the flour from the stable; he told me he was going to throw it into the river: he soon came back and said the flour would not sink. I then saw him remove the remainder of the flour, and take it up Mr. George's back orchard, towards the garden, where he said he would bury it in the ground. When he came to the mill for flour at night, I have sometimes seen along with him Edward Whitebread, Thomas Whitebread, and John Jackson, to whom I have seen him give what he took from the mill for them to take away, and I understand that they were in the habit of buying of him the stolen flour and offal.

            . I am a partner with Mr. Thompson - the prisoner came into our service on the Friday before Christmas-day - we had some suspicion of him; and on Thursday, the 26th of December, his hat was knocked off by our lad designedly, and a china mug fell out of it - I took it up, and said, "What had you this in your hat for?" - he said, "I was not going to take it away" - I went to the desk, and showed it to my partner, and the prisoner took up his hat and went into a little back place - he came out again, and another mug fell from his hat - these are the mugs; they are worth one shilling each, and the images are worth about seven shillings the pair.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER WILDMAN. I am in the prosecutor's employ - last Thursday night week, I saw the prisoner take a mug from the front of the shop, and put it into his hat - I was outside at the time - I ran in, and he pulled a handkerchief out of his hat and pretended to be wiping his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020040"/>nose - when Mr. Whitebread came in, I told him of it - I then went and knocked the prisoner's hat off, and a mug fell out of it - Mr. Whitebread took it up, and said, "What does this mean?" - he said, "I was not going to take it" - he took up his hat, and walked into the back place, and Mr. Thompson told me to fetch a policeman, but winked with his eye, as much as to tell me not to go - I went out for a minute or two, and when I came back, I saw Mr. Thompson pick up another china mug - both Mr. Thompson and Mr. Whitbread then told me to fetch a policeman.</p>
               <p>JOHN VIRTUE. I am headborough of Whitechapel - I went into the shop a minute after the policeman; Wildman got a light, and I went with him into the back place - I found these images among the straw - I showed them to the prisoner - he said he knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER WILDMAN. I had seen these images two days before, in a drawer, and I saw the officer find them in the back place, about the middle of it - I had been there several times that day; and about ten minutes before they were found, and they were not there then.</p>

I was in the shop when the prisoner came in for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco - I served him - he put down half-a-crown - I gave him five pence farthing change, but there was no silver in the till, and I called my mother to give him two shillings - she took out her purse, and the prisoner snatched it and ran out of the shop - there was money in the purse wrapped in paper, and some silver - I had before seen twelve sovereigns in the purse, but she gave my father one sovereign - I pursued the prisoner, and cried "Stop thief;" he was at first within a yard of me, but he ran faster than I could - I did not see him do anything with the purse; but as I was coming out at the door, there was a man who stopped me, and put his hands to my breast - the prisoner was stopped by Mr. Custance, who came out of his door and turned him back - he passed me again, and Mr. Newbiggin put out his hands and stopped him, and they all fell down together - I am sure the prisoner is the man - he had time to have given the purse to the man at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many were running? A. Only the prisoner ran out of the shop - there were more persons running in the street, but I was the first after the prisoner - I was not more than two yards from him - I never lost sight of him - I did not see him give anything away, but he might have done it by some artful means - I heard some halfpence fall when they all fell down.</p>

            . I went to the prosecutor's shop on the 24th of December - I bought two quires of paper and some pens - I paid the prisoner a shilling, which had been marked, and three pence in copper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS. This is the prisoner's book - he has entered for the first of these purchases only three memorandum books, 9d., for the second only 1s. 6d., and for the third only 6d. - when I went home I asked the prisoner what he had been doing - he said, "A little" - I called an officer and gave him into custody - this marked shilling was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many marked shillings had been put into the till? A.Five in all - I found fourteen sixpences in the till - I don't know how many I left when I went out - there might have been sixpences put into the till - I had a good character with the prisoner - I have sometimes found a few pence more in the till than the book would account for - I cannot swear that it has not been as much as a shilling - it may have been the case, that if two or three customers were in the shop, the entries have not been made till they were gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."The unfortunate error which has brought me here I cannot account for. I can only offer you a few remarks upon the nature and conduct of Mr. Adams's business, which I trust may lead you to believe, as I assure you the fact is, that my error has arisen from mistake, and not from a disposition to wrong my employer.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020045"/>The articles sold in Mr. Adams's shop are many of them of very small value, such as memoranda-books, steel pens, a quire of paper, &amp;c.; for such trifling articles many customers come in, in the day; sometimes several are in the shop together. The goods are bought, the customer pays, and perhaps wants change, and has it. For strict regularity, and to prevent the possibility of mistake, the entry of each sale should be made on the instant; if, however, a shopman were to go to the book to enter a sale to one customer, while another, or perhaps two or three others, were waiting in the shop to be served, they would become displeased at the delay, and leave the shop without purchasing at all; the consequence is, that it frequently happens that several different small articles are sold to different persons, and no entry made till the shop is clear; it then becomes difficult to recollect what article was bought by one person, and what by another; the money in the till and the memory are the only means by which the entries can be made. I had, on the morning in question, sold several different articles to a variety of people; I could not precisely recollect the articles sold to each individual, or the money paid for each kind of article; and I entered, to the best of my memory, the correct sums against particular parcels of goods, and I found the amount in the till and that in the book balance; and although I may not, and fear, as the evidence stands, have not made correct entries of the articles sold, and prices paid, I earnestly hope you will believe me when I say, that the gross amount of money received is correct, and not one farthing more was paid me than is put down. If I had intended to have embezzled my master's money, should I have placed it in the till? It is more reasonable to suppose that I should have put it in my pocket, and in my pocket the marked money would have been all found; but, gentlemen, only one shilling of that money was found on me, the whole of the rest was found in the till. If the sum which I am charged with embezzling had been found upon me, it would have operated against me; my own money was found by the officer, and amongst it one of the marked shillings, and that I can account for. I had two sixpences in my pocket. They are convenient for change, and I put them into the till, taking in lieu a shilling out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith, Mr. Moginie, Mr. Rouse, Mr. Kennett, Mrs. Matthew, and Mrs. Bertenshaw, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>JOHN COLLYER. I am a gardener, and live at Newington-green - the prisoner came to me and said my boy had stolen two rabbits from him - I told him I did not know how that could be - he said he had, and he would have them - I told him I was not satisfied about that, and should not give them up till I had got a policeman - my boy had brought two rabbits to my house - I followed the prisoner down into the brick-field, about three hundred yards; he kept saying he would have them - when I got down there I saw another boy hiding behind the bricks - I asked the prisoner what that boy was hiding from me for - he said he had got two other rabbits like his - I asked what he was frightened at - the boy said he was frightened at me - I asked why he should be frightened - he said he did not know - the prisoner asked me again for the rabbits - I said,"When I get a policeman, and am satisfied they are yours, you shall have them" - on looking round I saw a large cave made out of a clump of bricks, large enough to conceal two persons - I asked him where my boy took the rabbits from- he said out of that place - I had my little daughter with me, and I sent her for a policeman who lives opposite, but he was not at home - presently the prisoner turned round, undid his jacket, and took out this chopper - he flourished it about, and swore with an oath that he would kill my boy for taking his rabbits - he went in a direction to meet him as he was coming - I ran after him, took the chopper from him, and he ran away; and the boy who was hiding in the bricks ran with him; and we found hid under some bricks two more rabbits and the mole-trap - the rabbits are all here now.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HARVEY re-examined. This is my master's chopper and mole-trap - his name is James Adamson.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FIELDWICK. I am servant to Mr. Collyer - I work in the gardens - I found the rabbits in the hole, and took them to Collyer's house - I was going out on an errand for master through the fields, and on going by the clump of bricks, I saw a mole-trap; and on looking into a hole I saw the rabbits, and took them to my master's house - the prisoner afterwards charged me with stealing them - I was returning and saw the prisoner and a boy - he said, "Did you see a man here?" I said, "No;" he said, "I saw a man here, and when he saw me he ran away - I went for a policeman, and when I came back there were four rabbits here, and you have got two of them" - I told him they were at master's house - he said he saw me run up the field with two rabbits in my hand - I had seen nobody when I took them - there were wild rabbits in the field, and I did not know at the time that these were not wild - he went to master's house directly - the field is about three-quarters of a mile from Harvey's.</p>
               <p>JAMES PLAYFORD. I am a policeman - I took the prisoner into custody at Collyer's - I produce the rabbits.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Collyer's house, and asked him if his boy brought the rabbits there - he said "No;" I said, I would have them, and they were there - I said,"I must have them, they don't belong to me, but to another boy" - I knew nothing about them, only seeing the other boy with them in the basket - I told Collyer so - I took the chopper off the bricks.</p>
               <p>J. COLLYER re-examined. He did not say they belonged to another boy - he said they were his - the chopper was not on the bricks, he took it from his jacket.</p>

            . MESSRS. ADOLPHUS and BULLOCK, conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARD SQUIRE. I live on my property at King's Langley, in Hertfordshire - I have the probate of the will of Mrs. Mary Martin, late of Beaconsfield - I am under that will, trustee of some money left for the benefit of her niece, who is the wife of the prisoner - the sum was 1,600l. in money, which was invested in the 3 per cent. reduced.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON (for the prisoner). Q.What is the amount of the general proceeds of the personal estate? A. I am not certain, I believe about 14,000l. - I am not aware that I have received more than 14,000l. - I could have ascertained that, if I had thought the question would be asked - I cannot say whether I have - I will not undertake to affirm whether I have not - there was a certain sum detained until the decision of the Court of Chancery was given - Mr. Collier was entitled to it by a decree of the court - it was somewhere under £3000 - I cannot tell you how much - I really cannot tell you whether I had received nearly £14,000 under the estate before I received the £3000 from the Chancery Court, without having my documents before me - I cannot tell within £1000 what I have received - whatever sum it was, there is no doubt whatever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020047"/>that it was included in the sum under which I proved the will - it was not known at that time that there was any dispute, the sum was calculated with the rest - it was not in the Court of Chancery at that time - this sum of £3000 was certainly taken into the account, on which the probate duty was calculated.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The £1600 was invested in the 3 per cents.? A. Yes: in the names of the prisoner and myself - here is the regular stock receipt for the money purchased - it is 2044l. 3s. 1d. - the prisoner was joint trustee with me - he was entitled on behalf of his wife, during her life, to receive the interest of £2044 - I never received a single dividend whatever - George and Henry Wheeler were the brokers who acted for me in the purchase of the stock - I never in any manner, either directly or indirectly, assisted in, or consented to, the transfer of that sum of money.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS HENDERSON. I am a clerk in the 3 per cent. reduced office at the Bank - I have the transfer-book letter D - it is the original book - persons transferring stock sign their names in this book - here is the transfer of £2044, in the names of Collier and Squire.</p>

            . Q. How comes the transfer in the book D? A. We cannot always keep to the letter, the transfers are so numerous.</p>
               <p>MR. SQUIRE cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the prisoner's father alive? A. I don't know, I am not acquainted with his family sufficiently - I don't know his name - I know one of the sons; at least, I have seen him once or twice - his name is William - I never knew him by any other name; and by his being called Junior, I apprehended he had no other name.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some legal misunderstanding with the prisoner, I believe, yourself? A.Very little, not myself, not as I was concerned: but it was my duty as the executor to retain certain monies until the Court of Chancery determined - he wanted the money, but I took counsel's opinion, and could not give it up - I have seen his wife two or three times - I have never inquired of her whether she consented to the transfer - I have had no conversation with her - I believe by the will one trustee is not responsible for the neglect or loss of the other - I have sustained no loss that I know of - I have made no inquiry at all - this is not my prosecution - I believe it is at the instance of the bank - I believe the wife is alive - no call has been made on me by the wife.</p>
               <p>[The will was here put in and read. Among other legacies, it bequeathed to the executors, in trust for Sarah Collier, the prisoner's wife, free from the control of her husband, the sum of £1600, to invest in the public funds, in their names, &amp;c.; and bequeathed to the prisoner, William Collier, the residue of the estate - it was dated 14th of June, 1813. There was a codicil annexed, bequeathing £100 to William Collier, the prisoner's son.]</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. SQUIRE. Q. The sum of £100 was given to the prisoner's son William? A. Yes - that was paid, I think, in 1832, when he became of age; at least it was invested at that time the other sums were invested, and when he became of age it was paid to him with interest - it was in July, 1832 - the amount was about £140.</p>
               <p>JOHN RUMSEY. I am a solicitor, and live at High Wycombe, Bucks. I know the prisoner very well - I communicated with him in 1826, on the subject of borrowing some money - the prisoner was to borrow it - I effected the loan to him - Mr. John Lane lent it to him - I have the security here with me - I am one of the witnesses to it - it is signed by W. Collier, Sarah Collier, and John Lane - I saw all three names signed - the money was advanced on that security - the prisoner is the William Collier who signed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LUMLEY. Q.What was the amount of the sum? A.£200.</p>
               <p>[This instrument was put in and read - it was an assignment executed by William and

               <p>MR. BULLOCK. Q. Do you know whether that money has been repaid or not? A. I know it has not - Mr. Lane, who lent the money, is not now living - I have the probate of his will - his executor is Joseph Lane - he is alive - I know the prisoner's wife - I saw her last September - the prisoner lived at Stokenchurch, in Oxfordshire - I don't know when he left there - I saw him at the end of September in London - I met him accidentally - I was getting out of the coach, and he got off the coach, and just at that moment he said he was going to settle at Liverpool.</p>
               <p>MR. LUMLEY. Q. He knew you very well? A. Yes - the interest on the mortgage was paid regularly - I know the principal has not been paid from having seen the executor of Mr. Lane - I saw him last about three weeks ago - I don't know what family the prisoner has - he has several children - I think they are all young - when I saw the prisoner's wife I had no conversation with her on money matters.</p>
               <p>HENRY RINTER. I am clerk to Mr. Durrant, a stockbroker. I know the prisoner - I first saw him in October, 1832 - I saw him at Mr. Durrant's office - he came and said he wished to have £120 Consols bought for him - I took his instructions - he gave his name

               <p>"Dear Sir, - I shall be obliged to you to sell £120 stock three per cent consols to-morrow, Thursday. I shall be at your office about one o'clock. I also wish to transfer to my son William, £2044 3s. 1d., standing in the names of William Collier, surgeon, of Stokenchurch, and Richard Squire, of King's Langley. Mr. Squire will meet me at your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020048"/>office to make the transfer. It is not intended to change the stock."</p>
               <p>HENRY RINTER re-examined. In consequence of this letter, I sold the stock for him, and prepared the ticket for the transfer - we leave that at the bank with instructions to enter it in the book, to prepare it for the signatures of the party - the prisoner came to the office on the day appointed, the 10th of January - we did not receive the letter till the 10th - I made the ticket that morning; and he was at our office that morning - Mr. Blackburn is another clerk of Mr. Durrant's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody come with Mr. Collier to the office? A. I cannot say; I have no doubt somebody was there, but I was busy at the counter, and did not observe - Blackburn accompanied him to the bank to get the transfer made.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BLACKBURN. I am clerk to Mr. Durrant - I know the prisoner - I remember his coming to the office on the 10th of January to get some stock transferred - there was another person with him; and I was ordered to attend the bank with Mr. Collier to make the transfer - some person directed me to attend him, and I did - I knew Mr. Collier, but not the other party - I went to the bank with him - I do not think Mr. Squire was the person who accompanied him - (looking at the transfer) - I attested this transfer - my name is signed here - I saw the prisoner sign it, and the person who accompanied him signed it in the name of Squire.(The transfer was here read.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BLACKBURN re-examined. I knew the prisoner at the time, and supposed the other gentleman to be Mr. Squire, by Mr. Collier bringing him there - he passed for Mr. Squire in Mr. Collier's presence - I saw Mr. Collier at our office afterwards, in October, when he came to sell £120 consols - he gave instructions for a power of attorney at the same time - (looking at it) - this is it - it is in my handwriting - I took the instructions from Mr. Collier to make the power of attorney - after taking the instructions we leave them at the bank - I took these instructions as he gave them to me (read).</p>

No - I know it was done, by our books - the instructions are dated 1st of October - the Stock was 3 per cent. reduced - the books were closed then for a dividend, and they could not be transferred without the power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. The original transfer says, "Witness my hand, William Collier" - did you see it so written before the name was signed? A.

I did (looking at three) - these are them - I sent them to the prisoner Collier - these are the same bills - I addressed them to William Collier, Esq., No. 2, Trueman-street, Liverpool - I have seen him write, and I believe the endorsement on the bills to be his - I sent them to him in consequence of a letter which I received - this is the letter - I know the bank post bills, because they correspond - I recollect I did not take the numbers of them, but the names and amounts correspond.</p>
               <p>JOHN HENRY CLARK. I am in the employ of Messrs. Wheeler, stock-brokers - I know Collier - Messrs. Wheeler have transacted business for him at various times - he is well known in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of April, 1833, do you recollect his giving you any instructions? A. I cannot call to mind his coming to the office (looking at a paper) - the top of this is my writing - the bottom is Mr.

               <p>F. HENDERSON re-examined. Here is the transfer of £200, on the 30th of April, from William Collier, of Stokenchurch, Oxfordshire, Gent. - it says, "£200 of my," which shows it was part of a larger stock - that is, part of the £2044 3s. 1d. - I was present where it was signed - it is signed William Collier, jun.</p>
               <p>JOHN HENRY CLARK re-examined. I was present when it was signed - I cannot call to mind the individual who was with me - I believe this writing to be the handwriting of William Collier, the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you seen the son write? A. Yes; I will not undertake to say it is not the son's handwriting; but I believe it is the prisoner's - the prisoner writes very different at times - he and his son do not write very much alike - I believe it to be the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Do you believe it to be the son's? A. No; I believe it to be the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say they sometimes write alike? A. No; I do not - there may be some similarity. The transfer of the sum of £200 was here put in and read.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS HENDERSON re-examined. This is part of the original sum of 2044l. 3s. 1d. - I say so because I have examined the account - I do not find any other sum in the name of

I know the prisoner - I have no recollection of his coming to instruct us to purchase this stock - it appears so by my books - the stock was afterwards sold - I have no recollection of having instructions for a power of attorney - my clerk went to get the power of attorney - I recollect transferring the stock by virtue of the power - I recollect before that seeing the prisoner and conversing with him about the power - I recollect he asked me to act on a power of attorney for the sale of £1800 odd stock - I asked him if he had not better bring his son to town to make the transfer, as it was but forty miles from town the expense of coach hire would not be more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020049"/>the power of attorney - he said it would be inconvenient for his son to come at the time the stocks opened - they were shut at the time - he said he would be at some distance at that time - he said his son should come to town and execute the power, the next day, or the day following; and the prisoner came the next day, or the day following, and expressed his surprise that his son had not arrived - he said he must have missed the coach he supposed, or there must be some accident - the power was then in our office, ready for execution - I think I was called away during the conversation, but I understood from my clerk that he had taken the power away - I afterwards received it back with this letter written on the fly-sheet of it - I then acted on the power, and caused the stock to be transferred - this is my signature on the back, by which I demand to act - my clerk obtained the bank post bills, as a matter of course - I received this letter, directing me what to do with the proceeds of the sale - I have no doubt the bank post bills were sent to the prisoner in consequence of this letter.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALL FARMER. I live in Abchurch-lane - I know the prisoner and his son - the son lives at Stokenchurch - I am not exactly acquainted with his business - I believe he is a schoolmaster - the prisoner once lived at Stokenchurch - he changed his residence, I think, about the middle of October, 1833, and went to Liverpool - I knew of his intention of going to Liverpool from himself, but I did not know his address there - I have witnessed this power of attorney - it was executed in my presence, at my counting-house - the prisoner, his son, and my brother, were present - it was on the first of October - it is now dated the 5th - I don't know who did that - the prisoner came first to my counting-house - he said he expected his son up - he waited there an hour or an hour and a half; and when the son came, the prisoner brought in this paper, and it was executed in the counting-house - I saw the son sign it, and I witnessed it - the prisoner took it away with him - they both remained in town that day - they dined and slept at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Are you sure this was not on the 5th of October? A. I am - the instrument is now in the same state, I believe, as far as I have looked at it - I knew Mr. Collier was going to reside at Liverpool some weeks previously - he was going into partnership there - I know the handwriting of the son (looking at the letter at the back of the power of attorney) - I should say this is the handwriting of the son.</p>

               <p>THOMAS MOLES. I am a clerk in the Bank - I have a book in which a transfer of a sum of money is made to the names of William Collier and Richard Squire, which was made on the 3rd of January (yesterday) - it is a transfer of £2044 3s. 1d. from Mr. Ricardo.</p>
               <p>ROBERT MULLINS. I am broker to the Bank of England. I purchased of Mr. Ricardo this stock for the Bank - it was transferred by Ricardo to Collier and Squire - I received the money from the cashier of the Bank of England to pay for it by order of the governor of the Bank.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM REYNOLDS. I am a constable - I know the prisoners - on the 11th of December I was in company with Fryer, Ashton, Lloyd, and Hall - a little after ten o'clock in the morning we proceeded to a house in <placeName id="t18340102-94-crimeloc527">Grove-court, Moor-lane, City</placeName>

                        targets="t18340102-94-off526 t18340102-94-crimeloc527"/> - the outer door was fast - Fryer laid hold of it; I put my fingers to the bottom and forced it open - I ran up stairs and found the room-door fast on the first floor - I forced that open, and on the left hand side of the fireplace I saw the prisoners standing - the male prisoner was in his shirt-sleeves - they were in the act of moving their feet, breaking something under them, which turned out to be plaster-of-paris - I seized the male prisoner and held his arm, and Fryer entered the room - I shoved the female prisoner away; he took her and gave her to Lloyd, and I delivered the male prisoner to Fryer - they were then handcuffed and taken into custody - Hall came up; the male prisoner said, "Mr. Hall, do you know where we are now?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020050"/>we are in the City" - [we had taken them about four months before out of the City, and Hall is not a City officer] - we searched, and on the mantel-piece of the fire-place found eleven counterfeit shillings - I brought them to the table to let the prisoners see them - they made no remark - Fryer found three half-crowns on the same mantel-piece, and on a little shelf, by the side of the fire-place, I found a band - there was nobody in the room but the two prisoners - I found a plaster-of-paris band on the mantel-piece; it is a paper band to hold plaster-of-paris - Warren said if he got over this, he would rather break stones for the parish than do it again.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FRYER. - I accompanied William Reynolds - I have heard his evidence, and confirm it - on the mantel-piece I found three counterfeit half-crowns and a broken shilling - I saw Lloyd take up some pieces of a broken mould; on one piece there was the distinct mark of a letter S - the half-crowns and shillings laid open on the mantel-piece - I saw Ashton take a finished half-crown from the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>ANDREW LLOYD - I am a police officer of Hatton Garden - I was with the other officers, and agree with their statement - I found in front of the fire-place some plaster-of-paris on the ground - I put my hand on it; it was quite hot and caked - I found a file on the hob with white metal in the teeth of it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON. I was with the officers on this occasion, and found a counterfeit half-crown at the corner of the mantel-shelf, and a piece of metal; and on the hob on the left hand side I found another little file which had white metal in the teeth of it - I looked into a cupboard and found a quantity of plaster-of-paris broken up, and more in a bag in lumps - I saw Lloyd pick up some pieces of mould - it was hot - the plaster-of-paris is in the state I found it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HALL. I was with the others, and followed Lloyd up - I went to the prisoners - the male prisoner said, "Do you know you are in the City?" - as we went along he said, if he got over this, he would break stones.</p>
               <p>JAMES WELLS. I am the landlord of the house - Chapman took the rooms of me on the 29th of October; they occupied them till they were taken up - Chapman paid the rent, and sometimes another person brought it.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD. I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint - I have examined the plaster-of-paris in lumps; three of the pieces are what appear to me to have been a mould, for the purpose of casting half-crowns, made of plaster-of-paris - the first piece has one of the letters, and the impression of the obverse side, it is the letter"S" in the word "Georgius," and that letter has a peculiarity about it which induces me to believe the counterfeit half-crowns have been made by that - there is an indented mark in the lower part of it, and in the impression there is a dot corresponding - the other part is part of the impression of the obverse side - the shillings are all counterfeit, and all cast in white metal - the half-crowns also are counterfeit, and cast in the same mould - three of the half-crowns are in an unfinished state, as they came out of the mould, with the spray of the metal - this bag of plaster-of-paris is the same material as the mould - part of the plaster-of-paris has been set with water - when it is set it would be warm - these two files have both white metal in the teeth; they are used to remove the refuse of the metal - the white metal appears to be the same description of metal as the counterfeit coin - this band appears to have been used to confine the plaster while it was setting.</p>

               <p>Warren's Defence. I had just come from my father's - I had not been in the place for nearly two days - I went to this female's for my shirt - I asked her if it was washed - she said "Yes" - I had been at variance with her ever since I was last taken into custody, and never lived with her since, but had left her company altogether, further than she used to wash my things; and I had that moment come up - I did not see anything about - I know these men are wicked enough to act wrong towards people - Hall and Reynolds said in the coach, "We have got you now, and will have you, if it lies in our power."</p>
               <p>Chapman's Defence. I know nothing about the mould - I leave it to the mercy of the judge and jury.</p>

               <p>THOMAS FARRANT. I am in the employ of Mr. Smart, a refiner in Princes-street - on Wednesday, the 18th of December, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop of my employer, and tendered five gold coins called half-eagles, and asked what they would come to - Mr. Smart told him £5 6s. 8d. - he then asked to have it put down on a piece of paper, that he might show the gentleman what it came to, which Mr. Smart gave him, with a £5 note, and 6s. 8d., and he left the shop - Mr. Smart put the half-eagles into a bowl, and put them into the desk; and I followed the prisoner across Leicester-square into St. Martin's-street - he went into a house at the bottom of St. Martin's-street - I then went to Marlborough-street office and gave information - I afterwards returned to the shop, and received the five half-eagles out of the desk from Mr. Smart - I have them here, and know them to be the same, as I marked them, and have kept them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When did you mark them? A.When I came from the office, after giving information - I know we had no others in the shop - what Mr. Smart did in my absence I certainly cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You received them from the prisoner? A. No - I saw him put them on the counter, and saw Mr. Smart put them into the bowl; and I know there were not any others there at all - we had none in the house - we had had previous information of the robbery; and they were put into the bowl in consequence of that - I might be absent about half an hour.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS. I am a policeman - in consequence of Farrant's coming to the office, I went to Mr. Jaunay's house, in Leicester-square, between three and four o'clock -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020051"/>Mr. Jaunay called the prisoner into the room, and spoke to him in French, which I did not understand - I afterwards asked Mr. Jaunay if he meant to give charge of the prisoner - he said "Yes," in English - the prisoner understands English - I searched him, and found four shillings, two half-crowns, and twopence on him, and a bunch of keys, and two knives - I sent Stone with Mr. Jaunay to his locker, to search that, while I remained in the room with the prisoner.</p>

            . I spoke to the prisoner in French a little - I did not say he should come to no harm if he told the truth, or that I would not hurt him - he begged to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS re-examined. I said nothing to induce him to confess - I asked how he came to do it - he said, "I know I have done wrong, and I have ruined myself" - he said he only had five half-eagles - I said, "Yes, you had nine" - he said, "No, I only had five, and those I changed at Mr. Smart's to-day" - he said, "That is the remainder of the money which you found on me; and if you will go to my wife, she will give you a £5 note" - he said he had taken them out of a drawer in the gentleman's room - he did not say who the gentleman was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he had done wrong? A. Yes - I told him he had stolen nine half-eagles and nine Napoleons - he said he had not, that he only took five - he said he had changed them, and had done wrong - I asked him if they were in a purse - he said, "No - they were loose in the bottom of the drawer."</p>
               <p>GEORGE STONE. I am a policeman. I went with the other witness - I made the search with Mr. Jaunay - I went with the prisoner to the station-house - when I got there he desired me to go to his wife and get the £5 note - he said if I did not find her at his own house, I should find her at his daughter-in-law's, in Carnaby-market, and I found her there - he said the £5 note was what he had received from Smart for the gold coin, and he gave it to his wife to buy some things - and he dare say she had not changed it yet - he did not say whose it was.</p>

             FITZPATRICK. I am clerk to the magistrate at Marlborough-street office. I was present at the examination of the prisoner, on the 18th - the prosecutor was there - his name I copied in the deposition from a printed card, which he gave me - it was Francis du Suau de la Croix - he answered to that name - the prisoner was present - (looking at the depositions) this is my writing - the depositions were read over to the prisoner - here is a note at the end, signed by Mr. Dyer - it is in my writing - I took it down from the prisoner's mouth - it was read over to him by me - I saw Mr. Dyer sign it - the prisoner was not asked to sign it (read) - "The prisoner says, I admit taking out of the drawer, which was unlocked in the gentleman's room, six pieces of American money, which were laying loose, but I took nothing more."</p>

I am the wife of John Anthony Stringer - I was present when he bought a looking-glass of the prisoner - it is as near six weeks ago as possible - I think it may be seven weeks from this time - I was examined before the magistrate a fortnight ago last Tuesday - it was about six weeks before that - he gave thirty-eight shillings for it - I saw the pieces of the frame - they were delivered to the constable - I am certain they were parts of the frame which the prisoner sold.</p>

            . I am a constable - I went with a search-warrant to Stringer's premises on the 17th of December - he showed me all he had got - he produced the parts of a looking-glass frame - these are them.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON DARKIN CAMPBELL. I received from Mrs. Keyser a carved leaf, and produce it.</p>
               <p>HARRIETT KEYSER re-examined. This leaf fits the frame, which enables me to swear it is part of my looking-glass - I am sure this formed part of my looking-glass-frame - they have been fixed to the place at home where the glass had been fixed; and I know them by a mark here, and the leaf fits one of the pillars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are there no frames like that? A. I cannot swear that - this mark was caused by a liquor-frame being placed against it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If that is Mr. Keyser's, it was sold to Stringer before the robbery, which you will find by Stringer's evidence - I did not know till one o'clock, I should be tried before next week - last session I was admitted here as evidence against the men who did the robbery - if I had anything to have done with the frame, depend on it I certainly should have mentioned it - I was taken up for the robbery myself, and admitted as evidence at Hatton Garden- If I had known about the glass I certainly should have spoken about it.</p>

I remarked, "You have made a mistake here altogether - this is the 1st of November; it is market-day; and I suppose you have been very busy, and have put the 31st of October on the bill, but this is the 1st of November" - he offered to make the alteration - I said it was of no consequence at all.</p>
               <p>Witness. I do not remember such an expression - I cannot swear whether it was market-day or not - I do not remember such a thing occurring as he mentions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said I resided in Maddox-street - I said it was where I was going to reside; but I was going to take the machine in a cab to Vauxhall.</p>
               <p>Witness. He said he was either going to open a shop in Maddox-street, or that he lived in Maddox-street - I asked him for his address, and he gave me No. 18, Maddox-street - I believe he said he had bought a cart and horse, or something to that purpose - I am sure he gave me that direction, in answer to my asking his address - he said,"The name of Johnson, No. 18, Maddox-street, Regent-street" - I understood him to mean he was then living there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say a word about Vauxhall, or the neighbourhood? A. Not at all - the invoice was dated the 31st of October - I have no reason to think that was not the date - only I have no date in my book - I thought that was the date at the time I wrote it, and he said nothing to me about it being the 1st of November.</p>

               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I am an officer of the City. In December last I went to No. 6, Vauxhall-walk, to look for the prisoner - a boy answered the door - I asked him if his father was up, supposing him to be the prisoner's son - he closed the door upon me, I being inside, and said he was not at home - I think it was about twenty minutes after eight in the morning - another lad came into the passage at the same time - I laid hold of them both - they made a sort of noise - I then opened the front door, having two or three other persons with me, to let them in - I let go of the boys, opened the front door, and one of the lads ran up stairs - I followed him up directly afterwards, and some person was in the act of pushing the back room door to - I put my foot to it and forced it open - as I went into the room I observed a door in the left hand corner just closed to - it was a very small door - if I had not seen it close I should have thought it was a cupboard-door - there was a woman in the room, who the prisoner said was his wife - I called out to my companions to look out behind, thinking somebody had gone through the door - I afterwards found the door led to a little room, which room led down into a washhouse by a pair of steps into the back yard - when I called out, "Look out behind," the woman said, "He is not here" - but in about a minute the prisoner came into the room from the little door with only his shirt on - I said,"What is your name?" he said, "Johnson" - I said, "Is that woman your wife?" he said, "Yes" - I asked her where she got the £5 note she had changed with Mr. Burlton, the pawnbroker in the Walworth-road, on the 2nd of November - the prisoner answered, "From a person of the name of Hadley" - at the same moment the woman said, "He is a gambler" - I then left him in the room, and went and brought out two hat boxes, and a blue suit of clothes - the hats were in the boxes, and I found a green suit of clothes in the room below - I found this paper in a front parlour, in the table-drawer - it is the bill for the machine - I then asked him where he got the £5 note he had passed with Mr. Belcher for the two hats - I had not told him what he was charged with, and did not give him any caution that he need not answer - (I was instructed to trace the notes, and had asked other people about them before, and if his answer was satisfactory, I should have traced them to other persons) - he said he had taken that note of the same person. I found a boy's green suit of clothes, and I asked him where he got the £10 note he passed at Mr. Doddemead's, on the 9th of November.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you not aware it is not usual to question a person charged with felony without cautioning him that he need not answer? A. My Lord, I had no direct proof he was the man - I wanted to trace the notes - he told me he had taken it of the same person - he said he himself dealt in unredeemed pledges, and that he had sold him guns and watches to the amount of £50 or £60 - I won't be sure which - he said Hadley lived in Kennington-lane - I have since inquired diligently for such a person in Kennington-lane, but could hear of no such person - I went to a great many public-houses and bakers'-shops, and to the tax-gatherer, and could find no such person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Forrester entered the room, my wife was in bed and I with her - she was very poorly overnight, and our infant child was with us - the only obstruction the boy made was from the indecent manner in which Forrester and three other officers entered the room, and would not go out while she put on her clothes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. They having entered the room at that hour without producing any authority, I made to the little room, to know where the robbers were coming in. Witness. It was on a Sunday morning, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock - I was requested to withdraw while his wife dressed, but there were only two of us in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were no steps to go down from the little room. Witness. There were steps leading down stairs from the little room - I went up the next day without moving them - they stood under a sort of trap-door leading into this little room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Forrester asked me where I got the notes, I made no hesitation in saying I took them from Hadley - I was then taken away by two officers to a public-house at the corner of Vauxhall-bridge, and from there was driven about to two or three tradesmen, the hatter and tailor, and then we were driven to the Mansion-house (without their stating the charge or showing me any authority) with my wife and child; and my wife and child were locked up all the night in the Compter. Witness. The child was locked up with you at your own request; your wife had changed one of the notes.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You had no directions to apprehend him, but was employed in tracing the notes through the different hands of the persons who had possessed them? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You were well acquainted with his writing nine or ten years ago? A. Yes; I have letters of his by me which he wrote then - my memory has been refreshed by having letters of his before me within the last three days - I trace his character of handwriting - I cannot swear it is his - I should say the words "Barnett" and "London" are much like it.</p>
               <p>Q. If you took the paper up and was asked whose it was, without this circumstance being known, should you have said it was his? A.Perhaps I should - I don't think the signature is his handwriting; taking it altogether, I am more inclined to believe it is his handwriting than that it is not, from the character of handwriting - handwriting varies - sometimes persons writing in the same room from practice will write the same character; but we in the trade know how to distinguish them.(The cheque was here put in and read.)</p>

            Marquis of Camden, or Hastings,' I cannot say which, the card being either mislaid or destroyed by my little daughter. Hadley sent my son for a coach, and put the goods in, and drove off towards the City. On that day, my son and myself were at Battersea and Chelsea, from ten in the morning till we arrived home at five o'clock, where Hadley was waiting to see me: he appeared in a great hurry, and I produced the articles he wished; he looked them over and made the purchase. On that evening I went with my two sons to Walworth, about a house I was then taking; I was there till nine o'clock, and then returned home, after making a few purchases, and did not go out again. The next evening, Friday, the 1st of November, being then about to place my son in the fish trade, we proceeded to Smithfield, to a Mr. Burchfield, a scale-maker, to whom I was recommended, and purchased a weighing machine, fish-knives, weights, &amp;c. I tendered him for payment a £10 note: he gave me the change; but sent the note out for that purpose: he gave me a bill of parcels, and dated it the 31st of October. I made a remark immediately, and said, "You have made a mistake of a day; this is the 1st of November;" but I said it was of no consequence, and put the bill in my pocket-book: he found his mistake: we took the goods with us - my son being with me at the time of the purchase. I gave my wife 20l. to pay bills and make purchases. About two years or more,(nearly three years ago,) I purchased a great number of tickets of a person by name Cooper, which pledges were principally at Mr. Burlton's. My wife was known by the name of Cooper: it was for no felonious intent that the names were given on the notes, but only by the address that Hadley gave me. It was not likely I should give or pay notes away in a neighbourhood where I was so well known, having removed from there only a few months ago, and was on the point of going back again.</p>

No; I write on printed cheques only - I certainly have allowed other persons to fill up my cheques for me - I never sent a plain cheque - I occasionally allow persons to fill up cheques- they were always printed, and always signed by myself.</p>
               <p>JURY to GEORGE SEWELL. Q. On the cheque being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020057"/>presented, did you take sufficient notice to identify the prisoner? A. I looked at the cheque, having a doubt of it, and then looked attentively at the man, who appeared to me a sort of tradesman - I thought him incapable of forging a cheque, and handed it to Mr. Barnett - I decline to swear to the prisoner - I have no doubt at all of his being the person - I believe him to be the man - I am satisfied of it myself, but decline to swear it.</p>

            . I am a clerk at Messrs. Esdaile's &amp; Co., bankers, in the City - On Saturday, the 7th of December, a person called at the house and presented this draft to me, which I paid - I have no recollection of the prisoner's person - he must have produced a letter - he did not produce it to me - I paid the draft - I never saw the letter - the draft was signed when presented to me - I asked no questions - it was marked with an order to pay it, and I paid it - I did not ask him any questions, but gave him £1.</p>
               <p>JAMES DIGNAM. I am an attorney - the prisoner was in my employ - I remember expecting a letter from Bridport - I did not say anything to the prisoner about it - a person named Hopkins there remitted me £1 a month, in discharge of a debt and costs - I expected it about the 7th of December - I asked the prisoner on the 8th of December if he had received a letter from Bridport - he said he had - I asked where it was - he said he had left it at home; he had forgotten it - I said, "How came you not to leave it with the papers you left at my house last night?" - he said he did not consider it of any consequence - I asked what the letter was about - he said it was from Hopkins about the instalment referring to Messrs. Esdaile - he said he had been to Esdaile's on the 7th, the day the letter was received, and they knew nothing about the subject of the letter - I told him, when he came to the office next day, to bring the letter with him - I did not see him on the following day till about one o'clock; that was the 9th - in the meantime I had made inquiry; and I asked him particularly, if, on the 7th of December, he had received, in consequence of the letter from Hopkins, £1 from Esdaile's - he said he had not - I am positive of that - I asked him the question repeatedly, and he denied it - I then told him, in consequence of the discovery I had made respecting various disbursements which he had made while I was absent from the office, I should give him into the custody of an officer- he seemed confused; and while the lad was gone for the officer (which he was not aware of), he said, "It is no use denying it any longer: I received the £1 from Esdaile's on Saturday last, the 7th" - I am positive he said that in the presence of Mr. Pomeroy, who was there - I had never given him any authority to sign my name to any cheque for the receipt of money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to state you never gave him authority to sign your name? A. Yes, certainly, as to notices and briefs and things of that sort, the clerks invariably do it - he had authority, in my absence, to attend to the business, and to transact business in my absence under my directions - my instructions were, not to transact any business without coming to me always and receiving instructions - it was not his habit to open my letters and answer them - I told the lad in the office to tell him not to open my letters - when I took him into custody, I charged him with opening a letter, and receiving, without my sanction, 1l. - I went before a magistrate - we did not follow up that charge - the magistrate recommended me to follow up other charges, and we left this charge until I was advised to proceed on this charge, which was yesterday - we were before this magistrate on the 9th of December; again on the following Monday, and the Monday following that - I did not prefer this charge till I was advised, that in point of form, there was some little difficulty in the other indictments, or else, out of mercy to the prisoner, I did not wish to proceed on this charge - I said, in the first instance, I wished to proceed on the minor charge; but a suggestion having been made that those indictments might be objected to, I was recommended to prefer one for forgery - I am not aware that those charges are bad now - I mean to try them - I consider I was bound to follow the advice of counsel - I made a statement before the magistrate on this charge - it was not taken down.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If I understand you rightly, you say at first you preferred two charges, for minor offences, against the prisoner? A. Yes - I was advised afterwards that the Middlesex bills, found at Clerkenwell, were wrong - the present charge had its foundation in London - I was advised to prefer a bill in London for a distinct offence - the two charges still remain to be decided.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long has the prisoner been in your employment? A. He came to me on the 22d of November- he was not an articles clerk - I gave him 1l. 5s. a week - I was away from the office, from severe illness, from the time he came till this happened - I told him his salary should be increased.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you promise him 30s.? A.Certainly not - he only asked 25s.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STOCK. I am clerk to Mr. Dignam - I received this letter on the 7th of December - there is a shelf in the office on which I used to put the letters - I put that on the shelf - I never received any directions to open them - I told the prisoner he was not to do it - that was in consequence of directions from my master - I remember the prisoner sending me out after I left the letter on the shelf - it was on the shelf when I went out; when I returned from the message he had sent me, it was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Mr. Dignam's a large establishment? - how many clerks are there when the office is full? - they call you Charley in the office? A. Yes; there is nobody besides me and the prisoner in the office - Mr. Dignam was away for two or three weeks - the prisoner did in the office as he was instructed - he went to master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020060"/>mostly every night - he did not know there was a debt due from Hopkins.</p>
               <p>Q.Now will you take your oath you ever saw that letter on the shelf, or did your master tell you to say so? A. I put it on the shelf - Mr. Dignam did not tell me to say that when I went out I left it on the shelf - I think I put it on the shelf about eleven o'clock, and I went out between three and four - Mr. Dignam was at home - he lives at Pimlico - the office is at No. 6, King-street, Holborn; only one letter was on the shelf - I do not know how much money had passed through the prisoner's hands - I received sometimes one thing and sometimes another from him - I had not received so much as 10l. or 15l. in the course of three weeks - I do not know whether he has expended much - I have been two months in the office - the prisoner was not there before me - Mr. Dignam did not come for three weeks - I did not expect that letter from Hopkins - I looked on the shelf to see if the letter was there after the prisoner went out - I did not notice it was gone till he was out and came in again - I told him of it, and he told me he had had it - he did not tell me he had opened it - he did not afterwards produce the letter to Mr. Dignam that I know of - I don't know whether Mr. Dignam settled his account with him before he charged him with this offence.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure he told you he had had the letter? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How soon did you tell Mr. Dignam, the prisoner had told you he had had the letter? A.That night - I cannot say how soon it was that Mr. Dignam complained of the prisoner's conduct.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SHEPHERD. I am a jeweller. I have seen the prisoner at Mr. Dignam's office, and have seen him write,(looking at the cheque) - the name "James Dignam" to this is a good deal like his handwriting - I believe it to be his - I know Mr. Dignam's handwriting very well - it is not at all like his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Not at all an attempt to imitate his handwriting? A. The I is like his, but the D is not- I have seen the prisoner write frequently at the desk - I called at the prosecutor's office to ask how he was frequently, as he was ill at home, and I might stay there five or ten minutes - I went once or twice to Pimlico - it is my belief that this is the prisoner's handwriting - I speak from the formation of the letter D more particularly.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You believe it to be his writing? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a merchant, and live at No. 65, Broad-street, City. I was at Mr. Dignam's office on the 9th of December, and remember his speaking to the prisoner about receiving 1l. at Esdaile's - the prisoner at first hesitated and denied it, but afterwards admitted it - he muttered something which I could not understand - Mr. Dignum sent somebody out, and when he came back he said, "Now Mr. Cox, do you mean to say you have not received that money? I have made inquiry and found you have received it" - he then said, that it was no use denying it any longer, that he had received it - I am positive he said that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. STAMMERS. Q. Did you measure the wine? A. Yes, with a quart-pot I got from a public-house - I know it is claret wine by tasting it - I am not in the habit of tasting claret, but I have tasted it when I was in service. I do not know how many men were at work in that vault beside the prisoner.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the police at St. Katherine's Dock - I saw this wine and these other things found on the prisoner - I examined the vault, and found a cask had been spiled, and this gimblet fitted the holes - the prisoner attempted to make his escape.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were at work there? A. I do not know; there were a great many; there was a vault-keeper and several others - the usual way of tasting wine is by taking it from the bung-hole: I have seen it spiled, but it is not usual - one spile hole was left vacant, and another had a new spile in it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do merchants ever taste by a spile? A. No.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PITTENDRIGH. I am foreman cooper of vault B - the prisoner was employed to paint there.</p>
               <p>DAVID HUNTER. I am keeper of the B vault - I drewsome wine out of the cask; it was partially leaking - it is claret wine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent of the robbery. I was engaged to paint a box and three pieces of board for the "Lord of the Isles," and received the wine for it. I told the officer so, and he made a laugh at it. There is no proof that I got the wine out of the cellar - I was not stopped till I got to the front gate - the reason I did not state where I got it was, I did not know but that it was smuggled - I am guilty of having it, but I did not steal it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was no concealment of them? A. No: he was about two miles from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>MR. ASTON. I can swear to one of these in particular, and I believe the others are mine.</p>

When Mrs. Townsene asked my wife for money on Christmas-eve, my wife told me to step out, and she would tell me how we were circumstanced - when we got out she would have gone down on her knees to me, and told me of it - she said, "Mrs. Townsene does not know of the greater part of these things being pawned; you had better not go home; and on Saturday we shall have money, and we will get them" - I said I would keep up if I could; but being ill, I could not go far - I then took off my shirt, and got 1s. for it to get a lodging - my wife promised to see me the next day, but she has deserted me, though I would have laid down my life for her - I then went to the workhouse, where I was taken by the officer.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house with the prosecutrix - on the 3d of December I was at the theatre with her - she fainted away in the theatre, and a gentleman got her a coach - I put her tippet on, and saw her get into the coach at a quarter before eleven - I returned home after the performance - I know Leigh-street - it is about three or five minutes' walk from where the prosecutrix lives - I got home about half-past one o'clock - I found the prosecutrix in bed, and a surgeon bleeding her - she appeared to me to be dead - she has not recovered herself since - she was not sensible till nine o'clock the next morning- she was quite sober when she left the theatre - she had a gold chain fastened with amethyst, and her other ornaments, this boa was entire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lived with her? A. Seven months - I have seen her faint, but never saw her so bad as she was then - I never saw her intoxicated - I saw her faint once before, when she came home from the country - I do not know where she had been after she left me that night - she had her shoes on when she left the theatre.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the Norfolk Arms in Leigh-street - about half-past eleven o'clock at night, on the 3d of December, a coach came to my master's door - I cannot tell who was the coachman; but he came into the house and asked for a quartern of rum and shrub, which he took outside, and handed one glass into the coach - he came in again, called for another quartern, and handed another glass into the coach - he then came in and called for another quartern, and took that out; but I did not go out that time - he then came in again, took out sevenpence, and said, "Give me as much brandy and water as that will buy" - he had it, and took that out - I then heard a female, who was in the coach, burst out into a little bit of a laugh - I saw her fall back, and say, "Oh dear" - the prosecutrix's house is about a quarter of a mile from my master's - when the coachman heard the word, "Oh dear," he came out of the house, stood upon the step, and moved the female - the door was open, and I saw he moved her, but I do not know why - he then got on the box, and left about twelve o'clock, or close upon twelve - he went down Judd-street at about four miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you any doubt that the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020064"/>thing he had was a quartern of rum and shrub? A. No; and I saw some hand give some into the coach - I cannot swear it was the coachman's - I am sure that some of the second' rum and shrub was handed into the coach; but I did not go out the third time - I did not see any other person in the coach but the lady.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not see another man outside? A. No: there might have been a man inside the coach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.There were three servings of rum and shrub? A. Yes: the coachman paid for them at separate times, and then for the brandy-and-water - I cannot swear the prisoner is the man - I had not seen him before.</p>
               <p>MARIA ATKINSON. I am servant to the prosecutrix - I remember her going to the theatre on the 3d of December - she had her trinkets on, and her gold chain and boa - she came home in a coach driven by the prisoner between five and ten minutes to one o'clock - she was then in a state of insensibility; and her boa was torn; her chain and rings were gone, and her dress was drenched with what appeared to be clean water; but the coach appeared quite dry - I told the prisoner the things were missing; and I searched the coach - I found her empty purse and her eye-glass at the bottom of the coach - the glass had been attached to the gold chain - her bonnet and one of her shoes were at the bottom of the coach - the other shoe was lost - I asked the prisoner twice where he had brought her from; and he said direct from Drury-lane, and that was all he knew of the robbery - I looked at the clock, and it wanted five or ten minutes to one o'clock - I am certain of the time - Leigh-street is three or five minutes walk from our house - I sent for a surgeon - it was about nine o'clock the next morning before my mistress was sensible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lived with the prosecutrix? A. About nine months - I know her way of life - I believe her clock is generally right by the parish clock - I do not know how the clock might be at the public-house, in Leigh-street - when I went to open the coach-door, the prisoner offered to assist me, but I said, "No, thank you," and a gentleman, who was in the house, assisted me to get her in doors - I never saw my mistress the worse for liquor - I have seen her drink a glass of wine - the surgeon said she had had something improper given to her which she ought not to have had.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear the word "opiate?" A. Yes, he mentioned the word - he bled her directly he came, and said she was not to be allowed to sleep - he stayed with her himself till five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>JAMES DYER (police-constable E 81.) I took the prisoner on the 5th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening - I asked him if he knew anything of the jewellery, he said, "No," but the lady had it on when she got into the coach, and he knew nothing about the robbery - the shoe has not been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never told him she had her jewellery on - she fainted at the theatre, and that is where the water went over her dress, by the applewoman belonging to the theatre - I was told that by my own wife - I had brought this lady home twice before in the same state - she told me to pay for the rum and shrub, and she would pay me when she got home - some of her property was found at the theatre the next day - the pot-boy said at the office that the coach left the public-house at twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, and Atkinson stated it arrived at home twenty minutes before one o'clock.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH HOWE. I am son of the witness - I know the prisoner - I met him in Church-street, Bethnal-green, in August last - he asked me if I would let him bring a parcel to our house the next morning; and I said he might if he liked; and he brought a bag of flag annatto, and left it in the down stairs room, and said he would meet me another time - I saw a horse and cart at the bottom of the turning - I received about 30s. from my mother three or four days afterwards, which I gave to the prisoner the same evening in Church-street, Bethnal-green - he gave me half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you never carry about two hundred weight into your mother's house from Mr. Fullwood's cart? A. No; I did not bring you 4l. 18s. and receive 1l. 9s. of it myself - I did not buy the clothes I have now on with it.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GRAVES. I am an officer - I remember the prisoner being examined on Tuesday last - when I took him to the lock-up room he said, "The whole truth shall come out, I will show up the real thieves" - I had not promised or threatened him - he began to tell me something - I said,"You had better say nothing to me, but write it down, I will call for it;" I called and got this letter from him.</p>
               <p>MR. FULLWOOD. This is his writing, and this is our annatto.(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>"Newgate, Jan. 1, 1834.</p>
               <p>"I have known the witness, Joseph Howe, about eight months ago. I met him in August last in Crab-tree-row; he asked me where I was going? I told him nowhere particular; he asked me what was the matter with my hands; I told him it was my work; he asked me what work it was; I told him; he asked me if I could get any of the stuff? I told him I never had; I told him I did not like; he said he could put it away; I said I would get some; on the Friday I took him about 24 pounds, he sold on the Saturday; he had four half-crowns; he gave me two of them; we went to the Adam and Eve together; the next week I took him about 180 pounds to the end of Hare-alley; he carried it to his mother's house; I waited for his coming back again to me. On the Friday night following he told me it was sold for sixpence-halfpenny per pound; he said his mother was going with it along with Vanheason; he said it was sold in Wheeler-street; I asked him if he knew their names; he said, No. About half-past eight o'clock I went to Mrs. Howe's house; she told me it was right; she showed me a bill; I did not know the handwriting; it was wrote very bad; she told me that she had given Vanheason five shillings and the porter a shilling, and they had sixpennyworth of gin; we had some conversation with her; I then left her house and went to the Adam and Eve to meet him; he was there; he called me on one side and told me it was all right; he gave me two sovereigns and eight shillings; he said he had the same; he showed me the same quantity of money that he gave me; he said he should buy a suit of clothes with his money; I met him on the Saturday; I met witness in Church-street; he had on new clothes; I said to him, You have turned a Gentleman all at once; he said, When shall you get any more? I told him in a few days. The next week I took some to his mother's house - it was to fetch 4l. 8s. 6d.; it was at his house about four days; I asked him if it was sold? he said he had not got an answer about it yet. On the Friday night his mother came to the Adam and Eve; she said to her son Joseph, 'Have you taken the stuff?' he said 'No:' she said, 'Some one has stole it then;' she called me on one side and said, 'Bill, some one has stole the stuff out of my house; I know it is Vanheason is the thief.' I said, 'That is a very pretty thing for me;' he said, 'I followed him with a load all down Bermondsey; I lost him there: I know it was him.' I have been in her sons' company many times since; this is the whole truth; what they say is false. As for knowing anything of the other prisoner, or anything of any cake annatto, I never sold any in my life.</p>
               <p>"I hope Mr. Fullwood will come or send to me to-morrow, and let me know, as I want to make my defence, and to know if he intends to prosecute the witness. Do not forget it, if you please."I remain yours,</p>

             (police-constable, B 97.) About three o'clock on Wednesday morning the prosecutor came and said he had been robbed of the two coats - he took me to the house - I found Butler there, who said he had been robbed of his coat likewise - I took him and Cooper to the station - I then went back and took Morgan; and when she was going to be locked up, she said that Harber was to meet Butler and her at the Duke of York's monument - we went there and found him sitting on the step with these two coats on over his own, and this handkerchief round his neck - I asked him if he did not live in Jeffrey's-buildings - he said "No" - I then took him.</p>

Twenty-four hours - it was four hours after I had last seen the parcel, that I saw the prisoner warming his hands - it had been out of my sight four hours - it is a regular coach-office; but not the office which persons come to to take places - there was no stranger near where the parcel was - my three fellow-servants were in the office, and Edgell - my fellow-servants are not here - I was attending to my business, casting up the books - I had my dinner in the course of the four hours - I dined in the office - my sister brought it to me; but she was not round the counter - the others were round the counter - they came round to mark off the book - I cannot say whether "20l." was written on the parcel or not - I did not notice it much - I had other parcels to mark off - I put it in a place of safety - I have been there about four years - two book-keepers have left lately, but not under charge - it was about eight or nine months ago.</p>

Moses and Son, of Hounsditch, who sent me with a truck load of goods, for the purpose of delivering at different Inns; at the bottom of Hounsditch I unfortunately met with a man, whose name is

            , and who had lived in the service of Messrs. Morley and Co., of Gutter-lane, Cheapside; he being out of work, asked me to give him a job, which I did, as I wished to go to another part of the town, on my own account - I accordingly gave him the goods for the purpose of delivery, and the book to get signed, telling him to meet me at the end of Camomile-street, at a quarter past seven o'clock that night, which he did, and delivered me the book; but it being a wet night, he left the truck somewhere until the morning - I took the book home, and thinking all was correct, told him to meet me at eight o'clock next morning with the truck, and at the same spot, when I would pay him for his trouble; which he did - I took the truck home, but told him, if he would wait awhile, I would give him a glass of something to drink - when I came back, after I had cleaned my master's boots, he gave me a draft to get cashed at a banker's - I returned to the man, who by this time had another with him, whom I did not know, and we all repaired to Steven's Wine Vaults, where having had several glasses of gin, and feeling rather stupified, I at his request permitted him to have the draft, to get changed for me; after which I waited a length of time, but finding he did not return, I went to every place in quest of him, but in vain, he was not to be found; I then made inquiry at the different inns, and found that he had deceived me in that respect. Not having delivered the packages, I was therefore ashamed to return to my employers, and with a mind bordering on madness I absconded - since which I have been driven to every privation of this life, travelling different parts of England in quest of employment, but to no effect."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How long had you missed the keys? A. From the 5th of September till the 27th of November - I had not any intelligence of them in that time - they could not have been lying about the counting-house during that time, because I had every place searched - I had the counting-house swept every morning - I was very careful in the search - others had access to the keys - they might have taken them to have gone in - I questioned them about the keys - I was not absent ten minutes - I had only gone up stairs to Mr. Sayer, who was ill- according to the best of my opinion, no one would touch them, or had touched them, besides the person who took them away.</p>
               <p>Q.You say you heard three knocks at the counting-house-door? A. Yes: they followed each other immediately, as if somebody wanted to come in; and were loud enough to be heard - the counting-house is left for the night at eight o'clock - I leave to go to dinner at four o'clock -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020071"/>the clerk goes at half-past two, and is back about a quarter of an hour after I leave; so that it is left for a short time - it was known that our counting-house is open for business until eight o'clock - it is in the same building as the dwelling-house - Mr. Sayer lives there - I was engaged in making up an interest account which requires attention, that was the reason I did not answer the knocks - there was a handle to the door outside - I will swear it was a key, and not the turning of the handle that I heard, because when he turned the handle he came in - we have five persons in our employ besides Mr. Sayer - there are three porters, but they have nothing to do with the counting-house - when he put his head in at the door, I went to him, and said, "There is no Mr. Smith here" - he ran away as hard as he could - all the goods in the counting-house are Mr. Sayer's.</p>

Yes, it is in his handwriting - I had access to the book, but I was confined by illness; but he brought the book to me - I cannot tell whether he brought it between the 23d and the 27th of November, it is probable that he did, and that I saw this entry of the 8l.; if I did, I allowed the money to remain in his hands, for the purposes of the office; but he told me that Abbott had paid the 8l. - I cannot tell when he told me so - he had money from me as he wanted it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. During the last few months, the want of employment, and other circumstances, had involved me in difficulties, from which I could not extricate myself, which made me a prey to care and anxiety. In this state I entered my prosecutor's service, where I had a prospect of retrieving my circumstances, which have been disappointed. Just before the trial, for which the fees in question were payable, I had seen the prosecutor, he expressed himself satisfied with my attention to the business, and said, no doubt Mr. Abbott would make me an acknowledgment, and give me two sovereigns; this was peculiarly agreeable to me, and, having a balance in my hands belonging to the prosecutor, I was not so careful of it as I should have been; after the trial, in that case, I paid the jury fees, and took the ticket for them. I then went to Mr. Waters, he handed me the ticket for the Marshall's fees, but having only 8s. or 10s. I could not pay them; I told him I would go and get the money of Mr. Abbott; I went to see for him, but could not find him. I returned to the Court, gave Mr. Waters the ticket back, and told him I would call and pay him the first time I passed that way. I then went to the prosecutor's house and told him the verdict was for his client; he was much pleased, took me by the hand, and gave me wine, but I never received the two sovereigns; and then my hopes were disappointed. I intended to pay these fees, but as I knew they were not wanted, I did not pay them immediately, though every professional man knows I could not have taxed the costs without paying them, and I should therefore have done so. I beg to state, that on the morning of the day on which the prosecutor gave me into custody, he informed me he thought I should not suit him, and desired me to leave, and call the next morning to balance my book. I said it was unusual to leave at so short a notice, and we both agreed that I should stay the week; and I had every opportunity of making my escape. I will not deny that my conduct has been imprudent, but I trust, for the sake of my friends, you will pause before you pronounce a verdict, (which will brand me with infamy) - for which I shall be truly grateful to the latest period of my life.</p>
               <p>MR. DIGNAM. The prisoner had no opportunity of escaping after this charge was made - the costs could not have been taxed without this money having been paid - I generally tax the costs myself, and then I must have sworn that these fees had been paid, but the master would have required to see the ticket for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Have I not taxed the costs while you were ill? Witness. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you not promise him two sovereigns, or lead him to expect them from Abbott? A.Never.</p>
               <p>Francis Hebert, solicitor, and Thomas Dunnett, of Grange Court, Carey-street, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Were there not persons at work there who might have got into the pantry? A. Yes: the area gate was open, but the door was shut - I have known the door to be left open - I have no proof that you locked the door - the box was locked, and the key of it hung in the press - the bunch of keys hung up, but no one but you knew what they were - there was one workman in the pantry that day; but I went in with him, and came out with him - I saw him go out of the house - I will swear the press was then shut - the lock of the box was a common lock - I never tried it with any other key.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it usual to lock the pantry-door? A. Yes; if there was no man there - the key of the box could not be seen without opening the press.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you find the bunch of keys safe on your return? A. Yes; there were ten or twelve keys on it - the prisoner knew the key of the box, and no one else - he tied it on the truck himself - the bricklayer and labourer who were at work there that day are here.</p>

I am an officer of Marlborough-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020074"/>street - on the 18th of December I saw the prisoner in the lock-up place in the office - he had had one hearing then - I said it was a very serious charge against him - he said it was, but he was innocent - I said I was very ready to make any inquiry for him, if he liked; and I would take as much trouble to prove his innocence as his guilt; but if he was guilty, he must take the consequence of it - I then asked him where he had disposed of his livery clothes - he said he had got drunk, and lost them at a b-y-house - I said where was the b-y-house - he said, he did not know, he was drunk - I said "If you was drunk when you went in, you was not when you came out; what neighbourhood was it?" - he said in St. Giles - I asked were he went when he left Mr. Mitchell's - he said to Piccadilly; to two or three different houses, and he could not name one, and he had been part of the time in Piccadilly and part at Blackwall or Shadwell. I said, "Well, as you lost your clothes, where did you get money to buy these clothes you have on?" - he said it was given him by a friend, who was a servant out of place; but he would rather be transported than tell his name - I saw he had this new hat on, and I took it off his head for the purpose of seeing the maker's name, and I saw this writing on the inside of it - he said, "I bought it of a Jew" - I was then called away, and I directed the gaoler to take the hat from the prisoner - I afterwards went to remove the prisoner to the House of Correction - he had a fur cap on, and he began to complain of having his hat taken from him - when he got outside he was very violent, he insisted upon it that they had no right to take his hat, and if he had known it he would have torn the b-y hat to pieces - he threw the cap down into the road, jumped upon it and kicked it - he said, the magistrate had no right to have the hat taken away to make evidence - nothing had been said then to cause him to think that it would be made evidence - he took his cap from me, and tore the lining out, and he said, "If I do not get my hat, I will throw no light upon it" - when we got to the gate of the office he was going to throw the cap away, and said, "I will not have this b-y thing on; if I do not get the hat I am dumb."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I believe you will say I was in a great passion? Witness. Yes, you was - I did not tell you it would be better for you to tell, and that Mr. Mitchell would perhaps make it light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You false-swearing scoundrel, you did - stand down.</p>

            . I am an officer - I assisted Ballard in taking the prisoner to the House of Correction on the 18th of December: he said, that if he had known they were going to take his hat away, he would have torn the b-y hat to pieces; he attempted to tear his cap, and said, he would throw no light on the business, he was dumb.</p>
               <p>EDWIN DUNCAN WILKS. I am gaoler at Marlborough-street - I saw the prisoner with this hat on - I said, "You have got a new hat;" he said, "Yes; I bought it of a travelling Jew in the street" - I took it off his head, and left it outside the cell - when I returned, he asked me for it- I said, "The magistrate desired to see it;" he said, "If I had known that, I would have torn the b-y lining out before you should have had it."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Upon your oath, did I say, "I bought it of travelling Jew?" Witness. Yes, and you took a blue shirt out of it.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer - on the 3d of December I was at work at Mr. Mitchell's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was the door kept shut? Witness. It was opened for the tradesmen to come in, we shut it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got drunk and lost the livery - I went to a b-y-house, but whether in St. Giles's or Blackwall, I do not know - I went with a friend, who is a married man, and I promised not to tell his name - we got drunk, and he let me have the money to get my clothes - I did not take a single article of the plate.</p>
