             called me, I went as fast as I could, the prisoner had got away from him, and ran to the Fighting Cocks, in Tottenham Court Road, and the sack was dropped just by a pawnbroker's door, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260004"/> corner of Chapel-street; Croker called to me to take care of the sack, for he had the man safe enough.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that Croker brought across the road? - The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing else with him? - The things were all in the sack, I asked the prisoner what he had in the sack, he said nothing but apples, I laid my hand on the sack, and I found it soft, I said there is something else; I laid hold on the sack, and the first thing I took was the frock, the prisoner snatched it from me, and said it is only a pair of breeches of mine; I took him and the sack to the watch-house, and then we pulled all the cloaths out; there was a wad of straw over the apples, he said the apples came from Chatham to him, and that they were left at the Blue Posts, in Charlotte-street, my walk was within 100 yards of the prosecutor's house, and I heard a man calling out watch; he said his house was broke open, and that he had lost such and such things; I told him not to frighten himself, I believed we had his property, and the man and his wife, and son went to the round-house with me.</p>
               <p>Were the things that were shewn to him at the round-house, the same which are now produced? - Yes, the prisoner fell on his knees, and begged we would let him go, and he would give us 4 s. then, and send us 5 s. the next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me with the sack the next morning? - No, only Croker told me he saw him with the sack.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it very dark? - Yes, about ten minutes past twelve.</p>
               <p>Did you from the time that Croker called out to the time that he brought the prisoner back to you where the sack was, see the prisoner at all yourself? - No, I did not know what he called me for.</p>
               <p>When you ran it was after Croker, you did not see any body else? - No, only a woman that was upon her trial here the last sessions for this matter, she was the first person that I saw.</p>
               <p>Was the woman standing by the sack when you first came up? - She was the first person that I saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish your Lordship would look into his character for every word that he has said, is very wrong.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you take upon yourself to swear that he did offer you the money? - Yes, my Lord, he did.</p>

I did not think I was able to contend with them both, and I let the man go, and he ran away, I followed him one hundred yards, and I threatened to shoot him, and overtook him, he was never out of my sight; in the mean time the watchman came up, I desired him to take care of the sack, I took the prisoner and brought him back to the sack, and we opened it, and there was these things, he said they belonged to him, but his father and mother had had some few words, and he was going to another lodging, and he had brought these things away from them; I gave charge of him to the watchman, and we took him to the watch-house; he made a proffer of the apples, and to treat, and some money to let him go; I told him if he could prove the property his own before a magistrate, he might have them again the next morning, but I found they were the property of the prosecutor.</p>

Look at the prisoner, do you know the person of that man? - I do, on Saturday last between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, the prisoner presented me this watch, (the watch produced and deposed to) he asked me if I could advance him five guineas on it, I examined it, and went aside for a few minutes, in order to look over the warnings that are sent from the publick office, in expectations of finding this watch advertised, but I did not trace it in the hue and cry, or in any other of the bills; I told the prisoner, I could advance him the money upon it, or more if it was required; he answered, that he should be obliged to me so to do, I told him it would be necessary that I should first of all have an interview with the proprietor, because I could not conceive an idea of a man of the department in life that he was in, and the appearance that he made (he was in his post boy's dress, and appeared just to have come off a journey) having such a watch of his own; he said the watch was left him by an uncle, I asked him how long he had had it in his pessession, he said about two months; I then told him, I should be under the necessity of stopping the watch, and taking him before a magistrate, he readily consented, and I took him before Justice Penleaze, in Wellclose-square; I left him in the custody of his men, and immediately waited on Mr. Ellicott; I examined the watch, and saw it was a watch fresh out of the hands of the maker, Mr. Ellicott owned the watch, and we went to Mott and Harris's.</p>

               <p>Did you at any time recover any of these things? - Yes, my Lord, I was at the publick-office, and was shewn the trunk, and a part of the things, some few of the things, that was I think on Friday last.</p>
               <p>Did you call there, having any intimation that the things were found, or by accident? - From an intimation that the things were found.</p>

               <p>We found this trunk full of whipcord, in the house of the prisoner Dudfield, at a little court in Middle-row, Holborn; an information was lodged at the office, that there were some people lodged in that court that cut off trunks from behind chaises and hackney coaches; the prisoner Dudfield keeps the house; the trunk was in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it now in the same condition, and does it contain the same things as when you found it? - No, my Lord, the things were not in it, the things that are now in it, were found in different parts of the same house.</p>

               <p>When this shirt was produced to me at the publick office in Bow-street, though it was so exactly like mine, as to make me almost sure of it, yet there was a third button on it, and the mark had been altered; it has the letters of the prisoner's name; the mark had been very plainly taken out.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it discernable what those letters were that stood there? - No.</p>
               <p>Do those letters that are there appear to be an old mark? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you from any other particulars, say it is your shirt? - I cannot positively say, that it is; here are a pair of slippers which my name is in.</p>

               <p>Court. Then you do not know otherwise then by the information of the woman, that Hart Levy lived there? - There was a great many of his cloaths found there and boots and shoes which he claimed.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is the trunk yours? Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. The razor is not particularly specified in the indictment, it says, a mahogany shaving case, but the contents of that shaving case are not enumerated; are you sure, sir, that that razor was in the case at the time you lost it? - Yes, my Lord, positively so.</p>
               <p>Court. These shirts that you lost had they been in wear any considerable time? About six months.</p>
               <p>Do those that you have been looking over now appear to have been worn about the same time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. Here is abundance of locks and things that we found in the cellar, paper and books; and in the hand of Levy was that cane, which is very remarkable, being a loaded cane: Hart came in by himself, and Dudfield came in with one Read afterwards.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I belonged to the Earl of Oxford at Gravesend, and coming from Gravesend to get some employment, along Rosemary-lane, there was a parcel of cast cloaths women, and I bought these stockings for seven pence halfpenny; I got in liquor, and two or three girls met me, and stole my jacket and trowsers; I was taken up for this affair, I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. We have been deliberating, whether the prisoner could be convicted of a capital offence, though not of burglary; but I think the same answer will hold to this part of the charge, because it is essential in an indictment to state whose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260013"/> house it is; and upon this evidence it is not proved, that the prisoner has stole any thing out of the dwelling house of

I came to town on Tuesday, the 6th of February.</p>

               <p>Do you know that gentleman? - It was candle light.</p>
               <p>Look about? - It was very much like that man's face (Stokes). I do think to the best of my knowledge, that it was that man came up to me; he came, and said, says he, I want a porter to carry that trunk a good way, says he, it is a very busy time for porters, and I have never a one within at this time, do you just step down to the New-Inn at the Old Bailey, it is not above twelve or thirteen doors at farthest; says I, I shall have something stolen out, says he, do you think I should desire you to leave your chaise and horses, if I did not take care of every thing that was there, he began to bully me, so I went and called a porter; I observed nobody else there: when I came back, the trunk was stolen.</p>

               <p>Where was you standing? - I stood with my back to the horses, and was unfastening the trunk.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the man that you suppose was the man that gave you these directions as to the porter, have you ever seen him since? - Yes, I saw him once since in Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Court. Levy's cloaths were not in it at the time it was found? - Nothing was in it, we had found the other things that were here before, a silk gown and coat, they were found in Dudfield's drawers, in the same house, a pair of sattin slippers, a handkerchief and napkin, and a remnant of linen, (the gown and coat and slippers deposed to by Mrs. Powsey, the slippers having her name in them, which had been endeavored to be rubbed out, and she said she knew the gown by the trimming.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you put the trimming on yourself, madam? - No, sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>I suppose it is like any other trimming that any mantua maker puts on? - It is not very usual.</p>
               <p>Is it in the same situation as it was when you had it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then at present it would not fit you? - No, sir, it would not.</p>
               <p>Only that trimming is like your trimming? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You bought that gown I suppose at some mercers in town? - I bought it at Bellamy's in Chandos-street.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal more of the same piece I suppose? - Perhaps there may.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Macmanus. Who did you see in the house? - Mrs. Dudfield.</p>
               <p>It was a woman in the house that you chuse to call Mrs. Dudfield; were either of the prisoners there? - No.</p>
               <p>Then they did not hear what this woman said? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. I suppose she gave you the trunk to carry them home in? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you by the trunk? - The trunk I have had a long time.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Phillips, the brewer; on the 14th of September last, about eight in the evening, as I was going between the Ship and Sun Tavern Fields, being a vacant space, where there are no houses; I heard in Stepney Fields a most melancholy cry of Murder! murder! O do not kill me! I hesitated a few minutes what to do; I looked round and saw no person, I ran down the lane alone; but considering it would be dangerous and foolhardy, I ran back again, and I went into the Ship for assistance, I saw no person in the tap room, but I called out, For God's sake, is there nobody in the house, I believe there is a woman murdering in the fields; I heard some voices in the other room, there were three men smoaking their pipes; they followed me: here I must observe, my Lord, that when they got out of the door, the cry of murder was over, and the men heard nothing of it, and when they had got about half way through the lane, they returned; I begged them to follow me; near the bottom of the lane, I met the prisoner and one Thompson, they attempted to shun me by going close up the bank, this immediately made me suspect them; I collared Thompson with my right hand, and with my left I pushed the prisoner against the bank; in this situation the people behind came up; I observed something under his right arm, and put my hand to it, one of the other persons did the same, it was a woman's gown; he then began to make resistance, and attempted to get away, but we overpowered him, and with some difficulty got him into the Ship; there he was secured; then I begged somebody to go with me and look after the woman, we found the woman without her gown, her apron off, and her breast open.</p>

               <p>As for the gown, I had been at work on the Saturday, and had received my wages, and I found the gown in the pathway; it was dark, and I put my foot against the gown, and it had like to have thrown me down; I have no witnesses.</p>

               <p>Court. Why? - I thought it was secreted there with intent to be taken away at night.</p>

               <p>Why so? - It did, because I never saw him up before; I said I was affraid we had a thief in the house, I went to see for the sack and it was gone; it may be from ten minutes to a quarter past eight when the man went out, and I went instantly after him; I had been in the cellar before in the course of the day, but I had not observed the place where the sack was; I informed Mr. Chapman it was gone, we went to the prisoner's lodgings, and took him up, and upon the stair-case we found the property; he lodged up one pair of stairs in a court on Saint Dunstan's-hill, at the house of one

               <p>What things have you there? - These things I bought of the prisoner on Saturday after the robbery was committed, as I learn from the prosecutrix, I cannot recollect the day of the month.</p>
               <p>What are the things that you now produce? - Here is a cotton gown, a lawn apron, a muslin apron, a black silk cloak, and a white quilt.</p>

               <p>(The things deposed to by the Prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Overy. What business may you be? - I sell all kinds of linen drapery goods, muslins, lawns, Irish, and every thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Do you sell them made up in garments, or in the piece? - No, in the piece.</p>
               <p>How came you to purchase these sort of things? - I frequently buy both, of pawnbrokers, and of gentlemens servants, all sorts of left off cloaths; I was recommended to the prisoner last summer, I bought something of her at that time, as she took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260026"/> in things in pledge, I said I should be glad to deal with her.</p>

                        targets="t17830226-9-defend183 t17830226-9-deflabel57"/>? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Then you bought these things in the way of business? - Certainly, I bought them openly and publickly in her shop, there were many people that were in and out at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you afterwards dispose of these things to the person in Holywell-street? - No, my Lord, I wanted the white quilt for my own private use, or I should not have bought the other things; I carried them to Mrs. Simpson, she sold them behind St. Clement's, I seldom go to cloaths shops myself.</p>
               <p>Did you put any mark upon these things? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>That is a very common gown, is not it? Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Nor in the aprons? - No, here is one I had the curiosity to count the darns in it, there were between 60 and 70 darns.</p>
               <p>No more, at what o'clock was you there? About eight on the Friday evening.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Ireland at home then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she go out that night? - I did not see her go out, I was very much fatigued, and sat down, and she was in and out in her back shop and her fore shop some time, for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>What o'clock did you go there? - About eight she was in her shop in and out many times.</p>
               <p>Did people come in to sell, as well as to pledge? - I cannot pretend to say what they came about, but many different people came in.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you come to Mrs. Ireland's that evening, with a view to purchase any of these specific articles? - No, I called by chance, as I do at other places to know if she had any thing.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Ireland has had an inclination to get rid of a lump of goods, you are the person that take them off her hands? No, sir.</p>
               <p>Had you ever done it in any other instance before? - Not in particular, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did you buy any thing else besides this property? - No.</p>
               <p>How much did you give for these things? I gave three and twenty shillings, and I sold all but the quilt for 17 s. 6 d. for I told the woman who had them, that I thought they were very dear; I said, well says I, I will give you so, and so for them, she said she would not let me have them, I wanted the quilt, the other things I sold for 17 s. 6 d. which is reckoning the quilt at 6 s. which is in the indictment, I find only valued at 3 s.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Pray what value do you set on these things, they are your own property now? - They are thirty-eight shillings in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with the value that was set on these goods when they were set down in the indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then in your conscience, do not you believe they were the just value? - No, sir, I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Then you think they are worth more? Yes, a great deal more.</p>
               <p>How much more do you think, speaking reasonably? - I cannot tell, the gown cost me twenty-eight shillings before it was made, this apron cost 13 s. 6 d. the other apron 16 or 17 s. it was damaged muslin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Let us look at that damaged muslin apron, I believe nobody will give 6 d. for it now.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Overy. Very likely you might be glad to get rid of them? - I had no reason to be glad to get rid of these things.</p>

I desired Mrs. Overy to go to the prisoner; we went to White Cross-street, when Mrs. Overy cried out, there is Mrs. Ireland, says I, you sit in the coach I will speak to her; says the prisoner, what do you want, (she keeps a chandler's shop in Red Lion Market, White Cross-street;) I went into the parlour with her; pray says I, do you recollect selling to Mrs. Overy, who spoke to you in the coach, any wearing apparel, a day or two ago? - Lord bless me, says she, I hope there is nothing the matter, says I nothing particular, only these things were stolen; with that she fell down on her knees, and her daughter at the same time on her knees, imploring for mercy; and for God's sake to make it up, any sum whatever she would give; I told her, no I could not, she must go with me to Bow-street, where my application was; she was very unwilling to go, but she went to the door under pretence of getting her hat and cloak, and made off.</p>

               <p>But have you seen any body since the robbery till this time? - No, not like the man that robbed the chaise.</p>
               <p>What have you to say against this young man? - I believe him to be the person, I have not seen any body besides him, I have not seen him, not since the robbery.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you see him before the magistrate? - Yes, when he was taken, I saw the prisoner first at Hatfield.</p>
               <p>Find him out. - That is him, (pointing to the prisoner) he was sitting at the public house at Hatfield, about four months after the robbery, there was an elderly person standing at the door, and he asked me to take him to Barnet, I told him I could take him, and he said, there was another in the house that wanted to go too: I went in to drink, and I saw the prisoner eating oysters, and he had some beer, and he bade me lay hold of the cup and drink, and I drank, and he emptied it; and then he said, now damn me we will have some more: he asked me, whether I drove for Burton at Barnet; he looked at the chaise, and said, what, you drive this chaise; I came to Potter's bar, I stopped to give my horses some hay, he said, bugger the hay, I want to be in town; I called out to the landlord, and told him, I believed he was the person that robbed the ladies.</p>
               <p>What reason had you to believe so? - Because I took such a knowledge of him, I had such a full view of his face, that I really believe he was the man.</p>

               <p>What did you recollect him by at four months distance? - I had such a full view of his face, I had such knowledge of him, that I really believed he was the person.</p>
               <p>He was taken up before the magistrate, and the ladies, who were robbed, were brought there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And they said, they did not believe him to be the person? - So one of them said, as I heard.</p>
               <p>And did you undertake to swear positively at that distance of time, that he was the person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear now that he was the person? - I really believe him to be so.</p>
               <p>Believe him to be so, what reason have you to believe him to be so? - Because I think I am positive of him: I said, if I saw him a twelvemonth hence, I should know him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give any description of him to any magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Never saw him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor for four months afterwards? - No, never saw him, nor knew him.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a post boy on that road? - Six years last July.</p>
               <p>You have heard of the reward before now? - Yes, but I do not do it for any reward.</p>
               <p>Did not you doubt, when the ladies said before the magistrate, that he was not the man; when they went into the room, one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260030"/> by one, each of them separate, and one said, upon her oath, she did not believe he was the man, and the other said the same? - I thought he was the person.</p>
               <p>Could not these ladies see as well as you? - They were frightened.</p>
               <p>How do you know they were frightened? They screamed and shrieked out.</p>
               <p>Did you ever describe him to any public office at all? - No, I have described him to people at Barnet, I said, he was a young man.</p>
               <p>No other description? - I said, he was a little man, a young man, and his hair tied behind, and a dark chesnut horse and spatterdashes buttoned up to the knees, and a pair of spurs on.</p>
               <p>You do not know what coach he came up by to Hatfield? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did you scream out violently when you was robbed? - I believe I might, I said, what are we to do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This is a young man of worthy parents, and as good a young man as ever lived: he was coming to town, he stopped to eat some oysters, and was taken up in this manner; he was at Grantham at the very time that the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Jury. Post chaise boy, have you ever seen the horse since? - No.</p>
               <p>Should you know the horse again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What hoops did he acknowledge stealing? - Two or three parcels, but I cannot tell how many they contained.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises or threats to the man to make him confess this? - Not to my knowledge, we had been before, and searched three houses by his own confession, I never heard any body say any thing of that kind to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Pray, friend, did you see these hoops that he talked of? - No.</p>

               <p>Have you any knowledge at all how they came there? - Only by information.</p>
               <p>Who was it from? - From a man who absconded, who was also a watchman; I was present when the prisoner was examined; the prisoner was to have been sent on board a man of war, when he was taken up for the nails; the Board understanding that one of their labourers and watchmen were taken up, desired me to go and look at them, but I could not swear to them; they threatened that he should be sent on board a man of war, he desired to make some discoveries, provided they would not let him go on board a man of war; they promised him, he then said, he had seen Garden and Bowyer take hoops, that he met them at a house in Spitalfields, and that the nails were given him by this Garden, and he was to be paid nine pence for carrying them: the Board discharged him, and sent him to the cooperage as usual. Garden, came two days afterwards to clear up his character, and in consequence of Garden's information, I searched the horse pond, and there I found two bundles of hoops.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the prisoner say any thing about these hoops that were found in the horse pond? - No.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner taken up the second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260032"/> time for? - On the evidence of Bowyer who was an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise made him the second time that you know of? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Bell. Was it before or after he was examined before the Board? - It was after.</p>
               <p>I believe he was first of all discharged by the commissioners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he was not in custody? - He was not in custody but of the press-gang.</p>
               <p>What day was it he was discharged? - The fifteenth.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was that? - I do not know what day of the week.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it when you took him last time? - I never had any conversation after we took him up again.</p>
               <p>Court. The evidence of an accomplice cannot be let in this case.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, the candour of the law will not permit any man to be led into a confession against himself, under the expectation of receiving favour by it; Bell has given us a very fair and candid account of what passed before the commissioners, from whence it appears, that this man made the discoveries that have been mentioned, under a promise that he should not be sent to sea; after that it would be improper for us to convict the man, whatever opinion we may form in our own minds.</p>

               <p>On Monday se'nnight the prisoner came into my shop with another woman, about three or four in the afternoon, she pretended to bring a customer to buy a cloak, and one of my shopmen shewed her several, and the were higgling about the price, I was attending to other customers, I suppose she was in the shop a quarter of an hour; the first alarm that I heard was, I heard a gentlewoman that was in the shop say, why madam, you came into buy one cloak, how came you to steal another; the prisoner made no reply; but I instantly cast my eyes upon her, and the gentlewoman whom I saw pulling something from under the prisoner's petticoats, I did not know the gentlewoman, but she is here; it was a black silk cloak belonging to me, I examined it immediately.</p>
               <p>Had not she bought a cloak? - the person that she brought with her, pretended to buy one, and left 2 s. earnest for it, their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260035"/> way is, one comes too buy, and another steals, and the person that pretends to buy leaves some little earnest; I believe before the bargain was made, this gentlewoman detected her.</p>
               <p>Was not this the cloak that she was bargaining for? - No.</p>
               <p>Why is not your man here? - It is of no consequence my Lord because though he had shewn the cloaks, he could only prove it to be my property.</p>

               <p>I was in the prosecutor's shop at the time, I was an entire stranger, I went into match a piece of silk for a gown, I went to the left hand compter, the young man told me to go to the upper end of the shop, there was the prisoner at the bar, and another person cheapening cloaks; the bargain was the woman offered 33 s. or 34 s. and 35 s. she had the cloak on her shoulders, at last she threw. it off her shoulders and offered 36 s. and said then she would give him ten shillings earnest, and as she stood quite close to the compter, on the right side of her, I saw something hang down from under the prisoner's petticoat to the ground, it was the corner of the cloak, the prisoner and the other woman had got almost to the street door, I stooped down and picked up the corner of the cloak before I said any thing; the corner of the cloak was on the ground, I gave it a pull, and I found it was tight; I gave it the second pull, and I said, ha! how comes you while you are buying one cloak to steal another, with that the prisoner turned round and said, me! and the cloak was loose; so I pulled it from under her petticoats.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What did she say for herself? - She said she did not take it, she did not say how it came under her petticoats, I have the cloak, it has been in my possession ever since it is the very same I took from under her petticoats, she begged forgiveness as she had three children and a young child sucking at her breast.</p>
               <p>(The cloak deposed to beMr. Steel having his private mark on it.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of the cloak? The prime cost is 39 s. and 9 d.</p>

               <p>I went into buy a cloak, and there was a quantity of cloaks upon the compter, and this cloak was under foot, and this gentlewoman pulled it from under my foot; I did not see the cloak till then; I never moved from the compter till they sent for a constable, I have no witnesses now.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor to Prisoner. Where is the pretty creature that came with you?</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. That insult to a person upon trial for her life does you no credit, it is not proper nor humane.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I cannot, but remark, I think it my duty to remark upon the conduct of Mr. Steel, that it is such as does him no credit, and such as would not give force to his testimony, if the proof of this robbery depended on his single testimony, for there appears a degree of invetracy in him, which is very improper in any prosecutor; for prosecutions ought to be conducted for the sake of Justice alone, with the feelings of humanity; but the testimony of Mr. Steel, is supported in every particular, by another witness, who lays under no imputation: the facts therefore certainly press strongly against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, whatever ground you may have to suppose that the prisoner at the bar has actually committed this larceny, yet when a confession, which is the only evidence, has been extorted from her by promises or by threats, it is the course of courts of justice never to receive that evidence; therefore it is my recommendation to you to acquit her. </p>

               <p>Court. Before she said this, had you given Hart any reason to suppose it would be better for her? - She said it of her own accord, nobody asked her any questions.</p>

               <p>Was there any gold amongst it? - I saw no such thing; the landlady came and said, she should take seven pence out of it; then the prisoner Hart said, you take care of the rest: then she was taken into the watch-house, and the gentleman took out of her pocket to the best of my knowledge, to the value of fifteen shillings.</p>

               <p>I live next door to the prosecutor's washerwoman, the prosecutor came there, and he was making a sad moan, and he was laying dead on the floor, I said, he is dead drunk, then he rose up in a few minutes, and looked as white as a sheet; I said, what is the matter? he said, I am robbed of every thing I have in the world; he described the people that robbed him; he said, one of the women had a patch over her eye, with a white ribbon over it; I am pretty well used to them jobs in my business; this was after ten, we went to the Ship and Star, and the prosecutor immediately pointed out Hart, the other prisoner was not with her then; the prosecutor was very sober, he charged her immediately, she said, what did I rob you? he said, yes: then she took a handful of silver and halfpence, and gave to the landlady, and bid her take care of it: the landlady said, there was seven pence halfpenny due for a pint of hot; she bid her take it, and take care of the rest.</p>
               <p>Did you see any gold? - No, but when she threw down some halfpence and silver, she handed something over to Mrs. Smith, but I did not see what it was, nor I did not see the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Did she bid Mrs. Smith take care of that too? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hart. Payne owes me a great spite, because his son has been a misfortunate lad as well as other people.</p>
               <p>Payne. I do not know the women, I never saw them without it was promiscuously; I would not swear false for myself, I would sooner suffer death almost.</p>

               <p>I was at this White Swan between five and six in the evening, and the prosecutor was drinking, he asked me to drink, he sat till he had eight pints of beer, he began to sing a song, he up with his stick, and began striking me several times till I bursted out a crying, and went away; he came out again and gave me another blow, says he, I insist on your coming with me: he was taken sick, and being taken sick, he rather went to reach in the room; he went out, and was out sometime; when I came out he was sitting easing himself, and two women along side of him talking to him upon a muckson; I went to the Ship, and called for a pint of half and half; there was a young woman came in and asked me to join with her for a pint of gin hot; it came to four pence halfpenny; I took out a shilling, out of my pocket, and gave it to Mrs. Smith; she gave me some bad halfpence, and I reached them over to her; just as I was standing drinking the last of my gin hot, they all came in, and said, I must come along with them, and said, I had robbed this man of five guineas; the man never was in an apartment, not near an apartment of mine, nor over the threshold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260039"/> of my door. I have no witnesses, they were here all day yesterday.</p>

               <p>What was she, a servant or lodger, or what? - A lodger. (The things deposed to.) I bought the hat but a very few days before, I know it by the ribbon, and there is an S. on one handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner when these things were lost? - I do not know, I saw her at three o'clock in the morning, when we went to bed; these things were found upon her, the hat and the cloak, I was not present, I never saw her in the house after three o'clock.</p>

               <p>(The parcel deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether these books were included in the parcel you put in the coach? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why it was covered then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it wrapped in the same papers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How can you swear that those books that are in that opened package were the same books, that were wrapped in that parcel? - Because the prisoner had untied the parcel, and left the paper as it was. I went out of the yard at six o'clock on the 21st of Jan. I went to the Green Man and Still, where we take up parcels or passengers, I got off the box, and went into the warehouse, and there was no parcels, when I came out again, this gentlewoman (the prisoner was standing by the door of the coach, she asked me what coach it was, I told her the Worcester coach, she said she was going to Hayes, and asked me the fare, I told her 2 s. 6 d. and I let her into the coach.</p>
               <p>Where did you deposit the parcel you received at the Angel? - In the fore seat of the coach.</p>
               <p>Were then any other passengers? - No, I shut up the door, and proceeded on my journey; I stopped to water at the old Hatch, going along I thought I heard one of the glasses fall down, I turned myself about first of one side, and then on another: and not seeing any of the glasses<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260044"/> down, I suspected it to be the seat; when I came to Southall where we change horses, the waiter asked her to go out and have some breakfast, but she did not chuse any; she went with me to the Angel at Hayes, and there I set her down; she asked me, if I would have any thing to drink, I said, if you will go into the house, I will come to you: I perceived she had a large bundle, which I did not perceive she had when she got into the coach, I went and searched my seats directly, and pulled out this parcel, it was heavy when I put it in, and now I found it very light, it was filled with straw, and the books were gone, and it was tied up very curiously; I then said, says I, mistress, you have got some of my things, she said, no: I took the bundle out of her hand, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the bundle contain? - Some of these books, the books have been in my custody ever since. She was searched, and these prints were found in her bosom, and another book or two in her pocket; we took her before Justice Bishop, and he examined her, I was present; she said, she came on purpose to rob the coach, she told the justice so.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises of favour or threats? - Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Was her examination taken down in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it returned? - No.</p>
               <p>These examinations ought to be taken down by the Justices in writing, they are required so to do by the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>I shall certainly not receive any evidence of the confession, when the witness tells me it is reduced into writing, as that is the best evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bishop promised me my discharge: I leave it to your mercy.</p>

             the bookseller here? - No.</p>
               <p>The evidence is defective as it now stands, for what the parcel contained he is a total stranger to: Mr. Gardner ought to have been here to have established that fact, that the books that are here were the same that were in the parcel when he sent it to the Angel inn.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. Are there any particular marks on these books to shew that they were the property of Mr. Gardner before they were sent to Mr. Glass? - On some of them there are, the titles correspond (looking at the books) there is a mark on the British Plutarch, 6 vols. Letters on the Mind, 2 vols. and I know them to be his property.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see him before? - Yes, I saw the prisoner coming out of the Half Moon at Brentford, I heard at Harwood's yard that there was a robbery committed on Miss Holden and Miss Pollard, I went directly after in search of the person that committed the robbery, I heard a description of his clothes, that he had a drab coloured coat and black stockings on, and one stocking was much splashed; I searched all the houses, and I saw him at the Half Moon at Brentford, just as he was coming out of the house; and he went about three doors, and he turned short, and I collared him.</p>

               <p>Was it the dress he has on now? - The same coat: I saw the prisoner's wife the next morning at Twickenham, I talked to her about the purse, and she denied it for pretty near two hours.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Was not it me, did not you see me in Holborn? - There was a chest of shoes sell out of a cart in Chancery-lane, and a man asked me to watch, I saw the man stand by the baker's shop door, I never saw any more of him.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing when he brought this box in? - There was a few questions passed between Mrs. Hitchin and him, but I cannot tell what they were; I did not see him deliver the box out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This witness swore to Sir Sampson Wright, and said, she believed he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260047"/> was the man; then she looked round and fixed upon a young gentleman, an ensign, and said, he was the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brooks. I could not rightly recollect his face then, but I did after.</p>
               <p>How came you to mistake another man for him? - I was quite astonished when I went into the place, I was never there before, but as soon as I saw this man's face, I partly knew him.</p>
               <p>You partly knew him? - Yes, my Lord, I knew him.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, he came into our shop on Friday, the 10th of January, between five and six; he brought in a box, and asked if that was Mr. Jones's; I said, this is Mr. Hitchin's, but one Mr. Jones lodges here.</p>
               <p>Court. There was a Mr. Jones lodged at your house? - Yes: he said, one of our men will have it that this box is directed for Mr. Jones; but this direction is not for Mr. Jones; I said, if it is not for Mr. Jones, I think it is for Mr. Hitchin, for we very often have boxes of that sort, and I saw carriage paid at the corner, and I said, I know by that carriage paid, that box is for my husband, I had some halfpence in my hand, and I laid them down to read the directions; he turned out, and said, I must call the other man, he is gone higher up to see for Mr. Jones, for he will have it that it is for Mr. Jones: there is one Mr. Jones, a housekeeper, higher up in the street; and I sent up there to enquire if a porter had brought a box there, but he had not; the prisoner went out, and I did not see him any more.</p>
               <p>Court. This must be, I suppose, candle light, when he came into your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose he might stay in the shop? - About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubts concerning the prisoner being the man? - I have no doubts at all, when he came into the shop, he had a pen in his hand and no hat on, which made me look very hard at him, and I h ad a very good light in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you conceive any doubts about him at the justices? - No, Sir, I knew him as he came up the steps into the office, when he had his hat on, I thought him to be the same man then; and when his hat was taken off I was perfectly sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>You say there was carriage paid marked at the corner of the box? - Yes, and I thought it to be the hand writing of a gentleman who used to send us such boxes from Birmingham, one or two in a week we have had sometimes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you use to deal with Mr. Radenhurst? - Yes, for I suppose a year and a half, or a year and a quarter.</p>

               <p>I have nothing more to offer to the gentlemen of the Jury, I am truly innocent: I never saw the lady before, she looked round very carefully, she fixed her eyes very attentively, and said I was the man; she said, she could not take upon her to swear that, she swore to the best of her knowledge; this woman immediately started up, and said, I was the man: Sir Sampson Wright said, shall we commit this young man or not? and after some conversation, I was committed. It was calling at a house where a person had some stolen goods, and asking what is the matter, and they knowing me, that was the occasion of my being drawn into this premunire; I have no witnesses; this affair has been the occasion of my mother's committing suicide; she lays dead on the occasion now, and my father is obliged to be watched.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hitchin. Did you doubt about the prisoner? - I made no doubt at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260048"/> all, nor I was not asked whether I doubted him, but when they asked me whether I saw the man, I said yes, I said, I believe this is the man, I was sure he was the man.</p>

               <p>(Read.)</p>
               <p>Your petitioner humbly sheweth, that he has had the misfortune to catch the gaol distemper, which has reduced his constitution; and is so hoarse he is afraid he cannot inform this honourable court; therefore prays the following defence may be read. On Saturday I went to Tottenham-hill, to a person that owed me some money, coming home near Hilliard's ferry, I found the fowls in two bags, and the turkey with his legs tied; I told the watchman that I had brought them from my mother's, but little thought at the same time, that they had been stolen; but supposed they had been dropped from some cart or waggon.</p>

               <p>(The frock produced and deposed to.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Maiden-lane, my husband keeps a butcher's shop; on the 24th of January somebody knocked at our side door, and in came the child a baby without a frock; I stepped out of the fore door, and saw a woman go down the alley between a walk and run, I cannot swear to her face.</p>
               <p>Did you see the frock in her possession? No, I did not hear the child cry.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I gave a silver shilling for the frock on the Friday, I was coming along the Strand, and a woman had some clothes in her apron, and this frock was hanging out; I wanted the money, but I thought it was worth eighteen-pence, and I asked eighteen-pence on it; I told the pawnbroker I bought it. I thought I was to be tried at Westminster, nobody knows where I am.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Horner. What time of the day was it that the child came into your shop? - Between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Court to Turner. What time did the prisoner come to your shop to pawn the frock? - I believe about half past eleven, she asked eighteen-pence for it, I believe it is worth half a crown.</p>

               <p>Had he ever had an opportunity to know where you kept the money? - Yes, sir, I believe, he has seen Mrs. Williams pull out some, of her trinkets; she brought down ten guineas, and I took seven and a half, and she kept the remainder; we returned between five or six in the evening, we never missed the box then; the next day the 9th after dinner, Mrs. Williams and I proposed going to the theatre, and we had not money sufficient about us, and she was desired to go for some money; she went up stairs where the box was usually kept, and she had not been gone long before she called to me with some astonishment, and asked me if I knew where the box was, I told her I did not; I went up stairs, alarmed and searched the house all over, and could not find it; I then concluded I must have been robbed, and if so, it must be no common housebreaker, as there was some plate just by on another chest of drawers in the same closet; I took up the two women who were in the house, and carried them to Bow-street, but no magistrate was then attending: I then went to the Bolt and Tun in Fleet-street, supposing that if the prisoner had robbed the house, he would either send the property to Cheltenham, in Glocestershire, from whence as I had been informed by himself, he came, or that he would go there himself; I enquired for the book-keeper whether any person of the name of Wells had been there that day, he found that there was no such name entered there; but when he referred to the book, in which he entered parcels which were sent down to the country, he found there was a parcel entered in the name of Wells, for Cheltenham; upon that, I ordered a chaise immediately, and pursued the prisoner; when we came to Oxford, the Glocester coach had been gone about two hours; I was much agitated, and I there employed one Barton to go after the prisoner, on a single horse; I followed in a post chaise and four; took the prisoner at Whitney, and kept him till I came; there I found the prisoner in custody very dirty with travelling; he was carried before a magistrate and examined, but the property could not than be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260059"/> identified; I sent a messenger to overtake the coach; one

               <p>What property did you lose out of the house? - I lost 250 l. in bank notes, and I I should suppose from the negociation of money which I had had occasion for, nine or ten guineas in gold; and the box in which they were.</p>
               <p>Court. What numbers of bills? - Two notes for 100 l. payable to myself, I had them made out at the Bank myself, I can speak to one of the other Bank bills.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take down the numbers? Not before they were produced before the justice, but I knew the day of the month, I can swear positively to the days, and to whom they were made payable, I looked at the date at the Bank when I had them, it was the first August, 1782; I changed a 1000 l. note for these 100 l. notes; I had more notes for 100 l. the same day, but I cannot be sure how many, as I have negotiated a great deal of money in the last year, I changed one 100 l. note in Chelsea, and had a 50 l. and other notes in change, one of which was a 20 l. note, which was torn in half; the other notes of 20 l. and 10 l. I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Are you sure at the time that the box was stolen that you had notes in it, to the amount of 250 l? - Yes, the Cedar box is in court.</p>

               <p>Court. What wages had the prisoner from your father? - Twenty guineas a year besides board and lodging.</p>

On the 8th of January they sent for me from the White Horse to come there, they asked me to help them in with their clothes, we drank three pots of beer and I went up the area steps to the White Horse again; from there I proceeded to the Three Crowns at Chelsea; there I stopped, and was there till about four that afternoon; I had been there some time, and Jordan came to me, and brought this property to me in a pocket book; says he, Wells I have so and so, says he, you must take care of it; I said, you had better send it yourself; says he, neither I nor Mrs. Williams can read or write, and he said, you had better direct it, and they will have it all one.</p>
               <p>Court to Tillcock. You have heard what the prisoner has said, do you remember any time when the prisoner slept at your house? I cannot say when he did sleep there.</p>
               <p>Was you directed any morning when he did sleep there to call him to your mistress?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260063"/>I was ordered to tell him to come up into my mistress's bed chamber, but I cannot say the day.</p>
               <p>How long was it before the clothes were taken in out of the garden? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether it was a week or more, or less? - I believe it was more than a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Court to Tillcock. Did your master and mistress live together on good terms? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mrs. WILLIAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Remember you are upon your oath, therefore whatever may be the consequence, or however disagreeable to yourself, you are bound to tell the whole truth: you have heard the story which the prisoner has said, is it a true one? - No, my Lord; it is all false except my sending for him into the bed chamber, which I will tell you: Mr. Williams's mother and I had had a few words, as the prisoner at the bar says, and in my laying in I sent for him; I sent Mr. Please which was in my house to the chambers to know whether Wells had heard that Mr. Williams's mother was there to persuade him any thing about me, he came on the over night to our house, on the morrow morning I sent my servant to tell him, to come into my bedchamber, to tell me what had been said, which the nurse was there and heard every word; he told me my husband had agreed to run away with all my property, and that his mother had persuaded him to do it; which I found to be very false; enquiring of Mr. Please, which I sent to this Mr. Wells, to know what had been said, he informed me that she had said every thing that was bad of me; and that he would not live with me; and being confined to my bed-chamber at that time, we had a few words about it; I was afraid it was true.</p>
               <p>Court. What passed more between you and the prisoner? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Did you shew him any part of your property? - I was not able to get out of my bed.</p>
               <p>Was any of your property ever produced to him? - None of my property was ever touched.</p>
               <p>Did you propose ever going off with the prisoner? - Never said any such thing, never in my life; how could I propose such a thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not reason, but remember, you are upon your oath; Did any of that conversation, ever pass between you and the prisoner? - None at all my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you in any way deliver this box, or property, either to the prisoner, or to this other man, whose name is Jordan, or to any other person? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner ever see where your property was? - He has, Mr. Williams sent one of my servants to me for a guinea, five weeks before I was brought to bed; we were putting up a bed; I was very big; I sent my servant to get this little small box out, the servant brought the box to me, that was the time he saw the box.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the nurse here? - No, I did not think it necessary to bring her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mrs. Williams. You took out your rings and shewed me, and gave me a pair of sleeve buttons at the same time.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Williams. I took out a pair of buttons, of silver, glass buttons, and said I have three pair up stairs, and I will give you a pair; I took out a pair before Tillcock, and said I will give them to you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Madam, you pulled out the rings, as you and I sat down on the bed together?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I am destitute of a friend here, my friends are at Cheltenham, which is the way I know that lady there that stands at the bar.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Williams to Prisoner. And I gave you the best of characters to Mr. Williams, or else he would never have hired you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You never had any other occasion, madam.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260064"/>Mrs. Williams to Prisoner. No, that I had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She gave the girl a pair of pearl ear-rings, that was the time she shewed me the whole property, she shewed me diamond rings out of the box.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 20th of December, I left town, to go to Mr. Calvert's in <placeName id="t17830226-38-crimeloc212">Hertfordshire</placeName>

                        targets="t17830226-38-off209 t17830226-38-crimeloc212"/> on a visit; I took my watch chain from my watch, as I usually do when I travel, and laid it in a pair of stockings; I laid it on a table, or on a chest of drawers, and with many other articles put them all in the trunk together; my trunk was locked up, the prisoner was Mr. Villiers's <rs id="t17830226-38-deflabel213" type="occupation">servant</rs>

                        targets="t17830226-38-defend435 t17830226-38-deflabel213"/>; the next morning when I got up to hunt, my own servant was gone for my horses, and I undid the trunk myself; my hunting coat was at the bottom of the trunk, and in pulling it out, I pulled out several things, which I laid indifferently about the room; among the rest, I am positive there were these stockings, with either the chain, or something of metal in them; pulling on my boots, one of them was tore; Mr. Villiers was there on a visit, and his servant came in to assist me, to get off the boot; I put on another pair of boots, and went down stairs, when I got on my horse, I sent my servant up stairs to take care of my things, telling him, I had left them about, whether I left the prisoner, who was Mr. Villiers's servant, in the room, or whether he went into the next room, I cannot be positive; that was soon after we had taken a short kind of breakfast; till then my servant was with the horses, when I came home from hunting, I sent my servant to the stables; I looked for the chain, but not finding it I concluded my servant had put it up somewhere; the next day I asked him for it, and he said I had not brought it from London, for that he had not seen it, when he unpacked the things; that is all I know, I did lose it; and it is to be produced.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Your servant was then intrusted with the key of your box? I had the key.</p>
               <p>How was he to lock up your things? - I meant him to put them away in some drawers.</p>
               <p>Did you complain to any body there of it? - I mentioned it to my servant, and told him I had lost it.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it to the gentleman, at whose house you was? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260065"/>Did you mention it to Mr. Villiers? - I had suspicions of my own servant, who was a very idle fellow, and who has defrauded me.</p>

               <p>Did you advertise it as lost in Hertfordshire? - No.</p>
               <p>Not as being lost, I see (Looking at the advertisement) at Mr. Calvert's, or any particular place? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you had no idea it was stole then, I take it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And yet still you chose to advertise it, as a thing lost? - I did advertise it so.</p>
               <p>You seem to be tolerably careful of your things, is that always the case? - I suppose I am as careful as any other gentleman, I was told it was asserted at Bow-street, that I am very inattentive, which I think very extraordinary.</p>
               <p>Keep your temper Mr. Western, because in such cases as these it is not right to be out of temper, there is a case I want to mention to you about your absence of mind, you lost some money I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And when you left Enfield, you came back supposing your money to be left at Mr. Hamlinton's, and not knowing where it was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is a pretty good instance of carefulness; you came back, supposing you had left your money at Mr. Hamlinton's, and it was found in the inn yard I believe? I left some money at Mr. Hamlinton's, which I came back for, I had in my pocket when I set out from home, several guineas, I put about ten of them in my fob over my watch, and when I came to take out my watch, the paper came out with the money; which I did not recollect at the time; I happened to feel for it, and it was lost; I came back to the inn, and looked for it in the yard, and there it was found.</p>

               <p>Then you got into your chaise, and came to Ware, and there you lost your money a second time? - I put it into my boot.</p>
               <p>You did not recollect havi ng put it there? No, I did not.</p>
               <p>That is a pretty good instance of memory, you see Mr. Western? - That has very little to do with this case.</p>
               <p>It shews you know that you did not take care of your money? - I think it shews that I had some thought about it.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Villiers dressing at the time you went into his room? - Possible he might.</p>
               <p>You know it was just at breakfast time, you were both of you going a hunting? - I think he was dressing, but I think he was down before me, his servant was assisting him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you pulled off your boot in that room or not? - I think I pulled it off in my room, but I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Was the boot pulled off in Mr. Villier's room, or your room? - I think that is a thing very immaterial.</p>
               <p>I do not want your opinion at all? - Whether he pulled off my boot in his master's room, or whether with a boot jack, or whether it was in my room, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>If it was pulled off in his master's room, what business had he in yours? - He might come in out of civility.</p>
               <p>I ask you what business he had in your room, if the boot was pulled off in his master's room? - You may ask me any questions about it you please.</p>
               <p>I ask you what occasion he had to go into your room? - I will lay you a wager he was in my room.</p>
               <p>There is no bet on it you know? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Had he his boots on? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You think then merely out of civility, he came into your room? - Suppose you ask the prisoner, may be he recollects.</p>
               <p>Yes, he does recollect, he recollects he was not in your room? - I am positive the man was in my room.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I keep a silver smith's shop, in the Strand, No. 40, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260066"/> brought a gold chain, on the third day of this month, about eleven in the forenoon, he wanted to know if it was gold; he asked if it was gold; I asked him how he came by it, if he did not know whether it was gold or no, he said he found it in Germany; I told him it belonged to somebody in England, he said he bought it in Germany, I told him, let him buy it where he would, it was English gold, I asked him where he lived, he said he lived in the Strand, I told him this was the Strand; then he said he lived at St. Paul's, and we were going to St. Paul's with him to his master, but he would not go; then I said, I would take him before a Justice; we took him to Bow-street, then he told who his master was, and he mentioned different people first; his master was sent for, who bailed him, and took him home with him; the next morning after, he brought four more things to our shop belonging to the chain, that he had taken off the chain, a pump seal and mourning ring, a gold trinket and a gold key.</p>
               <p>What did he bring them there for? - He brought them there, and said they belonged to the chain, I had kept the chain, he left them at our shop and we sent them to Bow-street; he did not say what he brought them for.</p>
               <p>Did he give no account, and say why he brought them? - I understood his master sent them, because they belonged to the chain; the things I produce are the things he brought to me, and they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Your husband keeps this silver smith's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you speak German? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>When he came there with this ring and these trinkets, did not he desire they might be returned to the owner? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said the chain was his own.</p>
               <p>- Yes, but when he brought the trinkets? He said nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Why what were the trinkets to you, or you to the trinkets; was there nothing said I not a word? - Nothing at all, only he said they were belonging to the chain.</p>

               <p>Court to the Prisoner's Council. As the prisoner is a foreigner, - though I cannot consistent with the practice of the court, allow you to make a speech for him; yet you may state your facts to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I thank your Lordship; the prisoner went down with Mr. Villiers, to whom he was servant, to Mr. Calverts in Hertfordshire; and going down there, he found this chain with the other things belonging to it, he offered it to this silver smith in the Strand, to know whether it was gold or no; not to sell it, but to return it to the owner: as to the absence of mind, which has made the prosecutor so very angry with me, it is only to prove that when he thinks himself certain that the prisoner was in his room, he may be mistaken and have forgot, as he had done, in the cases I have referred to; I shall now call several witnesses of great respectability and credit to the character of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>The Hon. - VILLIERS, Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>This man I understand, was a servant of yours? - He came to me on the 20th of October last.</p>
               <p>What character had you with him? - I had two written characters in German, that was interpreted to me, of the highest recomendation of honesty, and fidelity to his master, he conducted himself with me, in all respects perfectly honest, he had repeated opportunities of taking all my wearing apparel, and likewise money that lay about, he had the keys of the drawers frequently in his power; I said but two days before this came out, I hoped nothing would oblige me to part with him, as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260067"/> was the best I ever had; I kept him in service after this, I pledged myself if he went off, he had frequent opportunities to go off; I told him he must wait till Mr. Western came to town, he said, he was clear he was innocent, but was only afraid I should dismiss him for having any thing without telling me of it; when the prisoner was dressing me at Mr. Calvert's, Mr. Western knocked at my door, and desired the assistance of the man to help him off with his boot; and as near as I can recollect, my man helped Mr. Western off with his boot in my room; I asked Mr. Western, if my servant could assist him further; and I said to him, go and ask Mr. Western, if you can assist him again; I was not forward in my dressing at all, but Mr. Western coming in, burried me excessively, at seeing him so forward; the man had not dressed my hair, I told him to make haste back, to dress my hair, I was the last person in the room at breakfast, and was accused of being very lazy that morning.</p>
               <p>Did you send him with the trinkets to the watch-maker? - No, I did not know of it, till Mr. Calvert told me of it, saying but how does he account for all the trinkets not being all together.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you leave your servant behind, when you went out a hunting, or did he go with you? - I left him at home.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner drop the hammer cloth on the 15th of January, between seven and eight he rushed by me with a bundle under his arm, he went about two yards from me, and I saw his face, I knew him before I followed him two or three steps, he made a bit of a run, I cross'd the way, thinking to have caught him in my arms, and after running about forty yards I headed him; I crossed the way again about four or five yards off, he perceived me, and threw down the bundle, and made his escape; I took up the bundle and followed him to Lamb-alley Bishopsgate-street, I cried out, stop him! and two butchers boys stopped him.</p>
               <p>Had you any information of this hammer cloth being lost, at the time? - No, only I looked upon him to be a suspicious person, I took him into custody, and the hammer cloth was advertised.</p>

            , then being the church-wardens of the parish of Enfield, without their consent. Gentlemen, by an act of parliament of the 17th of his present Majesty, made for dividing of Enfield Chace, there was a certain allotment of the Chace vested in the church-wardens of Enfield, and they are thereby made the owners of it, for the benefit of the parish; and they are incorporated by the same act of parliament, and are to be called a body politic, by the name of the church-wardens of the parish of Enfield; they are the church-wardens of the parish church of Enfield, in the county of Middlesex: Therefore by this act of parliament it is vested in them; so much for the crime, and so much for the conduct of the prosecutors. The facts to bring this charge home to the prisoners are shortly these: - On the 28th of December last, a watchman who was at his stand in a street called Baker's-street near Enfield town, observed a team with four horses go towards the Chace, he wished the parties a good night, but they made no answer; this was on a Saturday night, and it rather surprised this watchman to see a team with four horses go towards the Chace at that hour of the night. At the hour of four in the morning, as the watchman was crying the hour, he heard at a distance, a team coming along; after crying the hour for some little time he heard the team stop; this created a suspicion in his mind, after which he stood nearer to the highway, so as to see the team pass, and he saw it come past him; one man came before the team, walking a little way, another man held the fore horse of the team, and another was driving the team; he observed likewise, that the cart was loaded with a number of young timber trees, but who the men were, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260070"/> could not possibly tell; very soon after an alarm was raised, that these trees had been cut on this allotment belonging to the parish; some suspicions fell on Mr. Patrick, a search warrant was granted, and when they came to Mr. Patrick's house they found several young timber trees; and some trees likely to become timber trees, had been cut and sawed off. - Gentlemen, a person of the name of Hockett, having informed some of the overseers, that he knew something of the matter, the persons who went to search, cut off the end of the pieces of timber trees, they cut off that end, so as to make it tally with the stumps remaining in the earth; those trees that had been cut off, you will observe, they could not make tally; but the others which had been sawed off at the end, broke off at the end, they were taken to the place, and there they fitted exactly like an Exchequer tally: Upon this evidence you will have before you the particulars of the trees found in the prisoner's possession, the bits cut off, and those tallying with the stumps remaining in the ground; and this man Hockett will be produced to you, who was employed by Patrick himself, hired by him, to go to the Chace; and who together with Patrick and Pepper went to cut down these trees, and he will inform you, that they passed by the watchman, that he bid them good night, and that they returned no answer; that about four o'clock, hearing him call the hour of four, they stopped till he had done his cry, that he might go home to his box as they supposed he would; he will inform you that Patrick went before the horses, and that the others drove the team, as the watchman had observed, and that the watchman wished them a good night, but that none of them chose to answer him. Gentlemen, you will have this evidence of the accomplice fully corroborated in the strongest manner that such evidence can. The fact which is a very strong one of the property so taken, and so stolen from the Chace, and carried to the house of Patrick, will be fully proved to you; and also that they tallied exactly, so that there could be no mistake whatever. - Gentlemen, when these facts are thus proved to you by the witnesses that we shall call, it will be incumbent on Mr. Patrick to shew you where he got those trees, and unless he can make that out to your satisfaction, you will find the prisoners guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peckham, - My Lord, supposing for a moment, all that Mr. Silvester has stated to be true, I yet should trust under your Lordship's correction, that the prisoners ought to be acquitted, because I am supposing now that Mr. Silvester should prove, that the property of these trees was in the church-wardens of Enfield, pursuant to the act of parliament; we must likewise take under the act of parliament, that the churchwardens are trustees; but this indictment states, that the trees thus cut, are the property of

             the IIId. to make it a felony, for this act of parliament, for alloting the Chace does not make it so; and I understand this was after the division: the act of parliament has been particularly careful in speicfying the crime; it enacts, tha t</p>

               <p>"said Chace, before the sences, to be made</p>
               <p>"at his Majesty's expence shall be compleated,</p>
               <p>"shall be subject, and liable to</p>
               <p>"all such pains, penalties and punishments</p>
               <p>"such offenders are or would have been</p>
               <p>"subject, or liable to in case this act had</p>
               <p>"been made." But after the fences are made it runs thus: -</p>
               <p>"And in case any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260071"/> such offence or offences, shall be committed after the said fences shall be compleated, every such offender or offenders, shall be subject to all such suits, actions, damages, pains and penalties, as are provided by the laws and statutes of this realm, to be brought, given, imposed, or inflicted upon any person or persons, there committing the like offence or offences in the lanes, grounds, woods or coppices, being the private property of any of his Majesty's subjects." Now, your Lordship sees before the fences were made, it was all such pains, penalties, &amp;c. but after the fences are made, then they shall be subject to such actions, suits, &amp;c. The legislature has made a very clear distinction; but the first objection I take to be fatal.</p>

               <p>"then being the owners of the trees aforesaid:" why are these three persons the owners of the trees. The church-wardens are owners of the trees in trust; therefore unless I hear some reason assigned that I do not at present know, I must object to this indictment.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. What do you say to the first objection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. - My Lord, if the names of the church-wardens had not been mentioned, then the objection would have been, it is uncertain, we do not know who they are, the act of parliament vests it in the church-wardens of the said parish of Enfield for the time being; therefore at that time it is vested in them; but says Mr. Mingay, it is ex abundanter; then leave out the names, consider the names as surplusage, and you have them as church-wardens, but it was necessary to mention the names of these church-wardens, because it would be otherwise uncertain when the offence was committed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. - My Lord, I am on the same side with Mr. Silvester, and I conceive it to be necessary in all indictments, that it should be stated, in and upon whom the offence is committed: Now I conceive here, that the offence is committed on these persons so named; and if it left out that they were church-wardens, the indictment would not have been bad; is it necessary that I should set forth how I came by my estate? Sufficient it is that the law vests the estate in me; therefore we shall offer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260072"/> an act of parliament in evidence to substantiate the propriety of these people standing forth as owners of this property; we need not have stated the word church-wardens; but it is necessary for us to shew your Lordship that this estate is by act of law vested in those whom we describe as the parties interested in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. It is unnecessary as I have formed a clear opinion on one objection: If the act of parliament had stood single upon the first clause, which vests the property in the church-wardens for the time being, the indictment would have been clearly right; it is manifestly that which induced the mistake of the person that 
               <persName id="t17830226-40-person508">

             the indictment; it does all that is necessary under that clause, the act of parliament vests the property in the church-wardens of the parish of Enfield for the time being, and this indictment describes it to be the property of certain persons by name, stating them also to be the church-wardens for the time being: but the other clause puts entirely an end to this question; and I conceive wherever any description of men are incorporated, and have a corporate capacity, their natural capacity as to that is totally extinct; the law knows no such thing as

               <p>"then being," and make it "churchwardens of the said parish of Enfield," still it is not the description.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It is so in the second count.</p>
               <p>Court. The second count describes it technically the parish church of Enfield; but it is a description of the persons, and the property is laid to be in the persons; if an action was brought in the name of these people, they would be nonsuited, much more so in a criminal prosecution; the reason of a corporation suing and being sued is, that they have their property in that name, but it is impossible for a corporation to sue or be sued in their individual names; they have no individual capacity at all, it is extinct.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, as to the prisoner Dubois, there does not seem to me any evidence under the circumstances of this case to affect him with the fact of stealing; the pots are found in his cellar, and though in general where things are stolen; and they are found in a man's possession, if he gives no account of them, it is presumed that he stole them, yet where there appears to be another hand, as in this case, it takes off that presumption; his offence is that of receiving.</p>
               <p>N. B. He was afterwards tried for receiving goods, knowing them to be stolen, and found guilty. (See the last trial of this sessions.)</p>

               <p>Court. What do you sell them at? - The common price of standard moss roses is 1 s. a plant; we also missed between two and three dozen of mazerions out of the nursery.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of them? - The value of them is three pence a plant, that is the usual price.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you yourself see these things? - I saw them the day before.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - The afternoon.</p>
               <p>When you missed these mazerions and moss rose plants, did you observe whether the ground was fresh pulled up? - They plainly appeared to be pulled up by the roots, there had been rain in the fore part of the night, so that it might be seen that they had been tore up, and likewise the print of the shoe; I had seen them in the afternoon, and almost till dark, I was from time to time in this garden.</p>
               <p>Court. There was nothing missing over night? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you believe if these plants, and shrubs had been gone in the afternoon, that you must have had notice of it? - Certainly my Lord.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it that your man told you of the print of the shoe? - As soon as it was light, about seven in the morning; after I missed these plants I rather suspected it must be somebody that had worked for me, and knew my ground; and the prisoner having worked for me twice, and hearing he had sold some plants in the neighbourhood to one Ross, I had him apprehended the same morning, I found at Mr. Ross's two dozen mazerions and half a dozen standard roses; when the prisoner was apprehended he had not the same shoes on, but he had shoes at home with nails in, which were the same print as was in the ground, my servant has the measure of them, I can swear the plants are my property.</p>

               <p>Court. Had not you a pretty good bargain in these things? - If they had been properly taken up, they might have been a good bargain.</p>
               <p>Court. What would they have been worth then? - Ten or a dozen shillings I believe at least, but they were toin and sadly used.</p>
               <p>How did these plants appear to you to have been taken up? - I could not tell, they appeared by the roots to have been pulled up.</p>
               <p>If these plants had been yours, and you had properly taken them up, should you have dug them up or dragged them up? - I should certainly have dug them up, and very carefully too.</p>
               <p>What did you think of this matter when you saw these shrubs appeared to be pulled up by the roots? - I had no good idea of it, but I had bought things of the man in the open market before, which took off the suspicion off their being stolen: - I told the Justice I could buy the mazerions for 2 d. a plant out of the nursery, and that the moss roses were worth 1 s. a plant, if they had been taken up properly.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of January last, I was coming down Portland-street into John-street, between five and six, where the prosecutor lives, I observed a boy peeping through the shop window, which induced me to turn back to see whether any thing was going on that was criminal; in the passage I saw a man peeping in at the door of the shop, which is in the passage, and stooping down, leaning his hand on a piece of linen that was in the passage, and with his left hand pulled out a piece of linen which is here, the prisoner turned round to the right, I am sure it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen him before Mr. James? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing of a light in this passage? - There was a light in the further end that came from the shop door which had a glazed window.</p>
               <p>How far distant might you be from the prisoner when you stood at the passage door? - About three yards; I immediately seized him, and asked him what he was going to do with that linen, he had the linen in his left hand, and was coming out of the passage door, I seized him, and he dropped the linen, I could not make the gentleman of the house to hear; the prisoner had both his hands at liberty, and with his right hand he struck me a blow on the head, and got away instantly; I saw him again not many minutes after, he was brought back to Mr. Patten's house.</p>
               <p>Did you know him to be the same person that you saw in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Suppose he had not been taken and brought back to Patten's house, was the view that you had had of him in the passage sufficient to enable you to know him again? - I really think it was, I am sure I should have known him again, particularly as he has but one eye, which I took very particular notice of; I had him in my left hand a considerable time, and kept looking at him all the time.</p>

               <p>Court to Peach. Whose hand writing is that direction? - It is the hand writing of Mr. Capel, a clothier in Glocestershire, who was my correspondent, it was to come up by the waggon, this is but half the quantity.</p>
               <p>Did you ever receive any cloth corresponding to what you expected? - No, I did not, I had a letter from Mr. Capel informing me, that he had sent it on such a day, and I expected it at that time.</p>

I turned my back upon him every time I shewed him these goods, and the last goods I took down to shew him, he took a hat out of the window, and opened the shop door and went out, he bought nothing. I missed the hat immediately and followed him out; I returned again, having nobody in the shop, and fearing left he should have an accomplice, and the prisoner got clear off; I found the hat at Mr. Wood's in Old-street, the man that was in the shop gave the hat to another that was in the passage; this is not the man that was in the shop.</p>
               <p>(The hat deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any other man in the passage at the time or not? - My shop having many candles in it, and the passage<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260087"/> dark, I could not distinguish whether there was or not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going to my mother's, a man met with me, and asked me to buy a hat, he asked 3 s. I bid him half a crown, I gave him 3 s. and I was going to receive my wages, and I went immediately and pawned it for 2 s.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner is indicted for stealing a hat; the evidence against him is rather that of receiving it from somebody who did steal it, than stealing it himself; for unless you can go the length of inferring, that he was the person in the passage who took the hat immediately from the man in the shop, it is impossible to convict him of stealing it: It would be going a great deal too far to guess that he was the man in the passage, and we can do no more.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you know Mr. Belch's cart and horse? - Yes, he was on the wrong side of the way, and he gave the rein a bit of a touch, to let me come on the right side of the way.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Mr. Belch a neighbour of yours? - He is of the same business, I have no doubt of the horse and cart, I saw no more of him.</p>

               <p>Court. What made you think of attacking them both? - I am constable there, I thought it was not a proper place, as there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260088"/> is no poulterer near, I came back again, I looked in the hamper, there was nothing but straw, then they were both gone; I met the prisoner, I took him and shewed him the flat, I suspected they were stolen, I took him and the flat to the compter; my Lord Mayor said it should be advertised on the Monday: I left word at some of the poulterers, and Mr. Belch heard of it.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Belch deposes to the flat having I. B. on it.)</p>
               <p>Court. Why if that is visible it need not have been advertised? - There is I. B. on it, there were sixteen fat geese in it, my son brought me my cart and horse, he found it in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch.</p>

               <p>Court to Horne. Which way was you coming to town? - Up towards Leaden-hall-market from Mile-end, I saw him by Jewry-street.</p>
               <p>Is that the way from Lime-street to Gravel-lane? - Yes.</p>

            , with this bridle on it, at half past eleven, at the Cock in Tottenham Court Road, this was the 13th of February, the man asked me if the horse could stand that night, it was the prisoner at the bar, he came with the horse, he desired me to put him into the stable, and give him half a peck of corn and a little hay, and he should come and speak to my master in a minute or two, and he left the horse and went off, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have witnesses that I was in bed the same night this was done.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended the prisoner at the bar, I am one of the patrol lately appointed by Sir Sampson Wright, the patrol happened to go to Kilburn, I met this prisoner and some other people in company; I searched the prisoner, and I found this in his left hand pocket, it is not a pistol, it is only the appearance of a pistol; he said, he was going to Edgware, we took him into custody; the last witness immediately on seeing him again said, that is the man that brought the horse to our house.</p>
               <p>Court to Price. How long was the prisoner in the yard? - Only at the door, he gave me the horse, he stopped five minutes, not longer.</p>
               <p>At half past eleven, it was not light at that time? - There was a lamp over the door, I never saw him before, he was dressed as he is now, I can swear to him that he is the same person.</p>
               <p>(The bridle shewn to the first witness.)</p>
               <p>I know the bridle by the buckle</p>
               <p>Court. Is not it a common buckle? - There are others like it.</p>
               <p>Is there any particular observation that you ever made on this bridle, that enables you to swear to it again? - I know it by being broke, I have used it many times.</p>
               <p>What is there in that bridle that distinguishes it from any other old bridle that is broken? - I know it from an hundred.</p>
               <p>But if you do know it, you can give some reason for it, and some description that somebody else might know it by? - This was the bridle I gave him.</p>
               <p>What reason have you for being sure this is the same bridle? - I cannot know it any other way than this, I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>That young man knows no more of me, I never saw him before I saw him in Bow-street, the runner that took me has put him up to it, and bid him swear any thing that he could, and he might get 20 l. the people that I had as witnesses are gone home, some of the turnkeys told them my trial would not come on to night, and they are gone home.</p>
               <p>Court to Lawrence. Did you observe what sort of a horse the prisoner was upon when he robbed you? - A black horse.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, she looked after me when I was sick, and she was in distress, she was with me from the Saturday to the Wednesday, on the Wednesday morning she got up to light the fire, and went out to light a candle about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. What did she light the fire so late as nine o'clock in the morning? - The days were very short, and they set up very late as I was so ill, when she came in, she said, mistress, there lays a farthing on the table, may I take it for small-coal, I said, yes; she did not come back again, and I got a woman that slept with me to get up and seek for her; the woman looked for her stockings and apron, and they were gone: the prisoner never came back.</p>
               <p>What things of yours were missed? - When I got upright in bed, I could not find my shoes nor petticoat, and a long Bath cloak that I had to keep me warm in bed, and a clean shirt of my husband's, and a shirt of mine, and two caps, and a small table cloth; I never found any of my things, any otherwise than the Sunday fortnight following, I saw the prisoner with my petticoat on, and my shoes, near the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>How did you know they were yours, could you know your petticoat in the street? - It was a very moonlight night, I walked close by her, the petticoat had a new piece in behind, and it shined; she did not know me, I knew her, I did not stop her, I followed her to Westminster, there she was at a lodging house: I found one cap on her then, that was a month after I was robbed.</p>
               <p>But you cannot undertake to swear, meeting her in a moonlight night in the street, that the petticoat she had on, and the shoes were yours. - No otherwise than by the patch behind; she told the Justice the cap was mine, and she said, if I had had a thousand times more, she would have taken it with her; she behaved very rude before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she sober? - Yes; she told me she sold the shirt for two shillings to a Jew, and if I wanted the cloak, I might go to Rag-fair and look it.</p>
               <p>Were there any threats or promises used to make her confess? - When I saw her, I had no constable with me; I asked her, where the things were; and she swore bitterly many oaths I should not have them; I said, Polly, you should not have stripped me, you knew you left me stark naked, I had no other things to put on; she said, she knew that, that was the reason; there was twenty women in the place that threatened to cut my liver open.</p>

               <p>Court. That cellar, I suppose, was open to any body in the house? - Yes, I looked, and I could find no halfpence, when he came in, I taxed him with the robbery, he denied it at first, and at last owned it,</p>
               <p>When you taxed him with it, did not you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - No, in consequence of his owning it, I fetched a constable, but before he was apprehended, he went and took the money from that place.</p>
               <p>You told him where it was? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - Only that there was some hid in a cellar, and that we knew what it was.</p>
               <p>Did not you say it was hid in a hole? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did neither you or Mr. Feathers shew him where that money was? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor say where it was? - No, the boy at last pointed to where it was, and said, it was there; I asked him, how he came by that silver; he said, he had changed some of the halfpence for silver with a woman that is now an evidence upon this trial; I asked him, what he had done with the other part of the property, he said, he had bought a handkerchief and a pair of shoes and stockings, and had spent the other part: when he was detected, he went into the necessary, and threw something down, which by the found was money.</p>

               <p>Did you hear either of the other prisoners say any thing about this pig? - No, I did not, I went away, and came home, I told two or three people about our place, that there was a hog so and so, and I thought it was stolen; and I was persuaded to go and buy this hog, and get these chaps to bring it down, I went and agreed with Roberts for fifteen shillings, and they told me they could not bring it down till it was dark, there were six or seven playing at cards.</p>
               <p>Were the other two prisoners there at that time? - Yes, they were all together.</p>
               <p>Was this discourse about the pig, and agreement for it in their presence? - Yes, they were all together; I told them to bring it to Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Which of them was it that said, they could not bring it till it was dark? - Roberts, and I think Wenham, they gave me no reason why, this was in the middle of the day about one; all the three prisoners brought down the hog, after it was dark, tied in a string, they drove it before them, I told them to put it into the shop, and they did so; I had an officer waiting from Bow-street, and he took them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER WENHAM's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I have to say in my defence so far as this here: I had the misfortune to break my thigh; my mother lives in St. Giles's, to be sure she is a very poor woman, and all my friends; I went to Roberts's house, he was playing at cards, and I sat down, and played with him; and while I was playing, Mr. Marks came, and Roberts went out with him, at night Roberts asked me to go with him, as he was going to drive a pig, the liquor had got in my head, as I had not drank any for a twelvemonth, then I was taken up.</p>
               <p>PRISONER ROBERTS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This here pig came into the yard about twelve on Sunday night, and it laid there for three days, so I asked one and another, whether any body had lost such a thing, all about Tottenham Court Road, nobody owned it; so then Marks came and asked me to sell the pig, I asked him a guinea and an half, he offered me fifteen shillings for it, he bad me to drive it home to his house; he came twice to our house after the pig, the first time he asked me to take a shilling earnest, I would not take any money, without I had it all together.</p>
               <p>PRISONER ALLEN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was in Roberts's house playing at cards, and had some liquor, and Mr. Marks came in about a pig, and Roberts asked me to go down with him, and then the gentleman asked me, if I would take the money, I said, I had nothing to do with the money, and pointed to Roberts, who, I said, belonged to the pig; then I was secured.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Allen called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any thing particular how he was to pay for the candles? - I did not chuse to let him have the candles without the money, he had only twenty-six shillings, and a few halfpence, a man came with the prisoner, and he sent him for the remainder of the money, but before he returned, we were gone to the Justices.</p>

               <p>Did you observe whether the prisoner took up all the five shillings from the counter? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether there was any other sixpence besides that sixpence that you rubbed? - Yes, I recollect that there were two sixpences, the rest were shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to Dixon. Did you find no more on him than the two sixpences? - No, the next witness will account for the other money, there was no other money about him than the two sixpences; the magistrates granted a warrant to search his house, I went to his house.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - Mr. Bird, but whether any body else was with me I do not know, I found these two shillings in his wife's pocket, I searched the bureau, and I found some sixpences.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You will forget that Gentlemen, about any thing that was found in his wife's pocket, that has nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Who opened the bureau? - I waited till his little boy went to the office, and brought the key from him, I left a person in the shop, while I went up stairs, and the key was come back, when I went down stairs again, the bureau was opened, and I found these four sixpences, and two shillings, they are all bad.</p>
               <p>Court. Keep them distinct. - I found nothing else up stairs, or in the house but what I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you search in any trap door? - Yes, my Lord, I did, and Mr. Bird was up there himself, I helped him up myself, I could see in the trap door, and there was nothing there then.</p>
               <p>Court. You know where these things were found, I suppose? - I do not know my Lord; I was not there when they were found.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not go up your self? - I did not my Lord, I saw Mr. Bird in the room, I desired him to go to the further end, and he did, he went all over the room, he found nothing.</p>
               <p>Bird. I was up my Lord, and looked, but there was nothing.</p>
               <p>Court to Dixon. Pray had you Mr. Bird in your eye the whole time; did you see him all the time? - Till he opened a door at the other end, then I came down.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he was out of your sight? Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this man committed, or held to bail after that? - He was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You have nothing else to produce but that money, that was taken out of the bureau? - Nothing else, only the sixpence that was found in his pocket.</p>

What room did the cock loft communicate to? - There was a trap door went up to two other houses adjoining to it, I found the cock loft boarded, floored; but there was nothing in it, I went out of the trap door on the houses, I searched the lead gutters, and every place, but could find nothing, and nothing there was; I searched it very carefully, as much as possible, no man more so; the trap door that went up to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260111"/> the cock loft, was out of a bed room, I trod on a small table, and Mr. Dixon gave me a lift.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>When was it you went to Butler's house? - On Friday the 17th of January; Clark, Jealous and Macmanus were with me.</p>
               <p>Was he at home? - He was in the shop when we went in.</p>
               <p>What shop does he keep? - A clothes shop, sells ready made clothes; Clark told him we were come to search his house, and he stopped with the prisoner, while we proceeded up stairs; that is Jealous and me, I do not know whether Macmanus went up or not; in a bed room up two pair of stairs, a back room, I found a kind of step ladder, I then looked about, and I observed a trap door.</p>
               <p>Court. You had heard of this trap door before, had not you? - We were informed, my Lord, that there was a trap door, I went up through the ladder, into the cock lost, there I found this press fixed, it is a boarded lost.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Jealous go with you? - He followed me, this press was fixed upon a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260112"/> bench, near to another trap door, which was almost at the further end of the cock lost, within about two yards of the further end; I believe it was that trap door that went upon the leads.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the press fixed in the cock lost? - Yes, within about two yards of the further end, there was the cutters in it, which are still, and every thing complete for cutting.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray, Sir, how was this press fixed? - It was fixed upon a bench, which was fixed by feet and stays into the ground, through the bench are these screws.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was screwed into the bench? - The press was fixed on the bench by screws, and the legs of that bench fixed to the floor, the legs were nailed to the floor.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose they are obliged to have it quite tight? - Yes, my Lord, there were other stays besides the feet to keep it steady, it was the other trap door that gave us light.</p>
               <p>Court. So that when that trap door was fast, the cock loft was quite dark? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. But some light I suppose would come in from the other trap door? - No, my Lord, it shut very close, the first trap door; at the top of the first trap door that opened from the bed room, there were four iron bolts within side, one at each end, and one at each side.</p>
               <p>Had you a candle with you, when you went in? - The further trap door was a little open.</p>
               <p>Court. You have given a description of the manner, in which this bench was fixed, did it appear to have been fixed in that manner like a bench standing for some time? - No, my Lord, the legs of the bench, and the bench appeared to be new, or nearly new.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not mean to be understood, as if it was set up that day? - No, my Lord, but it appeared to be new work, but I do not apprehend it was set up that day.</p>
               <p>Court. As for that engine I suppose it is taken away presently? - In one minute, only unscrewing these two screws.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any other bed rooms in the house? - I only went into that.</p>
               <p>Do you know who slept in that room? - The prisoner and his wife.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - Their things were in it, and he said that he had lost his knee buckle, and sent his boy to look for it while we were there.</p>
               <p>What did you find there? - In the sieve that lay just by the cutter were these blanks, and this

               <p>Prisoner's Council. This was all you found in that appartment? - There were tools for putting them up, a hammer and nails.</p>
               <p>There were dies then in this room, that were calculated to be made use of for the making of buttons? - So Clarke told me.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing more? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Where did you find these? - On the cock loft floor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That instrument would equally serve with dies fixed for cutting buttons, as for cutting any thing else? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Court. How many buttons did you pick up there? - I found four.</p>
               <p>(Four buttons produced.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You went to this house of Butler? - Yes, I did, I took the prisoner into custody, at his house, I think it was the 17th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260113"/> January, he was walking at the door, my information running, that there was a press up two pair of stairs, in a place that went out of his bed room, I took him up two pair of stairs into his bed room, and I searched him.</p>
               <p>What did you find on him? - Two shillings.</p>
               <p>Are they good or bad? - They are bad. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations on these shillings? - No, I did not, they are not cut out from such tools as these, they are cast.</p>
               <p>Have you seen all the other shillings? - I have not, (the shillings shewn to Clarke) these are all cast.</p>
               <p>Explain to us the use and nature of this machine. - This machine is generally used for cutting out round blanks of any sort by the force of this fly, and this screw working up and down, every time it moves up and down it forces out a round blank.</p>
               <p>Look at these. - These are called cutters, they put the metal between, and whenever that screw turns round, it forces out a piece of copper, or metal, or any thing else.</p>
               <p>Has that been used? - Yes, it has.</p>
               <p>Court. Which cutter do you speak of? They have both been used.</p>
               <p>What is the operation of cutting? - They are cut out into round blanks without impressions, and wherever they are cast, the impression is squeezed into the sand, and it leaves either the impression of the man's or the woman's head.</p>
               <p>Then in casting money that is not of any use? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You say this machine may be used for an innocent purpose? - It is possible it may.</p>
               <p>Look at these four buttons. - Here are two that have been made by a button maker, and two that have not, these two have been made for a deception, they are not made by a button maker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. But yet they appear to be buttons. - Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>You mean today, that the prisoner is not a good button maker.  - He may be learning.</p>
               <p>Court. That is, these two were made by a man that did not understand button making. - Not a doubt of it, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prosecution. When they are made with a fly, how is it done then? - Then they are what they call blanks, without any impressions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That instrument would answer the purpose of a button maker, would not it? - It would.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. We have had many trials here, what has been the usual method that has appeared to the Court of making of silver? - The usual method of making silver has been by casting.</p>
               <p>Is there any other new way now?</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask him that, altho' whenever I have seen Mr. Clarke, I never heard him too forward.</p>

               <p>Court to Clarke. What is the value of such a machine? - I should suppose about four guineas, or four guineas and an half.</p>
               <p>Court. It ought to be proved that this instrument was in the prisoner's possession criminally and knowingly; I do not conceive that the bare having that instrument in the house is criminal he must have it for a criminal purpose; therefore you must give evidence of the criminal intention; do not presume a man into high treason.</p>

               <p>Court. What time of the day was you with him? - The fore part of the day, it may be ten or eleven, I cannot say to the hour, but it was before dinner, I was with him above half an hour, we had a pint of beer, he told me to come the next morning and they should be cleaned, I came the next morning to the same place, and they told me he was gone to clean them, in Fleet-market, I went down there to him, and he was at work cleaning them, that was before nine o'clock, or between nine and ten, I stopped while he cleaned three hilts, I suppose it took him an hour and half, or two hours; he went from there to fetch me some swords, I staid for his coming back, he did not return, and I heard he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Court. How was he dressed; - He had a great coat on, when he was at work at the wheel, and I believe he had nothing under it but a waistcoat, and his sleeve was tied up, with either list or garter; he always bore a very good character, I have dealt with him for many hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>What were they? - I suppose Clarke knows.</p>
               <p>They were dies? - I fancy they were dies, I only saw them at a distance, I cannot remember.</p>

               <p>Because at first you expressed some doubt whether it was the prisoner or Parker? - I am almost sure, I can take upon me to swear it was him.</p>
               <p>But do not stretch? - I am sure, it was him; the things in the room appeared to be filled for coining lately, but were shook out.</p>
               <p>Court. The sand was not in the flask when you found it? - No, there was a great deal about it, but it was knocked out; there were 200 people, and the alley was full.</p>

               <p>This man you say asked to go up stairs, what did he say? - The other asked for his hat and shoes, I do not recollect that this man asked for any thing.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you with him on the 6th of December? - Yes; I was at the White Horse in Covent Garden, the prisoner came and asked me to take a walk, we went down Southampton-street, and when we had got about fifty or sixty yards, he met with a boy; he said, here he is; what conversation passed between them, I do not know, but when we came to <placeName id="t17830226-84-crimeloc453">Northumberland House</placeName>

I judged he had secreted the Persian; two of the hats my wife gave away, and the rest I sent to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>How near was he when the boy delivered the box to you? - About twenty yards, it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. So when you had persuaded this boy to part with the box, and put it down, he went away, and after that it was, that Barew came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was dark, you say? - It was.</p>
               <p>In what situation are you at present? - What situation! I have a small matter to live on, thirty pounds a year.</p>
               <p>How did you get at it? - I have it from a paper mill that my brother keeps.</p>
               <p>Was that paper mill when you was in the army? - That is no rule.</p>
               <p>How many regiments have you deserted from? - That is not what I came upon, that business I will not tell you.</p>
               <p>Then you only acknowledge to have deserted from one regiment? - That is no rule, I am come here on facts.</p>
               <p>How long ago was it that you made this desertion, will you tell me that? - No, I will not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260123"/>Are you a married man or single? - That is no rule, I am not a married man.</p>
               <p>How came you to say you had a wife just now? - I suppose I have a companion the same as other people may have.</p>
               <p>I suppose that is of a piece with all your other evidence. - I have no business to tell you.</p>
               <p>The case is then that you have no wife; how long may you have been acquainted with Barew? - Too long; thirteen years.</p>
               <p>And you met together at the public house this night? - Yes, we have met together twelve or thirteen years ago about business that has not been very reputable, and I have shifted my lodgings many times to get rid of him.</p>
               <p>Well, now Sir, one question if you will resolve me, you will oblige me, merely to satisfy my curiosity; how came you to be struck with such compunction as to send to Bow-street? - I will not tell you.</p>
               <p>Then I am to seek in vain for the principle of your compunction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That I took for granted when I first held conversation with you: what sort of night was this? - I cannot say what sort of night, whether it was a rainy, or a fair night.</p>
               <p>What conversation did you hold with this little boy? - Only just took the box, and I told him to put it down, and to go back again, and make all the haste he could, the boy pitched the box down and set off about his business, then when the prisoner saw the boy set the box down, he came up; whether the boy saw him or not, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. There was something about these hats being sent to Bow-street, you must tell me about that, though you would not tell that gentleman; how came you to send them to Bow-street? - I was taken into custody, not for this charge, upon that I told them I wanted to be rid of the acquaintance, and this was the only way I could discharge it.</p>
               <p>So your dislike to your acquaintance commenced upon your being taken into custody then? - No, it was not upon that, it was upon something else, it was about the desertion that has been mentioned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. So you amuse yourself now and then with stealing hats? - I could not help it, I happened into this company at first.</p>
               <p>You seem an older man than the prisoner, did the young man lead the old one astray, or the old one the young? - I do not know, I believe his character is pretty well known.</p>

             and Gedeliah Gatfield; I was sent with a parcel, and pasling near Hungerford-street, I was accosted by a man, who asked me, if my name was not Billy Cox; I think he is most like the prisoner at the bar; the box was directed to Mr. Cuthbert at Hadley, we crossed the way together, he wished me a good night, and I saw no more of him: when I came to the Crown in Princes-street, I saw another man, and he said, had not I got a box directed so and so; and I said, I had, and he bad me put it down, that is most like this person Bage.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body near when you delivered it? - I did not take notice, I cannot say to the contents of the box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Little lad, what time in the evening was it when you first met the person that asked you the question? - About six or a little later, it was dark, I walked with him as far as Northumberland gateway; I shewed him the direction, he went up the Golden Cross gateway and wished me a good night; I think it was about a month or more before we heard of the hats again.</p>
               <p>Did you give an account of that robbery that night? - I did not give them an accurate account, I was afraid.</p>
               <p>You did not give them any description of the person? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were you carried? - I went to Bow-street, there I saw Sir Sampson Wright, but I did not see the persons, neither of them, I saw them both the second time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260124"/>What message was brought you when you was told that you should see the robbers at Bow-street? - I was told I was to go to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>What for? - About these persons, I expected to see them, when I came there, I was shewn them.</p>
               <p>What these men? - Yes, the second time.</p>
               <p>And then you thought they were the people that had served you this trick? - I was desired by Sir Sampson Wright to look round the room, and tell which was the man.</p>
               <p>It was darkish when you was accosted by the first man, it was still darker when the second spoke to you? - It was lighter by the lamps in the gateway of the inn.</p>
               <p>Court. There was light enough for the man, whosoever he was, to read the direction.</p>
               <p>How many persons were there in the room? - I think there were about a dozen.</p>

            , I sent a parcel by the last witness on the 6th of December, it contained the things mentioned in the indictment, they were my property, and my partner's; I have seen the hats since, I had a message from Bow-street about a month since, I was informed that there were two people taken up, and one of them had made a discovery, I went with the boy to Sir Sampson Wright, he examined the boy, and made some minutes, and we came away, he said I will send and let you know, and will be obliged to you if you will come up when the man is here; I went again with the boy, and there was some of the goods, he desired me to look them over; in one of the hats there was my mark, the chip hats were not marked, I cannot swear that they were packed in that box, because the same hats are in all the haberdasher's shops, one of the hats had my mark, I am quite sure that one was mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When he came back he did not give you any accurate account of this transaction? - He said a gentleman desired him bring a dozen more, and that he bad him put down the box.</p>
               <p>Did he say what sort of person? - He said he was quite a gentleman, and had a drab coat on and boots, and a whip or a stick in his hand, so I sent the porter back with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the boy mention to you the circumstances? - He mentioned to me all the circumstances he has told now, he was very accurate in what he said, the hats were left in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see that hat that was marked? - In Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Was this prisoner there then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any body here that can say where these hats were found, and how they came to Bow-street? - I do not know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Walter. Are you sure the elderly man, the witness, is the man that took the box from you? - I think he is, I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the prisoner is the man that looked at the directions? - I am not sure to him any more than the other, I believe him to be the man, but I am not perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him, did you say that you believed him to be the man? - I expressed a doubt as I do now, he had a round hat on.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Bage has been evidence for the crown twice before now, he swears against me because I would not assist him with a sum of money, I have had a writ against him for this six months, and never could appre hend him, it is nothing but mere malice, I beg my witnesses may be called.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. It is better for you not to examine those witnesses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my council.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, where more persons than one confederate together to commit a felony, every one of those persons who is present to give assistance at the time the felony is committed, is equally guilty; where more people than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260125"/> one go into a shop to steal goods, one person alone steals them, but the rest are all guilty: In the same manner, where several persons go together to commit a burglary, and some of them enter the house, and others stand at the door, and never go into the house, in point of law, the persons who stand without, and are ready to aid and assist those that go in, are considered equally guilty of the capital part of the offence. The difference between aiding and abetting as accessary or principal, consists in being present or not. You will observe likewise that with respect to the evidence of accomplices, though the law admits, for the sake of detecting offences, an accomplice to be examined under certain circumstances, yet the humanity and wisdom of the law will not permit any man to be convicted upon the single evidence of an accomplice unconfirmed by other material facts, let that evidence be ever so strong, for such a person is not deserving of that degree of credit, that upon his single testimony any man's life or liberty should be taken away; that being the general law with respect to accomplices, I think it but justice to the prisoner to add, that I have seldom seen an accomplice in a court of justice that deserves less credit than Bage.</p>
