I am a draper, of Upper Hilton Street, Manchester—in October, 1880, I was staying with the prisoner Rooney at his private residence, 133, Ladbroke Grove Road, Notting Hill—he was not then married; he was assistant manager in his brother Robert's ware house in Bishopegate Street, who trades in brushes, combs, and fancy articles—Edward Rooney had some machinery lying in some railway arches at Brixton; I knew of no business transactions or business engagements that he was connected with of his own—while I was staying with Edward Rooney he asked me to make out upon the invoice form pro<lb/>duced, an invoice charging goods to Mr. Whiteley; I made out this invoice dated November 1st (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), copying the items from a small slip of paper furnished to me by Edward Rooney—I also addressed an envelope to Mr. Moorhead at his private address, 1, Chippenham Road; the invoice was enclosed in that—shortly afterwards I made out a state<lb/>ment of account, dated November 5th, upon this form headed "James Vaughan and Co., 41, Coburg Road"—that was by Edward Rooney's direction—I addressed it to Mr. Whiteley, Counting House, Westbourne Grove—I saw this cheque for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I endorsed it at Edward Rooney's request "J. Vaughan and Co.," to whom it was made payable—I also receipted this account as it appears, "James Vaughan and Co.," at E. Rooney's request—I also made out this invoice of December 4th from items on a slip of paper, to Mr. Whiteley—I addressed an envelope for it to Moorhead at Chippenham Road—I made out a statement of account and addressed an envelope to Mr. Whiteley, Westbourne Grove, Count<lb/>ing House—shortly afterwards I saw this cheque for 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Decem<lb/>ber 14th from Mr. Whiteley to Vaughan and Co.; I endorsed it at Rooney's request, and receipted the account in the same name—this is a draft of the invoice—I was then out of employment—I found employment early in 1881 at the City of London Stores in Newgate Street; they went into liquidation, and I was again out of employment—in May I saw Edward Rooney again by appointment at Spiers and Pond's Restaurant, Mansion House Station—I made out two invoices; the items for one invoice were supplied to me on a piece of paper by Edward Rooney, and</p>

               <p>the other by Mr. Welsh—Welsh, was present at the interview; I knew him before; he was engaged with Edward Booney at his brother's warehouse—on the completion of the invoice made out from the memo<lb/>randum supplied by Mr. Welsh, Edward Eooney asked him if he had allowed for the 5 per cent, discount—Rooney said "No" he had not remembered it—I tore that invoice up, and another was made out with an addition to the prices to cover the 5 per cent.—these are the two invoices, dated May 25th—I shortly afterwards made out two more invoices, duplicates of the former one in every respect except the altera<lb/>tion in the date to June 1st—that was also at the Mansion House Station, and about the last week in May—I also made out a statement of account for those two invoices, dated May 31st—I shortly afterwards saw this cheque of June 3rd for 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Whiteley—I had heard Mr. Welsh ask Edward Booney whether it had arrived; that was while walking in the street; Booney said it had not arrived—Mr. Welsh was going for a holiday, and Edward Booney was going to lend him some money rather than Welsh draw on his salary—I endorsed that cheque "J. Vaughan and Co."—I returned to Manchester after that, and have been there since—I did not know Yaughan and Co., nor did I inquire; I simply thought it was a name adopted for trade purposes in the ordinary course of business—I never went to Coburg Road—Edward Booney said his writing would be known at Whiteley's, as he was having frequent intercourse with them on behalf of his brother, and there was a possi<lb/>bility of its being recognised—Edward Booney was not married when I last saw him in May or June of this year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal warder at Coldbath Fields—on 2nd October I was patrolling past the cell the prisoner was in—I had got about four cells from his when I heard a scuffle—I turned round and saw Moreham in the act of shoving the prisoner towards his cell—Hewitson afterwards made a complaint to me, and I went into the prisoner's cell—he had a knife in his hand—I asked what he was doing with his knife in his hand—he made no reply—he seemed to be angry—I said, "You had better give the knife to me," and I took it from him—he did not attempt any violence towards me—he had been with me the last time he was in, and nearly all the time—he had caught a mouse, which he said had got through the ventilator—I never saw it—this was a month previous to this affair—Assistant Warders Barefoot and Foster took the mouse away—they are not here—the prisoner showed it up his arm in the yard, and made the other prisoners commit themselves by laughing at it—he would not part with it, and they had to take him into his cell—I examined the cell door—I found no new marks; not even a scratch.</p>

               <p>Street, London Eoad—I knew the prisoner for some time by the name of Walter Tait—in October last he brought me a New Zealand bond for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't remember the number of it—it was produced before the Magistrate—he wanted to borrow 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it, and asked me to lend it him—he had borrowed money of me before—I lent him the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, and he gave me an I 0. U for the sum, leaving the bond with me—in the early part of December last year I saw him again, and asked him to repay the loan—he said it was not convenient for him to do so, but he asked me to give him a letter of introduction to my bankers, the National Provincial Bank—he said he would open an account there, and get a further advance upon the bond, and repay me out of it—I gave him that introduction, and he gave my name as a reference—the manager wrote to me for a reference, and I answered the letter, and the prisoner opened an account there—he did not get the advance—he told me they did not care about the security—I then gave him a reference to the Imperial Bank—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I wrote to the manager, and the prisoner opened an account there—he called on me and said that he told the manager I had lent him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., instead of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I think he gave as a reason, that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. seemed rather small on such a large security—he handed me a cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed by himself, payable on the delivery of the bond, which I was to present to the bank the following day—I did so, handed the clerk the bond for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he handed me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the cheque—next day the prisoner called on me, and I handed him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the difference between the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was due to me and the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid me interest at the rate of 6 per cent.—when he originally asked me for the loan on the bond he did not tell me where the bond came from—he did not say anything about it—he said when he applied for the loan that the bond was settled on his wife, and that was the reason why he could not sell it, although he could get an advance on it.</p>

On the 13th—I remember receiving a letter from the prisoner, but I do not recollect the date; it was lent to the Treasury at the time of the prosecution, and we have not seen it since; we were requested in that letter not to collect the coupons as he was going to redeem the bonds afterwards; it was signed in the usual way, "Walter Tait"—towards the middle or end of January we wrote to his address, Victoria Chambers, and got no reply—all the boards were produced before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statements before the Magistrate. Kun% says:</hi> "Mr. Black owed me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he came to me at the house where I was employed and wrote me out that cheque, and said "You can get that cashed," and then he went away and left me, and I did not see him again. I have changed several cheques with Mr. Oake and nothing has ever been wrong. I did not know but what everything was right with this cheque. I have no witnesses." <hi rend="italic">Black says:</hi> "I utterly deny what Kunz has said; beyond that I reserve my defence."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Kunz's Defence.</hi> As we left the chapel on Sunday morning Black handed this letter to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said "Copy that and let me have it back." I handed it to the chiet warder, who handed it to the governor of the gaol, and you can see by that how Black signs his name. In that he wants me to give false evidence not only as to myself, but as to Mr. Oake, making out that he is a betting man; but I have never had any transactions with him in my life, but I have used the house. Black owed me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He often came to my premises where I was at work, and on 3rd September I actually borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for him. He said "I shall be able to pay you next week," and he came and said "Have you pen and ink? I got it, and he pulled out his cheque-book and gave me this cheque, and I got it changed at Mr. Oake's, and it turned out to be wrong. The last thing I should have thought of would be robbing the man of the money. I gave the paper to the warder directly Black handed it to me, and he signed my name instead of his own.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Brown Bear, Leman Street, White<lb/>chapel, when I am in London—I deal in German canaries, which I bring over to this country—I have sold canaries to the male prisoners three or four times, and Morris has been with them twice or three times—Davis went by the name of George Davis, 86, Wickham Street, Lambeth—I only knew Onley as <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>—I once asked Davis if Morris was his wife, and he said "Yes"—on 2nd September Davis and Onley came in and Davis handed me this letter: "November 1st, 1881. Dear Sir,—Can you get me some good German canaries? I can do with 50 or I can do with 100; you can send 50 cocks and 50 hens; I will forward money. Frederick Morris, teacher of music and foreign languages, Catherine Villas, Rochester, Kent"—Davis said that he had no money to pay for them, but should like very much to fill up the order; he asked me if I would send them up—I said "I will see what I can do," and said "Who is Morris?"—he said "Morris keeps a big store; one side of it is fixed up with music, and the other is fixed up with fancy cages for birds, and it is laid out with fancy tiles, and is a splendid place; that it was established in 1860, and that he had 400 children to instruct in music and foreign languages, and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> said that he had sent Morris a dog and had received the money for it the next day—next morning I received this telegram: "Rochester, 9.5 a.m. From Francis Morris, Catherine Villas, Star Hill, Rochester, to Mr. Thege, Brown Bear, Leman Street, Whitechapel. Please send 200 hens and 100 males this night to Chatham; will meet train; cash sent at once"—in consequence of that I placed 300 canaries next day in 203 cages, went by train to Chatham, and took them to Catherine Villa, Rochester—a boy named Bourne came out of the house as I approached and gave me this note, saying that a lady had left the house and given him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to stop there and hand it to me. (<hi rend="italic">This was from Francis Morris, telling the witness to go to Mr. Marsh' s, 49, High Street, New Brompton, and Mr. Morris would be there to pay him.</hi>)—I went with the boy to New Brompton, four miles off, leaving the birds at Catherine Villa, and found Mr. Marsh in a chemist's shop, but found no trace of Morris—I then returned to Catherine Villa and saw Mrs. West, the landlady, but the birds had gone, cages and all—I went with Mrs. West to Strood Station, and found the birds and cages there, labelled for Meopham—a little while after that the prisoner Morris was found hiding on the plat<lb/>form with a child; a policeman fetched her; I recognised her and she was detained—the birds were worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took them down to Rochester on the faith of the letters and on the representations made by Davis and Onley—I afterwards went to Wickham Street, the address Davis gave me—there were a lot of birds there which I believe to be what I had sold him previously—he had given me part of the money only; I do not know whether I shall get the rest.</p>

I don't know Mrs. Morris; have you got Joe?"—I said "No"—he said, "He is as bad as I am, and has had as much to do with it as I have; in two caught"—I showed him this note marked "A," and he said, "I took that note to Mr. Thege; Jos, like me, thinks you can't touch him; have you been to my house?"—I said "Yes"—he said, "I did not leave there till 4 or 5 'clock; Joe wanted to come with me, but I thought it would cost too much money; so I came down to see her myself; Joe is waiting at Victoria for me to come back; what have you done with the child? I do not know why I should bother about other people's kids; she is not my wife; I thought the canaries were there as I had not heard anything"—a third class railway ticket from Strood to Cannon Street, dated 3rd November, which had been taken from him, was handed to me—I brought him to London on Sunday, 6th—on Monday, 7th, between 8 and 9 p.m. I saw Onley with a woman at London Bridge Station—they went from there to South<lb/>wark</p>

I am 13 years old, and live at 5, Bell Lane, Rochester—on Thursday, 3rd November, I was at the top of Bell Lane—Morris spoke to me, and said "Are you out of place?"—I said "I don't go to school, and I have nothing to do"—she said "Come to Chatham Station with me at 3 o'clock?"—I said "Yes"—I went with her to Mrs. West's; we got there about 2.50—she told me to go upstairs and look out of the window, and watch for a man who would bring some birds, and when he came I was to give him a note, and take him to High Street, New Brompton; she gave me the note produced—I saw her write it—she then went out; she promised me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but did not give it me—I went upstairs, waited for the man, looked out at the window, and saw Mr. Thege come half an hour after she left with a quantity of birds—I went down and opened the door to him as she told me—he left the birds, and walked with me to 49, High street, New Brompton; that is a long way—we could not find Mr. Morris there, and we returned to Mrs. West's—the birds were the gone <hi rend="largeCaps">HENRY WILLIS</hi>. I am manager to Mr. Marsh, a chemist, of 48, High Street, New Brompton; he has been abroad about 15 months—on 3rd November Mr. Thege and Bourne came there between 5 and 6 o'clock, and spoke to me—I knew nothing of the purchase of any canaries—I had not authorised anybody to send for the birds—I did not know Mr. Thege.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter of 96, Princes Street, Notting Hill—upon the morning of 11th October, about 12.30, just after midnight, I was in Lonsdale Mews with the prisoner's wife—we were going to her cousin's—I did not see the prisoner, but an we were going up the steps of the cousin's house, he jumped upon me and I fell back on my head, he on the top of me—while on the ground he struck me several times about the head and face, I don't know what with—he was very excited—I don't remember his saying anything—he went away with his wife—I was taken to the house of the cousin, Mrs. Street, and from there to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I trade as Bramston and Co, army contractors and water roofers, 18, York Road, Islington—the prisoner was a clerk in my employment up to Saturday, 5th November—I wrote some letters on 29th October, which were handed to him for posting on 31st; some of them contained cheques for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and so on; the cheque for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in favour of Messrs. Bevington and Sons, dated 1st November, was the largest—I placed that in an envelope with their account, fastened it, and addressed it to Messrs. Bevington; I placed it with the other letters in the prisoner's charge to be stamped and posted—on or about 8th November I received a communication from Messrs. Bevington's traveller, also a letter following upon that, in consequence of which I made inquiries at my bankers, and I received from them this cheque, bearing the endorsement of Bevington and sons; to the best of my belief that is in the prisoner's handwriting—he was under notice to leave at this time, and his time would have been up on Satur<lb/>day, the 5th—no other person in my office would be likely to know the amounts of the different cheques except the foreman, Mr. Watkins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cheque was drawn by myself on Saturday, 29th October—the amounts of the cheques were read over to the prisoner on the 31st from the counterfoils, in order that they might be entered into my cash-book on 1st November—I produce my cash-book; the first 14 entries are in the prisoner's writing, including this one—the letters for posting were put on a desk in charge of the prisoner, with others that he had been writing; no one would have access to them, except the fore<lb/>man and the prisoner—the desk is in the office close by the door—a lad would post the letters; he is not here, but this letter was never posted—I said before the Magistrate that I would not pledge myself to this endorsement being the prisoner's writing, but I have no doubt in my own mind about it; here is his writing in the book, which can be com<lb/>pared.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ashier in the London and County Bank, Caledonian Road branch—this cheque was presented at the bank between half-past 3 and 4 on 1st November—I believe the prisoner to be the person who presented it—he struck me as being a tall man, without whiskers; that was the description I gave—I saw seven or eight persons at the police-station, and I pointed the prisoner out as the man to the best of my belief—our premises are from about 7 to 10 minutes Walk from Mr. Gotto's—the bank closes at 4.</p>

I said, "Yes, I think it is, from what I have seen in Mr. Bramston's cash-book"—he looked at it again, and said, "It is very like my writing"—when he was charged at the station he made no further remark—I placed him with seven others at the station for Mr. Judd to look at—there were two quite as tall as the prisoner, or taller, and similarly dressed—Mr. Judd picked out the prisoner; he did not hesitate in the least; he walked directly up to him, and pointed to him.</p>

They said 'Nothing much.' I went with them, and the four stood at the corner of Sidney Street. They said 'Will you look out here?' I asked them 'What for?' They said 'For nothing.'

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and pawnbroker at 298, Brixton Road—it is a corner shop, and also faces Thornton Street—there is one door in the Brixton Road, another in Thornton Street, and beyond that door a passage which gives access to the pledge boxes—the counter reaches from the shop to the pledge boxes, and the till is behind the counter near the pledge boxes—on 9th November about 3 p.m. this tray and the cash-box were in the till—there were also holes cut in the till containing from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the tray was about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was alone behind the counter—I saw the prisoner look over the glass in the Brixton Road door; then he went and looked over the glass of the doer in Thornton Street—he then entered the shop about a yard and asked me if a clock in the side window in Thornton Street was an alarm clock—I asked him which one he meant, and he came round the counter, and then I followed him out into Thorn<lb/>ton Street—he pointed me out a clock in the window—it was marked 7s,. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—I said, "Nonsense," and went back into the shop—he went in the direction of the Brixton Road—about two minutes afterwards I found the till had been pulled out—I missed this cash-box tray—it was afterwards found in Stock well—I went outside—I saw the prisoner standing on the other side of the way about 100 yards off—I spoke to a constable about 60 yards from the shop on the same side of the Brixton Road as the prisoner—the prisoner then walked across the road and I followed him, the constable following me—I said, "That is the man I have a suspicion of; he came into my shop a minute or two previously"—he stopped at the corner of Robsart Street a second or two—the policeman followed him and brought him back to me—the partition in the shop is four or five feet high—some one must have come in as if to pawn and have jumped over and pulled out the till—the silver was left—the counter is about three feet wide.</p>

I am a greengrocer, of 3, Elstead Street, Robsart Street, Brixton—on 9th November, at 3 p.m., I was cleaning Mr. Fryett's shop window in Thornton Street—I saw three men come from the Brixton Road—the prisoner is one—they went to the pledge door—the prisoner went in, the others waited outside—when he came out the others went in—the prisoner then went to the first door in Thornton Street—he looked through the glass of the door and then went to the front door and looked through the glass of that, and then he came back and went in at the side door—I did not see what became of the two men—I saw them go in, but I did not see them come out—I saw Mr. Fryett come out and look at the clock with the prisoner—the prisoner walked, away—he did not rejoin the two men.</p>

I was at Battersea Station when Mrs. Lewis came in; she was quite sober—I went with her to the place where the assault was committed; she described the woman on the road, and pointed Hickey out, and I took her in custody—she answered the description—I said to her, "Have you seen this woman before?" she said, "No"—I said, "Have not you seen her about half an hour ago?" she said, "Yes, I believe that is the woman I saw crying and shouting 'Murder!'"—I said, "She is going to charge you with being concerned with other people in assaulting and robbing her of her goods and money"—she said, "All right, lean be searched at the station"—when I first saw her she was walking away; I believe she saw me coming; she turned her head in my direction—I was in plain clothes—she did not walk quickly—in about twelve minutes I saw Sullivan with twenty or thirty people; Mrs. Lewis went up to her, put her hand on her shoulder, and said, "This is the woman who caught me by my neck and threw me down, and took my money, and passed it to the other woman"—I said, "Have you seen this woman before?" Sullivan said, "No, I do not know anything about her"—I said, "Have not you seen this woman twenty minutes or half an hour ago?"—she said, "Oh yes, this is the woman who I saw crying and thrown on her back, and saw some people running away from her "—nothing was found on them.</p>

                  </hi>, I have been lot six years living with my wife, Hannah Deller, at Mr. Ruspini's, 156, Kennington Road—I was man servant and she was cook—I know the prisoner's shop; it is a pawnbroker's, 45, Lambeth Walk—I called there first somewhere about Christmas last in consequence of finding out that my wife was not acting honestly—I saw the prisoner behind the counter; I said to him "Do you know a customer calling here of the name of Deller?"—he said "Quite well"—I said "I am her husband; I think you have got some silver spoons here, have you not?"—he hesitated some-time, and then said "No, I have some plated ones, but I had some silver ones"—I said "Do you know she is a servant? we are both servants, and the property belongs to her master"—I told him if any more was offered to stop it, and send round to 156, Kennington Road, and he would find it was true what I stated—nothing more was said then—about four months after I found a pawn-ticket of plate among the bed-things in my room; in consequence of that I took it to Mr. Redfearn; I thought of getting it out and saying nothing about it to any one—I saw both Mr. Redfearn and his assistant on that occasion—I put the ticket; on the counter; then they talked together, and they said there had been an affidavit on the ticket—I spoke to both—I said I wanted the plate; I asked them for the plate; I came to redeem it—he said my wife had been and got an affidavit upon it—I told him again, if he had got anything more, if he would be kind enough to send round to Mrs. Deller, my wife, it would be very likely she would get them out, or he would get into trouble, and he would have to give the things up—I spoke rather loud, and the assistant threatened to turn me out if I did not go—I did not go to the shop</p>

               <p>again till some time in August—in the meantime, on Tuesday, 2nd August, I called my master's attention to the quantity of plate that was missing from his house—my wife had before that Tuesday been out several days; she was out all night on the Sunday before, and on the Tuesday she was given into custody—she was afterwards at the police-court, and there pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to four months—on the 3rd I went with the police sergeant to the prisoner's shop; the sergeant told him that he had got some property there belonging to Mr. Euspini, and he asked him to produce all he had got—he handed down about eight parcels, I think, and the officer took possession of them; they were my master's property; I recognised them—the sergeant told the prisoner that he had been warned by me more than once that they were her master's property and not hers; the prisoner replied "I had as much right to believe the woman as this man," meaning me—nothing more passed that I remember—I gave up to the police the pawn-tickets found at our house; I believe the constable found them himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was six years with Mr. Ruspini, not as butler or valet, as general servant—there was no other servant besides myself and my wife, the cook—nobody else was living in the house except Mr. Ruspini and ourselves; there was no Mrs. Ruspini—we had a little girl living with us—my wife had the entire management of the whole house, there was no one else to manage it—Mr. Ruspini did not occupy the lower part of the house, he lived at the top front, I am quite sure of that—our bedroom was at the top of the house—no one occupied the lower sitting rooms; we always occupied the two kitchens, front and back—no one occupied the drawing-rooms; we did not occupy them—my wife never sat there; no one occupied them only when they were required by company—Mr. Ruspini frequently had company—my wife has been a very respectable-looking woman; she is not now, through Mr. Redfearn—I have to thank Mr. Redfearn for her looks now, and so does she—I believe she is here—before she was in prison she was a thoroughly respectable-looking woman—I don't think she looked fit to sit in Mr. Ruspini's drawing-room; she would be out of place thore—she could go and sit in the parlours I suppose, if she liked, as we had the range of the house we could go to any portion—she was only away from the house one night, that was the Sunday night before she was arrested on the Tuesday, I think—I was very much annoyed about that—I was angry with her and with people in general—up to that time I had been on good terms with my wife—my wife had no property of her own—she used to wear a watch and little articles of jewellery—they belonged to me—it is some time ago since I saw them, more than two years I don't know that she pawned those with Mr. Redfearn—I occasionally noticed the absence of the watch, and then it would turn up again—I missed a good many things that used to reappear, or my suspicions would not have been aroused—I only know from what Mr. Redfearn himself has said, that he knew her as a customer for some years—it was about Christmas last that I spoke to Mr. Eedfearn about her—I had no fault at all to find with her up to that time—I told Mr. Eedfearn it was not her property, and that she was robbing her master—I did not mention Mr. Euspini's name to him; I mentioned the address that was on the tickets—if he had come to the house he would have seen me; perhaps it would have suited him better to see my wife.</p>

I live at 156, Kennington Road—I am a private gentleman—I had a woman named Deller in my employment as cook—her husband was my general servant—I have seen a quantity of plate in the custody of the police, and now produced—at the end of July or early in August John Deller made a communication to me; I think it was on the Saturday before the Bank Holiday—before that I had no idea that any of my property was in pawn—I never gave any one authority to pawn it—the woman was given in charge for stealing it—I gave evi<lb/>dence against her at the police court, and she was convicted—I after<lb/>wards received this letter fron. the prisoner.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant L</hi>). On 3rd August, in consequence of in<lb/>structions, I went to Mr. Ruspini's at 156, Kennington Boad—from what the witness Deller told me I accompanied him to the prisoner's shop, 45, Lambeth Walk—I saw Mr. Redfearn—I told him that a servant who had recently lived at 156, Kennington Boad, had been robbing her master very extensively, and that I had reason to think that most if not all the property was pledged with him—I described the property stolen, and eight parcels were produced which had been pledged during July and about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced upon it—Deller at once identified it an his master's property—I had asked Mr. Bedfearn to show the whole of the property that was in his possession in order that I might stop it if identified, and as the result of that I saw those eight parcels—I said to him "In my opinion you have acted very irregularly in taking that property in pawn, as this man," pointing to the witness Deller, "informs me that he has on more than one occasion cautioned you against taking the property in, and that he told you she was only a servant at the address she gave, and that the property was stolen from her master"—Deller said "Yes, and more than that, I asked you to stop any property she might bring in future, and the last time I called your servant ordered me out of the shop"—Redfearn said "It is quite true you called; the woman assured me that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188111210104"/>
               <p>the property was her own; I consider I have as much right to believe her as you"—I said "I think if you had any doubt you could easily have satisfied yourself, as the address she gave you was not more than three or four minutes' walk; or you could have called in the police and they would have done so at once"—that was the whole of the interview—I directed him not to part with any of the property, and gave him my name and then left—the same night I arrested the woman—on searching her I found a large number of duplicates—I found, I believe, 11 relating to silver and plated goods that were afterwards identified by Mr. Ruspini—I am not quite sure of the exact number—between 9 and 10 the fol<lb/>lowing morning I called again at the shop and saw the prisoner—I said "I have arrested the woman, and found tickets for more than double the property you have produced, in her possession," and I asked him to produce it at 1 that morning at the police-court—I said "I think it is desirable that you should attend at the police-court yourself, as I intend to call the Magistrate's attention to the encouragement you have given this woman to steal"—he said he could not possibly do so, but would send his foreman or manager, I forget which he called him—I then left—the woman was brought before the Magistrate, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to four months' imprisonment—after she was convicted I made a further search of the kitchen at 166, Kennington Road—I found several more "duplicates; amongst them—four relating to articles of plate of Mr. Buspini's, pledged with Mr. Redfearn—the articles described in the 11 duplicates that I had already found, and some I had found the evening previous, and some for which I had no duplicates, were produced before the Magistrate and delivered up—on Monday, 8th, I again went to, the prisoner's shop accompanied by Inspector Chamberlain—I told him we held a warrant and should have to take him into custody for receiving the property produced at the police-court the week previous, well Knowing it to be stolen—I read the warrant over to him—he said "Well I suppose I must go with you, but I did not take the property in myself"—I said "I cannot reconcile your statement now that you did not, take the property in yourself with what you told me last week, that the woman assured you that the property was her own; I must also tell you that your assistant who attended the Court last week said that his suspicions had been aroused for a long time; that he knew there was something wrong, and he told you so; that whenever the woman brought anything, before taking it in he always said, 'There is that Mrs. Deller again, shall we take anything more from her?' and that you have replied 'Yes, that is all right'"—he was taken to the station and charged—he made no reply to the charge—I produce four duplicates; the dates are "26th March, 1681, plated dish 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Jane Deller, 1, New Street;" "26th April, 1881,12 knives and forks, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Ann Deller, 126, Kennington Road;" 14th May, 1881, plated dish, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., E, Deller, 156, Kennington Road;" "4th July, 1881, six plates, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Jane Deller, 156, Kennington Road;" all pledged at Redfearn's—all these goods have not been found—after finding the tickets I went to the defendant's shop—I did not see him, I saw his assistant—the different articles described in the 11 tickets have been produced; the articles described here (<hi rend="italic">in the four ticket</hi>) are missing from Mr. Bedfearn's stock, and have not been traced—all the goods were pawned between 14th January and 13th July.</p>

               <p>the other things Helson said "You need not get any more; these will be quite sufficient for our purpose"—accordingly I did not go and get any more then; I put them back again—I was bringing them to Mr. Redfearn at the time—after they left I put all Mrs. Doller's pledges together—there were two assistants, named Bordelay and Andrew, in the shop, and Mrs. Holloway, a customer, was in the front shop—on the following morning, 4th August, between 9 and 10, Helson came again; I was in the shop; I cannot recollect whether or not he gave me a list of the 11 tickets he had—at that time the other parcels I had looked up were collected together at the back counter; Helson requested them to be brought at once to the police-court; I took them; my master was unable to go, he had another engagement—I did not take all that I had got collected on the counter; I left four behind; that was not intentionally, it was in the hurry, as Helson said he wanted me there by 10 o'clock—I had one arm full, 21 articles; they were not all plated; there were counterpanes and quilts—I was told to be at the Court by 10; I left the four behind in the hurry—Mr. Redfearn told me to take all I could find; I took several that were not on the list—on that same day after the woman was convicted, Helson came to the shop again with four other tickets; he said he had found some more tickets at the woman's house, and he put them down on the counter—I said, "Mr. Redfearn is not at home at present; you can have them when he is at home"—he said, "When will that be P"—I said, "To-morrow or next day"—he said, "If I come on Saturday can I have them?"—I said, "Yes, or Deller; he could come himself if he liked"—he did not come again—I did not tell Helson that my sus<lb/>picions had been aroused with reference to Mrs. Deller for a long time, and that I had told my master so—I never said that when she produced anything, I used to say to my master, "There is that Mrs. Deller again, shall we take it from her?" and that he replied, "It is all right"—he never said such a thing; I deny that conversation—I was the manager of the business; I did not myself keep the books required by the Act of Parliament; I know they were kept—I have made out a list with regard to Mrs. Deller's pledges from 22nd May, 1877, up to and including 2nd August, 1881—this is the list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have not counted them (<hi rend="italic">They were stated to amount to</hi> 212 <hi rend="italic">pledges</hi>)—of the first 174 of these pledges there are only two that were not redeemed—I think about 20 were given up to the police, and seven are still in hand—the total advances on these 212 pledges was, I think, 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the total profit by way of interest would be 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">ld.</hi>—I don't think I have myself given information to the police where property has been offered as to which I have had suspicion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not give evidence before the Magistrate; I was not called as a witness—Deller never saw my master at all the second time he came; not when he came about the duplicate he had found—if he has said that he said to my master, "She is only a servant; it is not her property; she is robbing her master," that is not true; he never saw my master at all on that occasion—I say that I did not say to Helson in Deller's presence after leaving the Court, "I have had my suspicions for some time about Mrs. Deller; I called my master's attention to it and said, 'There is that Mrs. Deller again; shall I take anything more from her?'" and that he replied, "Yes, that is all right;" it is all an inven<lb/>tion</p>

               <p>of the policeman—if he says that he said to my master in my presence "Your assistant who attended at the Court told me that his suspicions had been aroused for some time, and that when she brought anything he always spoke to you and said, 'There is that Mrs. Deller again, "that is an invention—both those are pure inventions of the constable.</p>

Up to within three years ago I was manager for the defendant in his business as a pawnbroker—I live at 7, Dorey Street, Princes Road, Lambeth—I remember Mrs. Deller—I served her as a customer I think on the first occasion—I asked her where she lived, and what she was—she told me she kept the house 155, or 156, Kennington Road, a lodging house, and that her principal lodgers were students at St. Thomas's Hospital—she appeared to be a lady-like woman—I should say certainly she was no menial—I made advances to her on various articles of plate, many times—I was with the defendant 16 years—his directions to me were to deal in a straightforward manner with everybody, and to do strictly an honest trade.</p>
