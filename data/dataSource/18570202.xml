                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Sudbury. I purchased a red heifer of Mr. Wilson—I missed it on 11th Nov.; I had last seen it safe on the 9th, on Mr. Wilson's premises—I informed the police, and on 21st Dec., saw it in Mr. Vickers's field, at Kingsbury—I saw Tomkins that day—Kench, who was with me, said, "Mr. Gibson has found his heifer, and I want to know where my bull is"—Tomkins said, "I shall not tell you"—he afterwards said, "I had the heifer, and Missenden had the bull, and it has gone down home"—we took him to Edgware, and he said that he would not tell us any more; he said, "You cannot make me, and I shall not tell you"—I gave him into custody—I may have asked him about their being fetched out of the paddock; I think he said that Mr. Missenden told him to fetch them out of the paddock—the heifer was taken possession of by the police.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020002"/>
               <p>mentioned Missenden's name—I had bought the heifer, I think, about three weeks before—I live about two miles from Mr. Wilson—I was in the habit of going there very frequently; four or five times a week, but sometimes not so much—he said, "You cannot make me tell you any more"—I will not say that it was not, "Any more than I know;" or whether he said, "I have told you all I know."</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">BEAUCHAMP</hi>. I am a dairyman, of Hampton-wick, and have a field into which cattle are turned. Before 11th Nov., I met Tomkins on King<lb/>ston-bridge—two or three days before that I met Missenden, and he agreed for turning more beasts into the meadow, but he did not turn in the quan<lb/>tity that he agreed to—that was all that took place; and on 11th Nov., Tomkins came with a lot of cattle; I asked him if they were Mr. Missen<lb/>den's <hi rend="italic">things</hi>, and he said, "Yes"—I told him he was to take the bulls to Kingston, and leave the heifers behind, and put them in the paddock—he had thirty-four heifers with him; one of which was the one which was left with the bull by Missenden—on 13th Nov., I saw the two prisoners in the field together—I had more cattle in that field on 13th Nov., as near as I can recollect, 143—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a memorandum which I made on the day the beasts were turned in—they took away 141, leaving two behind, a bull and the heifer, which I have since seen in the possession of the police—Missen<lb/>den would not take the heifer to the fair that day, because, he said, it was not fit to go, as it had taken the bull the night before—that was true—I could tell that from the appearance of the heifer—nothing was said about leaving the bull, but the bull was left—after that I met Mr. Smith, who was anxious to buy a couple of heifers; I took him to the meadow, and said, "That is Mr. Missenden, and that is the heifer"—I did not hear what he said to Missenden, but I saw them speaking together; they went one way up the meadow, and I the other—on 14th Nov., I saw Missenden in the fair field, and agreed with him that whatever beasts he left behind he was to pay 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for, and if he did not send the same man that put them in, he would send a note, and the money—the man who put them in came on 9th Dec.; he said that he came for the bill and heifer for Mr. Missenden; I told him to go up the meadow, and I would overtake him; I made the bill out, overtook him, and gave him the bill, and he paid me the money, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I receipted</p>

               <p>the bill, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my sister made it out, and I signed it—he took the two beasts away—I saw the heifer again on 24th Dec.—I was at the first examination, and on the second I swore to the heifer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose it is usual for cattle to be left with you before the fair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not know Missenden before—Tomkins is a drover—eighty-six of Missenden's cattle were put in first, bullocks and heifers—one of Missenden's men came with them; I do not know his name; I might know him if I saw him—there were thirty-four in the second lot, all heifers, and twenty-three in the third lot—I cannot tell who was with them—there was one bull among Missenden's own cattle—there was only one bull among the 143 head of cattle brought to me—(<hi rend="italic">A man named Hickmott, and a boy named Hosier, were here brought into Court</hi>)—that man brought some—I cannot say whether the boy brought any—eighteen bullocks came with the thirty-four heifers, but they went to Kingston, and the heifers were put in the meadow—I did not count the bulls—Tomkins took them on to Kingston—I think the cattle were at my place two nights before they were sent to the fair—I know nothing about the bulls—they all arrived at my place on 11th Nov.; the fair was on the 13th, and I saw Missenden on the fair morning in the paddock—there were 143 cattle of his there, and about ten besides his; I am including the heifer which is the subject of this indictment—the other ten were Scots; there were no heifers among them; they were bullocks—Missenden told me to meet him at Kingston, and he agreed with me that, if any remained unsold at the fair, I was to have 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for them in the meadow—this was about a quarter to 1 o'clock—the cattle were driven to the fair on 13th and 14th Nov.; I helped him out of the field with them; he and Tomkins were both present, and several men with them, but there were none of my men—all Missenden's cattle were taken to the fair, except the bull and heifer; he brought some back the next day, I cannot tell how many, or whether there were twenty or forty heifers—they were put into the same field as the heifer and the bull—I never saw Missenden afterwards; he was in the meadow on the 14th, when the cattle were driven away the second time to the fair, but he said nothing to me on the subject of the heifer which is the subject of this indictment—I saw him in the fair that day, and he said that what I had put in the field he would pay 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a head for—on the first day of the fair he said that he should not take this particular heifer to the fair, as it was not fit to go—I was close against the heifer when he said that, and could judge from her appearance that that was so in reference to the bull—I had no conversation with him in reference to the bull—he gave me a sovereign deposit when he came in and took the grass, and he paid me the rest on Kingston fair morning, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—he agreed to pay me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whether the number was 170 or 180, but he only put in 143—he gave me the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I did not give him a receipt—I think 300 was the number in the first instance, but I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover. I have been employed by Missenden—on 8th Dec., I remember being at Smithfield-market—I there saw Missen<lb/>den and Tomkins—I heard Missenden direct Tomkins to fetch the <hi rend="italic">things</hi> from Kingston—he told him to fetch the <hi rend="italic">things what was left</hi>, a bull and a heifer, and he was to pay for the keep—he told me if I wanted any money, or anything of the kind, I was to have it of Tomkins, I was to go with Tomkins—he told Tomkins to sell both the bull and heifer if he could—I remember, on 24th Dec., being at the Crane public house, in the Edg<lb/>ware-road—I there saw the heifer which I had been sent down to Kingston by Missenden to take away (I had been down to Kingston with Tomkins, and taken the heifer out of Mr. Beauchamp's field)—Missenden looked at the heifer with me; he said to me, "This is a pretty job, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, about this heifer, this will be a <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> job"—I believe I said, "Well, Sir, if you do a bad deed, it is nothing at all to do with me"—Mr. Missenden makes answer, and says, "The less you say about it the better"—he told me he bought it of a man named Shadrach Tomkins.</p>

               <p>me—he is here—he is a farmer's son—the conversation took place in the Crane yard—the heifer was there, in the stable—I did not see Missenden come there, I saw him in the yard, and he asked me where this said heifer was—that was the first question he put to me—Tomkins was then locked up—this was on a Wednesday—Missenden said, "This is a <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> job about this heifer"—I said, "If you bring this on yourself you must go through with it"—he replied, "The less you say about it the better"—that was all that passed between us—I had been summoned there—it was close by where the hearing was—Tomkins summoned me—I have the paper here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I was not examined—I do not know whether Missenden was examined that day—I did not go—I did not know whether he was in custody; he was at the Crane, having a little refreshment—he went to look at the heifer—he told me that he bought it of Shadrach Tomkins, and it was his, not only once, but several times before that—I know where Tomkins lives—I have not been down to his house lately, not for this fortnight—Missenden's cattle were only there two days before they started for the fair—Missenden ordered me to go to the railroad to meet them—I did not see Missenden at his own house, I saw him in London—I then went down to Tomkins, and assisted in driving the cattle from Tomkins's to Mr. Beauchamp's—I drove fifty—I took them from Tomkins's field—Tomkins was not with me—he did not go with me to Kingston—he told me where to take them from—it was close to where he lodges—Mr. Missenden's man went with me—there was a bull amongst them—I drove them to Mr. Beauchamp's, and left them there.</p>

I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in consequence of a note I had received from Mr. Meade, my landlord—I desired Chandler to pay that money to Mr. Meade for his rent when he called, as he said he would—I believe I saw the receipt on the evening afterwards—Chandler showed it to me—this is it—she handed it to me—she continued to remain with me till 23rd Jan.—on that day, about 8 o'clock in the morning, the landlord came to my house—I showed him this receipt, in presence of Chandler—he said it was not his handwriting, and Chandler said, "Mr. Mead, I know it is not your handwriting "—soon after that the landlord left my house, and something occurred which directed my attention to Pavis—I had seen Pavis once or twice—she lives about five minutes walk from my house—I knew she was acquainted with Chandler—I went to Pavis, and took this receipt with me—I asked her whether she had done any writing for Chandler in Nov. last—she said, "Yes"—I showed her the receipt, and asked her if she had written that—she said, "Yes, Mr. Fesdorf, and I am very sorry I have done so; I have done it with a trembling hand; I did not like to do it, but she persuaded me that she would soon get the money together again, and she would then get a proper receipt"—Chandler left me the same afternoon, about 4 o'clock—this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was sent me about 10 o'clock in the evening—it is Chandler's writing.</p>

On 26th Jan. my master and mistress were absent, and the prisoner, and I, and a fellow servant were left in charge of the house—the plate was left there in my charge—it was kept in the wardrobe—it consisted of table spoons, gravy spoons, a fish knife, dessert spoons, and other things—they were kept loose in this plate basket, and there was a paper there with half a dozen knives in it—I saw it all safe on Thursday, 22nd Jan.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I recollect the prisoner coming one day in Jan. to our bed room—he opened the door, and said, "There is somebody in the house"—I said, "Nonsense, go to bed!"—he went away and came back again, and said he had heard master's bed room window opened; he said, "Get up!"—I and my fellow servant got up, and we went with the prisoner into master's bed room, and found the window open—I looked out of the window to see if I could see or hear anything—I afterwards looked into the wardrobe—the door of the wardrobe was open, and the plate was gone—three drawers were open, and part of the things thrown out—I went into the adjoining room, and found the window open a little—there was a pane of glass out in the little room—the room in which the prisoner slept was next to our room—he slept nearer to my master's room than we did—when we went to bed the windows were</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, T</hi> 1). In consequence of hearing of this robbery, I went to the prosecutor's house about half past eight o'clock in the morning—Kirby had been there before me—when I went the prisoner came to me at the back of the house—I asked him how the robbery had been committed—he said they had broken the glass in the up stairs window, and had got in that way, and escaped out of master's bed room window—I went up, and saw a square of glass broken in a small room adjoining the master's bed room—I asked the prisoner how they could have got there—he said, "They must have had a ladder," and he pointed to some marks on the flower border under the verandah window—they were such marks as a ladder that was lying there would make—I found two ladders there—I compared them with the impressions on both places, and they corresponded exactly, and they fitted in the holes in the ground—neither of those ladders were long enough for a person to get in at the window—I tried the long ladder; the short one was quite out of the question—the prisoner pointed out some foot marks on the flower borders, which he Raid were the foot marks of the thieves—I asked him to put his foot on the border to make an impression—I said, "It corresponds exactly, it is just like your foot"—he said, "It is something like it"—I asked him to take his boot off, and it made an impression just like the others—I said, "It must be your boot; it cannot be any one else's; I will take my oath it is yours"—he said, "I cannot account for it, Sir"—he had not stepped on the border in my presence before he pointed out the foot mark to me—I found an iron tip under the window of the verandah—I went into the house, and examined the window where the square of glass was broken out, and I believe the glass had been broken from the inside—there was one very small piece of glass in the room—the rest was all outside on the verandah and the border—there were three spots of blood, two on the glass, inside, and one in the room—I examined the prisoner's hands, and found he had a slight cut on the forefinger of the left hand—it appeared to be quite fresh, and to have been cut by something very keen—he said that he did it in chopping some wood on the Monday with a chopper which he produced—this is it—it has a very thick edge—I should think the cut could not have been inflicted by this—I examined about the ground, but could find no trace of any person leaving that spot—I know the spot where the plate was found—a person might have gone there without going by the flower</p>

               <p>bed, by going out of the front of the house and going round—if a person had gone from the place where the foot marks were to the walk, there must have been more marks—I think a person could not have got down from the window without leaving marks—I was present when the plate was discovered in a loft over the place where wood is chopped—the plate was found on the Wednesday morning, the morning following the robbery—it was wrapped in this newspaper, and concealed under the wood and rubbish—this is a Lynn newspaper, addressed to "Mr. Linford, at H. Hodgkinson, Esq., East Acton"—all the plate was in this paper—I found this stone in a box in the prisoner's bed room—I did not see any lucifer matches or candle there—I found another newspaper in a cupboard in the prisoner's bed room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How much shorter was the long ladder than the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four feet—it was only four feet ten inches long—the two ladders together might reach the window—I observed four or five foot<lb/>steps on the border—they had come apparently from the veranda—it appeared that they had passed off towards the gravel walk, and from that gravel walk a person might get to the place where the plate was found—the prisoner had no hesitation in putting his foot down by the side of the foot marks—the foot marks corresponded; they were about the same length and breadth—there were no particular marks—they were rather smaller than boots are generally, and are peculiarly made—the mould was soft, it was very wet; it had been recently dug up—there were six marks of ladders, four of the short ladder, and two of the long one—there was a third ladder there that was longer than the window.</p>

On Tuesday, 20th Jan., about half past 10 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and asked me for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of coppers in change for a shilling—I told him that I had no coppers to spare, and he said that two sixpences would do as well, as it was for a person who was going to pay him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a neighbour, for whom he had done something—I gave him two sixpences, and he gave me a shilling, and went away instantly—it was bad, and I went to the door, but could see nothing of him—I put the shilling into my pocket, I had no money there—about half past 6 o'clock in the evening he came and asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin, and gave me a shilling—I said, "This is a bad shilling, which I believe you are quite aware of, being the second you have passed to day"—he said, "I have just taken it of a person close by, if you will return it to me I will take it back"—I said, "No, I shall not do so"—he left the house, and Mr. Girton, the landlord, who was in the street, took him in charge—I put the shilling into my pocket, went up stairs and fetched the first shilling, and Mr. Girton marked them both in my presence.</p>

On Saturday night, 15th Jan., I fastened up my house about a quarter past 11 o'clock—there is a cellar flap on the path, which was fast—it had not been opened for more than a week—there was a cask of beer in the cellar—I was called up between four and 5 o'clock by a policeman, went into the cellar from the house, and found the flap broken open—it had been fastened with a bolt across underneath—it had been wrenched up, so that the bolt slipped away when they pulled—the vent peg had been taken out of the head of the cask, and the beer was left running—the policeman found a large stick in the cellar, which was not there the night before—there is a back window there, and the putty had been cut out of one of the squares, but the glass was not removed—they had wasted nine or ten gallons of beer.</p>

On Sunday morning, 18th Jan, about a quarter past three o'clock, I saw the prisoners together ten or twelve yards from the prosecutor's house—Andrews, who was with me, went round one way and I the other, and we then saw Stringer walking away from the cellar flap, close to it—it was then about half past three—he walked away before I got up to him, and passed me—I did not know then that he had done anything—I went to the cellar flap, and heard a noise—I went down, Andrews followed me, and I found Madigan concealing himself in a corner of the cellar—I asked him what he was doing there—he did not answer me, and I handed him up to Andrews—I found this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the cellar—I then went in search of Stringer, found him, and took him into custody; his cap was all over cob<lb/>webs—I said that I wanted him for breaking into Stone's house with another man—he said that he knew nothing at all about it, or about the</p>

I was with Sudbury, and saw the prisoners about a quarter to three o'clock, standing together about twenty yards from Mr. Stone's—we searched them and found nothing—I have heard the account that Sudbury has given, it is correct—I took Madigan in the cellar, and Sudbury went after Stringer—as I was going with Madigan, he said, that if it had not been for his fool of a mate, he should not have been there at all, for he wanted to go to a gentleman's house in the country, where they would have had a good haul—he also said, "If we had not for<lb/>gotten some lucifers, we should have had the crib turned over before you came up"—he also said that if the landlord had come down, he would have quieted him with this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), pulling it out of his pocket—I took it from his hand; and he said, "If you had handled me roughly I should have put it into you; I would as leave be hung out of the way as I would live; we had to pull up some sweet turnips out of the road; me and my mate had some beer, but we could not very well get it; we were obliged to get it out of the peg, but if we had had a pot we could have drank it—I found nothing on him, but he said that he was a ticket of leave man—I asked him to show me his ticket, and he pulled it out of his pocket and gave it to me—(<hi rend="italic">This being produced, was for a military offence, striking his superior officer, and was dated 31st July</hi>, 1856.)</p>

               <p>there was an entrance, I went down, and was asleep for about half an hour, but did no damage; when the policeman found that he could not make a crime out of it, he very likely took the plug out, for he said, "Now I will make a crime of you, and make a little money of it; I think I can make up a story as well as any policeman can;" the two policemen went down and drank their bellies full, and then passed off their crime on us two old soldiers; I have been wounded, and have got a medal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and am a dressmaker, of No. 8, Frederick-street, Regent's-park. About 30 minutes past 7 o'clock on the evening of 29th Dec. a friend called on me, and I went with her down into the back kitchen, and about five minutes afterwards I heard a noise in the back parlour, and then we all of us heard a drawer drawn out very heavily—my friend's sister and a young man, a lodger, were also there—the young man went up stairs first, and we followed—we had got nearly to the top of the kitchen stairs with a light, and quite in sight of the parlour door, when the prisoner rushed out of the back parlour, and turned round upon us—he looked very violent, but the young man called out, "What do you want here?"—he said, "It is all right," sprang to the street door, went out, and slammed it after him, but he had secured it from shutting by the bolt—my lodger Robinson ran out, and called, "Police! stop thief!" and in a few minutes a policeman brought the prisoner back, and I recognized him immediately—I swear he is the man—he must have entered with a skeleton key, for I had closed the door five minutes before—the front parlour, which the prisoner entered, was left wide open—it had not been locked—it was the back parlour he sprung from—two drawers in the back parlour were open—nothing was taken out of the place, but the things were got ready to be taken away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been connected with this board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About seven years—the prisoner had been in the employment of the board long before that, many years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know the mode in which the board arranged the payment of the different accounts to persons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, generally speaking, they were signed at the board, and I did not see them after they went up—the prisoner paid some of the cheques, through his own bankers—that was known to the board, and to everybody; it was known to me; some of them, but not all, certainly—I mean, some of the cheques given by the guardians of the Union, and he then paid parties by cheques of his own, creditors of the Union; many of them were not creditors, but non-resident householders—I very frequently filled up the cheques, whether drawn on the Union bankers or on his private bankers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After the cheque had been paid into his own bankers which he received from the Union, supposing him to pay the money by a cheque of his own, were you in the habit of recognizing that system, and filling up the body of the cheque? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A very great many of them—it would be the prisoner's duty to receive directions as to the course of business he was to pursue from the guardians, or from Mr. Rowsell, who was the representative of the guardians—there were printed papers in 1850 pointing out the duties of all the servants—the duties of the clerks were defined in a printed list—I believe all the servants have been acting under those orders since that time—Mr. Thornton</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I was at the board of guardians on 2nd Sept—the prisoner was acting as assistant clerk to the board of guardians on that day—he was present at the board that day—Mr. Rowsell was out of town at that time—I was present when this cheque was given to the prisoner—it was given to him to pay Kingsford and Co., one of the contractors for flour to the Union—the whole of it was to be paid to them—he was to pay them that cheque—he had no authority to pay it into his own bankers, to his own account—I did not see that cheque again until 17th Dec.; I then found it in the prisoner's private desk, at the house he lived in, in St. Mary Axe—he had then left the office; it was after he had absconded—the returned cheques of the Union would be kept in his office until the audit; they might have been kept in his private drawer; I do not know.</p>

               <p>most certainly done without the authority of the board—Eldred was a clerk of the Union, but in consequence of his revealing that he knew of this fact, he has been discharged by the board of guardians—he was discharged because he was aware that Mr. Paul had used the cheques of the guardians, and had not informed the guardians of that fact—I mean used them by appropriating the money to his own use, by paying them into his bankers in the first place; I am now aware of the fact, that accounts have been paid by him over and over again, by his own private cheques—he may have paid his own cheques to Messrs. Atkinsons, to the amount of thousands—I am speaking of matters that I have learned since.</p>

                  </hi>. In Sept last, I was principal clerk to the board of guardians, of the London Union, and had been so for nearly twenty years; this cheque is countersigned by me—it was my practice to counter<lb/>sign cheques which were signed at the board by the members who were pre<lb/>sent—it was the prisoner's duty to have paid this cheque over to the party for whom it was intended, Messrs. Kingsford—the prisoner left the office, I think, on 17th Dec.—before that, on 27th Nov., I had a conversation with him in consequence of an application for payment by Messrs. Kingsford—I thought I recollected that a cheque had been signed during my absence from London; I found that that had been the case, and that it was signed on 2nd Sept; and I asked the prisoner for the receipt for the money from Kingsford's—finding that he hesitated, I told him that the cheque had been cashed on the 13th—I then left the office for a moment, to see by the bankers' book, whether the 13th was the right date; I returned again almost imme<lb/>diately; the prisoner then said that it was useless deceiving me, he had used the money; he implored me to save him from the ruin of disclosure; and having a great regard and esteem for him, and knowing the estimation and regard in which he had been generally held, I was induced to forbear the disclosure at that time—nothing more passed between us that I recollect, except that he said he should take care to repay the money—I afterwards paid the money out of my own moneys; that was on 6th Dec.—we also Lid some conversation as to another cheque, which, I believe, is not before you to-day, which he had misappropriated; and he told me that that was the whole of his irregularity—I paid the money into Messrs. Kingsfords' bankers—the prisoner left the office on 17th Dec.—I think a search was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020047"/>
               <p>being made in the office that day by some of the guardians—the prisoner left, I think, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I never saw him again until he was in custody, which was, I think, on 31st Dec.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your duties, I believe, were defined by a paper pub<lb/>lished some four or five years ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they were stated on that paper; it was my duty to do a great many things, and amongst others, to instruct the various officers in their duties—I had very hard work myself—I did a good deal in the instructing line—I do not say I was constantly at it—if any of the officers felt any difficulty, they applied to me, and I instructed them—if they did not feel any difficulty I gave no instruction—I did not proffer it, but only gave it when asked for—I had frequent applications—I frequently instructed Mr. Paul—I did not know of his paying the accounts of the Union by cheques on his own bankers; I never heard of it—it was among my duties to examine all papers, and all Acts of Parliament relating to the poor laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This is the part that I wanted to call your attention to (<hi rend="italic">referring to a printed paper</hi>)—you were "to keep punctually minutes of the proceedings of the meetings, and to keep check, and examine all account books and docu<lb/>ments?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wish you to understand that that is the whole detail of the duties of the office of clerk; if you will look below that, you will find that to enable the clerk to perform those duties, there are certain officers appointed—all the duties are under the head of myself—I do not consider that it was personally my duty to keep check and examine all accounts; that was the duty of the prisoner—he was an acknowledged and confiden<lb/>tial clerk; if you look below that paper, you will find that it was so—I do not say that it was his duty to check his own accounts—it was not my general duty to keep, check, and examine all account—the responsibility attached to my office was very great, and produced a constant wear and tear of mind and body—I say I had not personally to keep, check, and examine all accounts—the auditor would check the accounts—it was the duty of the auditor to see that each officer, at the end of every half year, produced his accounts to be examined—I do not see how the auditor should know the arrangements of the office, or the mode in which cheques should be given; he could easily check it, because he had the power of calling any officer before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But how should he judge by calling an officer before him? suppose, for instance, that Mr. Paul had been drawing cheques on his private bankers to pay the accounts of the Union, would that be a matter that the auditor could check? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could check it by the dates of the receipts—he could see that the vouchers and other matters agreed—he would perhaps be 'able to tell whether that was proper, as much as I could—the auditor is a person called in every half year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner, in this very conversation, tell you that he had overpaid Lee's account to the amount of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if you could get that back from Lee it would help to pay the defalcation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me so afterwards, not during that conversation—it was some days afterwards—I found that was true, that he had paid Lee 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which did not appear to have been drawn by the board—it appeared to me that he had paid Lee 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; out of his own funds—I do not think he told me when he had paid it—it was recently—I understand it was after 13th Sept—I think I asked him how he could satisfy me that that was the case, and I after<lb/>wards saw a statement from Messrs. Lee, written by them, in which it appeared that that was the case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at No. 12, Michael-place, Brompton. I knew the deceased, Mr. William Marcooley—I saw him a few days before his death—I was attending a child of his—I was not attending him particularly—he complained of a pain in his chest and stomach, and I advised him to have a dose of castor oil next day or the day after, if he did not feel better, and to have a mustard poultice—he was about thirty-five years old, I should say—he was living at No. 6, Brunswick-place, Brompton—I did not see him any more until 27th Dec, when I was called in about 10 or a quarter to 10 o'clock in the morning—I then found him on the ground, convulsed, and apparently dying, senseless, unconscious, and gasping—I applied ammonia, and the usual remedies, and the stomach pump with-out effect—the stomach pump would not act—I remained with him until he died—it was not until after his death that I found out the cause of it—I then perceived a bottle containing some prussic acid, and a small portion of castor oil; less than a teaspoonful altogether; the rest had been swal<lb/>lowed—I took it from a table into the room—I put it in my pocket, and afterwards examined it—I detected it first by smelling it—there was no difficulty in detecting what it was—I opened the bottle directly after his death—I analysed the contents, and afterwards Mr. Rodgers did so—upon the analysis I detected the presence of prussic acid—two drops gave a sufficient test of the presence of prussic acid—I could detect it perfectly—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—in my opinion the prussic acid was the cause of death—that is my positive opinion—there can be no doubt of it—I did not find much prussic acid in the inside—it is very volatile.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and lecturer on chemistry. I received the bottle with some small portion of castor oil—I analysed the contents, and found prussic acid in it—if that bottle had been half full, judging from the proportions I found, there would have been about eighty minims, nearly a drachm and a half—that would be a great deal more than sufficient to cause death—twenty minims is considered to be a fatal dose—I analysed the contents of the stomach, and detected prussic acid there, but not sufficient to account for death—it was tested on the 4th, death having occurred on the 27th—it is a very volatile spirit, it requires great care to preserve it from evapora<lb/>tion—I received another bottle, which I have here; it contains a lotion—I analysed the remains of it; I detected merely a trace of prussic acid in it—the analysis for prussic acid is extremely accurate—I should not have the slightest difficulty in detecting a very small portion, I could detect the thou<lb/>sandth part of a grain—I detected merely a trace; nothing that you could weigh or measure—the quantity I found in the castor oil bottle corresponded with one minim of Scheele's acid—I was speaking of Scheele's strength when I spoke of twenty minims causing death—a minim is considered to be the bulk of one grain of water—supposing two drachms to have been put into the other bottle, there must necessarily have been more prussic acid than I detected—hydrocyanic acid is used by druggists in two strengths, one according to the Pharmacopoeia, and one an old acid, known as Scheele's strength—hydrocyanic acid is synonymous with prussic acid—that is the general term.</p>

On the night of 20th Jan., I had been to the Haymarket theatre—I was returning from there, and about 1 o'clock got into Somerset-street, Whitechapel—on my way, I had been into the Turk's Head public house, to have a glass of ale, and there I met the prisoners; that was the first I saw of them—the prisoners followed me out, and walked with me—there was another woman with them, I cannot say whether there were more—I had not spoken to them in the public house—I cannot say how far I had got before anything happened, I suppose it was about five or six minutes after leaving the public house—one of them then snatched off my victorine, and the other my cloak, and passed it to another woman, and I was struck and knocked down by one of them—I called out, and a young woman came up, and then a policeman—the prisoners ran away, they were brought back by the policeman in five minutes or more, and I identified them—I have no doubt they are two of the women.</p>

                  </hi>. I am out door inspector to the persons carrying on business as the General Omnibus Company. Mr. Arthur M'Namara is one, and he has partners—the prisoner was one of the conductors of an omnibus from Chelsea to London—his wages were 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a journey, 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—his duty was, at the end of each journey, to make out his ticket, which was on a printed form—this is one of the forms—he was to enter the number of passengers at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is called a journey ticket, or way bill—having made out the list, he was to deposit it in a box kept at the Star and Garter, Sloane-square, on the following morning, and, having subtracted the amount of wages due to the coachman and himself, he left the remainder and the bill with an officer appointed to receive the money.</p>

               <p>aware that he carries any book with him—nothing but the ticket—he would have to depend on his memory as to the number of passengers, unless he chose to provide himself with a book—from Chelsea to Charing-cross is a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fare, and from Charing-cross to Hoxton is a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fare—from Hyde Park to the Bank is a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fare—from the Post Office to Hoxton is a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fare—that is the limit—there are four charges of fares, and the con<lb/>ductor is bound to recollect where each person gets up, that he may charge them accordingly—it is quite an easy matter—I have not been a conductor—I am an out door inspector, I take notice of any irregularity that I might see, and forward all complaints that are brought against drivers and conductors—I have not been employed to travel for the purpose of check<lb/>ing conductors—I have not been in the habit of travelling in the omnibus as a check on the conductor—I have occasionally done it for pastime—I cannot tell the number of the proprietors of this company—I know the names of three, whose names are attached to the vehicles—there are a number, I believe—I do not know whether they are all entitled to passes—some of them are in the habit of having passed—there are about nine gentlemen who give passes—workmen are entitled to passes—there were some buildings being erected at Chelsea at that time—there are some ivory passes, and I have heard that there are passes which will enable a person to travel one journey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am occasionally in the employ of the General Omnibus Company, to check the conductors, to see what passengers they have. I have been so employed, off and on, for three years—on 28th Nov. I travelled in the Chelsea and Hoxton omnibus from the Bank to Chelsea—I got in at the Bank about 8 o'clock—the prisoner was the conductor—I took my seat about one from the door, but on the first opportunity I shifted to the door on the right hand side going in—I cannot say how many were in when I got in—I think it was full—I was aware for what distance 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was charged, for what distance 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and for what distance 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I rode as far as Sloane-street—I observed how many persons rode the different distances—I took a note of it not two minutes after I left the omni-bus—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>) on the inside there were seven 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; fares, eleven 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and outside there were two 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; seven 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;—on 9th Dec. I went again from the Bank to Chelsea—I took my seat as nearly as possible where I did before—I took a note of the passengers immediately after-wards—there were seven 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and nine 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. inside, and one 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and five 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. outside—in the course of those journeys there was no dispute between the conductor and the passengers—I saw something pass from every one—I</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You rode to Sloane-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about the middle; to Cadogan-place—I do not know how many I left in when I got out, I had nothing to do with that—I got in at the Bank—I have no note of how many got in between the Bank and Charing Cross—I cannot tell how many got in between the Bank and Hyde Park corner—I cannot tell how many were in when I got in—there were three on the top—two got off at the Bank, and left one on the left hand side of the omnibus—I sat inside, close to the door, on the right hand side—I entered at 8 o'clock—it would be about half past 8 o'clock when I got to Sloane-street, rather later—I cannot tell the place where any one got in, or any one got out—I made no note till I got out—on the first journey I made altogether thirty persons, nineteen inside and eleven outside—twelve is the number which makes the omnibus full inside, and nine outside—on 9th Dec. I made sixteen passengers inside, and six outside—I cannot tell how many were in on that day when I got in, or when I got out, or how many got in at Charing Cross—I do not believe there were any passes given on that day; I did not see any—I did not get out of the omnibus all the way—I could see through the window, and on the right and left, who got up—this is my book—these are all journeys that are entered here—it is exactly as I entered it at the time—I put my pencil into my mouth, which makes the entries blacker in some places than others—none have been pencilled over since: they have never been touched—here is 28th Nov. and then 9th Oct.—that is a mistake—I put Oct. for Dec.—I can swear to the day I did it—there are in this book ten journeys, all done with a view of checking the conductor—I entered all these correctly—I always enter one journey before I do another—here is Clapton to the City—I entered it 7 o'clock, and scratched it out, and entered 5 o'clock—I put the wrong time down—if I had sent that report in at 7 o'clock, it would not have corresponded with the conductor's account—it would not have got him into trouble, it would have been sent back to me—it would not correspond with the conductor's time—here are three at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is altered to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are no 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fares on that road—I am familiar with those omnibuses—I altered this 7 o'clock to 5 o'clock, and the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. soon afterwards—I altered the time and the fare—I generally carry a watch with me; if not, there is always plenty of time to see—I have frequently, in the course of these journeys, found that when I made these entries, I have made mistakes—I alter them directly if I make a mistake—this mistake was the time, but I am positive as to the number of passengers—I do not do this for a living, only when I have nothing else to do—I do not ride ten or twelve journeys every day—here is the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, the eleventh, the twelfth, the fourteenth, the fifteenth, the sixteenth, and the seventeenth, and then I had business of my own to attend to—it is not a business that I like better than this—it is an honest business.</p>

               <p>asked me what I did there—I told him I had come to purchase a chain of this person, which was represented as sixteen carat gold, and weighed 2 ozs. all but 1 dwt.—he asked the prisoner for the chain, but he refused to give it up—they took him into custody, secured his hands, and took the-chain out of his left hand pocket—this is it.</p>

Salisbury—I was served with a copy of a writ of summons on 6th Nov.; I believe I instructed my attorney to make an appearance for me—I appeared at the police court on 13th Nov., in reference to an assault which was said to have been committed on the 8th—I saw Mary Ann Ridaer there; the defendant was not there—a man named Hitching appeared, who had the summons out against me—I was arrested by Strong, a Sheriff's officer, and taken to Mr. Sloman's, another Sheriff's officer, and kept there about a week—I went eventually to Whitecross-street, and came out, I think, on 6th or 7th Dec.—there is a public house called the Blue Posts, next door to where I carry on business; I do not reside there, I usually get to business about 9 o'clock—I was not at the Blue Posts on 12th Nov., nor in the parlour of that house, nor did I there see John Salisbury, my father—I did not go in and begin to converse with him on the subject of an assault case which was to be heard at the Thames Police office next day—I did not say to him, "They will appear against me to-morrow, but never mind, if I only once get out; I will be off, I will not give them one rap, none of them"—I never made use of those, or of any other words, intimating my intention to leave the country—I never had such a conversation with my father—I was at Woodford on 12th Nov., with my wife; we started between 10 and 12 o'clock in my cart, and got there between 12 and 1 o'clock, I suppose—I saw Robert Francis there, we dined with his wife, and I believe he came in dur-ing dinner—we had tea there, and left about 7 o'clock, and got home about 9 o'clock—I paid Francis two half sovereigns for clipping a horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the resident medical officer at the London Hospital. On Monday afternoon, 5th Jan., the prisoner was brought to the hospital—she was in a state of approaching coma, or insensibility, from the effects of laudanum—I gave her an emetic—I examined the discharge from the stomach; there was no question as to its character—when she was somewhat recovered from the effects of the poison, I asked her what led her to do it—she said that she was anxious to go to heaven, and that she had also given her child some, in order to take it to its father who was in heaven—I sent for the child; I found it suffering from, the symptoms of poison by opium—it was nearly five years of age—I cannot at this moment remember its name—it was a male child—she Raid it was her child—about 8 o'clock the same evening she said that she had been to Yarmouth to bury her father; that on her return she found that her husband had committed suicide; that she had been endeavouring to support her child and herself by needlework, and being unable to obtain a subsistence by that employ<lb/>ment, she had bought about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of laudanum, at different chemists, part of which she had taken herself, and the rest she had given to her child—I did not take any means of ascertaining what quantity the child had taken—I gave it an emetic, but owing to the carelessness of the nurse, what it threw up was thrown on one side—the child was fast lapsing into a state of coma—I should say it had taken sufficient to be dangerous to life, but, fortunately, there was a large amount of food on the stomach, which ren<lb/>dered the absorption of the poison less liable to prove fatal to the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am collecting clerk to Messrs. H. and E. Rosier, of Limehouse, and have been so forty years. On Saturday, 10th Jan., I was in Rose-lane, Stepney, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day—I was walking along, with a leather travelling bag in one hand, and an umbrella in the other—the Black wall railway runs across Rose-lane—there are three arches, one crosses each of the pathways, and one crosses the road—when I got within about sixty yards of the first archway, the prisoner Miller came off the footpath as deliberately as possible, and came towards me—when he came close to roe, he stopped in front of me, and said, "Old gentleman, we have been waiting for you"—I was instantly seized from behind by two men—I turned my head sharply, and saw there were two—one took charge of my arms, and the other took charge of my head—my head was pressed down, and something as cold as possible put over my face, I could neither speak nor see, no further than I know that the man who met me in front, took my watch out of my waistcoat pocket—the weather was cold at this time; it might have been a hand that was put over my face—Miller tore the watch through my buttons—he tore the buttons off my waistcoat in doing so—finding that he could not get the guard off my neck, for I always button one side of it in my braces, and it was a strong solid gold guard, he seized it with all his might, and broke the guard—it was enough to cut my neck through, indeed, I wonder it did not do so—he broke the guard and took the watch away—I then felt his hand going to my right hand pocket—having a considerable sum of money in my left pocket, I struggled to get my mouth clear, and sang out, "Police!"—and at that instant I received a blow which knocked me down, and knocked my senses completely out of me—my recollection never came to me again until the next day—I fell on my arm, and have not been able to lift it to my head since—I recollect nothing after I was knocked down, until I found myself at home the next morning—I live at Barnet—the prisoners were taken into custody, I think, about seven or eight days afterwards; and when I went to the police station to see them, my recollection had not rightly recovered, and my eyes were so bad, I could not actually trust to them—I would not then swear to Miller, but I stated to the magistrate that, to the best of my belief, he was the man—I can now firmly swear he is the man—I never saw my watch again—I understand that my carpet bag was picked up, and brought to the station, but I know nothing at all about that.</p>

               <p>Queen-street, Ratcliff. On the day in question, I was coming from a pawnbroker's shop in the Commercial-road, with a basket in my hand—I saw Mr. Harris coming under the railway arch in Rose-lane—he was just going into the arch, and I saw Williams come over, knock him down, and run away—that was the first that I saw—I did not see any watch taken—I did not see any other person—I know a man named Briney—I saw him at the corner; I suppose he was looking out.</p>

On Saturday morning, 10th Jan., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was talking with another lad, and we happened to turn round, and saw the old gentleman lying on the ground at the end of the court, and the prisoner with his leg across him—I cannot exactly say which prisoner it was, because he was off in au instant—but when the old gentleman was walking into the station, the other prisoner laughed as he was going in—I only saw one person close to Mr. Harris; the other one was a little way off, down by the court—that was Briney—I know Miller—he is the one that laughed, as the old gentle-man was going into the station—I know Williams by sight—I saw Briney, Miller, and Williams, all three together, before the robbery was committed—I cannot exactly say how long before—it was that same morning—I cannot say whether Williams is the man that I saw standing over the old gentleman—I cannot say who it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sexton of West Hackney Church, and live opposite the north side of the Church. On the evening of 30th Dec, a little before 7 o'clock, in consequence of what my two children came and told me, I looked towards the vestry room of the Church, and saw a glimmering light through the vestry room window—I sent for Thomas Williams, the beadle—I keep the keys of the Church—I took the keys, and went over to the Church with Williams, my wife, and the two children—I unlocked the outside back lobby door, and went into the Church—I locked the door again immediately—I then lighted a candle—I saw Williams go towards the vestry—he turned back, and said, "There is something up," or, "It is all up, let me out"—I let him out, and locked the door after him—I then went to the vestry room—it was dark at this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020077"/>
               <p>time—I did not find any one there—I found the iron chest wrenched out of the wall, and turned upside down, about four feet from the place where it had stood before—that chest contained the communion plate, a flagon, two chalices, two patens, and an alms dish—the churchwardens are Mr. Thomas Waller and Mr. John Carter—I had last seen the chest at 11 o'clock that same morning—it was then safe in its place—in the evening after we had discovered this, there were traces of violence on it; the lap of the door was forced off, and there were other marks—there are two doors to the chest; a lap of one folds over the other; that was wrenched off, and other marks made apparently by that lap having been used as a lever or crow bar, and there were marks of another crow bar, to get the lid open—the handle was wrenched off one of the doors, and also the escutchens from the keyhole—in consequence of what my little girl said to me, I came out of the vestry—I heard a noise towards the back door of the Church, and proceeded in that direction—when I got to the inner door of the lobby, I saw two men—Stannard was one, the other was a man named Cox, who has not been apprehended—they bad been trying to get out of the back door, but that being locked, they retraced their steps some few paces to the door leading down to the vaults, where they had originally entered—I did not go down after them, having no assistance—I had employed Deller the whole of that day in wheeling some earth away, about twenty-one yards from the back door of the Church, and Stannard I had employed for an hour and a half, from 11 o'clock in the morning till about a quarter to 1 o'clock, to assist me in fixing some stones, about fifty-one yards from the Church—I saw both the prisoners in custody about 11 that same night—I saw Deller in the vestry that evening; when I went in the second time, he came behind me; I was not aware that he was behind me until I heard him exclaim, "Dear me, what have they been doing?"—I then turned round, and was astonished to find him there—at that time no part of the Church was open by which he could have got in, no legal entrance—the way in which they had got in was through a grating at the east end of the Church; that was loose, and had been so for some time—it would be easy for any one to get in there if the grating was lifted out of its place; it only lay there by its own weight—the inner door of the lobby was broken open; I had seen it safe at 11 o'clock in the morning—besides the iron chest, there was a sheet iron chest taken from off a high cupboard, and a wooden chest from underneath the form, and placed on the top of the form; that had been opened, although not broken open—the table was moved out of its place—Deller had been employed on one occasion before this, assisting in decorating the Church with evergreens on Christmas eve.</p>

I was about five feet from him—he then went down the stairs, into the vaults—I had a candle in my hand—he had no candle—my candle showed a light upon him; with that exception, he was in the dark—my wife was just close behind me—I believe she saw him—I knew the man that was with him—he is out of the way; his name is Cox—it might be some minutes afterwards that I saw Deller; the two men had got completely away before I saw Deller—I formed the opinion that the persons had come in by means of the grating—I do not know that I saw that grating par<lb/>ticularly after 11 o'clock in the day—the grating leads into the vaults; there are no coffins kept there—there is a staircase leading from the vaults up into the Church—there are no steps from the grating into the vaults—you</p>

               <p>are obliged to jump down—the height is about four feet six inches; the aperture is about two feet across, and rather higher than broad—the wall is three feet thick—it is rather a disagreeable passage—you must crawl on your hands and knees part of the way—there are three front outer doors to the Church, and one at the back; one pair; they are double doors—I examined all the doors that night after seeing these men; I found them all locked except the inner door; that had been broken open—that would be done by any persons who had come in by the vault—they could not have come in any other way without breaking the outer door, and that was in a sound state—the two men I lost sight of, must have got out by the same means by which they came in—it would not be more difficult to get out than to get in; I have tried it—it was about five minutes after seeing the two men, that Deller came behind me as I was in the vestry; I was not aware of his presence in the Church until then—he came up, and said, "What is all this about?"—no property was taken—I missed a piece of lead next morning, weighing about 7 lbs. or 8 lbs.; I had seen it safe about 11 o'clock that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. Previous to the night of 30th Dec. I had seen the prisoners about the Church yard—I had not taken very much notice of them, but I had seen them, and had spoken to Stannard that morning—I accompanied my husband and Williams into the Church that evening, when a light had been seen through the vestry window—I saw Stannard in the Church on that occa<lb/>sion, and I saw Deller afterwards, but I did not know that it was him at the time, until I saw him at the police office; when we were in the vestry, some one came up, and spoke to my husband, but I did not see who it was—I believe my niece gave the keys to the clock winder in my presence that afternoon—he brought them back to me, and I then asked him the time—he said, "Seventeen and a half minutes past 4 o'clock M—when he comes to do the clock, we generally ask him the correct time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever been down this grating? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have been near it, in the vaults; the furnaces were there; I could get through it; there is sufficient room—I saw the light in the vestry window in the first instance when the children came to the door—I went over to the Church with my husband—I was a little alarmed, but I did not know whether there might have been any fire—we had had a wedding in the morning, and there had been a little fire left, but I found it was out—as soon as we got in at the back door, we heard some one running up the north aisle towards the front door—I do not believe in ghosts—I could not see at that time who the persons were—I was behind my husband when they passed us—he had a candle—I do not know whether he was frightened—I</p>

From information, I went on Tuesday, 13th Jan., to Mr. Eaton's warehouse, and on Friday, the 16th, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I went with Bull to Spital-square—I saw the prisoner in White Lion-street—he had this parcel—there was no one with him—he went into a public house called Job's Castle—I and Bull, who were both in plain clothes, went in after him—he had some refreshment, and some conversation with some other persons, who asked him if he had got silk in the parcel—he said, "Yes; a piece of silk;" the persons said, "Silk is going up "—he said, "Yes; it has got very much dearer of late "—he left the house, and I and Bull followed him—he walked through various streets till he got to Bishopsgate-street—he called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and got in—we called another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and followed him—he went to No. 14, Hatton-garden—when he alighted we alighted, and as he was going in at the door I took hold of his arm, and said, "We are two police officers, is that parcel your property?"—he said, "It is"—I said, "I think it contains silk, does it not?"—he said, "It does"—I said, "I believe it is stolen property; how do you account for the possession of it "—he said, "That is my business "—we went into the house, and he went into the back room on the ground floor—there is a cupboard in that room, which forms something like a dresser—on entering the room I saw an immense quantity of silk lying on that cupboard—I said, "Here is the remainder of the silk we are looking for"—it was covered with part of a newspaper—I said, "How do you account for the possession of this "—he said, "I shall answer no questions "—I said, "You may consider yourself in custody for being in possession of this silk, and not giving a satisfactory account of it; we believe it to be stolen property, you have an opportunity of telling us who you received it of, if you think proper to do so "—he then said, "I received it from a person of the name of Bacon "—I said, "What Bacon?"—he said, "Bacon, of Anchor-street, Spitalfields; it was left here on Wednesday afternoon; I was not at home "—I asked him if he had seen Bacon since that time, since the silk had been left—he said that he had, and he was going to sell it for Bacon—Bull took possession of the silk, and I took the prisoner to Moor-lane station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Nichol-street, New North-road. I am a fore-man in the East India Company's service. In Nov. the Company received nineteen bales of China raw silk, marked S S N in a heart, Nos. 56 and 74 inclusive—I examined the whole of those bales—our practice is to take out the damaged books, and put them into the last bale—that was done in those bales—there were six damaged books put into the bale No. 74—this book in the paper which the officer took from the prisoner, I pronounce to be the least damaged—here is another damaged book, similar to the one I saw damaged in the bale No. 74—these others are of the same character.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you much to do with silk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, during the whole of the warehouse hours—I have been twenty years in the up warehouse—I have in a week 400 or 500 bales of China silk, but varying in kind and quality—I can tell when silk is of the same <hi rend="italic">chop</hi>—silk of the same <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> would be of the same kind and appearance, supposing the books not to be damaged—this came by the overland route from India—the damage was done in the transit—that is not uncommon—in every cargo I receive, I examine each bale, and seldom fail to find a book damaged more or less, and the damaged ones are put into the last bale—if there were more than twelve books, we should put the most seriously damaged in the last number—it may be damaged by sea water, or by the camels in coming across the desert—the damage to the silk all proceeds from the same cause—this was consigned to Mr. Springfield, I believe—the parties that buy the bales would send for them—the delivery is not my department—I have only the damaged books to enable me to say that those bales were examined by me—if the silk were the same, and the damage the same, these books might belong to other bales—I know those I put into 74 came from those bales.</p>

I was on the back part of those chambers in the afternoon—I saw Richard Fleming cutting the lead off the sky light—he was on the roof of the chambers—I raised the window and asked him what he was doing—he said, "I am going to take this lead off and put new on, and going to take these tiles off and put new coating round here "—I said, "That is all nonsense, it has only just been repaired; what is your name?"—he said, "We are employed here for Chaplin, and have been for some years past" (we took these premises of Chaplin)—I went and spoke to Mr. Evans, who is the superintendent and manager, and when I returned with him, I saw Richard Fleming going across the roofs of the houses with the lead on his shoulder—Mr. Evans said to him, "Hey! where are you going with that lead?"—he said, "It is all right"—Mr. Evans said, "No, it is not all right, it is all wrong"—I then ran into Norwich-court and Mr. Evans into White Horse yard—when I got into Norwich-court I saw Richard Fleming with the lead on his shoulder on the top of the houses—I saw a policeman, and took him into one of the houses that I thought Richard Fleming was on the roof of—we came out of Norwich-court, and I saw Richard Fleming again in White Horse yard and gave him in charge—these pieces of lead were lying on the ground in the White Horse yard—this piece is like the lead that came from our premises—myself and Mr. Charles Pine are the proprietors of them—Richard Fleming had no authority to take any lead from our premises—I have not the least doubt that he is the man I saw on the roof cutting the lead—I examined the place the next morning, and all the lead had been removed from there—the lead had been cut all round a weathercock that was there.</p>

My atten<lb/>tion was called to this about 4 o'clock that day—Keys was coming down the ladder, with something in his hand resembling the size of this small piece of lead—I was about twenty yards from him—I saw it distinctly—the ladder was then thrown across to another wall, thereby no one could go up or come down—in a few minutes my attention was called by seeing Keys and Alfred Fleming standing on the coping of the roof, and they were directing two boys to raise the ladder up to that roof—the boys did not raise it, and there was another lad pushed it up, and just afterwards I saw Keys come down the ladder—Mr. Evans came into the yard, and he said, while Keys was there, "Have you, in any shape or form, given any orders for these men to take lead from our premises to repair yours?"—I said, "No"—he said, "They have brought the lead from our place on to your roof; go up and see it yourself"—I went up, and there was the largest piece of lead lying on the roof—I went a little further, and saw a piece of matting lying in the gutter—I turned that off, and there were two other pieces of lead folded—I said, "Here is the lead "—Mr. Evans said, "You had better have them down"—I threw the two smallest pieces down myself, the largest one I dared not attempt—I got a young man to assist me, and he threw it down—it lay there till Mr. Jones gave the first prisoner in charge—the three pieces of lead were put on my wheelbarrow to wheel it aside, and it was taken to the station.</p>

Cutler was admitted into the workhouse again, and I asked him if he had seen Charlton—he said that he had on Thursday morning—he was then given into custody for being concerned with Charlton in breaking into the place—he made no answer—there is a long range of buildings; the next ward is the infirm ward; then the bad leg ward; then the dead house, and next to that the store room which was broken into—they are all one group of buildings, fifty yards long, and enclosed by a wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a school at-Belmont House, Turnham Green. It is a large house—I have kept it twenty-three years—the defen<lb/>dant applied to me about Michaelmas last to fill the situation of general assis<lb/>tant which was vacant—I had no reference with him, he appeared very plausible in his manner, and being in immediate want of a master, I was induced to let him come—he gave the name of a school bookseller, who gave my name to him; he also gave me the names of two persons whom he had lived with before, Mrs. Dawson and Mr. White—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the rules of my establishment for the assistants to conform with—I gave it to him the first day he came, and he returned it when I paid him his salary—after he had entered my service, in consequence of something which oc<lb/>curred, I wrote to Mrs. Dawson—this letter which I received is in his writing: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"Mr. Clements, Belmont House, Turnham Green. 4, Cor<lb/>nelia Terrace, Barnsbury Park, Jan. 4, 1857.—Sir, As you have endeavoured to injure me in not giving those gentlemen who applied to you a satisfactory testimonial as to my character, thereby taking away my means of sub-sistence, I shall, for I feel it a bounden duty to do so, inform those parents whose sons are under your care, of the gross immorality of your establish<lb/>ment. I ask you, Sir, how can you put forth your lying advertisement in the Times from day to day when you are aware that it is a gross deception? <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, Henry Belcher.") This other letter was given to me by Mr. Duncan, the parent of two young gentlemen in my establishment—it is the defen<lb/>dant's writing: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"Mr. Duncan, Norwood—4, Cornelia Terrace, Barnsbury Park, Jan. 13, 1857.—Sir, I feel it to be a duty incumbent on me to inform you that the establishment of Mr. Clements, Belmont House, is grossly immoral, and that the education of the youth placed under Mr. Clements' care is scandalously neglected. The pupils receive very little instruct<lb/>tion, and that by the assistants. This latter fact may not be of primary im<lb/>portance, but the former is, and I call upon you to consider ere you send your sons where every virtue is blasted. Signed—Hy. Belcher.") I be<lb/>lieve the charges contained in these letters to be utterly false—he did not complain while in my house of immoral conduct on the part of the boys,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to state on your oath that there never was, to your knowledge, any immorality in your establish<lb/>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do, and until it is proved to me I am of the same opinion—I believe there is no immorality existing in my house—a day or two ago I acted on information I received, and discharged a female servant—I can scarcely believe that several boys, who are now here in Court, were sleeping night after night in the servants' room with the servants—until proof is adduced, I am still staggered by it—I can give no further answer—until it is proved; I am still incredulous—I have taken every possible precaution in my power for the strict morality of the pupils, and therefore I am of that opinion—I have heard several of the boys confess it this morning, and I have received information from a parent in Court—I am married, and my wife lives with me at the school, certainly; I am surprised at the question being put to me—my wife has lived at the school twenty-five years; she has always lived there except when she has been away for her health, and when she has lived with my daughter for a short time out of town—I have a house about a mile away from my daughter, and she has some-times been there—she has not left my house for twelve months together—she has never left it at all—I have a housekeeper; a different one to the one that was there during the defendant's time—Miss Nutter was housekeeper then—she is now living in the neighbourhood of London with her friends—she left because she was not equal to it—she was there to assist Mrs. Clements generally—I was always at home except on the half holidays—I was not constantly put in the evenings—I have not come home so late as 12 or 1 o'clock for the last three months—I swear that, to the best of my belief—I have only been out on the hall holidays—I have never been absent but on school, business, or matters con<lb/>nected with the house—I have not been away from the school constantly, leaving it to my assistant; I have occasionally—it is extremely difficult for me to tell whether I have been away three times a week; when I have been called away it has been engagements—I have frequently letters from parties in town requesting me to call—there are two half-holidays in the week—I generally have thirty pupils, or rather under; the last number was twenty-six—I am a Master of Arts—I took my degree from Leipeic—I have not it with me, but I can produce it in two hours—I got it about thirteen years ago, by sending literary productions of my own—I do not mean that they purchased my literary productions by a degree, but they required proof as to my identity—the production that I sent was a Latin theme, which had to be identified in England as my composition, by documentary evidence—it was by writing a Latin theme, and proving it, that I got it—I cannot tell you what I paid—it did not come over by post; it came in a case—I made an application for it—it was not given me from any know<lb/>ledge that Leipsic had of me—my degree is M. A., and Ph. D.—I paid the usual fees for both of those—I do not know how many M. A.'s of that sort there are in the world—I was frequently called away from home by letters—I have letters at night requesting me to go to town next day; and I have letters to answer, and things to order, and bills to pay; but I am always in the school directing the teachers, and seeing that they carry out their instructions—I have two teachers: a Frenchman and an Englishman—the defendant was the Englishman—the Latin and Greek chiefly came to</p>

               <p>me; all the head classes came to me—I have heard of two boys who used to sleep in this woman's room—those were not some boys whom I have now—a boy named Bryerly was subpœnaed here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say that you would not bring him to-day because you had not received a shilling with the subpœna? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I brought him yesterday; I did not bring him to-day because I did not expect the case would come on, as there was a consultation between me and my Counsel—the defendant offered me an apology at the police-court; I did not ask him what he was to state—whether I have been perfectly willing to receive the apology, if I got a retractation of the charges, is a question which I cannot answer—I do not know that he has refused to state that what he said was a lie; because it was the whole truth—my impression is that he declined to make the apology—Mr. Duncan is here—there is another boy, who is in the same predicament as Bryerly, whom I have refused to bring to<lb/>day—I have not heard this from the two boys themselves that I have kept back, that they have frequently been in the habit of sleeping with the servants—I have not pressed them on the subject, and have not heard so from them—they have not stated so to me—this morning is not the first time I have heard anything from the boys on the subject; I called on a gentleman last night who informed me—I did not see either of the boys last night—that was the first specific information I received—I mean to say that I never heard of the boys sleeping in the servant's room till last night—the defendant has never told me that he saw the boys coming out of the girls' room—Watts is one of the boys—the defendant has never called my attention to the peculiar appearance of Watts, and told me that the habits he was pursuing were injuring his health; if he had I should have dismissed the boy—I should not have kept the maid; they would both have been expelled instantly—he has called my attention to Watts's appearance, that was at the latter end of the quarter, immediately after he had had a quarrel with Watts; he said that he suspected, from the appearance of his eyes, that he was in the habit of self abuse; he did not suggest that it was from connection with the woman—the boy is between seventeen and eighteen years old; I called him into the parlour and had a conversation with him—the prisoner was not present.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. T. ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe the prisoner had the control of the bed-chambers of the boys; what was his duty with regard to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here are the rules: "At 8 o'clock, to call the list, read prayers, attend the pupils to bed, enforcing absolute silence and order in all things"—after the boys had said their prayers up stairs and were in bed, it was his duty to lock the doors—there are bolts on each door, and his room is close to their's, so that if they require anything in the night, he would know it; if they got out of the room without his knowledge he must have grossly neglected his duty—I have reproved him before the scholars for striking them, and using improper language—the first time my attention was directed to this parti<lb/>culr fact about these two boys, was yesterday, by a gentleman now in Court, whose son was in the school—I wrote to his friends requesting them to withdraw him from the school at the end of the quarter, but, generally speaking, he has been a very good boy—I think I ought not to mention names—it was the son of that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">pointing to him</hi>)—there was no angry feeling towards the boy in the least—these other rules (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were hung up in the school room—(<hi rend="italic">These related to the conduct of the pupils in school.</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN DUNCAN</hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you satisfied before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not generally satisfied on the point of education; I had one or two points to complain of; but on the score of morality I knew nothing—I cannot say that I thought their education neglected, but there was a want of practical application of theore<lb/>tical rules; they could go through a simple or long division sum, but they could not adapt it when I came to examine them—that would not have prevented my sending them back, because if I had called attention to it, it would have been remedied.</p>

On Friday night, 2nd Jan., I received some information from last witness—she pointed out some particular place to me—I went to Mr. Cooper's the next morning—I got a piece of lead from him—I called in a plumber on the Monday afternoon, and took the lead that I got from Mr. Cooper to the colonnade—it fitted—there were nail holes in the lead, and there were corresponding nails and holes on the colonnade—I am quite certain it fitted—I produce the lead—there is a piece of wood attached to it that fits the woodwork at the top of the colonnade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a rag merchant. The two prisoners came together with the lead produced, on Friday evening between 7 and 8 o'clock—they had been before in the day, about 12 or 1 o'clock, and bought some goods of me, which I have entered in this book—I bought rags and bones of them—Williams</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020102"/>
               <p>asked me the price of lead—I said I would give him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a hundred weight—he said he expected Cordery would bring some, but it would be nothing to do with him—I was then at our shop in Thames-street, at Kingston—Cordery was with Williams, but I believe he was outside, and did not hear him—I stated before the magistrate that Cordery was with Williams—he was with him, but I do not know whether he was outside or inside—I do not know whether he heard the conversation or not; my impression is that he did—they came again in the evening, both of them—Williams was at the shop, and said that Cordery was at the warehouse with the lead—I went down to the warehouse to weigh it—Cordery was there with the lead in a donkey cart—the shop is about five minutes' walk from the warehouse—I weighed the lead, and took the weight and went up to the shop to pay for it—while I was coming up, Cordery asked me if I had a bit of rag, as the donkey was bleeding—I gave him a bit of rag, and he went out, and presently he came back and took the money, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in my presence—my father gave it to him—Williams was not there—I have it entered here (<hi rend="italic">producing a book</hi>)—it was entered the same day that the transaction took place—I have entered it in the name of Williams, as I always book to Williams what I buy of him—I did not think there was anything dishonest about it—I have got down, "paid Cordery"—I put that there at the time—there is "18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—that means, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a hundred weight—I knew Cordery before—I had been in the habit of buying of them for a long time—Williams had not returned before Cordery took up the money—he came in afterwards—I did not hear him say anything more—in a former entry his name is down as "John Williams"—sometimes I entered it as "John Williams," and sometimes as "Mr. Williams"—I am quite sure that Williams told me he had nothing to do with it, but that it was Cordery's matter entirely—that is the piece of lead produced, which I gave up to the officer—Williams was not present at all at the time Cordery made the bargain for the lead—Williams was at the shop, and Cordery at the warehouse—they both go about the country gathering marine stores, and selling them to me.</p>

On the morning of 3rd Jan., about 5 o'clock, I was in bed, and was awoke by a noise—I got up and went to the folding doors, and listened, and thought I heard a noise—I unlocked the folding doors and opened them, and found the prisoner crouching against the door leading into the passage—I saw him by the light of the lamp out—side—I asked him what he was doing there—he said some boys out-side had asked him to get through—I said, "For the purpose of stealing?"—he said "Yes, "I then came on him rather suddenly and seized him by the wrists—I then said he had got himself into a <hi rend="italic">scrape</hi>—I opened the door, took him into the passage, and called out to Mr. Foster, the landlord, and held him while he dressed, and he did the same while I dressed, and then we called a policeman and gave him into custody—he had got in through the window—he had closed the window after him—there is an area railing—this is on the ground floor—there is a ledge outside the window—I should think he could hardly stride across the area.</p>

On the morning of 14th Jan., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I had been to get something for my supper, and as I was coming home I saw the prisoner kicking at the door of a house, and his companion was <hi rend="italic">singing out</hi> to an old woman up at the window, calling her very bad names—she said if he kicked at her door again she would cleave him down with a poker—he kept kicking at the door, and the old woman's daughter came and struck his companion in the face—a young man came and kept the prisoner from hitting her, and he turned round from the door, grating his teeth, and went to cross over towards his companion—he took his knife from behind him—I screamed out twice, "Murder! he has got a knife!"—I said nothing to him—he ran after me round the corner, caught me by the throat with his left hand, gave me</p>

I was called to the police station to see the prosecutrix I found two incised wounds, one on the abdomen, and the other on the forehead, the former about two inches in length and three-fourths of an inch in depth, the latter about half an inch in length, and the same in depth—they were such wounds as might have been produced by such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the wound in the abdomen was a dangerous wound; the cavity was almost penetrated; if it had been, inflammation would have set in, and loss of life would have been the consequence.</p>

I said, "Yes;" we had some beer, and he said, "I want you to drive four cows there; I do not think I shall send them to market; I know a good many people buy beasts of him;" he took me to the almshouses; I waited there till ten minutes to 8 o'clock; I went back, and saw four cows coming; Banks came to me, and said, "Yon understand driving better than I do; drive them on; I will go to Geary's, and get the place ready;" when we got there, Banks was standing at the door, talking to Mrs. Geary; Banks said, "They are mine," and the cows were driven in, and he said to me, "You remain here, and I will pay you for your trouble; tell Geary, if he likes to sell the offal in his name, and the fat in his name, as he generally does; and if you can get a customer for them, I won't take less than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I will allow you the commission, 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a stone;" he gave me a drop of beer, and he said, "If you like the kidneys and tongues, you can have them;"I went in; they knocked the cows down, and whilst doing that, young Mr. Geary came in; I said, "Where is your father?" he said, "He is down at Stratford, he won't be long;" they got one cow up, and Mr. Geary came in; I said, "Mr. Banks has sent four cows, and he said he will be here presently f the cows were dressed, and we went into the room, and had some coffee; we went to Mr. Borritt's; I remained at the door; Geary went in, he came out and said, "He will come down about 10 o'clock;"I took the kidney and a portion of the skirt home with me; I went to Banks; he was not at home; I then went to Mr. Geary, he said, "I have sold the cows for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" he was then taking the fat; I said, "I want the money, what do you reckon they weigh? will you oblige me with half a sovereign?" and he gave me a half sovereign; I went home, and I wanted an article that I had to get an affidavit for; I went to Worship-street, and waited there from half past 2 till 4 o'clock in the Court, to get the affidavit signed; I then went home; I can only say that I know nothing of the transaction; I have a witness to prove that Banks came to my house; I can likewise prove that I did not wear a hat that night, but it is not worth while, because I admit I drove the cows; it must be clear to all that I was not there at hall' past 6 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Slater—street, Bethnal-green, and am a fancy trimming maker. On 22nd Dee. I had a pony, a cart, and harness for sale, and on the 24th Harnwell came to my house about 9 o'clock in the morning—it rained very hard, and he had a waterproof coat on—he asked me if I would allow him to take my pony and cart and harness to show to a customer—I said if he would bring it back safe, but I asked a neighbour named Bolter to go with him to see that he safely returned it—Harnwell was to drive, but they were both in charge of it—I only knew Harnwell by having a card from the place where he worked—that was the reason I let him have it—I instructed them not to sell it or get rid of it in any way; but if it suited the party, I would sell it him if he came to my house—I was to have the determining of whether I would sell it or not—I gave them no authority to sell—on the same night, about dusk, Bolter came back, and brought me a sovereign, which I would not take, and he holds it now—in consequence of information, I went to the house where Day was represented to live; it is at a wharf in Agar Town—Day was not to be seen that night, but I saw him on Christmas morning, and said, "I have come for my pony and cart, I have information that they are here;"</p>

               <p>he called a man named May, who said, "There has been a tall man here this morning, and I am to give the pony to no one but him "—Day had said that it was not on the premises, but was in the country—I said, "Here is my name on my card, which will prove that it is mine, as my name is also on the cart;"May said, in Day's presence, that they were not to be given to me, as he had received directions—I said, "Well, if you will not give them to me, I will go with you to the station house—I showed him this bit of paper, and said, "Is this the piece of paper you sent to me by Bolter, last night?"—he said that it was, and I claimed to have them returned, but he would not—he said that he could not tell whether I was the right man, and he did not want to tell—when Day said that they were in the country, I said that I should go to the station house, and get advice—I did so, and returned with a policeman—we saw Day and May together—Day read this receipt to the policeman, and then said, "Now, if you don't go, I will kick you out"—I said, "I don't wish for that, I will go "—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "Received of Mr. G.

I afterwards heard of a customer, and when I was at Mr. Stadden's shop I said, "You are going out this afternoon, you had better take a walk down and see what that pony and cart are worth, and whether 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. can be made of it;" I went there, and asked Mr. Grout if it was for sale; he said, "Yes," and we went and looked at it; we then went to a public house and got a pint of beer; Stadden said, "Let it come down to my place to-morrow morning, because it wants a little alteration; the pony has got too much white, but he has got a goodish mouth, and by making a little alteration it will fetch a pound or two more;" he said that he would not take a halfpenny less than 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; next morning I went; they put the pony in the cart; I jumped in, and Mr. Grout drove away from his own door himself; he afterwards dropped</p>

               <p>the reins into my hand, and that was the reason I drove; he said to Bolter, "If you do not sell them, I want you to go to another place this afternoon; I went to Mr. Stadden's, and just washed the pony's face, and made him look a little better; I had to be at the Repository in Leicester-square at 11 o'clock, and I left Bolter in the cart, and said to him, "I shall not be gone above 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour, as you want to get home;"I went and looked round the Repository, and saw a man named <hi rend="italic">Watty</hi>, I do not know his other name; I asked him if he had seen a party buying a pony and cart; he looked round, saw Mr. Day, and said, "Here is a man who will buy it;"Day said, "What is the price?" I said, "I do not know;" he went to a public house and asked Bolter whether that was the pony and cart which were for sale; he said, "Yes," and asked 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them; Day said, "I will treat you for fetching me, but it is no use to me at that price;" we had a pint of half and half, and Bolter said, "What will you give?" Day said, "I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" Bolter said, "My master has been offered that over and over again;" Day said, "I do not mind giving you 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" Bolter said, "You shall have it;"Day said that he had not got enough money in his pocket, but asked him to drive to Agar Town; he did so, and I stopped at the public house; all that I was to receive for my trouble was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I expected to get a little out of Mr. Grout; what was done afterwards I do not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in North Woolwich road. On Saturday evening, 10th Jan., about a quarter to 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoners together, and another man with them, standing two yards from the kerb, twelve or fourteen yards from the prosecutor's window—Croker said, "Now is the time;"I thought he meant it for me, and as I had just got my money, and that being a dangerous place, I put two sovereigns into my boot; but he went direct to the prosecutor's window, and made a blow with his hand—I thought he struck the sash; he then struck a second blow, which broke the glass, and drew his hand sharply back, and ran away; French made off with him—Croker moved his hand sharply, but I cannot say whether he threw anything or not—I caught him by the throat as he ran towards me, and he fell down; I took him back to the prosecutor's—he pretended to be drunk—I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far was Croker from the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The distance from me to the Judge, and directly afterwards the pane was broken—I took him into the shop—I did not see the third man go to the window, the other two did—I saw French again on the Monday at Stratford, before the Magistrate—I was not aware that he was in custody; I went to give my evidence against Croker, saw French standing by his side, and identified him—there is not much light in the street, it is very dark till you get about 400 yards further, but you can discern one another—the man who I say was French ran away directly the window was broken; he passed by me towards Barking Railway station; it is a straight road, you turn to the right from the prosecutor's door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines. I came out of the barracks in Francis-street about a quarter to 6 o'clock; that is near the Rose and Crown—I saw the prisoner give another man something behind him—I could not see what it was—the prosecutrix said, in his hearing, that he had robbed her—he said that he had no <hi rend="italic">call</hi> to rob her; he did not want her paltry purse; he had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his pocket—I saw the prisoner give her purse—she said that it was her's, but that that was not all her money—the man who took something from the prisoner said that he would go and fetch a policeman, but he never came back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines. I saw the prisoner and prosecutrix standing together—she said that he had robbed her; he said, "Me robbed you! you are drunk;" she caught hold of him by the skirt of his jacket, I saw his hand behind him with something in it, I could not see what, but he gave a nod to another man who came behind him, to catch hold of it—I did not see the other man take it, but he said that he would go and fetch a policeman, and then the prisoner put the purse into the woman's hand—I saw that the other man never came back—the prisoner said, "I do not want to rob you, I have got as much as 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Richard Attenborough, of No. 8, Bridge House-place, Newington Causeway. On 1st Nov. the prisoner called there in a sort of dog cart, and asked if we advanced money on plated goods—I said, "What sort of plated goods are they?" he produced a sample parcel, and said that he had the rest with him—I said that I should like to see the bulk—I had asked him how much he wanted, and he said, "100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said, "How am I to tell about the quality?"—he said, "It is very easy to do that, because these are marked 1, 2, and 3, and Elkinton marks his goods A B and C;" that, they were his manufac<lb/>ture, and that his No. 1, which he offered me, was equal to Elkinton's letter A in every respect; that there was as much silver on them as there was on Elkinton's, or anybody else's—I do not think anything particular was said about the foundation, but he said that they were equal to Elkinton's in every respect—he said that he wanted the money to take up a bill—he gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and brought an invoice with him; but he took that back again—he said that he was a manufacturer of those articles at Sheffield, or a Sheffield manufacturer, and had a warehouse in Dyer's buildings—he gave me to understand that he made those articles—he said that he had 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of spoons and forks always on hand, at big warehouse in Dyer's buildings—I do not recollect that he said anything about who was the maker of them; he only said that he was the manufac<lb/>turer—I advanced him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them by a cheque—he came again on 4th Nov.—I did not see the dog cart then; but he could not have carried the goods, as he brought ninety dozen, and said that he wanted a further advance to take up a bill—he said that they were the same goods as before, and I lent him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them (<hi rend="italic">looking at a memorandum</hi>)—he came again, I think, on the 15th, which was Saturday, and left the goods, 150 dozen, I think; but I can tell by looking at this paper—I will swear that it is a correct abstract—it was 150 dozen—I did not feel quite confident, and wished to speak to Mr. Attenborough; in consequence of what I said he left them till Monday—he came on Monday, and I went in with him to Mr. Attenborough, who told him he hoped the goods were of the quality he represented them to be; that he did not care how much money he lent him, provided the goods were genuine; but, if he found out that he was cheating him, he would prosecute him; the defendant assured him that they were all genuine goods, and equal to the representations that he made, and he was very sorry that Mr. Attenborough should make such a remark to him—I said, "You warrant these goods to be equal to Elkinton's letter A?"—he said, "So they are"—I said that I did not think they were so good as some we had purchased at his warehouse in Dyer's buildings, for the purpose of testing the quality—he seemed surprised when I showed him his own spoons; put the two together when I said that, and he pulled out a knife to cut the silver off—we thought we had hurt his feelings, and Mr. Attenborough then agreed to lend him the money, and wrote a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was left with me, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, as the defendant could not wait—part of it</p>

B., E. P., which means John Bryant, electro plate—since this has been going on I have learned a little about it—these are very nicely finished; I saw some of them tested, but they did not appear, after testing, as good as Elkinton's; the foundation appeared to be inferior, but as to the quantity of silver on them I do not understand it.</p>

Elkinton's, I should have been perfectly satisfied—Mr. Round, of Sheffield, tested them—some were sent down to him, and Mr. Attenborough had some tested at his own house immediately after we returned from the police Court, on 2nd Jan.—Mr. Round was not present then, he went away to catch the train—they were tested in the presence of Mr. Elkinton's foreman, I do not know his name, and of Mr. Kemp, of London Wall; they were spoons and forks, I brought them from Mr. Attenborough's warehouse, No. 8, Bridge House-place, and gave them to the tester—I saw him test those which I brought from the warehouse—I brought down all that were tested from the warehouse, and gave them into the hands of Mr. Attenborongh, I believe—I did not see the whole process while they were in the tester's hands—I think there were a dozen table</p>

               <p>spoons, a dozen tea spoons, a dozen dessert spoons, and a dozen forks—those were taken from the lot which was pledged with the cutlery on the third occasion, the 17th; we always kept each lot separate—Elkinton charges something like four guineas a dozen for his A table forks—I had some doubt about the matter when I sent to purchase some—I did not know how to strip the silver off, I do not know that there are hundreds of persons who can do it; I understand that only the Birmingham and Sheffield manufac<lb/>turers, can do it—I know that there are assayers—it never struck me to ask the prisoner to allow me to test them—we did get one of those which we purchased at Dyers'-buildings assayed; that was on 2nd Jan., when we had advanced all the money—we did advance more after we purchased some of those at Dyers'-buildings, because we believed his representation to be true; I have never seen spoons or forks with A or 1 upon them unless they are of the best quality—if I wanted the best quality, I should have asked for No. 1—there are a great many of No. 1—I should expect No. 1 of different manufacturers to be as nearly as possible of the same quality: I should take that for granted, just the same as a Hall mark—when they were tested I did not give notice to the defendant for some one on his behalf to be there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you have often found that you have ad<lb/>vanced more money on things than you find you can get for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, sometimes, but we have the change of fashion and other circumstances to consider—we consider, when we take in a lot of goods of this description, that we are dealing with respectable men, I asked him if he was a re<lb/>spectable man, and it was upon his word that I took these goods.</p>

B., E. P., which means John Bryant. electro plate—since this has been going on I have learned a little about it—these are very nicely finished; I saw some of them tested, but they did not appear, after testing, as good as Elkinton's; the foundation appeared to be inferior, but as to the quantity of silver on them I do not understand it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many spoons, silver and plated, have you advanced money on in the course of your career? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This room would hardly contain them—I certainly did say that the defendant said that he had between 6, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property in his place, but what I said before the Magistrate was between 3, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I fancy to myself that just now I did say too much; I did not correct myself as another question was put to me directly—I have got the bill here of the spoons which I purchased in Dyers'-buildings, it is dated 8th Nov.—I believe his foreman made it out—I bought half a dozen of each, the first quality and the third quality; I did not purchase them, but they were purchased for Mr. Attenborough by Mr. Gill, who is a pawnbroker—on silver we can advance nearer to the value than on plated goods, there is always more risk on plated goods, unless they are of undoubted quality; but silver is all the same quality when stamped with the Hall mark, and we must not sell them without—we charge 15 per cent. per annum, and take the goods as security that the money and interest shall be paid at the end of twelve months, but the contract is made for six months—we do not charge the interest when we lend the money—if it is furniture, and is very bulky, we sometimes charge twenty per cent.—Mr. Attenborough is very anxious to lend his money, and if he has good security, he will do it at a less percentage—the dog cart was a good looking thing, it was one of those things which travellers drive out, taking samples of goods—the defendant had no letter showing the quality of his goods, but they were marked 1, 2, and 3, and his initials—if there had been as much silver on these as on Messrs. Elkinton's, I should have been perfectly satisfied—Mr. Round, of Sheffield, tested them—some were sent down to him, and Mr. Attenborough had some tested at his own house immediately after we returned from the police Court, on 2nd Jan.—Mr. Round was not present then, he went away to catch the train—they were tested in the presence of Mr. Elkinton's foreman, I do not know his name, and of Mr. Kemp, of London Wall; they were spoons and forks, I brought them from Mr. Attenborough's warehouse, No. 8, Bridge House-place, and gave them to the tester—I saw him test those which I brought from the warehouse—I brought down all that were tested from the warehouse, and gave them into the hands of Mr. Attenborough, I believe—I did not see the whole process while they were in the tester's hands—I think there were a dozen table</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020147"/>
               <p>spoons, a dozen tea spoons, a dozen dessert spoons, and a dozen forks—those were taken from the lot which was pledged with the cutlery on the third occasion, the 17th; we always kept each lot separate—-Elkinton charges something like four guineas a dozen for his A table forks—I had some doubt about the matter when I sent to purchase some—I did not know how to strip the silver off, I do not know that there are hundreds of persons who can do it; I understand that only the Birmingham and Sheffield manufac<lb/>turers can do it—I know that there are assayers—it never struck me to ask the prisoner to allow me to test them—we did get one of those which we purchased at Dyers'-buildings assayed; that was on 2nd Jan., when we had advanced all the money—we did advance more after we purchased some of those at Dyers'-buildings, because we believed his representation to be true; I have never seen spoons or forks with A or 1 upon them unless they are of the best quality—if I wanted the best quality, I should have asked for No. 1—there are a great many of No. 1—I should expect No. 1 of different manufacturers to be as nearly as possible of the same quality: I should take that for granted, just the same as a Hall mark—when they were tested I did not give notice to the defendant for some one on his behalf to be there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of the Hackney Road, and No. 90, Shoreditch. On 27th Sept. the prisoner came to me, he drove up in a dog cart, and showed me a quantity of spoons and forks, upon which he wanted 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him that they were goods that we did not understand, and which we were not accustomed to see at that end of the town—he said that he was a Sheffield manufacturer of electro-plated goods, and had a ware-house in Dyers'-buildings—he said, "The reason I have come down to this end of the town is, I serve Mr. George Attenborough with goods, and if he sees that I am short of money, when I next take him goods to sell, he will not give me the price for them "—Mr. George Attenborough lives in Fleet-street—I said that we had no means of testing them, and the price was so extraordinary that I should decline them—he said, that there could be no doubt about it, and I need not be at all alarmed, that he was the manufac<lb/>turer himself, he made the goods, and was in a large way of business—he showed me his prices, and they certainly were a great deal—I think he left them, but I have searched for them and could not find them—he said, "Here, you see my prices, I do not want anything near what the wholesale price is," and certainly he asked far below the price on his card—I said, u They may be what you represent them to be, but how can I tell?" he turned to the back of the spoons, and said, "These are my initials, J. B., and the electro plate is my No. 1, it is the best quality, and is equal in quality and quantity of silver to Elkinton's A, and the foundation is of the best quality "—from the fact of his saying that he was the manufacturer, of course he knew what the spoons were made of, and, from his appearance, I agreed to take them, and at a price entirely from the representations he made of himself and of the goods, and believing he knew what was in the goods—I lent him 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid him partly in gold and partly in notes—I have since taken some of them to Mr. Kemp, of London Wall, to be stripped—if I had known what the articles were, as I found them after the testing, I would not have taken them at all.</p>

B., which I received from Mr. Attenborough, and I have them here, with my report—there was a slight difference in the table forks; the others exactly agreed; the table forks were 4 dwts. instead of 2—I have not tested any of those from Cotton's or Russell's (<hi rend="italic">look<lb/>ing at them</hi>), they appear the same description as those I received from Mr. Attenborough—if you will allow me, I can, perhaps, make myself more sure upon that point by just scratching with a penknife (<hi rend="italic">scraping one</hi>); I firmly believe them to be of the same quality as those sent down to me—we put on the silver by electricity applied to a certain solution; the article requires preparation previously to the solution being applied; it is polished after the silver is applied—the prisoner is not a manufacturer at Sheffield.</p>

B." looked bright—the moment the silver disappears from the surface of the article, and you immerse it in water and wipe it, the black appearance disappears like so much smoke—all of these looked bright, and from that I judge that they did not seem to be acted upon—I have seen German silver that has been acted upon, and then, after being put into water, it looks frosted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal salesman to Messrs. Elkinton, in Moorgate-street. I have seen the spoons that were tested by Mr. Round, on the first occasion, at Sheffield—some of them were manufactured by us, not those marked "J. B."—I have another portion here, sealed up—they were tested in my presence, and sealed up by me—I understand the process of stripping—I saw some belonging to Mr. Attenborough, some belonging to Mr. Cotton, and some to Mr. Russell, stripped—there was about as much silver on one of our table spoons as there was on thirty-four of the defendant's—that applies indiscriminately to those produced from Mr. Attenborough's, Mr. Cotton's, and Mr. Russell's—they appeared all alike, and exhibited the same results on testing; the moment one was subjected to the testing point, it immedi<lb/>ately cleared the silver off—previous to testing, each of them was weighed to the nicest grain, in the scales, then applied to the test, and then weighed afterwards—of those that were tested belonging to Messrs. Atten<lb/>borough, Russell, and Cotton, the silver disappeared instantly; those of Messrs. Elkinton's make, after being in twenty minutes, the silver was acted upon—there is no doubt about the test, you could see the silver walk off, or run off—independently of the test, the article itself was such as we should never think of sending out of our house, nor would any respectable tradesman—in some of the instances, as regards the dessert forks and spoons, there was a greater disproportion than in the table spoons—Mr.</p>

               <p>Attenborough, Mr. Russell, and Mr. Cotton were present when I tested them; it was done at Mr. Attenborough's house.</p>

Elkinton's are the first per<lb/>sons in the trade, and are determined to keep so—the price of our large forks is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a dozen, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the small ones, fiddle patterns; the more expensive patterns are 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 41, London Wall, and am an electro-plater and cutler, of the firm of Kemp, Liddell, and Co. I made the test at Mr. Attenborough's; Mr. Cotton and Mr. Parker were present the whole of the time, and Mr. Russell part of the time—the test I used was oil of vitriol, and nitric acid—this is my report, made at the time, and certi<lb/>fied by several witnesses—I did not strip any spoons and forks belonging to Mr. Attenborough, those I stripped belonged to Mr. Elkinton, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Russell'; these are Mr. Russell's, I received them from him himself—on three table spoons, I found 1 dwt. 6 grs. of silver; on three table forks I found 16 grs; on three dessert spoons, 16 grs; on three dessert forks, 13 grs.; and on three tea spoons, 12 grs; that is much more than I found on some others—on three table spoons of Elkinton's, I found 9 dwts. 16 grs.; on three table forks, 7 dwts 12 grs.; on three dessert spoons, 6 dwts. 15 grs.; on three dessert forks, 5 dwts. 11 grs.; on three tea spoons, 4 dwts. 20 grs.—I then tested some of Mr. Cotton's; on two table spoons I obtained 7 grs. only; on two table forks, 6 grs.; on two dessert spoons, 4 grs.; on two dessert forks, 4 grs.; on two tea spoons, 2 grs., being one grain to each tea spoon—I stripped both Russell's and Cotton's in from one to two minutes; by the same process it took me from twenty to twenty-five minutes to strip Elkinton's—the foundation of these articles is third quality metal; it is a very common article—I saw Mr. Round test Mr. Attenborough's; I agree with him as to the value of the test, I did not exactly go into figures with him—I have known the prisoner for about two years—he is not a manufacturer at Sheffield to my knowledge; I knew him as a dealer in London, occasionally travelling in the country, as rather a better class of hawker, supplying hotels and so forth, not travelling as a commercial man—I have not known him with any manufactory; I think he has had the place in Dyers'-buildings about nine months; before that he was at some other building, no great distance from there, Staple's Inn buildings, I think—he had no warehouse there, merely an apartment, a lodging—the place in Dyers'-buildings was fitted up with glass cases, and so on, for his goods, commonly called a warehouse.</p>

               <p>two years I carried on business by myself, partly as a dealer, and also as an agent for several Birmingham and Sheffield houses—we are still agents for some houses—we are not directly manufacturers of plated goods, we say that we are manufacturers of electro plate, and we are justified in saying so; we buy goods of the manufacturers in an unfinished state, and have them plated and finished in London—as a matter of strict fact we are not manufacturers—we do not represent ourselves to the public as manufacturers at Sheffield—we have an establishment at Birmingham for the manufacture of jewellery, but not for electro-plate—the firm there if Bostick—we have been under arrangements with him for five years, to take all he can make; we take the whole of his produce; if any one went there to buy goods, they would be bought in our name; they do not sell to any one but ourselves—we sell plated spoons and forks—there is some great trash made for the Spanish market that is unsuited to any other—it is impossible to cover spoons with a less covering of silver than these; but it is possible to have a brass foundation instead of German silver—I am not an assayer, but we have at times to strip them after plating, where there are certain mishaps.</p>

I saw the prisoner pass my house—just before he passed, when he was just by No. 1, he said, "Mr. Apps, it is a long time since you and I have spoken to each other"—I made a reply, "I hoped it would be a very great while longer"—there was no further remark—he passed two houses further down, and he said that I had been speaking ill of his wife in a public house, and knowing I had not been there, I went down to save his wife from a thrashing, which he was in the habit of giving her—I went to his house, and he said to me, "Go away from my place"—I said I would, and my wife came up and caught me, and said, "Come away"—I said, "I will"—I was just on the point of turning round and he struck me with a hammer—it was not the one produced in Court, it was One much larger—he hit me in the left eye, and said, "Take that, you b——"—I cannot say whether I fell, for I did not remember anything for a day or two—I do not recollect anything after I was struck—I had not said anything to pro<lb/>voke him before he gave me that blow, not one word—my wife was with me when the blow was struck—she caught me by the sleeve, I was in my shirt sleeves—the sight of my left eye is entirely gone—I have been suffer<lb/>ing in my other eye—the doctor says he does not think I shall be able to see to do work much longer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Blackfriars-road. I was called to visit the prosecutor—I found him insensible, and with the left eye very much injured, a portion of the nose and the left eyebrow cut—I have attended him since—the result is that the left eye is entirely lost to him—I believe there are no means whatever of its being restored—the right eye is sympathetically affected, and it will render it impossible for him to pur<lb/>sue his trade for some time—I do not think this hammer could have pro<lb/>duced the wound—there appears to have been but one blow given, and the diameter of the wound is much larger than this hummer.</p>

I was returning to my home after taking home some work when, coming to the top of Hatch-row, I encountered Mr. Apps; he asked me how I did; I said, "Well, Mr. Apps, how are you?" to which he replied, "Oh, I am very well, how are you?" feeling pleased at his speaking to me, for we had not spoken friendly for about seven months, I said, "Are you going to be friends and make up our difference?" he then replied, "We shall never be friends again, see what you called my wife;"I then said I did not speak that foul word to your wife; if that is your temper I will wish you good night, saying as I left him, "See how basely you perverted the words I said to you at the Mitre about my wife;" returning inside my own little shop, I began to put up my tools, it being Saturday night, when Mr. Apps came, and slapping his hand on my counter, said, "You did say that you first met your wife at a low concert room;" I then told him to leave my shop, upon which he said, "Come outside now and I will punch your b—head for you;" he very well knew that the sinew of my right arm was injured that I could not properly defend myself; he kept on using abusive words, when I told him twice more to leave my shop, and he would not, when having my ham<lb/>mer in my hand, and about to put it on my seat, I unfortunately struck him, I knew not where at the time, for which I am ashamed, and shall never forgive myself; what made my excitement worse was the feet of our having all our clean washed linen stolen out of our wash house on Friday night, which upset me all day on the Saturday, and I eat very little all day, and then going out in the evening, and having two glasses of old ale along with a customer, I was very excitable; I did not strike him with a mali<lb/>cious intent; I sincerely regret and repent of what I have done; I have a wife and five children; I have been in prison more than seven weeks already.</p>

I received charge of Edney on 27th Jan., I told him he was charged with having stolen property in his possession—on the way to the station, he said he knew nothing about them—he was engaged by a tall man he knew nothing of—when at the station, he said, "If I must tell the truth, I bought the two barrels of flour of Hart, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a barrel, and sold them this morning to Mr. Malin, a baker, in Bermondsey New-road."</p>

On 27th Jan., I saw him at his own shop, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning—he paid me a little bill, and he said, "I have two barrels of flour to sell"—I said, "What quality?"—he said, "I will bring you a sample," and he brought me round one—I told him I would give him 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that quality—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>.(<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, M</hi> 27). I know Edney—I stopped him twelve months ago, at half past 6 o'clock one morning—he and another man were carrying two sacks of oats—the prisoner was convicted and fined 1<hi rend="italic">l </hi>. or
a month's imprisonment; the other man had two months.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you a record of the conviction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was the policeman in the case—I am sure I am correct—it was not the other man who was convicted for the oats, and the prisoner was fined 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for not having his name on his cart—it was left over for him to be summoned, but he never was summoned—I am quite confident as to that—that was on 14th Jan., 1856—here is a memorandum of it—this is what I call a record.</p>
               <p>Hart's Defence. On 21st Jan. Kirby came to me and told me he had two barrels of sour flour and a sack of barley; he asked me if I could find a customer for them; I said I would try; he took me into the warehouse and drew samples; I saw Edney, and the next morning I met Kirby, and told him I had got a customer at 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the flour, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the barley; I left him and went to the Ship tavern, and in a short time he came and said I might have the goods; they would be delivered any time; I asked him if the order was all right; he said, "Yes;" I asked him what name of the ship I was to put on the order; he said, no name of the ship, but per order lodged; I did as I was desired, and called on Edney and told him he could have the goods, and on the following Tuesday he fetched the goods away; it appears that Kirby received the order from Edney, and delivered the goods on his own responsibility, thereby doing away the validity of the order; Edney gave the order to Kirby, therefore I consider the blame rests on those two persons, and not on me; I only obeyed the instructions of Kirby, who employed me.</p>
