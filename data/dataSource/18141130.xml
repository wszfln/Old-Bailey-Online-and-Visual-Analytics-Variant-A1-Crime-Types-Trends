After our removal to the Isle of Wight, I was absent upon a voyage to the South Sea; upon my return, I found my wife connected with a gang of smugglers; she had taken to drinking, and was in a deseased state; I did every thing to recover her again; it was ineffectual. I placed my wife with Mr. Pearce. I went down to Rye; where I formed an inproper connection with my second wife; her friends were very inportunate with me to marry her; I offered to give a bond of five hundred pounds to marry the second wife upon the death of the first. I obtained no property by either of my wives; I have neither deserted my first wife, or any of my children, to be sure, about a twelvemonth back, my means would not afford me to do as much for them as I had before. I entreat the merceful consideration of the court.</p>

In consequence of my seeing the two prisoners together, I watched them into Bond-street; the girl, Stanley, went to the shop of Mr. Ward, a confectioner, in Bond-street; the other prisoner passed on a little way, looking in the shop windows, apparently as if waiting for her coming out, and when Stanley came out of Mr. Ward's shop, she went to Luscombe; from Bond-street, they both turned down Stafford-street; there Stanley went into a shop; I was not sure which shop she went into; as I was passing along, I saw Stanley come out of a stationer's shop with a sheet of paper in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came out of the stationer's shop, did she join the other woman then - A. Plank will speak to that. I went into the shop; I ascertained she had been changing some money there; I saw Mr. Kirby, and found she had passed a bad sixpence there. When she came out, she went into Albemarle-street, into a pastry-cook's shop, and the other woman walked on two or three doors following, waiting for her. At the pastry-cook's shop she uttered a shilling; she came out. I went into the shop to make enquiry, and when I came out, I lost the two prisoners, and Plank to. I kept strait down Piccadilly, thinking I should meet them, and when I came back again, I saw the two prisoners, and Plank following them, I joined Plank.

            ; I went into Mr. Spencer's shop; I discovered that some money had been changed there. The young prisoner was in the shop, she had got a large shawl on, and had got a loaf or a roll in her hand. Mr. Spencer was in the act of taking some halfpence out of the till to give her change; I laid hold of the prisoner's hand; I then desired Mr. Spencer to look at the money he had taken; I told Mr. Spencer that she was a common utterer, to be particular in marking the money he had taken of her. I told the prisoner that she had got something in her hand; she was scuffling with me; she dropped something from her hand upon the floor; it was money; I picked it up from the floor, and put it in my hat, and what I found upon her; I also put into my hat three shillings and two-pence in copper, that was the money that dropped down, and what I found in her pocket together; I had mixed them; there is one shilling bad; the others I believe are good, a three-shilling bank token, two good shillings, a counterfeit shilling, and two-pence in copper. The other prisoner was brought in by Plank. I searched the old woman; in her right hand pocket I found three shillings and two-pence three farthings in copper, in the same pocket eight good sixpences; I believe they are good. I then asked her in the presence of the other prisoner, if she had any counterfeit money on her person; she said, she had not. I searched her further; I found forty sixpences; thirty-nine of them appear to be counterfeit, and one good. I have them here. I spoke to both the prisoners; I asked them if they knew each other; they denied having any knowledge of each other. This is the shilling found upon the old woman; I looked at the sixpence uttered to Mr. Spencer; I desired him to mark it; he did, and delivered it to me. I have had it ever since, and have it now to produce.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Foy on Tuesday the 22d of November, in Bond-street. I first saw them in Oxford-street; they were together walking and talking. I saw the young one go into several shops. I saw her go into one shop in Oxford-street; the other waited for her coming out, two doors off; they joined immediately; they crossed Hanover-square into Bond-street. The young one went into Mr. Ward's shop, the other remained a short distance off as before; she did not stay a quarter of a minute in the shop. Immediately she come out the two prisoners joined; they went down Bond-street. When they came to the corner of Stafford-street, the young one went into the shop at the corner of it. The young one turned to the left into Stafford-street, and the old one went town into Albemarle-street. I kept my attention to the old one. I saw the young one come down towards her in about two minutes; the elder waited for her; they joined company immediately; the younger one gave the other some money; what it was I do not know; by the whiteness it was silver. They conversed a minute together or so. I saw the elder receive something from the younger; they stopped at the White Horse, and close to that there is a confectioner's shop. The young one went into it; she come out very quick, and was eating of something; and she delivered something from her hand to the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could you see what it was - A. No; I did not go near enough for fear of being known; they then passed on together. I told the last witness to go into the shop; they passed on towards Hyde-park corner. There is a pastry-cook's shop in Piccadilly; they passed the pastry-cook's shop; they stopped and consulted together; the old one gave the young one a piece of money what it was I do not know. I was on the other side of the way. Stanley then went to the shop window, took up a cake, and gave something into the hand of

               <p>Q. What day was this - A. Tuesday the 22d of November. On the Thursday following I called again; I received the sixpence of her which I had desired her to mark before she gave it me. I have had it ever since. On the Tuesday after I came out of the shop, I immediately pursued the prisoners; they went on towards Hyde-park. Foy was in company with me. I had just met with him. I kept near the prisoners; they passed on until they came to that gate; the young one received something of the elder prisoner again, I could not see what it was; she went to the lodge; I saw her take up some curds and whey at the window; she gave some money to a child at the window within the shop, that child is not here. The child gave her some change, I supposed it to be some halfpence, I was not near enough to distinguish; the other one was walking just round the corner, close to the lodge. The young one then delivered something to the old one; they passed on down the right-hand side of the road to Knightsbridge. When they came near to Mr. Speneer's shop, the baker, the elder one passed on about two doors past the shop, and the young one went in. Foy and I went into the shop after her. In about a quarter of a minute the elder one stepped and looked back. I went on to the elder prisoner; she was standing with her right hand in her pocket, and her left was closed. I went behind her, and took hold of the wrist of her right hand and drew it out of her pocket, and at the same time I took hold of her left hand, and with some difficulty, I opened her left hand. In it I found these two counterfeit sixpences. I took her back into Mr. Spencer's shop, where I found Foy and the other prisoner. I held her hand while he searched her; I heard Foy ask the question which he has stated; each of them denied any knowledge of each other. I never heard them acknowledge they were relations.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 22d of November, a person coming to your shop window - A. I recollect a person; I do not know the person; she asked me at the window for a penny almond cake; she gave me a sixpence; I took the sixpence and gave her fivepence change. I put the sixpence into the till; there were two other sixpences in the till, and three or four shillings in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the two other sixpences before that - A. I know the two other sixpences that I before had taken were different from this other. I knew the two sixpences in the till by being large sixpences, and much battered. Plank came immediately to the shop window, after I had served that person. I shewed him that sixpence I received of that person. I am sure the sixpence I received from that person I shewed to Plank. He desired me to put it by, for I should be called on again. No person had come to the window between the time I took it and the time I shewed it to Plank. I rolled the sixpence in a bit of paper, it was put into a box in the parlour. On Thursday afterwards Plank came to me, I delivered him the sixpence; he desired me to mark it. I did so; this is the sixpence to the best of my belief; I put a cross upon it; that is the sixpence I received of the young woman that came before Plank.</p>

               <p>Mr. Nicoll. It is a counterfeit sixpence, like the one produced first with the same mark; there is a figure of 8 upon it.</p>

            . I am a baker at Knightsbridge. On the 22d of November, the young prisoner came into my shop, she asked for a twopenny loaf. I served her; she gave me a sixpence, I gave her fourpence change; no person came in after before Mr. Foy; he came in in the space of a minute or less; he said this is an utterer of base and counterfeit money, I should be glad to look at the sixpence. I turned round to get the sixpence; I had put it on a bit of paper in the bowl of money, it was mixed with no other sixpence. I shewed Foy the sixpence, and by his desire I marked it. I gave it Mr. Foy. This is the sixpence, I marked it at the edge with a knife. In the scuffle the fourpence and the loaf were put on the counter both; some customers came in, and there was a confusion.</p>

            . On the 7th of October, I was coming from Sloane square, between seven and eight in the evening; my way lead <placeName id="t18141130-4-crimeloc20">near the Five Fields</placeName>

I met him, I was alone, and he was alone; as far as I saw he was dressed as a military man, but not quite so well as he is now. As soon as I passed him, he fetched me down immediately. He gave me a blow with a stick that he was walking with; he hit me upon my head, that blow knocked me down; a very little thing will knock me down, I am in years, I was perfectly sober, I had taken nothing to drink since I had porter at my dinner. When I was knocked down he kept hitting me; I was sensible. I got hold of his stick. I said to him, now what use is your hitting me, when you have got all my property. I had a bundle in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the bundle out of your hand - A. I fancy when I was knocked down the bundle fell out of my hand, I did not see my bundle again after I had been knocked down. When I laid hold of his stick and said, what use is it of your using me ill, when you have got my property, he made me no answer, he got the stick away from me, and hit me two or three times on the head after that; I believe somebody came by, he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person assist you to get up - A. Yes, that person is here. I was so disordered I could not speak; that person is here; he took me to a Mr. Marr's, a green-grocer, in Five-field row. When the prisoner was with me, I could see this house by the light of his shop; it was not a light night, there was a moon, but it did not shine; he took my hat away too. The prisoner took my hat; he said I will have his hat, I saw him take up my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner came up, did you look about on the ground for your bundle - A. No.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18141130-4-person105">Q. </persName>
            Did your hat fall off when you fell down - A. Most likely; at the green grocer's a constable came in by chance; I was taken to St. George's Hospital. I continued in the hospital a fortnight; after I was taken to the hospital, the prisoner was brought in the next morning; then I could not speak at all through the blows I had. Before this happened I had a good speech; I could speak better than I can now. When he came to me my sight was perfect; I knew the prisoner perfectly well; I am sure he is the man. I was so bad from the blows I could not speak.</p>
               <p>Q. When this happened, was there light enough to distinguish the countenance of a man - A. I certainly did take notice of the man, he met me, I was going one way, and he the other. There was light enough for me to be quite sure of him. I saw him once or twice in the hospital; I continued to be certain he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was you able to speak that he was the person? - A. The nurse at the hospital is here, she can tell you better than I can.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you in this bundle - A. I had two shirts, two white neck handkerchiefs, and two coloured ones, and a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you - A. I have been a hatter; my eyes will not let me work at my business, I now live at home with my family in Jermyn-street; I have not seen any of my things since; I always said I was satisfied he was the man.</p>

            . I live at 24, Sloane-terrace, Sloane-street, Chelsea. On the evening of October the 7th, between seven and eight, as I was coming over the fields, I found Mr. Larkum in the road lying; there was a person by him like a watchman; Mr. Larkum held out his hand to me; he could not speak; I lifted him up, and led him to Mr. Murrell's, a green grocer; I was coming towards London, the same way as Mr. Larkum was, until I came up to him; I met nobody at all; I found him bleeding; he was not able to speak. I took Mr. Larkum to the house of the green grocer, and there I left him. I did not go to the hospital with him; I had no thought of a robbery until I got him into the green grocer's; he was not able to speak; he had a pen and ink, and wrote what he had lost; that is what he has already stated here; that is all I know. I observed the bruises upon his head, a blow behind the ear, and a violent blow on the temple. It was near eight o'clock when I first saw Mr. Larkum; he had no hat on, nor did I see any hat on the ground.</p>
               <p>MARY HENDERSON. I am a nurse in St. George's hospital; I saw Mr. Larkum when he was first brought into the hospital. On Friday evening, a quarter past ten o'clock, he appeared to be very bad indeed about the head; there were three violent blows about the head; he could not utter a word; he continued several days so as not to be able to speak, so as to understand what he said. On Saturday morning the prisoner was brought to me for him to look at;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300007"/>Larkum saw him; he could not speak a word at that time that I could understand of him; he did not wish to be bothered; he snook his head, and appeared not wishing to be troubled, and the man was taken away. I saw the man brought; there the second time. I believe the next Wednesday; he was a little better; he was perfectly sensible the whole of the time; he could speak then, but not perfectly; directly the man came into the room, he said that was the man. Larkum was in the hospital a fortnight.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 7th I was out on duty; I went to the green grocer's, and there I found Mr. Larkum; they were rubbing his head with brandy. I went to the York hospital for a doctor; I could not see any. I then got two men to carry him to St. George's hospital; I did not go with him; I went to look for the man that had robbed him; I went all round the Five Fields; I found nobody that night. The next morning I went to St. George's hospital; at that time the prisoner was brought into the hospital by one of the Bow-street officers; he had some books in a green bag and a hat; the prosecutor was asked whether that was his hat, and he was asked whether he was the man; he shook his head, and made no reply; he held his head down the whole time. On the 18th I received information that Mr. Larknm was going to leave the hospital, and that he wished to see the man that had been brought in before. On the 19th I went to the York barracks, Chelsea; I asked the colonel to let me have him; he granted me liberty; I took him to St. George's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the first time - A. The first time was about the 8th he was taken; this was on the 19th, twelve days after. Mr. Larkum was sitting by the fire; he turned round and saw the prisoner, and exclaimed, that is the man that robbed me, and nobody else. I then took him to the watch-house, and from there to Marlborough-street; I told Mr. Larkum there were many men alike; he was positive to the man; Mr. Larkum did not come to Marlborough-street office for a week or ten days afterward,</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street office. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday the 8th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; I saw him in the Five Fields, Chelsea, near the Crown and Anchor; it is called Chelsea, but it is in the parish of St. George's; he was coming to town. I knowing him to be a soldier in the 21st regiment of foot, and seeing him in a state of intoxication, I asked him where he had been, and why he was so far from his barracks; he said he had been to town; he had a green bag in his hand; in the green bag was a dictionary, grammar, and school books; he had also a hat in his hand, besides the one he had on his head; I recollecting what had happened on the night of the 7th, I took him in custody. That hat was shewed to Mr. Larkum in the hospital; he signified that was not the hat, nor was the prisoner the man; he could not speak so plain that I could understand him; but by the motions of his hand, by all his motions, I understood that he was not the man, and that the man was taller than the prisoner, I know that night was a very dark night; I can hardly recollect a darker night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence I had neither art or part in robbing that man; he might as well swear against a man in France as to swear against me; he has sworn false. My regiment is in America; I have been between four and five years in a French prison.</p>

            . On the 29th of October my master sent me out to watch; some people had been breaking his fence. I was armed with a musket and a bayonet; I heard some people breaking his fence about eleven o'clock; I pursued them, and overtook them; I saw two men at the near the end of the field; I saw Remington with some fence under his arm; he was one, and

I saw Barnfield the next morning at Bromley; I asked after my musket; he said he fancied I was in a dream; he went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people by at the time he took the piece from you - A. No; I did not follow him. On the Wednesday following I had him taken up.</p>

I had been up in my room about an hour before; when I left the room the window was shut, and the gown in my box; and when I went up at ten o'clock the gown was gone, and the box was open.

            . I keep the public house; it is in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. When my servant went up stairs, I was in the bar. It was on Saturday November 12th; she went up stairs between eight and nine to carry her gown up, after it was dark some time; when she came down the key was brought into the bar to me; she went again between tween ten and eleven. I sent her up to bed; in about two minutes she came down again; she came to me; she said somebody had robbed the room; then I went directly into the yard, where I saw the prisoner laying in the yard, under the ladder, on his back, with the gown under his arm, without a hat on. I lifted him up and took this gown from him, and took him into custody. I asked him how he came in the yard; he made me no answer; there was nobody with him as I saw. I got some man to take him to the guardhouse.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300009"/>There was a ladder in my yard; my house was under repair; I had not seen him in the house that night. This is the same gown, I took it from him myself.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors I was in the act of weighing the bee's-wax; I ordered the prisoner off. Mr. Blenkarn was by he asked him what he had got. He said nothing. I went up to him, and took between two and three pound of bee's-wax from his pantaloons. I had ordered him off two or three times before; in his breeches I found two or three pieces of bee's-wax; he said he had daily put a little bit in his breeches to clean a hat. He hoped I would not send him to the Compter. It weighed eight pounds and a half; it is worth three shillings or three shillings and sixpence a pound.</p>

            . I am warehouse-keeper under the firm as before. On the 11th of November, I received six bales of worsted hose into the warehouse. On the 16th I received information against the prisoner, that he was committing a depredation. I was in the accompting-house. I went from the accompting-house into the yard. I found seven pair of stockings upon him; he begged forgiveness. I would not allow it. These were the stockings I took from him. They are the stockings we had in the warehouse.</p>

            . I am waiter to these gentlemen. On the third of November the prisoner came into the bar. He ordered a rump-steak and sauce. I missed a spoon. On the 4th the prisoner came; he ordered a lunch; he had it; he came in again at four o'clock, and had liver and bacon. I handed him a spoon. After dinner the prisoner ordered half a pint of porter; I cleared the dishes away, and took it directly. I took the spoon away from the plate, and put it into the tub that we wash the plates, glasses, and spoons. The prisoner had the half pint of beer which he had not paid me for. I was called down stairs to bring up a steak. On my returning up, I met the prisoner on the stairs. I told him he had not paid for the porter. He took some halfpence out of his pocket, and paid me; he let some of the halfpence drop on the stairs; I took the steak up stairs; I looked in the tub, and missed the spoon. I followed the prisoner, and caught him in Bartholomew-lane. He asked me what I wanted with him. I told him I suspected he had got a spoon. He said he had not got any thing of the kind. was welcome to search him. I told him to come back to my master; he came back with me; he then took the spoon out of his pocket, and gave it me.</p>

The prisoner Mallard caught hold of me by the arm; she wanted me to go with her to a house in Shoe-lane. I told her I could not conveniently go with her. She had then hold of my arm; she dragged me towards the end of Shoe-lane, and the other prisoner followed. The watchman was going the half hour after twelve. I told them I could not go with them; then the watchman coming at the time, was the consequence of my walking up Shoe-lane with them. When we stopped I told Mallard I had no money in my pocket, it was useless to stop me. She shook my pocket, and said, here is some halfpence here in your inside waistcoat pocket, give me them to get something to drink; and while I was feeling for them, I gave her three halfpence. I felt my watch drawn out of my fob. I immediately charged Mallard with taking my watch, and that he had given it to the other girl; that moment I charged her with it. I saw her shuffle her hands to the other prisoner, who was standing on her left-hand side. I insisted upon her giving me the watch, or she should go to the watch-house. She said she had not got it. I was confident she had. I took hold of the prisoner's hands; the other prisoner, which I supposed had got it. She said, Oh God, you have dropped it. I said, it was not likely I should drop the watch, I never dropped a watch for seven years. She said, go back and search for it. I said I would not go back, without they both went back with me. I saw the prisoner which I supposed had got the watch stoop and look down an area. They did not find the watch. I gave charge of them to the watchman; they were taken to the watchhouse, and there searched; the watch was not found on them. The constable went out to look for the watch, and found it in a hole in the wall where we had been standing; he found it in the hole in the wall by taking a brick out of the wall.</p>

About half an hour after the prisoner came back, he rung the bell, he said, Scotch Jack had sent him for the trunk, he said, he was going further than he expected, and will be late before he comes back, he was going back to the wharf, Mr. Wilkinson desired he would take the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man - A. Yes, I am; I know him by his voice, person, and dress, and every thing. Ryan, the porter, came at eight o'clock; he asked for the trunk; I told him the little man that he sent for it, had taken it away; Ryan said, he had sent no man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday afternoon, the 28th of November, I was going up Holborn, I saw the two prisoners in company with another man; knowing their persons, I followed them about an hour, and there they followed every genteel person almost that was walking up and down Holborn; I followed them into Turnstile, and there they followed the prosecutor and another gentleman; the one not in custody, pulled the handkerchief out a little way, the two prisoners immediately closed the gentleman, and the prisoner Chapman took the handkerchief out, and put it in his pocket. I apprised the gentlemen of his loss, and told him to wait there until I returned with the prisoners; they went down Coal-yard, in Drury-lane, and I met them at the other end of the Coal-yard; when I got in the Coal-yard, the prisoner Chapman had got it in his hand wiping his nose with it; all three when they saw me coming down the Coal-yard, were making away; directly they saw me coming down the Coal-yard, they all set off running as hard as they could ran; I laid hold of Chapman, and Rice was catched in Drury-lane, and brought to me there; I am sure Rice is the other man; I am quite sure of the two prisoners. I searched Chapman, and found the handkerchief in his coat pocket; he put it in his coat pocket directly he saw me come down the Coal-yard. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Dundee. Look at that handkerchief - A. It is my own handkerchief; the initials of my own name are on it.</p>
               <p>Chapman's Defence. A young man came up to me, and asked me to purchase a handkerchief; I told him I had no money.</p>
               <p>Rice's Defence. I was coming from the India House, I met Chapman and a young lad with him asking him to purchase a handkerchief; Johnson came and took me into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that shop robbed at any time - A. Yes on Sunday, the 23rd of January; I left the house between seven and eight o'clock, leaving the door upon the spring lock; it was dark at that time of the year; I shut the door after me, and pushed the door to see it was fast. After I shut it, I left no one in the house. I returned to my house about half past ten; when I came back, I found my door nearly closed, but not locked, so that I could push it open; I went in; I found eleven pair of boots missing, and seven odd ones; they were all new boots, and were in the shop when I left it that morning, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any violence done to your house - A. No, except the door was open: there was no other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300013"/>violence then that. My partner was out. I was the last that went out; there was nobody there but myself when I left. There is nobody lives in the house but me and my partner; there is no family. On the Monday morning we gave information at the police office, Marlborough-street, and Foy afterwards discovered some of the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see any part of your property that you missed - A. It might be three weeks afterwards. They were brought to the police office. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner Bird - A. No, he was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOY. I am an officer. In consequence of the information that Mr. Arnold gave at our office, on the 14th of February last, I took in custody a person of the name of Clarke, who had offered some boots to sell, which afterwards turned out to be Mr. Arnold's; he was committed for re-examination; in consequence of his being apprehended, I took Joseph into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch with a watch ribbon, key, and two silver tea spoons from your chambers - A. I did on the 10th of October, in the morning; I perceived the loss about eleven o'clock in the the morning; about ten o'clock in the morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300014"/>opened my street door, it being a fine morning: I left both outer door and inner door open; I left my watch on the breakfast table, and two silver teaspoons; my chambers consist of a front and back room on the same floor, the kitchen is below. I retired for something less than a minute to the back room; I remained in the back room but a short time; I perceived by the sun that came into the passage, the shadow of two persons that lottered in the chamber, or at the door; I came to see what they wanted, and found the two prisoners in the passage, within the chamber; that is, I found Leary, and the other I will not positively swear to the face of the other; I found two persons, of which Leary, the younger, is one of them; I detained Leary; the other made off. I asked Leary what business he had there; he gave me an answer, that he wanted Mrs. Jones, or some such person, whose name is printed on the top of my chamber. The precipitation which one had ran off, I thought it was not right; I looked on the table; the watch, and tea-spoons were gone; I immediately called after Leary, who was making after his companion, he was going towards the gateway, the gateway into Middle Temple-lane, where his companion was waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, you were less than a minute in your back room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible that any other person should come and take these, unless they were companions of this party - A. Impossible; the room was very small. I was gone scarcely half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us that two or three boys were waiting in Middle Temple-lane; can you be certain that the other prisoner was one of these boys waiting - A. I cannot positively swear to his face; his height and appearance exactly answers to the description of the boy. He was taking before the sitting magistrate at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Leary searched in your presence - A. Not in my presence; nothing was found upon him whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your watch and tea-spoons since - A. I have found part of the property; he was detained five days; I was not able to get sufficient evidence of the property, and the property not being found, Leary was discharged. About a fortnight afterwards he was taken up upon some other occasion; his youth and humane interposition got him a place in the philanthropic reform, where I heard he made a confession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any person in your hearing, tell him it would be better for him to disclose who were his accomplices - A. The confession was voluntary on his part, I heard no promise of favour, or threat of punishment. I heard by accident that he was in this society; I called; he confessed that he, and one Harry, in company with two boys, called Jack Hill and Mackey, had been that morning on a party of plunder; that he and Harry had entered the chambers, my chambers; that he had waited in the passage while Harry went and took the property. He charged the lad Harry, that Harry told him in going out, that he had taken a thimble, meaning a watch; Leary explained it as a cant word, meaning a watch, and after he had been discharged on my account, he had received one pound seven shillings and sixpence of one Kelly as part of the plunder, as part of the produce of the watch and spoons; he mentioned the spoons, and having been disposed of to Kelly for one shilling each.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where this Kelly lived - A. He keeps a public-house in Rose-street, near St. Martin's-lane, and on the evening of the day, on which he had been discharged, he, Kelly, had shewn him this same watch which he had not before seen, and said, this is the watch I bought of Harry for five guineas; Leary gave me a description of the watch, which was a peculiar watch which answered to my watch; it was a very peculiar watch indeed, he described my watch accurately; he stated moreover, that the chain had been concealed by Mackey, by one of the four, under the floor of a certain coffee shop in the Seven Dials, a steal chain covered with ribbon my watch had; he had concealed it through a hole in the floor, and that this Harry was in the habit of wearing the ribbon and the key of my watch. I was anxious to ascertain the truth of this story, and to bring the receiver to Justice. I asked him if he could lead me where it was likely to find the other parties, and assist me to find out this Kelly; for that purpose I took him out of this society by the leave of this society; he was in the reform part of the institution; he went with me to Bow-street; we went to the coffee shop, where we found the ribbon as described; we found the chain exactly where he had described it to me; he was with us at the time; it was under the floor as he had described. We next proceeded after Harry; he took us to his place of residence, he was not there; he took us to his mother. This Harry was recognised by Leary, and at last we found the person that he called Harry by the mother in Clerkenwell prison; Harry is the boy now charged in the name of

On Saturday, the 5th of November I went to my bed-room about eleven o'clock in the morning, on my going into the room I observed William Green, the prisoner, under my bed, I saw his legs under the bed; I gave an alarm; I called down to my servant; I was outside of the door; I called my servant up, my witness came up James Styles.</p>

             came up, had the person came from under the bed - A. No, he had not moved.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose when 
               <persName id="t18141130-25-person293">
                  James

             came up, then you and he went into the room - A. Yes, I went up for some change; I missed the box, and five pounds in silver. Styles asked him what he did there; he said, nothing. He got from under the bed; my witness Styles rather pulled him from under the bed; I believe he pulled him from under the bed; I saw his whole person; I knew him, he had lodged in my house a month or five weeks. My box of silver was under the bed where he was laying; I took the box up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you use to keep that box - A. In my drawer, in my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that drawer locked - A. I don't know; I sometimes locked in; I cannot say whether it was then locked or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you last went to that box, and saw it in that drawer - A. On Saturday morning, about ten o'clock in the day; I counted five poundsworth of silver in the box that morning; at ten o'clock I left the box in the drawer; I went up at that time for some change.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the prisoner was taken from under the bed, did you look at the drawer, and see whether it was open or any keys in it - A. The drawer was a little way open.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found this box under the bed, was any thing said to the prisoner about it - A. I found the money in the box as I left it; my witness searched him, and found no property on him, but the box under the bed where he was laying; the box was shut with the money in it; the money had not been taken out of it. I don't know whether I said any thing to the prisoner about the box and money. This is the box, it is a screw box; it holds five pounds; it was shut as it is now. I lost nothing at all; the prisoner always conducted himself well before, and he had been ill about ten days, and had not worked.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith, at Potters Bar. I was alarmed by Mrs. Darnell; I was at work in my shop, there was a great alarm; I ran out, and up stairs immediately. When I went into the room Mrs. Darnell stood at the door; I asked what was the matter; she said, there was a man in the room. I looked, and saw part of a man underneath the bed; I catched hold of him, he immediately came from under the bed. I asked him what he did there; he said, he did not know. I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300016"/>whether he had got any money, and what he had got about him. I searched him; he had only three or four halfpense about him. I found nothing about him; I looked under the bed, I saw a box; I called Mrs. Daniel, and told her the box was under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the box been missed before that - A. Not to my knowledge; she took the box up from under the bed; I asked the prisoner whether he put it there; he said he did not know that he did, that is all that passed. I took him in custody, and took him before a magistrate. Mrs. Darell opened the box in my presence; she said all the silver was right, five pounds.</p>

               <p>Mr. HALL. I am a pawnbroker in High-street, Mary-le-bone. The prisoner pledged at my shop four yards of lawn for thirteen shillings; he said it was his own, he had purchased it in Oxford-street, for his sister; I told him I doubted his statment. He then said, he lived at 129, Oxford-street, it was his master's property. I delivered the lawn to a constable of Mary-le-bone; I requested him to take him to 129, to ascertain the fact; I delivered the prisoner with the lawn; this is the long lawn, I marked it, it is the same.</p>

Yes, I do; it is a remnant of long lawn; there is a mark upon it of my own; I know it to be my master's property; it is worth about fifteen shillings, there is four yards of it. I never authorised the prisoner to take it, or have sold it; the officer brought it me on the 5th of November, I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

My brother in law, father in law, and a ship lad were in my shop. While we were taking in the biscuits, a boy came in, and told me we were being robbed; about half an hour afterwards Mary Welch came into the shop; I asked the boy by who, and where, and immediately went into the street. I saw no person; I asked him by whom I was robbed; he said by two women, they had broken a pane of glass, and had taken the bacon out. He pointed to the other side of the way, saying, the two women were in conversation together; the boy is here. I went across the street by the boy's direction; one of the women had a great coat on, I saw her walking towards Long Acre; her name is

I was in Belton-street between six and seven in the evening talking to some of my playmates; and while I was talking, a boy came up to me and said this woman had broken the window and taken out some bacon; I did not see it; the boy that told me is not here; I said I would stand a little time, and see if she would do so again. I saw a woman with a great coat on go to Mr. Gosling's window; she seemed to stand a little time with her face towards me, and then she turned her face towards the window; she stopped there about half a minute, and came away with one piece of bacon in her hand, under her coat, with the other arm across, holding the great coat over it; she crossed over the way to another woman that she joined, and they both went to a passage together, they seemed to come out of the passage nearly together; this woman with the great coat on walked up a little towards St. Giles's; she came back again and walked across the way to the window again, and came from the window in the same manner. A little time after I went up Belton-street with the lad, and gave Mr Gosling intelligence; we then saw the same two women in conversation together, that is all I saw. I told Mr. Gosling.</p>

            to Gosling. These are the same women that the boy Bradey pointed out to you; are they not - A. He told me they were the two women; he did not point them out, he said two women, I had no clue at the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window of your shop broken - A. The glass was cracked, probably there might be a hole for a finger and thumb to go in; there was not a whole big enough to take bacon out; the pile of biscuits were piled up, so as to screen the window from my sight; afterwards when I took the women, almost all the glass was cut; I found the bacon was gone, and then I found the glass was broken. I examined, with Saint John the constable, and my father; my bacon laid near the window that was so broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bacon the constable has produced - A. The bacon that I had in the window looked like this bacon; this bacon answers to the description of my bacon; I am confident it was taken through the window; the window was broken on purpose to take it out.</p>
               <p>Galloway's Defence. I work for a woman that lives up at Mr. Gosling's house, in the army clothing; when I was stopped, I had no bacon about me.</p>
               <p>Welch's Defence. In going through Belton-street a woman asked me to buy a bit of bacon cheap; I gave her half-a-crown for a large bit of bacon, and fifteen pence each for the other bits.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 17th of November did you lose any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300018"/>handkerchiefs - A. On the evening of the 16th I lost some handkerchiefs, how many it is impossible for me to say; several I lost, I do not know how many.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of the shop - A. From off the counter. The prisoner and another man came into my shop on the 16th, about ten minutes before nine o'clock, and asked the see some silk handkerchiefs; the prisoner was looking at some silk handkerchiefs as well as the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say he wanted to see silk handkerchiefs - A. Yes, he asked as well as the other; I heard him speak; I was in the middle of the shop; I went up to the top of the shop; I saw his companion take the handkerchiefs off a bundle, and put them under his coat, and run out of the door; I immediately called and said, stop thief. I laid hold of Hedger; I said stop, your companion has stolen some handkerchiefs,</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner Hedger offered to run away - A. He had offered to run away, his back was towards me; the other saw me coming. Hedger just made a move nearly before I seized him; he had not got one pace, he had only just made a move. I told him his companion had stolen some handkerchiefs; he was as bad, he had some handkerchiefs about him. He had none when the officer came in and searched him. He had been there a week before with his companion; I had seen him there. I suspected him the week before, they bought nothing. We were very busy; then they said, there was nothing that suited them. They had not an opportunity of suiting themselves, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any answer to you when he said he was as bad as his companion - A. He said he did not know him, he was a young man that he had met by chance, unfortunately he said, that evening somewhere at the west end of the town. I asked him what he was; he said, a chair stuffer. I went in pursuit of him, it was dark, I could not find him. I missed several handkerchiefs from the parcel; I am sure he took some handkerchiefs, I missed two pieces, one with four handkerchiefs in it, the other I do not know how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine them before they were lost - A. I had not counted them.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who took the handkerchiefs escaped - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had nothing upon him - A. He had not; his companion, when he went out, said to him, I shall see you in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not, count the single handkerchiefs, did you - A. No, I did not; I am certain I missed two pieces, one had four, and the other not less than two.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

I received it on the 5th of September. I received change of Foster, Lovett, and Company, change of a check of forty-seven pounds, five shillings in four ten pound notes, a five pound, and a two pound.</p>
               <p>Q, Had you taken account of the numbers - A. I had not. When I first received them I folded them together, and placed them in the middle of a pocketbook, which I put into my pocket; they were separate from other notes. On returning home it was rather late; in the afternoon I was going out, I placed the pocket-book in the iron closet, with the contents exactly as I received them, without opening the pocket-book, or examining it. The iron closet is in a room in the house; I locked the iron closet, and put the key in my pocket. I went out that evening, in a few minutes afterwards I came home, near twelve at night. I did not open the closet that night, I went to bed; the key of the iron closet I am certain was in my pocket when I went to bed. When I returned home, I found one of my children was not well, and when I went to bed I laid my coat down in the children's room, with the key in my pocket. The prisoner slept in a room beyond the children; she must pass the children's room to come out. About nine o'clock the next morning, I took the pocketbook out of the closet, and replaced it in my pocket. I found my coat in the children's room in the place where I put it. I found my coat in the same situation I had left it. I took the key out of the pocket about half an hour before I took the pocket-book out of the closet. I afterwards opened the iron closet with the key I found in my pocket. I put the book into my pocket, without examining it; I went out a little before eleven o'clock; I left the putting the bankers names on the notes; then I took out my pocket-book; I was at the lottery office, Somerset-house. I opened my pocket-book for the purpose of endorsing the notes with the bankers names. Immediately I took the notes in my hand, I perceived they were not folded up in the same way that I had left them. When I received them, I folded them altogether across, and then back again, to make them in a small compass. When I took them out at Somerset-house, the centre one was separate, folded by itself. The different position struck me; and I counted the notes instantly, and I found there were but thirty-seven pound instead of forty-seven pound. There were three tens, I had four tens. I returned home, and made enquiry of my wife, and also of the prisoner; I asked the prisoner particularly if she had seen or had got any thing of the kind of the ten pound note. She pretended total ignorance of the thing; she said she had not any thing of it. She then went down stairs to search about the sweepings of the room, to see if by chance it might be dropped there. She returned and said she saw nothing of it. As I had not counted the notes over, I was uncertain which way it could be taken; I had not counted them with my finger, I merely followed the cashier with my eye. With that I went to the bankers, Messrs. Foster and Lovett, to ascertain the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300019"/>number of the notes. The cashier who paid me is here. He gave me the number and date of the note. I stopped payment at the bank; after that I took no further proceedings. When I went home I pressed it more closely to the prisoner the same day, I believe it was, I am not certain whether I charged her with taking the key out of my pocket. I think I charged her as closey as that; she so solemnly denied it. I felt I was doing her an injustice to suspect her at that time. I heard nothing of the note, and gave up all suspicion that it was her. On Tuesday, the 8th of the present month, it was in September I lost the note; she continued in my service. On the 8th of November a piece of a key was discovered in one of my drawers; the prisoner was out at the time I made the discovery; when she came home I asked to look at her keys, to see if it was any of the keys belonging to her. I was then determined the prisoner should leave my service. That circumstance induced me to give her warning. On the Saturday following she had warning to quit as soon as she could, or otherwise. On the Thursday following she was sent out on an errand in the evening, and I had business which led me out a few minutes afterwards. On my going out I found the prisoner instead of being in her errand, I found her in conversation with the witness Starr, he is a cobler that keeps a stall. I stopped to listen to their conversation. I thought I heard the witness Starr say, what can they do, unless they find it out. Her answer I could not make out, but I heard again, you must get a new ward to it. I then said to the prisoner, now do not idle your time here, I have heard all your conversation. She said she was speaking about boots; I said, boots do not want new wards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there - A. About three quarters of an hour; I went to Wigmore-street, and waited some time there, not more than three quarters of an hour; certainly I returned home, and found Starr and his wife standing at my door; I know no more. The prisoner was my only servant, she attended in the morning to get up the children, and to do what was to be done.</p>

Yes, next Wednesday three weeks, I believe it is, I do not know the day of the month, between six and seven in the evening I believe it was, she came and rang the bell of the house where I live, and asked permission to come up stairs into my room; I met her on the stairs; she came into my room; my wife was there, no one else there; she said, she wanted to speak to my wife; she presented a little parcel tied up in a rag or silk, I do not know which; she said, it contained pawnbroker's tickets, and requested her to take care of them for her; I said to my wife take them, and take care of them for her; she said, her mistress made a rule to overhaul the servants boxes before they went away, she was going away on Saturday; on the next day she came again, she asked me to lend her eighteen pence, she came to my shop; I lent her the eighteen pence reluctently; she said it was to pay a score over at the public-house. I then requested my wife to look at the packet of tickets to see if they were worth the eighteen-pence; my wife opened the parcel in the evening; my wife told me there was a ten-pound note in it. I desired her to go, and fetch the girl directly; she went and knocked at the door; I saw the prisoner about half past eight o'clock, she came to me that same evening to where I was at work; when she came I said why did not you come sooner, I have lost these tickets, you must go with us, and stop the these things; I saw the girl was confused, and immediately somebody spoke to her at the door, whether it was Mr. Denham I cannot say. The girl said, if it was lost she must find it again, that is all the girl said. I said to the prisoner if there is any thing valuable in it, you must offer a reward. My wife went down with the packet to Mrs. Denham, and Mrs. Denham cut the note out; I never saw it opened.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness the shoemaker. I did not know the prisoner until a week before this accident, that is the first time I saw the girl. On the 9th of this month, she brought this packet, on that day she brought me a parcel, she said, she wished me to take care of it for her until Saturday night; she said, they were pawnbroker's tickets; she said she was going to leave her place on Saturday night, and her mistress looked over the servants boxes, she did not wish her mistress to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce the parcel to you - A. Yes, it was sewed up in a piece of linen cloth; I kept the parcel without examining it until Thursday evening, I examined it then by the request of my husband, he desired me to open it; on opening it I found a few pieces of paper, apparently a letter cut up as pawnbrokers tickets, there were no pawnbroker's tickets in it; on opening the linen further, I found a bit of whity-brown paper, and in that a ten-pound note; I directly sewed it up as near as I could to what it had been before. I went down, and acquainted my husband of it; he desired me to fetch the girl; I went and knocked at the door; the girl told me she could not come just then, she would come in half an hour. She came in half an hour after that; my husband told her he had lost the parcel; the girl appeared to be flurred. My husband asked me to go to her mistress, and ask her if she had lost any thing; the girl was gone then. I went to her mistress, and on getting to the door, I met the girl; she desired me not to leave the parcel with her master; I told her I wished to speak to her master and mistress. She again desired me not to shew it to her master; I said, how can I shew it him when I have lost it. I went the second time, the first time she was engaged, and could not speak to me; the second time I went into the parlour, I shewed the parcel in the presence of the girl, the mistress' father and mother; the mistress requested me to open it she gave me a pair of scissars to cut it open; the ten-pound note was in it. The mistress' father, told her she should go to the watchhouse directly;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300020"/>her mistress took the note out of the parcel. The girl begged they would not send her to the watch-house, but to send her home to her own mother. That is all I heard pass. Mrs. Denham took the ten-pound note out of the rag herself; the patrole had it. That is all I know.</p>

I have got the book here; I can speak nothing but from the book about this note; the entry in the book is my hand-writing. On the 5th of September last, I paid a draft of forty-seven pounds five shillings, drawn by a Mr. Ward to the name of Denham four tens, a five, a two, and five shillings, the first ten is No. 14403, the next 15299, the next 14464, 10288, in this book there are only the numbers; the dates are in another book; the enter of the dates are made by somebody else; I cannot speak to that myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the note produced by the constable - A. This appears to be one of them, it is the same number.</p>
               <p>Q. What number -

            15299, I can only speak to it by the number from the book; it was paid by me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr Hall. What is the date of that note - 
               <persName id="t18141130-30-person343">A. </persName>
            31st of May, 1814.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. You had not yourself looked at the numbers - A. No, I had not; I cannot say it is the note by any mark whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the number of the notes in your pocket book, are they the numbers that Mr. Dalton has spoken of - A. Yes, 14493, 14464, 10288.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked the note up when my master was at the play; my mistress told me to go into the parlour and pick up the bits of paper in the parlour, and under the chair where my master sat I picked up a note; a person came to the door, and asked me what I had in my hand; I said, a one-pound note; I did not know it was any more than a one-pound note, she had taken it out of my hand; she said you fool, it is a ten-pound note, keep it; I said no, I will return it to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What age are your children - A. The eldest is between six and seven.</p>

When I came to the top of that place, there are five posts, and when I came up to a small house, I heard these people, they were going the same road as I was. There are two roads, one a gravel road, and the other not. When I came into the middle of the field, a tall man came from the right hand; he passed me; I looked at him; I did not like the look of him; he knocked me down; I up with my umbrella I had then to keep him off; I was not afraid of one man; before I could get my arm to strike him, I was pinioned by two more men. Seagrim, the man at the bar, put the pistol up to my head; he is one of the two men now at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were pinioned by the man, what did that man to you - A. There were two men, that pinioned me; this was one of them, and that slapped the pistol at my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Of the two men that pinioned you, Seagrim you, say was one - A. He was one.</p>
               <p>Q. He held the pistol at your head - A. Yes; the other man who has has since got away, he came to me and demanded my money and my watch; I hesitated about it. When the man, who is now away said, damn you, none of your airs, if you do not deliver up your money immediately, you are a dead man. The man who has got away took my money, and this pistol this man kept at my hand the whole time. They tried to get the watch out; the chain broke.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did they take - A. A half guinea in gold, a three shilling bank token, and an eighteen penny piece and a shilling, to the best of my knowledge. I lost my watch too; when my watch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300021"/>chain broke, one of them said, damn him, out with it, or you are a dead man.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said that - A. I think Seagrim mentioned that. I immediately unbuttoned the waistband of my pantaloons that I had on, in order that they might take the watch. They got at my watch: they did not leave me. I entreated of them not to hurt me. I told them I was a man of a very large family. A bludgeon then came over my head; I was knocked down; after seeing the bludgeon at my head, I forgot the pistol, and made a plunge and got away. I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not Seagrim that knocked you down, was it - A. No, not Seagrim that knocked me down; than they left me on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. From first to last, how long might they be with you - A. I suppose ten minutes nearly, I cannot exactly ascertain the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Seagrim stand behind you, or in the front of you - A. In the front of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or not - A. It was not moon light, nor it was not very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been out long - A. I left my home in the morning; I came direct from Sun-street at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from Sun-street to were this happened - A. About three quarters of a mile; it was not so dark but what I crossed out of a little puddle that laid just in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make such observations of Seagrim as to be sure of him - A. I am certain of Seagrim, I am confident of him; I cannot identify the other man. I only know that there were three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of your property since - A. Yes; here are the seals in the hands of the pawnbroker.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to this, because it is broken; it has been broken some time, I have had it this twelvemonth, that was to the watch that night; I have seen no other part of the property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then I am to understand from you, this seal there is no mark upon it that you know it by, it is a common seal with no impression at all - A. It is so common that I know that is the seal; I do not recollect that ever I saw such a seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the key you say, that is broken - A. I can swear that is my watch-key.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that you never saw these three persons before that night - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about ten o'clock - A. It was about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell me, it was light enough to see the person of a man - A. It was light enough to see a pistol at my head, and therefore I could see a man.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no opportunity of knowing either of the men before - A. I never saw them before.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, can you take upon you to swear to a man you never saw before at ten o'clock - A. I saw a puddle of water so as to get out of the way; I could see a man to be sure; I could see water three or four yards before me.</p>
               <p>Q. From the circumstance of your being able to discover a puddle of water, therefore you could swear to a man you had never seen before - A. I believe upon my oath that is the man that put the pistol to my head; I am certain I could see the man's face.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you always been of that opinion that you could swear positively to the person of the man - A. I have, from the first time I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you say so before the magistrate - A. I think I identified Seagrim; I do not pretend to identify the other. I think I said to the best of my recollection Seagrim was the person that held the pistol at my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, before the magistrate, did not you say that you believed that he was the man - A. I said, I believed he was the man; I never deviated from that man, from the first time I saw him, I had no doubt at all of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you never before the magistrate said you believed, and believed only he was the man - A. I do not recollect I said so; I am confident I never deviated from that man, from the first time I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that you believed, or swore positively; did you use the term you believed him to to be the man - A. I had no doubt of his being the man; I never doubted of his being the man at the first onset before the magistrate, I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the robbery was it that you were before the magistrate - A. On the Wednesday evening I think they were taken, and I think on the Thursday, the day after they were taken before the magistrate; the robbery was on Saturday; on Wednesday evening they were taken; I believed him to be the man when the officers took him in custody; I said before the magistrate that he was the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Partridge, looking at him now, have you any doubt of his being the man - A. I have no doubt at all of his being the man that put the pistol at my head.</p>

I went to Sadler's Wells; it was closed for the season; from thence I was coming home, and on my coming from Sadler's Wells I passed a person I never saw before to my knowledge.

On Monday morning the 15th, I returned to the warehouse about half past eight in the morning, I found the warehouse door opened; I went into the warehouse, and saw ten pieces of cloth gone. I was in the warehouse when Harrison, the constable, came to me, and asked me if I had lost any pieces of cloth, he said if I would go with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300023"/>him he would shew me where it was gone to. I went to a baker's shop in Grub-street, and in the one pair of stairs room there were Williams, Holmes, Hands, and the prisoner now at the bar, all four in the room; Harrison and me entered the room; Williams opened the window, and jumped out; Murphy followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Murphy - A. Yes; I ran down stairs, and ran after Williams up Grub-street, and down a court, Williams fell down, and before he could get up again, I catched him; I got hold of the prisoner Williams; Murphy came past me in the court. I brought Williams back to the house, where I found the cloth. The other man escaped. Then Williams said he knew nothing about it. The property was secured afterwards. That is all I know about it.</p>




               <p>Q. What were they doing with the cloth - A. Cutting it up; here are the ends here that they cut off. I know it was my master's property; it was worth about one hundred and forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Upon your oath sir, did you say whether you knew any of the other persons upon the last trial, when you was asked, did not you say no - A. I cannot say whether I said no or not; I rather think I did not say no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know Williams before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not know Murphy was one of them at that time, you did not say any thing about him - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago, 15th of March, 1813, next March it will be two years - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time had you of observing the prisoner; you had never seen him before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So you mean to sware to the prisoner, you never having seen him before - A. Yes, because I saw him in the room, and I saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, are you sure he is the man - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a porter. On Monday morning, the 15th of March, I was in Basinghall-street between eight and nine o'clock, I opened my employers warehouse, Mr. Yatherd and sons, it is near Mr. Sutcliffe's. I saw four men loitering about the street; I saw Holmes and Williams standing opposite of the warehouse where I live in discourse together, there were two more with them, but them two I could not get a clear sight of that; I cannot swear to either of them; the other two Holmes and Williams I did swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - A. I cannot speak to him. I saw Holmes with a blue great coat on; I saw Holmes pull the great coat off his back, and another man put it on; the man that put the great coat on was the man that first went into the warehouse; he came out with the cloth upon his shoulder; Holmes followed that man, and brought out cloth likewise; another man went in, a third; the fourth man went in while Williams he came out, and did not bring any cloth, Williams did not. The man that put the great coat on, had returned with the great coat off; he went in again, and brought out another piece of cloth. Harrison took the great coat in the room they went up afterwards, and he left the great coat in the room. They then left the street; I saw Harrison coming up the street; I called him over, and spoke to him; I told him that Mr. Sutcliffe's warehouse had been robbed. He went and found it had. Harrison went up into the room in Grub-street; he took Williams and

            . Holmes was taken shortly after; I knew him.</p>
               <p>- ELKIN. I am a painter; I lived in Grub-street on the morning of the robbery. On Saturday, the 15th of March, I saw two men carrying cloth from Basinghall-street to Moor-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men - A. There were four to the best of my remembrance. I followed them after they passed me; they seemed to be in a great bustle; they went into a house in Grub-street, where they took some of the cloth in; the men carrying the cloth were Williams, Holmes, and Gale.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - A. That is not the man Gale that I saw went into this house. Before I went into the house, I went to Harrison, he was not up; he said, he would come presently. I said, it was a business of consequence, you must come directly. Harrison got up, went with me; I shewed him the house, where the property was, and he went into Basinghall-street. Then we came back to the house in Grub-street; Harrison went first into the house in Grub-street, and Brooks; by the time I got up stairs two men jumped out of the window; Brooks ran down stairs, and I followed after him; we took Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know Stiles's name - A. I knew him by being at the house where I live; he did live in the same house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that house - A. No length of time, more than a week, not so much as a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know his person - A. I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is not the prisoner the man - A. No; the man that jumped out of the window was a taller man.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you saw with the cloth one of them lodged in your house, that was Gale - A. Yes; that was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you saw on the 15th of March in company with Williams, was a man of the name of Gale, who lodged in the same house with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where did you both lodge - A. I lodged at the upper part of the house No. 16, Butler's-alley, in Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your landlord's name - A. Guillim; he keeps the Weavers Arms; the house is let out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of March, did Gale lodge in that house - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, do you mean to say the prisoner is not the man that lodged in that house - A. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that man well - A. Yes, I know him well if I was to see him; when I came into the room up stairs in Grub-street, one of them had jumped out, and the other was in the act of jumping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300024"/>out when I went into the room, and therefore I am sure the prisoner is not the man; the shop where these people was found was a baker's shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You know nothing of the prisoner - A. I do not; I never was in company with the prisoner at all at no time.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday morning, the 15th of March, the last witness came to my house and called me; he told me there was a person of the name of Gale, and three others, carrying cloth through Honeysuckle-court, they brought it from towards Basinghall-street, and they took it to a baker's shop in Grnb-street. I went to Mr. Sutcliffe's, and found the warehouse had been broken open, I saw

There were five in the room altogether. I laid hold of Williams; he pushed me from him, he jumped out of the window, and the prisoner Murphy followed him. Murphy is his right name. I cried out stop thief, and laid hold of Hands.

             ran out of the room, pursued, and in a little time he brought Williams back into the room. I searched the room; I found nine pieces of cloth in the room by the side of the bed; under the shop-board I found some paper and some string; and under the bed, between the mattras and the sacking of the bed, I found these pieces that had been cut off, and two great coats. I secured them; and on April the 7th, I apprehended Holmes. In April sessions, they were tried and convicted, and Murphy stood indicted. Holmes, Williams, and Hands, were tried together, and Murphy stood indicted. On Tuesday the 25th of October, I met the prisoner in company with a man of the name of Hunt, in Rose-lane, Spitalfields. I said to Hunt, how are you? The prisoner ran down Rose-lane, I ran after him. I said halloo, Jack, is that you; he said my name is not Jack; Johnson was with me. We took him in custody; he is the man that stood indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that man you saw in the room is the prisoner at the bar - A. I am sure of it; I knew him before; he is a known thief. I am sure he is the man that was in the room; he has been to India since he lodged in Butler's-alley where the last witness stated. I am sure of him; I know the man well; people have been to me, offering me money to put it on one side. I have kept these pieces ever since; the whole of the property I gave up to the prosecutor.</p>

When I returned home I heard I was indicted; I have seen the gentleman that took me in some of the public houses, and drank out of the same pot with him. He says I run away, he took hold of me by the collar, and called me Murphy; he said I was his prisoner, I went along with him.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am am officer. On Friday the 25th, about half past five, I was going down Thames Street; I passed the prisoner. He had something rolled round with a piece of canvas on his shoulder. I asked him what he had got; he told me a piece of wood; I told him I must see it. He took me to the public house the corner of Water-lane, and putting it down, said it was only a bit of lead; he said he found it in the street. I took the lead and left it in the bar, and the prisoner I took to the Compter. The next morning I went down to the prosecutor; it proved to be Mr. Blenkarn.</p>
               <p>MR. BLENKARN. The lead is similar to what we have now on the premises; it was under our care. prisoner was an extra labourer to us.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Defence, I picked it up in the street; I intended to leave it at the public house till morning to see if any body owned it.</p>

On the 13th of September I called her up to do her domestic work, about seven o'clock; and while I was making the breakfast for the customers, she went up to make the beds. After I had made the tea for the customers, I called her to come to breakfast; she answered me she was coming. I waited a considerable time; I thought she was gone out after the pots. I put her breakfast on one side, and wondered why she went out. I went up in the servant's bed-room; I saw that her clothes were all gone. I ran down to the first floor; I said, Oh, Mary has run away, her clothes are all gone; I hope she has not robbed me. About an hour after that, I went up into my bed room, and when I got into the bed-room, a key that I had lost three weeks before was in the closet, and the closet door open; the key of the closet was is the door that I had lost three weeks before. The night before I had put all my money in the box in this closet, every pound that I had in the world, in a mahogany box in the closet; all the notes were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you put away - A. I cannot tell exactly to one note.</p>
               <p>Q. About how much money had you in the whole - In the first place. I think there was near forty pounds in the whole. I think there must be eight or ten pounds in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of bank notes were there, do you know - There were twenty-six one pound notes that I put by the last time, and a two pound note.</p>

               <p>Q. How many had you put by before - A. I don't know. In the whole there was near forty pounds and eleven shillings, to the best of my belief. I sent directly for

She purchased goods to the amount of twenty or thirty shillings; she offered me a two pound note in payment; she paid me in two one pound notes, I gave her the change; I gave the notes to the officer that night.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in custody on the 15th of November. I made diligent search after her, at last I found her in Dyot-street, St. Giles's. I questioned her what she had robbed her mistress of a large amount; she said she had taken only twenty pounds in notes, and about three or four pounds in silver. She said she gave one Freer half of it, she had none left. She had spent it all. Ann Freer was out of the way as well as the prisoner, until after I apprehended the prisoner. After that I apprehened

               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Are them two notes yours - A. The notes are of my children's endorsing.

On the 7th of November a little boy took a candle to look into the privy to find by what means the cat had escaped. He there saw a shelf under the seat of the privy, and ten bottles on the shelf. He came into his mother, and said there is a robbery going forward, and Mr. Carney ought to be acquainted with it. The prisoner came on Monday the 14th of November, to ask if we could employ him, and the man said there was no work to do. The prisoner then went to the privy; the housekeeper then discovered two bottles taken away out of the privy. We engaged him to work on Monday the 21st of November; that day passed without any bottles being taken away. On Tuesday evening he was observed to go to the privy about eight o'clock. On his return I called him into the accompting-house; the woman brought in word there were two bottles missing out of the privy. I sent for a constable; the constable took one bottle out of his pocket, and two out of his breeches. I had taken one out of his pocket previous to the constables's coming. One of the bottles contained Hollands, two red port wine, and one white wine, all drawn from the casks on tap.</p>
               <p>- I am a constable. I produce one bottle of Hollands; there are four bottles in all; three out of the four I took from him; one out of his pocket, and two out of his breeches; down before him he had a leather apron on.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Atkinson, Delwyn, and Company. On the 26th of July, I took the package to the Custom-house to be sent by the Aberdeen packet. The Captain of the packet there refused to take it; he told me to take it to Chester Quay, and to put it on board the regular packet. The throng of carts being great, I could not go down to the quay; a cart stood in the street. I asked the man if I might put the bale in his cart for a few minutes.

            . I am a potboy at the Ship-on-ground public house. I was down in the cellar at the Ship-on-ground, in Bear-lane. Patterson brought a parcel there, about half past nine o'clock in the morning; he told my master had given him leave to bring it there. He cut off the wrapper and gave me the wrapper, to make an apron of; he asked me if I could put the truss into the other cellar; one is a beer cellar, and the other a spirit cellar. I locked the cellar up, and mislaid the key somewhere. About half an hour afterwards I informed my master that it was smuggled goods; he did not seem to take any notice of it. It passed on until nine o'clock at night; two men came in and asked if Patterson had been there. I said no; about half past ten o'clock Patterson came in; he called for a pint of beer. I drawed it him; he asked me to go down and get the parcel in brown paper. I did; he walked out with it under his arm, he did not say any thing more to me till the next morning; he came into my bed-room, and asked me what I thought of the parcel; I said I thought it was stolen or smuggled goods, that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the goods - A. Mr. Atkinson has got them; the wrapper went back with the things. When he gave me the wrapper, I cut off the marks and burnt them. I did it without a thought; there were the marks upon it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLTON. On the 26th of July, about five minutes after ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into my house with a small truss; he asked me to let him leave it. I did. At about half after ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came again; he went into the tap-room, and called for a pint of beer, my lad drawed it him. He said he wanted one of those pieces in the spirit cellar. I took the key and went down with him; this parcel was open with several large paper parcels. I had no doubt then they were stolen. I thought it would be best to let him have one of these pieces then, and make an appointment with him to come the next morning. The next morning he was to come at six o'clock; I got up at four o'clock; I went to get a constable, I could not find one. I found the truss belonged to Atkinson and Delwyn, Corbett's-court; Mr. Delwyn found the truss first.</p>

            . On the 29th of October I took the prisoner into custody. I found this bale in Mr. Golton's wine cellar; one piece in the truss had been taken out; the wrapper we had of the pot-boy; he said he burnt the piece that had the name on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Atkinson. I know the goods to be our property, every thing but the wrapper; I cannot swear to that particular, because the marks are cut out. There is one piece of the bale missing.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 9th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Compton-street, I there saw the two prisoners and a Jew with a pocket-book in his hand, it appeared to me he had a bank note in his fingers, he was just taking a note out of his pocket-book, and by the side of the jew I saw a large bag twisted up, and a great coat laying by the side of that, it was laying between the prisoners and the the Jew. I knowing the prisoners, I asked them what they were doing with the Jew; they replied, they were buying a jacket of the Jew; by that reply, the Jew shut up his pocket-book, and put the bit of paper in his pocket-book what he had in his fingers, and put the pocket-book in his pocket; he took up his bag, and put it on his shoulder, without saying a word. I asked him whose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300027"/>great coat that was, that he was leaving behind; he said, that coat the two prisoners offered him for sale; he said that five or six times in their hearing, he was about purchasing it; they denied the great coat. The Jew said it was a bad lot, he would have nothing to do with it. I took the two prisoners to Bow-street office, and the coat. By enquiry I found the coat belonged to Mr. Jarvis.</p>

            . My father lives in Compton-street, nearly opposite of the spot where this transaction took place. I observed a Polish Jew walking by my father's house; behind him were the two prisoners, one of them had the coat on his arm, and when I got to the door, I saw the officer having the coat; when he had got the coat, the prisoners said nothing, neither of them. I am sure the prisoners are the same men.</p>

               <p>Perry's Defence. I saw this Jew with the his bag on his shoulder; I asked him if he had got a fustian jacket to sell; he said, he had a velveteen jacket, he could shew it me, he put his bag down in Compton-street, he put the coat out of the bag; he said come a little further, carrying this coat when Godfrey came up; I told him to take the Jew; I had never seen the coat before.</p>

               <p>Q. On Saturday night, the 20th of August, did you observe any persons come home - A. Yes, I did not see them; I heard the feet of two people going backward. Catherine Hall lodged in the one pair back room. I heard two people go through the house to the back part. Shortly after I saw Crawley come home; I only saw him go through the passage, and by the time that he had got up stairs, I heard a great noise; I listened at the noise, and very gently; I heard the voice of Catherine Hall cry out, pray do not; I heard her voice plainly, though I was in another room; I called my husband; I went towards the stairs, with intent to go up the stairs; I found the deceased about two or three stair up; he appeared as if he had just fell, or had been thrown down; I cannot say which; he seemed to be coming forward then; when I came to him he complained of his right arm. I saw him bleeding on the right side of his head; he got hold of my hand, and while I was attending to the deceased, the prisoner Crawley came down stairs, and seemed desirous of passing; the stairs being narrow, he could not get down without stepping over the young man; I looked up, and said it is you that has done this; he went away as quick as he could, and never offered any assistance; there is but one access to the house; he went out the way that he came in. I called to my husband to secure the door, and not to let him out. When my husband came, I said, do not let Crawley out; I believe he has killed the young man; my husband secured the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you when you heard the noise - A. In the front kitchen; the noise was at the back of the house. My wife was in the room over my head; she ran backwards and alarmed me, by saying that Crawley was doing some violence, and desired me to secure the street door; I ran to the street door with the light in my hand, and bolted it; I ran to my wife at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Crawley escaped before you had fastened the street door - A. I cannot say; we did not meet. When I got to my wife, the deceased was in the passage upon his hands and knees; he was bleeding on the left side of his head. I immediately enquired where the prisoner was, and finding he was out of the house, I ran up stairs, and saw no one in the room; Catherine Hall was not in the room. I never found her until after she was taken. By this time the street door was opened; the watchman and I took the young man to Mr. Morris, the surgeon, in Chandois-street; I never could discover how Crawley got away; I never saw him that night at all. I afterwards went into Catherine Hall's room; I found the poker on the floor; there was a quantity of blood on the floor, and among the blood was the poker broken in two pieces. This is the poker; I gave it to Clements, the constable; he now produces it; I took the poker from the blood; I did not examine it; it must have been bloody.</p>

               <p>SYDNEY CHOPPING. I am a surgeon; I attend at St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought to St. George's Hospital on the 26th of August, in the afternoon, I examined his head; I found a contused wound, about three inches in length: it appeared to be done by a blunt instrument; he continued in the Hospital a month; his symtoms were at one time relieved; it returned with a considerable violence, his head was examined two or three days after he came in, an inscission was made through the wound to the bone to examine the scull; I found the scull was fractured; the bone was deprest over the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue before he died - A. In the space of a month an inflamation ensued from the violent contusion given to the scull; he died in consequence of the violent contusion which gave the fracture. I opened the head, the abscess was found in the substance of the brain; during the time he was in the Hospital I saw him every day; I did not communicate to him that he was in danger. I should suppose he was expecting his dissolution by the violence of his symtoms.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after your son was brought home did he recover his senses so as to talk to you rational - A. The next day; he remained to talk rational until he was to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from any thing he said to you, whether he was then expecting to live or to dye - A. He was in hopes he should live then. I visited him every day after he was taken to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time did he express to you that he should dye - A. He said the violence of the blow would be his death; he often said, he never should get through it, after the first three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he converse with you about the manner in which he had received his hurt - A. Yes, he told me only once, that was the day after it was done.</p>

            . I am one of the nurses of St. George's Hospital. I had the care of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever learn from him in what manner he came by his hurt - A. Yes, sir; the last time he informed me was a week before his death; he repeated it several times to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he repeated this to you, did he consider himself a dying man - A. He did, more than once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he considered himself a dying man - A. He frequently said he knew he should never recover it; that appeared to me to be the impression of his mind from my constant attending him when he first came in the Hospital; he said, nurse, I don't think I shall trouble you long; he was in his perfect senses when he said this, and after the inscission was made in his head, he continued in saying he should never recover; in about a week he satisfied me clearly that he expected he should dye; it to be the settled conviction of his mind from the first time of his coming in to his death; he told me he was going home. He told me he met Catherine Hall as he was going home, she asked him where he was going; he told her he was going home. She said, do not go home, come with me; he said, he would rather not. She prevailed upon him, and he went; he had not been in the room but a short time when Crawley came in; Crawley as soon as he saw him, took up the poker, and struck him a blow, and the blow knocked him down; when he recovered himself, he found himself on the stairs; from that he was taken to the surgeons, and remained at home for six or seven days, then he was brought to St. George's Hospital. I asked him whether he had given Crawley any blow, or had any words with him; he told me no, he did not give him time to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did he die - A. I cannot say the day of the month; he was a month within one day at the Hospital. He told me he had not drank any thing.</p>

            . I am an officer. I and Solomon apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of November, at Perkins's Rents, Pie-street, Westminster. He was in bed with Catherine Hall, about eight o'clock in the morning. I afterwards took him in a coach to Bow-street Office. As we were going along, he said the hand-bill was a bad description of him; it was right only in the age.</p>

            . In August last, when this affair happened, I lived in Vine-street. I met the deceased in the Strand. The prisoner at that time entirely lived with me. The deceased knew me before Crawley knew me. When I met him, he asked me if I would go and drink; I told him yes, and thanked him. We went to Mr. Davis's in the Strand, and had a glass of rum apiece. As we came out of there, he said will you go and have any more. I said I thank you, George. He said we will not go into Davis's, we will go into Monday's, the Scotch Arms, in Round-court. We went there, and had a glass of rum again. When we came out of there, he said Kit, I shall go home with you; I told him it was a thing I was not allowed to do to go with any one that knew Crawley.</p>
               <p>Q, Did he know Crawley - A. Yes, he knew from the time that I first lived with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know where Crawley was - A. Yes, he said he said he could go home with me, Crawley was not at home, or else I should not have been out.</p>

            How long had you been in the room before Crawley came in - A. Not a moment; Crawley came home immediately. When Crawley came in, the door was not fastened. Crawley said to Dixon, what do you here; go down stairs. Dixon said, I shall not; what for? Crawley said, I will tell you what for; Crawley struck Dixon with his fist, and knocked him towards the fire-place. Dixon, on getting up seized the poked, and immediately struck Crawley on the head, or the back part of the neck. Dixon struck at him again with the poker; Crawley avoided the blow; Dixon with force only struck the wainscot, and the poker fell out of his hand. I picked up the poker, and laid it on the table. Crawley catched hold of the poker, and struck Dixon back handed at the back part of the head as Dixon was making out of the door; I said then, pray do not, endeavouring to part them by speaking. Dixon directly went out of the room; I never saw him after. The landlord and landlady said Crawley should not stop there, and then he went away; I staid until I took out my things that I had there, and then I went out of the room. Mrs. Raine told me to go away, she said, she had no objection to me, but Crawley would come where I was, and then I went away. When Crawley was taken, he was with me in Perkin's rents, Pie-street; I went before the magistrate and was examined.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him the character of a mild disposition.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they enter into conversation with you upon different subjects - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said a word about their husting you in the deposition to the magistrate, you observed you missed your pocket-book after they jostled against you - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And then you missed the pocket-book; and after you missed the pocket-book what then - A I followed them to Virginia-street, it is about twenty yards from the house; when they got to Virginia-street, I challenged them with having my pocketbook; they denied it with abuse, and one of the two prisoners knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it - A. I believe it was the prisoner Curran, and then they ran away. I came up to them again at the lower part of Virginia-street, one of the two prisoners cried out give it him twice; they turned round, and knocked me down again the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they acting together - A. They were both concerned together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who struck you this second time - A. I believe it was the prisoner Curran.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 25th, between ten and eleven, I heard the rattle spring; I saw the prisoner Smith running; I pursued him, and took him; when I secured him, he said, do not stop me, I have not got it, I have done nothing. I said why do you run if you have done no harm; the prosecutor came up, and gave charge of him. The prosecutor went with me to the watch-house. I asked Smith if he was sure the other prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300030"/>had got the pocket-book; he said, yes he had got it, he saw him take it; he told me where he might be found.</p>

            . I am a patrole of St. Botolph Aldgate. I stopped the prisoner in King-street, Tower Hill, about half after seven in the evening, I asked him what he had got; he said, a piece of cloth. I called another patrole to lay hold of him, while I took the bale of cloth; he got away from me; I saw the prisoner get away, he ran, but not far before he was taken again; he ran apparently as fast as he could; I saw him taken, and brought back; I am sure the man that my partner brought back, was the same person. At the watchhouse, the prisoner told me he picked it up in Blue-coat-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the place where you stopped him to Mr. Brown's shop - A. About a mile and a half. In the watchhouse he told me a man asked him to carry it for him, he could not tell me who the man was. When I stopped the prisoner there was another man in company with him; when I stopped the prisoner that man made off, he ran off directly I stopped the prisoner with the load.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a heavy load, is it not - A. Yes. it is a pretty good load.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor You had not seen the prisoner about your shop at all, had you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the cloth - A. Between nine and ten pounds; there is my shop mark upon it; I can swear positively to it being mine.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very bulky? Could it be taken out of your shop without your people seeing it - A. I suppose it must be taken from the shop when there was a crowd of people in it; we had several bales opened that day. There are two cutters continually in the shop. The piece of cloth was missed by my brother, I was up stairs at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suppose that any of the people in the shop saw it taken away - A. No, I am convinced it was not seen to be taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. It is bulkey and weighty; if any of your people had seen it they must have been able to overtaken any body that had taken it - A. Yes, they must.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bulk and weight such that one man in the way it was folded up might take it - A. He might take it himself; it was heavy; he might take it under his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up from the West India Dock, a man asked me to carry it; I was stopped by the patrole; that is all I know about it; the man was to give me eighteen-pence for carrying it.</p>

They do not go through one another's rooms, they all go separate. I let out three of the rooms, and one I keep for myself for my bed-room. The room that I let to a man and his wife, they find their own goods. I let that room by the week, and lodgings by the week, or by the night.

Yes, on the 11th of November, between seven and eight in the morning I heard one of my lodgers say to Jack, you went out at one o'clock in the morning, and left the door upon; I had let him in at two o'clock in the morning, I said let me see what you got. One of the men said, we have got a robber, I sent for an officer; I said, see what this man has got. I give charge of him to you. I took one shirt out of the prisoner's hand, and one from under his arm. I sold these shirts to Bennett when he came from sea; I am quite sure of this shirt. I had washed it for seven years.</p>

            , meaning the prisoner Angler, was the man that robbed the house, but he did not say what house. We went on until we came to Burton Crescent, in Bloomsbury, and when we came to Burton-street, I saw the young man he had put in possession of the goods until he came. I went down the area of an unfinished house, where the things lay. A young man was there in the vault of the area. I found a carpet covered over beds, candlesticks, and other things. I took possession of the things, and brought them away. Burrell assisted me in bringing the things to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the other man - A. His name is Chipnell, a man who is not apprehended; the things are here, I have kept them ever since. After I had got the things home, I went in search of the prisoner Angler, and the house that had been broken open. On the Wednesday morning the patrole took Angler and brought him to the watchhouse. After he was locked up, I went to him and asked him what he thought of himself? He said he did not know. I asked him whether any body was with him. He said nobody. I asked him who put his hand over the child's face? he said he did himself; he said he brought the swag (meaning the things out of the house) himself, and brought them to a public house in Dean-street. Then he said, they wanted to do him out of the whole. I asked him who he meaned by they? He said, Burrell and Chipnell. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>COURT. When Burrell came and told you, did he tell you any part he took himself - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not he tell you, who the true owner was, in order that the true owner might have them; Burrell was at liberty for a week after he gave the information, was not he - A. He was; I saw him several times. I am of opinion he had not any hand in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suppose that Burrell did more than give you information, he supposing Angler had done wrong - A. I never heard any thing against Burrell in my life: I have known him a good while.</p>

            . I am a publican, in Dean-street. On the 20th of October Angler brought a bundle to my house, about a quarter past six in the morning. I shewed him the porter's block; instead of his putting it on the block, he put it under my window. He asked my wife to let him put it into my house. He left it there; they were fetched away when I was absent. Angler desired to leave them at my house, until he had an opportunity of taking them away.</p>
               <p>Angler. A person of the name of Jack put it on the pitching-block and ran away.</p>

The prisoner is the man; he had got a fustian jacket on; he was in the same dress as he is now; he had a bag on his shoulder; I went and met him in the road. I asked him what he had got; he said his own; he said the two bundles he had in his bag he had found the other side of Finchley. I asked him where he was going to; he said to Guy's Hospital; I said it was too early to go there; I took him to the watchhouse. When I came to the watchhouse I searched the bundles. I produce them. I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The razors in the bag are mine. There are six razors, they are all mine, and what is laid in the charge is mine. I had seen the razors in the case on the Sunday. This is my dictionary; here is another book mine; the books are all my own, they were in my house on the night of the robbery; here is a pair of gloves mine; all the things I have named are my property.

About seven o'clock the candles were lighted: I have a room behind the shop; I had occasion to go from the shop to that room; I returned to the shop; I thought I heard a noise in the parlour; I looked into the shop. I saw all was safe; then I went into the parlour again; I heard a pull at the flannel. I went in, and the flannel was gone; when I heard this pull at the flannel, I went into the shop.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 14th of November I and Wilson were on duty; we were going out; we saw the prisoner and another man coming down Tottenham-court-road by Pierey-street; he that is not in custody came and nudged the prisoner on the shoulder; he dropped the flannel; it was covered over with a great coat; I fitted the great coat on; it fitted the prisoner; I ran after this man; and apprehended him at the bottom of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that flannel, is that flannel yours - A. Yes; I now hold a part of it in my hand; there is the remains of the mark which I am in the habit of making on the flannel. This is the flannel that I lost, I am sure.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the night of Tuesday, the 15th of November, I was in Billeter-lane, about two o'clock when I was there, in company with Bray; I saw the two prisoners in company with two other men; I knew them perfectly well; I observed their conduct; I was about sixteen yards from the premises. I saw three of the men make up to Mr. Framptons' gate, and one was patroling the street; one left the four, and three went to the gate; one patroled the street; I heard the rustling of some keys, apparently at the gate, as if they were sorting them out, as if they were handling a bunch of keys; I heard one enter the lock; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300035"/>then so near, I could hear that; the morning being still and no person walking in the street at the time; I heard the lock open with some difficulty, as if the door stuck, it sounded when opened; I saw the two prisoners enter the premises, with another, and after they had been in ten minutes, one came out, thinking they had been disturbed by the family, I thought with Bray to secure each side of the gate; Bray instantly made up to the gate; I was close to him: just as we got to the gate, he cut down the prisoner Turnwell, he apparently fell; Bennett rushed out of the gate. I cut at him with my cutlass; I missed my blow; he instantly struck me on my cheek-bone, which caused me to fall, he struck me with that double crow, what they call a jemmy, it did not stun me his striking me on my cheek-bone. I perceived the prisoner stumble nearly across the road before he recovered; I got up, and went after him, crying out stop thief; he ran down Billeter-lane, he turned on the right hand in Billeter-square, in turning the corner of Billeter-square; he turned short; I saw the watchman laying on the ground, that was Curtain, the watchman; I thought he was murdered; I found he was wounded; I jumped over the watchman at the time, He proceeded to the right of Billeter-square, where there was no thoroughfare; at that time, I could not get my pistols out, I meaned to shoot him, and when I came to him, I aimed a blow at him with my cutlass, and missed my blow again. He ran down Fishers-alley, into Fenchurch-street, then he crossed into Mark-lane; he threw himself up against a house in a dark part, there was not a lamp near the place, that I might over run him; I cut him across the head; he had a hat on; I collared him, and took from his right hand the crow that he struck me with; he said, do not murder me. I brought him back again to the premises of Messrs. Frampton. there I found Bray with the other prisoner, close to the gate; we then took both the prisoners to the watchhouse. I searched Bennett; I found on him a phospherous bottle, a small bunch of matches, two pieces of wax-candle, and a piece of candied horehound. After we secured the two prisoners in the watchhouse, I came back again, and found this green bag rolled up in the gateway, and a cord round it. We then alarmed Mr. Frampton. We found these two keys; I believe Mr. Frampton picked up one; they are skeleton keys; they were about three yards inside the premises, by the gate; at that time we desired the watchman not to shut the gate, but one of the watchmen shut the gate.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the man enter the gate: I knew them perfectly well. Three went in, and one stood outside; one came out that made his escape. Turnwell was just coming out, I sprang over, and cut him down with a cutlass, that is Turnwell, be dropped this green baize bag, he dropped these keys; they were wrapped up in the green baize bag. I immediately called to my partner, I have one; Bennett rushed out, and hit me on my arm with the crow; I thought my arm was broken; my partner cut at him. I never quitted Turnwell; I cut him down as he was coming out of Mr. Frampton's gate. I staid till morning, and found this key close to the gate.</p>

On the night in question, I heard the cry of stop thief; I went out of my box with intent to lay hold of him; before I could lay hold of him, I received a violent blow from the man that I was going to lay hold of: the blow knocked me down, and deprived me of my senses, and knocked some of my teeth out. I received the blow from a man that was running at the cry of stop thief.</p>

I returned to town either on the 24th or 25th again. In consequence of information, I went to Mr. Rolley's, a bacon factor, in Wood-street, on the 26th of September; he accompanied me into his own loft; I found twenty five reams of paper there, overed over with hurdles, straw, and bagging; some of the reams of paper were in wrappers, the whole of it was concealed; not a ream to be seen, there were twelve reams of thick post five reams of large yellow wove post, and a ream of imperial, making altogether twenty-five reams of paper. I am certain I have missed as much again.</p>

             I am a stationer; I live at 14, Lawrence-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day in October last did either of the prisoners come to you - A. Yes, the prisoner Griffiths came and brought a ream of thick yellow wove post on Wednesday, the 26th of October; this is the ream; he said he brought me that ream of paper to look at; a friend, an acquaintance of his, had a quantity to dispose of, if I would go and look at them. I asked if they were at his house; he lives in Phillip-lane, London-wall; he said no, they were at a warehouse just by, if I would go with him to the warehouse, he would shew them me. He said he did not know who they belonged to; he said the man took them for a bad debt; he said he did not understand the paper, if they were eggs, he could tell what to do with them. I said Griffiths, if it is not all right, it will not be worth your while to get into trouble for the sake of a few reams of paper; he said he knew nothing about it. I told him I could not go then, I would come on the next morning; on the next morning I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300036"/>went to Griffiths's house, No. 17, London-wall; Griffiths took me to Mr. Rolley's warehouse, a bacon factor, in Wood-street; we went into the yard; we saw the prisoner Stratch; Griffiths said to Stratch, this gentleman is come to look at the paper; we all three went into a two pair of stairs to a sort of a loft; which is over the yard that we entered by; the floor was covered with straw; Stratch pulled some wrappers or bags off a quantity of paper in the disordered state I saw it lay; I was convinced it was not come honestly by; I asked Stratch if it was his; he said no, it belonged to an acquaintance of his, he would be there presently; Coleman came in; soon after I asked Coleman if it was his property; he said yes; I then said, provided I buy it of you, you will deliver me a regular bill of parcels; he said yes, certainly. I asked him what he asked for it; I think he said forty pounds. I said that is too much; he then said thirty pounds. I said I would consider of it. I went to Mr. Street immediately afterwards and stated to him what I have seen; I consulted with him; we laid future arrangements. On that Griffiths called at my own house, at twelve o'clock; he said first, he thought I had not asked so many questions about the paper as I might have done. I told him that Coleman had promised to send me a regular bill of parcels, that was all I required; I asked him if he thought they would not take any thing less for it; he said he did not know, perhaps they might: he denied any interest in it himself whatever, he should not get any thing for his trouble.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITE. I am an officer. On the 29th of October I went to Griffiths's house. I saw Griffiths there; I told him he must account for some paper that I understood had been stolen. At first he said he knew nothing of it. I told him he had offered some for sale, and from information it was stolen property; He said, he would take me to the man he had it of; he then took me to Mr. Rolley's yard; I saw Stratch there; I told Stratch I understood there was some paper there: he said, he knew nothing about it. I told him it was very strange that he should have property in his master's premises and not know any thing about it; Stratch is a servant to Mr. Rolley. He then said, there was some paper there, a man brought it there is a cart, he said he did not know the man. I told him he must give me a better account than that, or else I must take him in custody. Stratch then went with me to a public-house, a door or two from Mr. Rolley's warehouse; we had not been there half a minute before Coleman came in; Stratch said to Coleman, this man has come about the paper. Coleman turned very pale, and said in a faint voice, that he would tell me; he said, he had it from a man in the country, he did not know his name. I took the three prisoners into custody. I took the paper and skins out of Mr. Rolley's loft.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the first he said about it - A. He made some application respecting an acceptance of Mr. Larking, he said that Mr. Larking had given him an acceptance in compensation of excessive damages of a levey; that was in July last, he applied to me. He said, he wanted thirty-nine pounds ten shillings, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300037"/>a particular occasion to pay to the Gravesend Bank; he said, he had the bill at home on the 23rd of July, and he had omitted to bringit up with him. I then gave him a check upon Mr. Collins to the amount of thirty-nine pounds ten shillings, upon his putting Mr. Larking's bill into the post for me, addressed to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you on a subsequent day, and bring this bill to you with the acceptance of Mr. Larking - A. I believe he came on the 4th of

             I said to the magistrate I believed on the 2nd of August; I know now it was on the 4th; I lived then in Ely-place, in the County of Middlesex; he came to me, he brought to me this acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that - A. That is the acceptance he brought, exactly as it is now; he brought this to me on the 4th of August; in consequence thereof, I then gave him a draft upon Brown and Co. of thirty-nine pounds ten shillings; the first draft was not paid. I afterwards handed that bill over to Mr. Collius on the same day, I put a mark upon it before I parted with it; October 3rd, that is the day it became due; I put on it before I parted with it October the 3rd.</p>
               <p>Q. On or about the 5th of October, did you receive a letter from the prisoner - A. I believe it was on the 6th. That is the letter.</p>
               <p>COURT. The date, October the 3rd on the top of the bill, is your hand-writing - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. On the 6th of October, did you receive these two letters - A. I received this letter on the 6th, by post; it is dated the 5th; it is addressed to me at Ely-place. I have seen the prisoner write. I have no doubt it is his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that acceptance, do you believe that acceptance to be Mr. Larking's hand-writing - A. Certainly not; I have had frequent opportunities of observing his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you superintended the execution<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300038"/>the prisoner's house - A. I was there; I found that letter in the prisoner's house myself; I found it in the desk that was sealed by Mr. Russell; that is the letter from Mr. Collins to Mr. Larking.</p>
               <p>Mr, Knapp. Did any body live in that house but himself - None but the prisoner and his family.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that letter, and look at the address; did you ever receive that letter from Mr. Collins - A. No, I have seen the letter (read) signed Collins and Waller, 33, Spital-square, dated the 4th October, 1814, addressed to Mr. C. Larking, auctioneer, Rochester, Kent.</p>
               <p>"Sir, Your acceptance of thirty-five pounds ten shillings, drawn by G. White, is returned dishonoured; and unless the amount is repaid to us by return of post, we shall proceed to enforce the payment thereof without father notice."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I stand here charged with a crime that I am innocent of. I do not know any thing about writing that acceptance, or know who did. On or about the 20th or 25th of August, I was in great distress for money; I had a consultation with my wife for the payment of some money to the Gravesend Bank; the time of payment was about the 22d of August; this bill on Mr. Larking my wife said she would take to her for acceptance; I came to London; I told Mr. Russell that I had the bill, I would send it. About the 3rd of August, I carried the bill to Mr. Russell; Mr. Russell gave me a draft upon Brown and Co. for the sum of thirty-nine pound ten shillings, and a little time before the bill became due, my wife asked me to get the money to take this bill up, I could not get the money; my wife was very uneasy; I have not got my witnesses here that heard what my wife said, they were here the day before yesterday. I do not know for what reason they left London, nor do I know any thing of the forgery.</p>

I saw the prisoner upon the rumble-tumble as we call it; I cast my head round, and saw him with the trunk, I am positive he was not a passenger in the coach; we had set the two last outside passengers down at the Cross Keys, in Wood-street. I cast my head round, I saw the prisoner behind the coach; he had got hold of the trunk; he lifted it from the two irons; he was pulling it down; he had got it from the irons; it was slanting on the roof crossways upon the roof, and when it was fixed it was lengthways; and when the prisoner got hold of it it was crossways. I told the coachman to stop, there was a thief behind the coach. As soon as I said that, the prisoner jumped down, and I jumped after him;

            . I am a grocer; on Tuesday the 26th of October last, a little after six in the evening, I was in my accompting-house in Old Fish-street-hill, Doctor's Commons, it faces the Old Change. I heard a vehement cry of stop thief. I ran to my door, I saw the prisoner running violently, and Barker running after him. I stopped him, and when I had got hold of him Clark came up, and charged him with robbing the Brighton coach in St. Paul's-churchyard, The prisoner said he had done nothing; he then said he had got up to take a ride to Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. All I have to say against this charge, I was passing through St. Paul's-churchyard to go to Richmond. I saw the Brighton coach go along, which goss to Piccadilly; the trunk was on the top; it was not moved by me; it was placed as Clark has stated he turned round and accused me of attempting to take it away. My intention was never attempting to steal. I got on the coach without asking the coachman leave to be sure; the trunk was never moved by me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I went into the butcher's shop; I asked a man, whose name is Boswell, mine, said a man; I then said, you have had brought here to night nine pigs; who brought them? The prisoner was there. He said this man; I then secured the prisoner, and said to Boswell and my son, shew me the pigs. I said to the prisoner, where did you buy these pigs? He said he bought them in Smithfield this afternoon. What did you give for them? that is not a fair question. He did not answer, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300040"/>did not answer.

               <p>Q. Where was your redicule at that time - A. Upon the bed. The prisoner was in the room assisting me in putting my clothes away; she took them from me and put them upon the bed; she asked me if she could assist me any further; I remarked that she stood along side of the bed where the redicule was; I had suspicion of her. About an hour after she was gone, I looked into my redicule, and the pocketbook was gone. I enquired after the prisoner, she was not in the house; I found she had left the house immediately after she went out of my room. That evening I went to the office in Bow-street, there I heard the prisoner had been taken up on suspicion: I saw the prisoner that evening about eleven o'clock. I know that the notes that I lost were the notes that Mr. Murray gave me.</p>

From information in the neighbourhood, I waited until the prisoner came home, and when he did come home, I went up into the room; I found him in bed; the woman that was in bed with him came out of the room and spoke to a person in the house. I asked her who she had in bed; she said, my husband; this was at No. 7, Cable-street. I awoke the prisoner; he said, you will find nothing here, I heard of your being here. While he was dressing himself I proceeded to to search the room, and in a box in his room, I found this jacket, waistcoat, and breeches. I asked him how long he had them; he said about a twelvemonth, they were to be his wedding suit, though they were not married, they were to be married. I searched him; I put my hand into his breeches; I took out this card of Mr. Chambers's shop. I then said, it appears you bought these new clothes there, you have not had them a twelvemonth. I took the clothes out of the box, and tied them up. These are them. The next morning I went to Mr. Chamber's shop, and asked Hatfield if he remembered any person yesterday coming, and buying clothes; yes, he said, he took a five-pound note of him.</p>

            . I am a farmer, residing at Yousley, in Middlesex; my farm is close to the Canel. On Sunday, the 20th of November, I perceived my hay had been taken away; I traced hay all the way down the lane to the barge, that lane leads to the house of Mr. Allen; I tracked hay and feathers from the lane to Horton-bridge, where the barge was; there was a load of dung on the barge, hay, and feathers; we fetched a constable; we went into the barge, we saw Chapman, alias Watts, and Saw; we took the prisoners away from the barge. Chapman was very obstroperous, he tried to hit the constable; he kicked one mans shins. We met Mr. Allen; we returned to the barge again; we found a turkeys neck and a gizzard burning in the fire. We searched all round that part of the country, among a clump of bricks we found a sack, containing four turkeys, about fifty yards from the barge.</p>
               <p>JOSEHH ALLEN. On Sunday morning, from information, I looked for my turkeys. I missed five. I went to the magistrate, got a warrant, and took Chapman and Saw into custody. The constable went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300042"/>on board the barge; the constable put his hand into a sack, and pulled out part of a turkey. I saw the turkey's neck and gizzard. I saw four turkeys concealed in a sack in a brick-kiln about three hundred yards from the barge. Saw had some blood on his shoes, stockings, and breeches. Saw said, do you suppose there is no other blood besides turkey's? The four turkeys I found in the sack were my own. The cock turkey in the sack I had brad a great many years; I knew him by his feathers.</p>

            . I am a constable. I knew Chapman before; I thought he was a returned transport. On Sunday morning I saw the two prisoners together, at the Bell public-house at Drayton, within half a mile of Mr. Allen's house. After I heard of the robbery, I went on board the barge; and apprehended the two prisoners. I saw a turkey in a dish in the barge; it was either a turkey or a large fowl; the head was off, and burning in the fire.</p>

             HAMILTON. I am a serjeant in the third regiment of foot guards. I was in company with Hull on the evening of the 17th, between four and five o'clock. Hull put his hand into his pocket to take out his purse, to take a piece of money out. After that I saw Hull put his hand into his pocket again to take out his purse. He immediately said his purse and his money was gone. He sit upon the table a little bit, and then went and told the landlord. The prisoner Price went to the landlord, and desired him to send for a constable. The prisoner and Hull came from the bar into the tap-room. Hull then said in the tap-room, if any person had got it, and would deliver it up to him, he would say no more about it. A few minutes after that, suspicion aroso among the people in the tap-room, that Price had got the purse and the money. I went and asked the landlord if Price had been out of the house. He said, No. Price was then standing by the bar. I pushed Price backwards, with his back against the hatchway that led down into the cellar. I told Price that he was accused of being the man that had taken the money, if he had got it, he had better deliver it up. He denied knowing any thing of it. I kept my eye upon him all the time. I observed him raise his right hand and reach it over the bar-door leading down into the cellar. I said, Hull, watch Prices's right hand that is over the half-door. Hull stepped up, and laid hold of Price's wrist, and drew his hand over the half-door; in his hand we found the purse and the four one pound notes. I saw them. Hull took the purse, and shewed it all the people in the tap-room. Hull asked him if he was not a rogue for taking his money; the prisoner said it was done out of a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been joking together - A. Not as I saw; they had been drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hull. How long have you known the prisoner - A. Two months; we had been drinking together near two hours.</p>

               <p>Q. You found the money in his hand, did you - A. I did; this is the money, and this is the purse.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS. I am the landlord of the Red Lion. When I heard of the loss of the purse and the money the prosecutor and the prisoner came to the bar. Hull said he had been robbed; Price seemed very much hurt at the man losing his money. Price said it was hard for one man to sit by another, and to be robbed of his money; they went into the tap-room. I heard Hull say in the tap-room, if any person had taken his pocket-book, and would deliver it up to him, he would say no more about it. Price said to Hull, recollect what company you have been in; suspicion arose upon Price; the serjeant insisted a constable should be sent for. I saw Price's hand catched hold of by Hull; he took the purse out of Price's hand and throwed it into my wife's lap; he said, if my money is in the purse, it is four one pound notes. My wife opened the purse and it contained four one pound notes. Kennedy the officer took the prisoner into custody.</p>

            . I am twelve years old. I and Luker went to Mr. Spencer's house in Mecklenbourg Square, on the 28th of October in the morning, a quarter before seven. We took the lead off that house the day before; we went up the joists and got on the roof; we cut some lead from the skylight; we chucked it down in six pieces; we went and sold it to Hunter, in Bell Court, Brook Street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell it for - A. I think it was half an hundred weight; he gave seven shillings for it; Luker sold it: he told us to bring more, there was not weight; he gave the money to Luker. This is the lead.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Mecklenbourg-square; on Tuesday the 25th of October I missed lead from off the house; it rained, and the rain came in; I waited until the 28th, and then I went on the house and examined it, and at No. 28 I saw two boys at the top of the house, Luker and Carey, and with assistance I took the two boys. The watchman went to the top of the house, he saw Carey in the chimney; and when he came down, I took him into custody; the watchman took Luker; we took them to the watch-house, and from the wathhouse to Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANCOCK. As soon as the two boys were brought to the office, I and Limbric went with a search warrant to the prisoner Hunter's house, there we found this lead. I went with Partridge, and fitted on one piece to the top of No. 16, and they fitted the rest, it fitted completely. I and Limbric found this lead in Hunter's shop.</p>
               <p>George Hay. This lead matched with No. 16, that house belongs to Messrs. Spencer's; there was lead taken from different houses.</p>
               <p>Luker said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Hunter's Defence. On the 24th of October, Luker and Carey came into my shop, and said, do you buy lead; I said, where is it? Luker said at his father's; he said his father bought the lead of old houses. I gave him three halfpence a pound for it; I can only make twopence a pound of it myself. On the 25th he came again with some more lead; I bought it at three halfpence the pound, that is the market price. I thought the lead was the boy's father's; he said his father lived in Gray's-in-lane.</p>

               <p>Hunter called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I thought it was all right; he called it his authority only Kusick came into the room; the other man staid at the door; he looked under the bed, and pulled the clothes off my wife that was in bed. I was in my room all the time he was searching it, he went to the next room; then I stood by the door, when they had searched the next room. I begged and prayed that they would not go up stairs, because of the woman that had been in labour all that night. With a great deal of persuasions, they did not go up and search the other rooms they then said I must treat them with something to drink. I went down stairs, and gave them a quarten of gin which they did not pay for, and then they went away. I had no such person as

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at your house on the 13th of November - A. He was. I cannot say exactly the time he came; a little after eleven o'clock I received the injury.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been there - A. I understood by my wife, he had been there better than two hours. I had seen him better than an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. A little after eleven what happened - A. I make it a rule to clear my house at eleven o'clock; and the company had all gone, except four persons, and my two friends, I had got in my bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other three persons in company with the prisoner - A. They had been prior to the time that this happened. The prisoner placed himself against the bar at my house; and used very abusive language. Before he used that language, I had desired him to go, the other three requested to have another glass, it was past the hour I said, I would serve them no more; the lights I had taken out of, the tap room. They stood at the tap room door to have another glass; and by the request of my wife, I let them have another glass. The prisoner requested to have some, he said he had no money except three farthings; but he would be damned if he would not have it. I told him he should not, nor any one else should have more; and if he would not go out, and the others I must be under the necessity of putting them out" why you b - r, said the prisoner</p>
               <p>"which way will you do it" I had no anger on my part; he is but a little man. I took him up in my arms from the place where he stood, I carried him about three yards, immediately I found I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300045"/>found I was wounded in my side, I called out I am stabbed; and secured his arms directly, my neighbour had his eye upon him the whole time, he is here; he jumped to my assistance, he pulled the prisoner up to the bar. I said examine his hand; he has got something in his hand, he extended his arms from his body; we found nothing in his hand, and the party that was there, said, it was only the prick, of a pin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any knife afterwards - A. My neighbour did. I said it is some sharp instrument; I am afraid it is broken in me; my wife sent immediately to the watchhouse the constable of the night, sent several watchman down they came and secured him, we all looked on the floor where he stood I saw Mr. Hodge pick up the knife within a foot of where I was stabbed; he was taken to the watch-house the constable was bnt a young officer, he sent a watchman down for me to come to the watch-house I hesitated about going and while I was at the watchhouse the prisoners party nearly rescued him.</p>
               <p>Q, Have you given the whole account of every thing that happened, before you received the wound - A. Yes; the constable has got the knife; he has had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried him three or four yards - A. Yes; to put him out, that was towards the door I carried him. I carried him that way for the purpose of putting him out of the house and for no other purpose,</p>
               <p>Q. Had he frequented your house before - A. I have seen him several times before.</p>

             HODGE. I was at this public-house on this night. I went in about nine o'clock, I did not see the prisoner then, I saw the prisoner some time afterwards, in the passage; Mr Jones said it was a rule to clear his house at eleven o'clock; there were three more in company they wanted some rum and water. Mrs. Jones said she would have no more drawed for any body. They made some disturbance Mr. Jones said to his wife, I will let them have another glass, if they will go quietly. They went out into the passage; the prisoner stood with his back against the bar, opposite of the street door; I was in the bar myself. Mr. Jones stood in the passage, he said to the others come now you have had your glass it is time for your departing, it is a late hour, I will have my doors fast. The prisoner used foul language and said he would not go, until it suited himself. Mr. Jones said if he did not go qusetly, he should be under the necessity of putting him out. He abused Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones said, it is of no use I will have my doors shut. Mr. Jones laid hold of him round the body, to carry him out; and when Jones got by the door he called to me that he was stabbed. I went to his assistance, and laid hold of the prisoner, and drew him up to the bar door, Mr. Jones opened his waistcoat; he bled a great-deal. He said he did not touch him, there is something broken in it. The other men said it was only the scratch of a pin. I picked ue the knife at the very spot where it was done. The knife was partly open, there was no blood upon it when I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on what part of Jones's body was it where he was struck - A. On the left side; just by the bottom rib bone.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the surgeon here - A. No his wound was dressed by a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The knife hit against the rib otherwise it might have been mortal.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was called to take the man into custody that stabbed Mr. Jones. I went with some watchman. I searched him, and found no knife.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor How long did you continue ill with that wound - A. I did not feel any great effect of it until Wednesday morning. A surgeon did not see it until this happened on Sunday night eleven o'clock, a surgeon saw it on Monday Dr. Smith attended me he told me it was very fortunate that it hit upon the rib no harm would come of it. If it had not hit there it might have been fatal.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you get well - A. The next morning I felt a very little uneasier; except I breathed hard if any body came near me, I was in fear from it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was an uproar in the house, when I went into it. Mr. Jones was running out of the bar with his chopper, and striking a man on the head. His head was all of a gore of blood. I sat drinking in the house until eleven o'clock and then I was more drunk, he charged me with stabbing him. There were seven or eight followed me into the watchhouse, and took my part.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hodge. Did the prisoner appear to be in liquor - A. No; he had not had but one pint of porter in the house.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses; who gave him the character of a quiet humane man.</p>

            . I am a journeyman coach-maker. I live at 136, High Holborn. On 4th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing in Holborn. waiting for a friend. I saw the prisoner take a piece of bacon from the prosecutor's shop. He held it with both his hands and ran across the road with it into Bloomsbury-court. I pursued him, and laid hold of him in Bloomsbury-court with the bacon; he made no resistance; said he hoped I would forgive him; it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the bacon - A. Just within-side of the shop. This is the bacon.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. It is my bacon.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Wood then at home - A. He was not; he came home at half past six; upon his coming home, I stated what I found. He knocked at the door; we opened the door to him. I told him it was our duty to search him; we searched him, and found upon him paper of the same description as the other. He told us to take the tea and the paper, and say nothing about it. We told him it was our duty to take him before the magistrate. He said, cannot you take the money and the tea, and say nothing about it; he said, if it comes to the Company's cars it will be the ruin of me, and in going along in the coach, I asked him where he got it; he said, he bought it of a man in the Commercial-road, about five months ago, he bought it by the lump, he gave two-pounds for it, in the street, he said, he bought it in the day time; he should know the man again if he was to see him. When he was before the magistrate, he said, the paper was his perquisites, that he was allowed it by the East India Company, he stated to the magistrate that he got the tea as before.</p>

I lost my property on the 16th of November, between five and six in the evening, the prisoner Myers took the piece of cotton nett out of a window where the pane of glass was broken in the inside sash; the prisoner Myers took it out, and put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. The glass was broken before, was it - A. Yes, I saw him put it into his pocket. I went into the next door, there was no one with me at that time. The prisoner Abrahams had been in the shop a minute before, and had left the shop before Myers came in, and took it; Abrahams came into the shop before Myers, he asked to look at some handkerchiefs. In about a minuate after Myers came in; I called my husband, and while my husband turned his back to take some stockings down, I saw Myers put his hand into the side sash, and took the cotton nett; my husband came round to assist me; he threw the cotton nett down: I laid hold of Myers' coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Abrahams all this time - A. I believe he was standing some where about the door; the two prisoners were never in the shop together; Myers denied taking the cotton nett, and after he took it out of his pocket, he said, he meant to purchase it; this is the cotton nett; it is my husband's property.</p>

I took the ironing-cloth. I saw a blanket on the top of the bed instead of a quilt. I overhauled the bed; I found a pair of sheets were gone, a pair of pillows, and one pillow-case, that is all I missed; those things I let to them with the room for their use. I asked the wife what they had done with my property; she told me she knew nothing at all of it, I must ask her husband, she knew nothing at all of it; he was a lazy man, he would not work. When the prisoner came in I sent for an officer, and had him taken in custody. The pawnbroker produced my things at Shadwell office.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 24th of November, a quarter before one o'clock, I saw the prisoner bring this truck with a sack of potatoes on it at No. 6, Clear-street; I came up to him, he said, you know me; I said yes. He said, I have bought a sack of potatoes of a man; I have been drinking; he called for his wife Mary; in two or three minutes she came down with a candle and opened the door; he took the potatoes off the truck and put them at the side of the door; he moved the truck about three yards off the door; he went into his house with the sack of potatoes. I took the truck to the watchhouse. The prisoner was not sober,</p>

I gave her some money to get something to drink. In about a quarter of an hour, I went home; I went to pay my landlord some money, and my pocket-book and notes were gone; I went out with intent of searching after the prisoner; it was so dark, I could not find my way. On Sunday morning I went out, and by chance I saw her go into the house with another woman; I told her I would get her taken up on Monday; on Monday morning. I got an officer to go with me to the house; I pointed her out to the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any copper at any time - A. Yes, on the 14th of September, 1812. I lost it out of a warehouse; our warehouse is situated in the yard, at Limehouse-hole, in the parish of Poplar. On the 18th of September, 1812, two copper bolts I locked up in the warehouse about one o'clock. After two o'clock I looked for the bolts, they were gone; I had the key of the warehouse in my pocket all the time. I never saw the bolts afterwards until the 18th of the same month, 1812. About seven o'clock in the morning I was told the prisoner was near the premises. I went and looked over the pales; there I saw the prisoner with one of the bolts in his possession; upon his seeing me he endeavoured to put the bolt under his jacket. He went into a privy just by, and shoved the bolt into the soil; then I called Mr. Dalton, he was near at hand. I called him to come to take him; he did, and then a lad took the bolt out of the soil; I saw it to be one of the bolts that I lost, the other bolt I never saw again. We secured the prisoner, and took him to the Thames Police office, that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you not to prosecute before - 
               <persName id="t18141130-74-person774">A. </persName>
            He was committed: he broke out of the lock-up place, at the Thames police, the morning after he was committed. I am sure he is the same man. I have seen him many times before; I have no doubt at all he is the same person.</p>
               <p>JAMES DALTON. I am a fireman also to Almon Hill and James Hill. I have known the prisoner Tyler for some years; the bolt that is now in court I ordered one of my boys to take it out of the soil. I took the prisoner with the bolt to the Thames Police Office; he was committed for further examination; he broke out of the look-up place. Afterwards he was taken for stealing some tripe at Bow; he was sent to the Thames Police to be tried upon his former commitment.</p>

Yes, at the latter end of October I missed a pair of shoes, and on the second day that she was in the house, I missed another pair of shoes. When my servant went away, the prisoner was recommended to me during her absence; and on the 22d of November, I missed another pair of shoes. I then suspected the prisoner; she left my house on Monday evening; she left my house and went to her lodging; my servant had returned. I immediately went to the prisoner's lodging, suspecting that she might be the person that took the shoes. I begged her to give my property up; she denied having it; an officer was fetched; the three pair of shoes was found in the cupboard; these are the shoes; they are my property.</p>

            . On the 7th of November I missed my bank note. I had been to Blackwall upon some business to a ship there. I met the prisoner at the George, in St, Martin's-le-grand. I was tipsy; I slipped my foot; the prisoner ran up, and catched hold of my arm; she said she would see me to my lodgings. I told her to go along; she took me to <placeName id="t18141130-77-crimeloc471">Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you had the notes in your pocket-book - A. Yes; I looked at the notes after I returned from Blackwall. On Friday morning I and John Furzeman searched after the woman; on Monday evening we found her by Leicetser-square.

            . I live with my mother, 204, Tottenham-court-road At our house we take in parcels to be taken by the Hampstead coach. I took in a box directed for Miss West of Hampstead; when the lad brought the box, I desired him to send somebody; in consequence of which Mrs. Davis came, and after that Grigg came; he went to a neighbour's house until I sent for him; in about half an hour after that, the prisoner came; he said I have come for those things for Miss West. I said to him, it is a box; he said it is a box; he asked me where it was; I said it was in the parlour, if he would come and take it. He came, and lifted the box up by the rope from where it was into the middle of the room, and at the time Grigg came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he move it completely from the place where it was before - A. Yes, he moved it about a yard; I had sent for Gregory, and Gregory came in and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never moved the box at all.</p>
               <p>MISS SMITH. I am sure he moved it full a yard from where it was before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Grigg. You were sent for by the last witness to come over - A. I took him; he confessed the two notes were written by him; I shewed him the two notes; he said they were his own writing; I took him into custody; he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Davis. Do you know the prisoner's hand writing - A. I think the notes are his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these candles - A. Four pounds is an under value</p>

             I am a patrol of St. Bolthop Aldgate. On the 7th of November, about half past seven, I stopped that prisoner in East Smithfield, he was carrying the tea in a leaden chest; he had taken the wooden chest off it. I asked him where he got it from, he was carrying it on his shoulder. He said he brought it from the Lord Nelson, a ship, laying off the London Dock, going out, laying off the London Dock; he said he was going to take it to the Captains house, I put the tea in the watch-house, and sent my two partners with him, to find out the Captains house. My partners came back very soon, with the prisoner. The tea remained with me, he told me, that he had stolen it. My partner told me so, I asked the prisoner where he had got it from, he said he had stolen it from the Lord Nelson, We went to see if there was any such ship there was no such ship laid there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you could find no such ship - A. Yes; then he told us he stole it from a wharf, he did not tell me what the name of the wharf was. I asked him if I took him with me, could he find the wharf; he said yes. I took him with me, in company with

            . I am a patrol. After Simmons had stopped the prisoner, I went to find out the Captain the owner of the tea; I was sent by the other patrol. I questioned the prisoner going along where he got the tea; he still said he got it from the Lord Nelson laying off the London Dock quay. I asked him where the Captains house was; he said is was no use flattering me; he had stolen it; that is all he said to me. I went down to Wapping to find the ship, the Lord Nelson, I could find no such ship in the dock.</p>
               <p>JOHN TURNBRIDGE. I am a constable. I went to the watchhouse and found this prisoner in custody; I asked him where he got the tea; he said he did not know the name of the place, he would shew me, I took him with me and the two patrols. He shewed me Hoare's wharf, that is in Wapping; he afterwards shewed me where the chest was between some stones at the bottom of Nightingale-lane, where they are making a new opening to the Dock, I produce the tea,</p>

            . I am a ticket porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that chest do you know any thing of it - A. Yes, there is my mark on it; It is my marking I marked it and sent it by a man to Hoare's wharf he brought me back a receipt signed by Mr. Hoare's clerk. This marking shews that I sent it to the wharf. I never saw it at the wharf; I saw it before, and sent it there; I knew It was there, by having the receipt back.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the quantity do you - A Yes twenty nine pound weight, it is about seven shillings the pound; here is the permit in the chest which specifies the quantity; it was given to a man of the name of Garrett of Aberdeen; this was in the chest and was among the stones.</p>
               <p>John Bull. I found the permit between the stones<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300053"/>where the chest was.</p>

               <p>John Garrett, Aberdeen, to receive twenty nine pound weigh, of tea from the stock of the East India company.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr Hoare. Does the Aberdeen vessel go from your wharf - A. Yes; the chest of tea answers to the permit the gross weight; the tea is of more value then I have set upon it. I have set upon it seven pounds for the loss of it, we should have been answerable for it. It was through the prisoner we found it out; having the case knocked off, although he was stopped with it, we had nothing to prove it.</p>

The prisoner was in my brother's service about two years and a half; I had suspicion that the prisoner robbed my brother. I secreted myself in the spirit cellar about five o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner near seven o'clock come and draw off brandy from the vatt into a stone bottle; he left the cellar, returned, and drew off a pint of gin into another bottle, and put it into his coat pocket as he had done before. He went then above stairs; I came from the place where I was secreted; I went to Bow-street, and returned with two officers, Wilson and Cave. The prisoner had left the premises; I found him in his way home in Northumberland-street. The officer took the two bottles out of his pocket; one of the bottles had my mark upon it.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Peatt in Whitechapel. The prisoner brought me some books; I bought them; he came again, I bought more; these three books instead of five volumes. I stopped him; I asked him if could bring the two other volumes; he said yes; he would go and fetch them. I followed him, and lost him in the Commercial-road. The next morning at noon he brought the two other volumes; he said they were his master's property. I asked him whether I could step and ask his master whether he was correct; he said yes; and he was to call in the evening. I never saw him any more until he was in custody. These are the books.</p>

I asked him what he was; he said, a shoemaker. I said it was unusual to have work in an unfinished state to sell; he said it was of no consequence, if I did not like to buy them, I might return them to him; I asked him again: he said he had them of Mr. Price, in the Minories; I asked him on what account he had given them to him? he then said his clerk gave them to him, which was all the same. He afterwards said Jessop in the Minories gave them to him; I being an officer, him, and took the prisoner before the magistrate. At the office the prisoner said they were the property of Mr. Tanner; I sent for Mr. Tanner, and on the following day he saw them, and claimed them. These are the upper leathers.</p>

            . Q. Did you on the 26th of November, see the prisoner - A. I was coming past the chandler's shop; I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with a loaf under each arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner, did you see his face - A. He was dressed as the prisoner is; they were two quartern loaves. I looked through the window; I went in, and asked Mr. Roberts if he had sold two loaves to a sailor; he said no. When I looked in the window, I saw nobody in the shop; I went and gave the information. I saw the prisoner again at Hatton Garden office; I knew him to be the same man, only by his clothes, he was of the size, height, figure and shape, I can swear to the clothes, not to the man; they were the same clothes he has on now.</p>

               <p>Q. to Roberts Q. You pursued after the man, and lost him - A. He went to Mrs. Gibbon's shop to sell the bread.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gibbons. I keep a chandler's shop directly opposite of Mr. Roberts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 26th of November, see the prisoner - A. Yes, he came to my door between five and six.</p>
               <p>Roberts. That is the time I got my information.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gibbons. The prisoner asked me if I would buy the two loaves of him; I asked him how he came by them; he said, a gentleman had given them him, he asked ten-pence for them. I said I would buy them, but I thought he had stolen them. Mr. Roberts came over to me. The man owned that he had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Roberts. Are you able to swear to bread - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I leave myself to your mercy, and the gentlemen of the jury.</p>

I saw How and his wife in a court in the City-road; I saw the watch there in the possession of Mrs. How; I took possession of it after Bourn claimed it. I then went and took Brooks up; I understood he had bought the duplicate; I took him before the magistrate; he there said he bought the duplicate of Mahon.

               <p>Q. How came you by a watch that was claimed by Brown - A. On the 3rd of September, I believe it it was the day Bartholomew fair was on, Mahon came to me, and asked me if I would buy the duplicate of a watch; I said I did not exactly want one. He asked me two or three times; he wanted five shillings for the duplicate; I borrowed two shillings of the waiter and gave it him; he was to come for the three shillings another time; he delivered me the duplicate, and called again on the Sunday after the fair for the three shillings, and I went to the pawnbroker, and paid for changing the duplicate into my own name; and on the Tuesday following I redeemed the watch. After that I went with Beer to How the watchman; he asked to look at the watch; I let him look at it, he said it was a nice watch; the next day when I went to How's with Beer Brown was there, he asked to see the watch; I shewed it him, he claimed it; I left it there.</p>

He had an old one he wanted to be repaired, if I considered it to be worth the expence of repairing. I went to the Black Horse Yard, in Gray's Inn Lane, to view the old chaise. I told him the old chaise was not worth repairing; he said he would take the old one he had seen on trial; he thought it would be too heavy; if he found it so, he would have a new one built: in either case, I was to make an allowance for the old chaise. Six pounds he sent the same afternoon, and took the chaise away. In about a week or ten days afterwards, he called again to say the chaise did not suit him; he called at my shop and gave an order for a new one; I agreed to let him have the old chaise until the new one was made. On the 15th of September I received a note from him to hurry the completion of the chaise.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lloyd's compliments to Mr. Large, wishes to know if the chaise will be ready on Wednesday evening.</p>
               <p>"10, Symond's Inn, 1813.</p>
               <p>On Saturday I went into the country, and left the chaise unfinished. On Monday the 10th of September, 1813, he sent a person from the stable yard, as I understood, saying, he wished to have the chaise on the following morning. I had left no order to detain the chaise, consequently one of my men delivered it in my absence, that was the new chaise, the old one was to be returned, but was not. I made no enquiry; about three weeks or a month afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300057"/>I met a person in Chancery-lane, I enquired Mr. Lloyd's character. I heard something which gave me suspicion; I went and found the chaise I lent him in Mr. Paste's yard; I seized the chaise and took it home. On the next day a man of the name of Flack and Mr. Paste the keeper of the yard came and said they had purchased the chaise of Mr. Lloyd.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the chaise - A I seized it as my property, it is in my possession now. Mr. Paste and Flack threatened to bring an action against me.</p>

            . On Tuesday the the 22d of November, I was out sliding, it being a frost, I saw a man go into the yard, who was not one of my father's men; I went behind the bricks, and watched him; he took one of the stones just at the corner of Collingwood's factory gates; he came back and fetched the other. He took the smallest into Doughty Mews: I saw a green grocer's boy I knew; I told him to go and inform my father's man. Immediately the prisoner went back to Collingwood's gates, took up the largest stone, and took it into Guildford-street. I saw my father's man coming, I pointed out the prisoner to him, then I went to Hatton Garden office for Mr. Read, the officer, and when I came back with Mr. Read, the prisoner was not there. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLES. I am servant to Mr. Renshaw. On Tuesday the 2nd of November I was at work in the shop, in my master's yard, a lad came and said Joe is watching a man that has taken some of his father's stones. I went to look after Joe, I saw Joe in Guildford-street; he beckoned to me; I went up to him; he said, Coles, there is a man has got my stones. The prisoner had the biggest of the two stones with him; he put it down in Lamb's Conduit Street, and then he went back for the other one in Doughty Mews. He took the stone on his shoulder again, and then I collared him; he said, do not coller me, I will not run away: in the mean while up came a mob, and hustled me a considerable way down Guildford street. I walked with them into Russel-square to the end of Bedford-place; he said he lived in St. Giles's. I did not chuse to follow him into St. Giles's. I expected to have an officer to assist me. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

On the 9th of November I discovered the robbery; on the 4th of October Merton left my service; she left a box at my house she said for the use of Lutterlow. On the 9th of November I opened Merton's box, in the presence of Lutterlow; in that box I found a broach, fourteen remnants of lace, a habit shirt, and two knives, in Merton's box, and two keys, they belong to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a purse there - A. I cannot say whether the purse was in Merton's or Lutterlow's box; I afterwards found some things in Lutterlow's box in her bed-room. I knew that box to be her's. In Harriet's box I found a scent bottle, and more than a yard of lace, and a penknife, the knife is mine. I also found two pair of stockings which I knew to be mine.</p>

When my wife returned down stairs into the kitchen, she missed the watch, and sent for me. The prisoner never came back. On the next morning, I found my watch at Mr. Dobree's, the pawnbroker; that was my watch that I had left in the drawer in the kitchen; when it is produced, I shall know it.</p>

I went up stairs, and coming down, I heard him go out, and on my coming into the kitchen, I missed the watch from the drawer; this was about five o'clock.</p>

I saw him on Wednesday, the 19th of October, near seven o'clock in the evening, he pawned this watch and a seal; I was not the person that took it in; I actually saw him give that watch in pledge; he pressed very much for a pound note; he mentioned his coming from Walworth. I knew the prisoner previous to his pledging the watch, he was frequently in the neighboured; I knew him by seeing him at Morton's, a grocer there; I have been two or three times in the same room with him at Moreton's. This is the watch.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 3rd of November, at the Dover Castle, Marsh Gate Lambeth, he had a midshipman's dress; I observed to him, that he had been to Sea; he said he had. I asked him if his name was Ayre; he said, yes. I then said, you are the hare that I am looking after. I told him I had a charge against him for stealing some watches. I took him into custody. He confessed to me that he had stolen the watches, nothing but distress made him do it. There were four watches, three of them have been given up by the pawnbrokers, the value of them altogether is about twenty pounds. I asked him what he had done with the duplicates; he said he burnt them.</p>

I am sure the rope had been cut.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see those four pieces again - A. It might be two or three days afterwards, I saw it on Tuesday at the Thames Police office on a timber carriage. I had marked them myself before I lost them; I put W N the first and last letter of the ships name, and J. H. for Mr. Hinde. These marks were on them at the Thames Police. I am perfectly sure they were the four pieces of timber that I lost, there is no doubt of it.</p>

On Monday, the 7th of November, he came to me at Limehouse-hole, he said he knew a person that wanted a piece or two of timber; he told me to meet him at the Lord Hood at five o'clock in the evening, near the Commercial-road; I do not know the name of the street. I met him there at the Lord Hood public-house; we had a pint of porter and a glass of rum and water; we staid there about half an hour, he and I then walked down to Limehouse-hole, when we arrived at Limehouse-hole, it was dark, it was past six o'clock; at Limehouse my own boat was a ground. Parker told me to get a boat, and row up to the shore, and to take him in; I took

               <persName id="t18141130-102-person970">Parker</persName>
             the same. When we got to the timber, Parker got on the timber, and cut out four pieces; he cut the head rope with his knife; the four pieces were turned a drift; the tide was then running up; we rowed a little bit, and came up to them; we took them in towards Stone-stairs, that joins Mr. Rayner's wharf; Stone-stairs is in Shadwell, in the parish of Ratcliffe; the tide was not high enough; we made the timber fast to the boats that were put there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Parker say any thing how it was to be fetched away - A. It was to be put on Mr. Rayner's wharf as soon as the tide would permit; Rayner's wharf is under the crane. We then rowed home to Limehouse-stairs; in my way I put him on shore at Kidney-stairs, I made Epthorp's boat fast to where I took it from, that was about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you parted, had you settled where to meet again - A. We then met at a new public-house in Solomon's-lane; William Hall was there, Parker and me, Parker was there when I got there; Parker said with me until ten o'clock; we then went to put the timber under the crane at Stone stairs; we took the boat of the man that had to watch there, he was on duty; the man that had to watch, called out halloo, who has taken the boat; Parker said, we will bring her back in a minute or two; I got on the timber, and made the timber fast to the boat; Parker shoved back to the wharf, and took me in again.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards is Stone stairs to the wharf - A. Stone stairs joins the wharf. The man of the watch asked him what he had been looking after; he said the skiff, and he supposed the boy had taken it home. We then went to the Davids Harp at Limehouse-bridge; we stopped there until about half after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know two men of the name of Monet and Sharpe - A. Yes; they were there at the time; we left the house at half after eleven, and went home. Parker said he knew a man that would buy any timber his name was Gould, he supposed ten pounds might be got for the timber. I was taken into custody on Wednesday morning, until I was taken into custody I told nobody of this business; I was taken before the magistrate, and admitted an evidence; I came here from Cold Bath Fields as a witness.</p>

               <p>Q. On the afternoon of Tuesday the 8th, did you go to Mr. Rayner's wharf - A. I did, about four o'clock; when I came there I saw a timber carriage with the name of Mr. Planket, a respectable timber-merchant in that neighbourhood, and two horses to it, and four pieces of timber upon it, marked W N I H. I saw he prisoner Gould, he had hold of the fore horse; he had a whip in his hand; he appeared as the driver. I went up to him, and asked him where he was going to take that timber; he said he was going to take it to Limehouse; he said he did not know the person he was to take it to. I then told him the timber was stolen, and that I was a police officer; that it behaved him well to tell me where he was going to take it, otherwise I must take him into custody; he then said he did not belong to it, he was not the driver. I told him I should take him into custody; he then said, what is to become of my horses, he would shew me where he was going to take it. He said he was going to take it to his own yard in St. George's in the East; that it was to remain in his yard all night, the next morning the person was to come that had engaged him to carry it, he was a sailor-looking man. I took him into custody; that account did not satisfy me; Mr. Wynne and Mr. Hindes both saw the timber, and claimed it.</p>

He said the person lived at Limehouse: he gave a namo, I do not recollect it; I said, the expence of carriage for two days would be great; they had better let it lay at the wharf. Parker said what is the expence of a carriage for two days: I told him I paid five shillings a day for the use of it. Parker said, never mind the expence of the earriage, I will pay for it; he wished me to bring it to my own yard and there let it lay until the next morning. John Gould said, you were saying you wanted a piece of timber for your waggon; I said yes; he said you may have one of these, if they suit you; I said I had no objection for one or two, provided they would give me credit, I had no money to pay for it. He said, that will not do for us, what we buy to day we must pay for tomorrow night. Nothing further passed at that time; I was just going home; it was a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning.

Mr. Evans asked me if I would shew him where it was going to; I said, I would; I took him into Ratcliffe Highway, there I told him I was going to take it to my own yard, and in the morning I was going to take them to Limehouse. I did not know at the time it was stolen timber; they employed me as a carman only; I had no mistrust that it was stolee property.</p>
               <p>Parker called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Gould called twelve witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Elizabeth Green asked me if I had got a shift; I shewed, her a shift, that would not do; she then asked me if I had got any stays; I shewed her some, they would not do; then she asked me if I had got a piece of keyseymere, to mend small clothes, I fetched her some that would not do; I looked round and missed some waistcoats out of the window. I told them I had got nothing that would suit them; they went out, they moved very slowly, I pursued one of them; I saw Elizabeth Green drop a waistcoat from between her clothes. I took them both back into the shop, they dropped three more. I cannot say which of them dropped the other three. These are the waistcoats, they are my property; they cost me six shillings and sixpence by the marks. I sent for an officer and had them taken into custody. I never left the shop, I sent for the things as they called for them; I had an eye upon the window, I saw the waistcoats moved out of the window. There was a time when the prisoners were in the shop that I had not my eye upon them.</p>

            . I was standing at Mr. Griffith's window at the time the prisoner ran out; I saw the prisoner run out; I am positive he is the man; he came out as swift as ever he could; my wife was with me, he parted us. Mr. Griffiths said he had robbed him; I pursued the prisoner, and took him; a boy picked up the seal, and brought it to me, about a minute after I laid hold of the prisoner. This is the seal.</p>

               <p>MR. BECKWELL. I superintent the timber at Mr. Mill's Dockyard; at the Isle of Dogs; I did not miss the timber until it was found. This piece of timber was shewed me by the officer Evans; upon examining, I found it was missing; the value of it, when lost, was more than found; the worth of it is forty pounds. The marks were F P for the ships name and M for Mills. It was formerly one piece, it is now cut the mark remained. I knew it directly I saw it, it was not defaced in any way. It was fifty six feet and a half long.</p>

            . I am a waterman; I ply at stone stairs, just by Rayner's wharf; I went on shore, with some passengers. I saw Parker on the wharf, I did not know his business: the next day the 4th of November. I saw it in the morning moved to Rayers wharf; Parker was upon the timber he was assisting in craneing it. I came out in the morning about seven o'clock; I saw Parker and several working men the timber was brought before I came out in the morning they were heaving it up on Rayner's wharf; I saw no more until I saw it sawed, I think that was on the same day I will not be sure; I saw it sawed at a little after seven o'clock. I saw it being sawed by two men, as I was going off with a fare.</p>

            . I am a waterman. I saw this piece of timber on Mr. Rayners wharf on Friday the 4th of November; I saw Parker assist in craneing of it. I came out, it was heaving up a slip that was made on purpose for heaving of timber.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORD. I remember this piece of timber being brought on Friday morning the 4th of November, Parker and the others said it must be landed on the wharf; they said they had permission of Mr. Rayner on the over night. I went to borrow a rope of Mr. Pallister, Mr. Rayner was by, I got the tackle ready, and it was brought on the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that day afterwards did Turner come - A. Yes; he came down and cross-cut this piece of timber; he brought a saw with him, and cut it in two. I assisted him, after he had cut it in two he said, he believed Mr. Gould was coming to draw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you for wharfage and landing - A. Mr, Turner, and he paid me for the cross-cutting of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he pay for the wharfage and landing - A. I cannot say; after it was put by till Monday; the prisoner Gould came, Gould brought Mr. Planket's timber carriage; with three or four horses, I fancy his own horses he took it away, he did not say where he was going with it as I heard.</p>
               <p>JOHN BAYNER. Q, Do you remember the timber coming to your wharf - A, I remember a person applying to me, on Thursday evening; I saw it on Friday morning landed, about eight o'clock. About eleven o'clock, I remember the prisoner Turner coming, he was looking at the timber; I think he mentioned something about having it up, I said to him, what, does it belong to you; he said, yes; I said, another person had applied to me, the night before, but if it belongs to you, that is very well, he said, yes; it belonged to him, he could pay the wharfage and labour; I asked him the contents, he said two hundred and sixteen feet. I asked him why he did not send for the timber, as he had promised; his reply was that the carriage was broken down, that they would come for it on the Monday following; the carriage came on Monday, the prisoner Gould came; it was loaded, and taken away by Gould, Gould assisted in loading it.</p>

               <p>- BIRCH. I am a sawyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting Turner - A. Yes, on Monday, the 2nd of November, he said, he had a large piece of timber he wanted sawed if I would cut it, I should do it; I said, I had no objection. On the Monday following, I saw a strange carman; I asked him what he wanted, I suspected he was the carter of that timber, and while we were unloading it Turner came, Turner marked the piece on the saw pit how I should cut it; I asked master the proper place to put it for conveniency; master said outside of the yard; Turner said let it remain in the yard: Turner seemed careless whether it was in the yard or no; it laid outside of the yard, and there it remained until Evans the officer came.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On Wednesday the 7th of November, I went to Mr. Ireland's yard, I there saw the timber; it appeared to me to be all one piece before it was out, it was marked M at one end, and F B on the other end 216, the quantity, the ships name the Friend; I shewed Mr. Beckway the same pieces; he identified it. In consequence of information, I went to the house of Turner in John-street, Curtain-road, he was not at home the first time I went; I went the second time, and found him; I told him I had come to make some enquiries respecting a piece of timber he had cutting at Mr. Ireland's. I asked him who he bought it of; he said a person living some where about Limehouse, he did not know the person. I asked him what he was to give a loud for it; he said ten-pounds, he had paid seven pounds on account, he was to pay the remainder in two months. I asked him if he had a bill of parcels; he said, no. He said a person came there at two o'clock in the morning, which he believed to be the man that he had bought the timber of, he said he had the appearance of a sailor. I told him he must go to the magistrate to explain the matter; he very readily went there.</p>

               <p>EWBANK LEAF. On the 26th of November, I had gone to bed, being a little indisposed; I went to bed a little before eleven o'clock. Mrs. Leaf was following after me; she told me one of the children was indisposed. I recommended her to to burn the night lamp; in getting the lamp, she perceived the lamp part was wanting; she went to see for the night lamp, not finding it in the room where we were, she went into the room adjoining; I heard her in very great distress. I jumped out of bed, and went into the room where she had gone into; I there found the prisoner at the bar; my wife told me she discovered her in the fire-place. I seized her, and asked her the reason of her coming there. She said she come to the house between seven and eight o'clock, and thought of asking for relief, as she was in great distress; and having formerly been our servant, she was sure I should relieve her. We then discovered a bundle of clothes in the fire-place. The fire-place had a chimney board before it; it had seen removed when I came into the room. Mrs. Leaf handed this bundle out to me; she asked the prisoner how she could be such a bad girl; she begged for mercy, and hoped we should forgive her, and overlook it, I was much alarmed lest there should be accomplices in the house; I armed myself; I then took her down stairs, and sent my present servant for the watchman; the watchman was too feeble, in case a rescue should be attempted; I sent for another one; he came took her to the watchhouse; we did not discover any accomplices; we thought we heard a watchword in the night. The watchman and myself searched the house before I went to bed, and found nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any idea how she got into the house - A. Not the slightest; I think she must have got over the area rails, and got into the kitchen; from the kitchen there is access to the room that she was in; I told her to empty her pockets; she took from her pockets a pair of shoes, she had no shoes on. The constable of the night searched her.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. About a quarter before eleven at night; I went into a room adjoining where the servant always slept, and a young child of my own; the room was adjoining of my own. I went into that room, and found part of a night lamp I went to the fire-place, and removed a chimney board, and behind the screen I discovered a woman. I immediately screamed for assistance, and went into the front room, and fetched my husbnad directly; he came and seized the prisoner, and asked her why she got into the house; she said she was in a state of starvation, and came to the door between seven and eight o'clock, in tending to ask for some relief, finding the door a-jar, she came in, and thought she would stay till the morning I told her that was very improbable. I turned round and looked at the place of her concealment. I saw a bundle lay; I then asked her if she had brought her clothes there, she said Yes, she turned herself from me, then took up the bundle, and unrolled it; it contained a gown of my own, a fur tippet taken to the front room closet, and also some articles from wearing apparel of my servant's, a gown, a habit shirts, two caps, two handkerchiefs, and an pron. Remnant was my servant then. Mr. Leaf desired her to turn out her pocket. She turned not her shoes, she had none on; she said she meant to take nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with you - A. About nine months: She ran way, without giving any warning; she went out for some porter for supper; she went away and took the money with her, never brought the porter, and never returned.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - . I am a constable of the night at Islington. On Saturday night, the 26th of November, the prisoner was brought to me by two watchmen; they said a gentleman, at No. 27, Charlton-place, had given them charge of her; I searched the prisoner; in her pocket I found this pocket-book, with seven duplicates, a flint and steel; a bit of tinder, and a match wrapped up in a bit of rag; she had nothing else about her. I produce the bundle.</p>

            . On the 10th of November, the prisoner came in and called for a quartern of gin at my bar; I immediately served her, it was between eight and nine o'clock at night; after I had served her, she put down two-pence, I told her twopence would not pay four-pence for the quartern of gin. She then said, I must give her credit for the two-pence; I said, I had better give it her; a customer came in, and called for sixpennyworth of rum and water; the decanter had no rum in it; I filled the decanter; I then turned round to get a glass, and when I turned back again, the decanter with the rum was gone; there was not a soul at the bar but the prisoner. I exclaimed to my husband, the decanter was gone, he had better go to the prisoner's lodgings after the prisoner. Mr. Haigh and I followed the prisoner to her lodgings; I found her at her lodgings; I asked her for the decanter and the rum; she said she did not know what I meant. I said to her you may as well bring it out. I went up to the fire-place, I took up the decanter; the neck was broken off. I took it home. This is the decanter. Afterwards the patrole went and found the broken neck, This is it.</p>

I told him I wanted to speak with him; he told me to sit down. I told him I wanted to ask him a question in consequence of my wife having left me some time; I should be glad to know his opinion whether she would ever return.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in order to induce him to give answers did you give him any thing - A. He answered first; I gave him two shillings and sixpence after the answers, I paid him. He then took a slate, and drew some figures on the slate, and when he had drawed the figures, he signified I might possibly see my wife on the 1st of November; if I did not see her on that day, he thought I should see her at the latter end of that month: and if I did not see her at the latter end of that month, he thought I never should see her again. When he had answered me them questions, I gave him two shillings and sixpence; he gave me a hand bill to recommend him customers. This is the hand bill.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to apprehend this man at 64, Queen-street. I found in his apartments two slates, and these books, I now produce for casting nativities; these are the two slates, and the books. I also found a number of letters with questions in them to be answered; this frame I now produce he called a perpetual motion at the office; it appears to be for the purpose of drawing lines on a slate. Plank and Jeffereys were with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentleman of the jury, this is a very unjust prosecution. I had for many years dropped the business of astrology; by no means answering any thing, when I did, it was down right distress made me do it, and for want of bread for my family. I have now a wife out of her mind, and a child only nine years old; a twelvemonth ago two children were left upon me by a relation that died, and left his wife in great distress, now they are all in distress together. My poor child came yesterday evening to me, and told me every thing was gone, and yesterday she had only a pennyworth of bread to exist on. As to this man, he came in and asked some questions about his wife, and I told him my opinion. He first scraped some acquaintance with me some years ago, and on account of old acqtaintance, he asked me some questions about his wife; I told him I did not pretend to predict any thing. He laid on the ground two shillings and sixpence. I told him I did not look for any money; he would leave it; he said, it was all the money he had. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300065"/>insisted upon his taking back a shilling; no said he, as you are so generous to give me back a shilling, I s will do it in your lottery. I told him that was a thing I by no means did do now, I had suffered before. I asked for no money; it was a thing I by no means wished to do for any body.</p>

Yes; I discovered several pieces of paper there, she keeps a tin shop in Barretts-coura, Wigmore-street; in her house I discovered five or six pieces of paper, and a remnant of a border, I told Mrs. Pinner to procure more for me; Jeffreys the officer purchased other paper at several other places, and we went with a search warrant, we took all the paper that we could find; we found seven or eight pieces of paper at Mrs. pinners, we brought them away; they are here; and several other pieces of paper we took from Mr. Leggs in Barretts-court; we took nineteen pieces of paper in all, I believe from there.</p>

Having missed two or three articles of mine, suspicion fell on the prisoner; on Thursday week last, having deposited six five shilling papers in a room, some pence and some half-pence, on the 2nd of November I missed two out of the six, and on searching for them I found them concealed under some wood that was bought to light the fire. I marked the paper of halfpence with my initials; the paper of penny pieces was only once tied round with string, I did not mark them. After I had marked them, I placed them as nearly as I found them covering them over with the fire wood; I desired my servant maid not to touch them until I got up the next morning; the next morning I examined the spot where I found these things they were gone. I then applied to Mr. Griffiths of Lambeth Street office, I let the prisoner go ont to breakfast as usual and when he got out of the house I called him back when he returned Griffiths the officer searched his person, and found the two papers in his pocket.</p>

            . On Friday morning I went to the house of the prosecutor; the prisoner was not gone to breakfast, I waited until such time he went; he went to breakfast; I was sitting in the parlour. I saw him go out into the street, I called him back into the shop; I searched him, and in his breeches pocket, I found a paper of halfpence in one pocket, and penny pieces in the other; these are the papers of copper. I asked him how he came to rob his master; he said it was the first time. I asked him the reason of his doing so; he said he wanted some money to make up to buy him a new coat: he begged of his master to forgive him. That is all that passed.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. to Prosecutor. When did you mark them - A. After I found them under the wood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The money found on me was part of fifteen shillings paid me on Saturday night by my master. When Mr. Griffiths found the papers of money in my pocket, he asked me what made me take them; I said to buy me a new coat; I said it is my first offence, they ought to forgive me; they took me to Lambeth-street offence.</p>

I gave him the article, and the bill of parcel of the same goods. He came again the next day, and said he wanted a pound of black tea and a pound of green tea for the same master's use for the country. I gave that to him, with a bill of parcels. On the 22nd he came again, he then said he wanted a pound of green tea, for town; he represented that to be for his master's town use, it was his master's custom to have a pound of black tea and a pound of green, that he should have taken it the other day; he had the green tea, two pounds and a half of currants, three pounds of moist sugar, and nine pounds of loaf sugar; I let him have them believing him to be Mr. Martin's servant; each time he came he said he was glad of having returned. My brother is my only partner, his name is Thomas; he called again on Saturday the 29th, I had suspicion; I sent to Mr. Martin; the messinger returned, I detained the prisoner, and took him before the Lord Mayor.</p>

            . In consequence of suspicion, on the 10th of November, I saw the prisoner; I watched him; I saw him go into Mr. Vaisey's shop; I stood outside. I saw him tender a three-shilling piece; when Mr. Vaisey had got the three-shilling piece, I heard him ringing it; I went into the shop, I asked Mr. Vaisey to let me look at it; he shewed me the three-shilling token; he said, I have just received it of the prisoner. I upon looking at it, I observed it to be a counterfeit. I shall know it again if I see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that - A. That is the token that was given to Mr. Vaisey by the prisoner; I have no doubt about it. I asked the prisoner where he got the token, and told him it was a bad one, he said, he got it in change for a pound note at Chatham. I asked him if he had any more tokens about him that he had taken in change of the pound note at Chatham; he said, no, he had not. I took him backwards to search him; in his left hand breeches pocket, I found two tokens wrapped in paper, and two loose; the two in paper had paper between them, as they are sold, to prevent them from rubbing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and tell me whether these are the four that you found in his breeches pocket - A. These are the four that I found in his breeches pocket.

             any more money - A. Of Mr. May, I had received six shillings of Mr. May. I went into the prisoner's house, by myself; the prisoner was a bed; he came out in the street; I gave him the six shillings to purchase four counterfeit tokens. I gave him the money that I had of May.</p>
               <p>COURT. You had of Mr. May two three-shilling bank tokens to purchase four - A. Yes; the prisoner came out in the street; I gave him the money I had received of May; he told me I owed him some money; I said, I would pay him another time. Then he went strait to the place as usual, and told me to stop at the pawnbrother's shop; I did. He went, and brought the money; when he returned I was at the pawnbrokers shop, and Heron was over the way;
