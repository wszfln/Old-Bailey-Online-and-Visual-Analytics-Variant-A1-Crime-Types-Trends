I delivered to them 4 s. and 2 d. out of my left hand pocket; they said, he has got more in his other pockets, we will chip him down; then they took and slit my breeches open from top to bottom, (producing them) I had no more money about me. The bye watch. or what is called the private watch, was coming very near, they left me, and turned the corner; I told the private watch what they had done, we went to the corner and saw the two prisoners standing at Mr. Lesever's brew-house, the other was gone farther on; then the watch-man went to the watch-house, and brought the constable of the night, then the two prisoners were coming along the street just by me again; I shewed them to the officer, he seized Donnolly directly, and the other ran into an alley; the bye watch struck him, and he fell, and I seized him by the collar. The corner where they were standing is not above fifteen yards from the place where I was robbed, and I saw them after the robbery in less than five miactes, there was not a soul in the street at that time but themselves, there was a lamp near the place where they robbed me, and another at the brew-house where they stood.</p>

Shields came up and patted me on my left shoulder, and said something I did not understand, I thought he asked me what o'clock it was; I continued walking on very briskly, and said, No, friend, I can't tell what o'clock it is; then he felt at my right side breeches-pocket, and asked me, if I had got any money for him? I said no, I had none; then he bid me stand and deliver, and took hold of my collar; I said I would not stand, and began to shake myself from him, then the other three came up, one said hold on  collar behind and the others held me by each arm; then Shields let me go and went behind me, and presently came before me again with a clasp-knife open in his hand, I was then calling out for assistance, he laid hold of my collar again, and swore if I made the least noise he would kill me; I did not mind his threatening at all, but called out murder; they held me some time; I can't swear who cut my coat, but I had three cuts in it; it was pretty dark, but we were under one of the lamp. one of them had his hand in my breeches-pocket they were afraid of somebody coming to my assistance; Hogan took my hat from my head, and one of them struck me on my nose, then they all ran away, they took nothing out of my pocket; I pursued them and catch'd hold of Shields by the coat, but running against one of the posts going off the hill, I was obliged to let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come to your assistance?</p>
               <p>Alston. I neither saw nor heard anybody. The other three ran towards Queen-street, and he ran towards the Victualling Office; running by the watch-house, a watchman took him, then I left him and pursued the other three. The two that escaped, ran up Queen-street, and Hogan ran up King-street, I pursued him, I knocked him down against a post, and knocked a hat and wig off, which hat appeared to be mine; he recovered himself, and got up and ran again, I pursued and got hold of one of his arms, he gave me a shake, and shoved me against a post; I let my hold go, and he ran back again the way he had came; I pursued him again, then I saw he had a clasp knife in his hand open; I ran before him, and laid hold of his collar, he got loose from me again and turned and ran up the street again; I still pursued, he found he could not make his escape he ran up to a leather-cutter's door, and stood stopping with his knife ready for a stab at me and said, You dog, what did you strike me for? said, I will let you know presently, and called watch, watch, make haste, I have got him. He thinking somebody was coming, looked back at which time I jumped upon him, and seized hold on both his arms; he put his hand down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176309140005"/> and shut the knife against his thigh, and dropped it against the door; I put my leg behind him, and gave him a fall; after that I got him up, and was leading him down (this was all in King-street) to get him to the watch-house, there came an old woman that had heard the noise, and asked, what was the matter? I told her I had got a thief: she asked me if I had nobody to assist me? I said, no: she said, where are the watchmen? I said, I believed they were all dead: said she, I'll fetch you a watchman presently: presently she sent two, then we carried him to the watch-house at Tower-hill; I left him there; I then went with one of the watchmen with his lanthorn to look for the hat; I went first to the place where they stopt me, to see if they had dropt any knives, I found none, then at the bottom of King-street, where Queen-street begins, I found a case knife, I suppose dropped by some of the others, and in the middle of King-street, where I knocked him down, I found my own hat in the kennel, then we went again to the watch-house; in about 10 minutes time two watchmen came from another watch-house, to know if any body was there that had been robbed; I said, I had; then I went with them to their watch-house in St. Catherine's, there was Shields; then we sent for Hogan, I knew him as soon as I saw him; I charged him with taking me by the collar, and drawing a knife upon me, to rob me. The next day they were carried before the sitting Justices, Shields confessed every thing in the watch-house, and also before Justice Scott. The knife which Hogan dropped at the door I found in the morning about 4 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cooley. I was sent for to the watch-house, being the officer, there Shields confessed he was in this robbery, with one Welch, Ryan, and Hogan, and that he had been concerned in other robberies with one Wilson, and desired I would go and take them, which, he said, would be a means of saving his life. I went with some watchmen of a notorious house on Salt-petre-bank, as he directed me, but did not meet with them.</p>
               <p>John Hall. I am watchman. I heard the prosecutor cry out murder, and thieves, I went out of the watch-house, by the Victualling office, Shields came running, I catched him in my arms, and secured him in the watch-house, this was about half an hour past 11 o'clock; after that I went to the other watch-house, there was the prosecutor and the other prisoner, when Shield's saw them he wanted to be admitted evidence, and owned to the fact.</p>

On the 22d of Aug. the two prisoners came to buy sailor's cloaths, but seemed not to settle to any thing; they agreed for a waistcoat and handkerchief, but when they came to pay, they neither of them had no money, they left me a pair of silver buttons and said, they would come again in the afternoon; I saw them no more till the 25th, they said, they were come to pay for the handkerchief and waistcoat and to have the buttons; then Hill said, he wanted some more handkerchiefs, I put down some, and some neck-cloths; I did not like them, and thought I had missed something before. The neck-cloths were soon missing, I seized Hill, my servant came in, and we bolted the door, I sent a porter for an officer; Hill was very saucy, he said he wanted beer and would not stay, he swore he would not be confined, and said he wanted to case himself, and made water against one of the counters; then they josteled up together to the counter, the neck-cloths were immediately cast from them, they were all in one piece of black silk, part sell on the counter, and part behind, and withall an old handkerchief stuck to them, which Hill afterwards said was his property; I could not tell from which they came.

               <p>Dalton. No, I thought he would take care of it for him. Three days after I asked him what he had done with it? he said he left it with the landlord, but would not say what his name was, or where he lived. I took him before a Justice, he then acknowledged he had pawned it at one Davidsons's at Queen-hyth; I went there with the prisoner and two constables, there it was produced.</p>

            . On the 28th of July I was going home to the Bull-and-gate, in Holborn, from White-chapel, about 2 in the morning; going down Fleet-lane stood two women, one of them asked me if I would go and see her lodging; I said, with all my heart; I went with her, she asked what I would drink? I said, a pint of porter; she said, she would have a pint of wine; I said, I could not afford it; then the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176309140017"/> prisoner came in, and asked me to pay for the wine, (something was brought, but I did not taste it) I said I had none, and would not pay for any; then she laid hold on my throat, and held me backwards on an old bedstead, till they took two guineas out of my pocket, there was nobody else in the room at the time; I said, if they would not hurt me, I would pay for the wine; the other got off, and I laid hold of the prisoner; she got up one pair of stairs, I still kept hold of her, and called for the watch, as we were coming down stairs a man got between her and me, she got out at the shop door, and I at a passage door, both into Fleet market; the man crossed me two or three times, as I was running after her, she ran into a sort of a butcher's slaughter-house, there I took her, and charged the watch with her. I believe I was not above five minutes in the lodging.</p>

               <p>William Chamberlaine, the constable, deposed, that the prosecutor and prisoner were brought to the watch house, he gave charge to him of the prisoner, for robbing him of two guineas, upon which he, and

            . I live at Mr. Townsends', a woollen-draper, the corner of Durham-yard, in the Strand. On the 30th of July, between the hours of 9 and 10 at night, coming out of the city, a little in liquor, I stood leaning on a post in Middle Temple-lane to vomit, the prisoner at the bar passed and jostled against me, which caused me to look up; he laid his hand on mine, which was on the post, and asked me to walk down the Lane with him, saying the air that came from the water would make me better; I was perfectly able to remember all that passed; I went with him half way down the Lane, he kept about four yards before me till we got within about seventeen yards of the bottom; I turned to the waterman's bench to make water, on hearing him attempt to open the gate I turned about, and saw him walk very fast towards me; he violently seized me by the collar with one hand, and by my penis with the other, and said, By G - d, I have got you, you are a sodomite, and if you will not immediately consent to give me your money, I will swear that to your charge that shall hang you. I pushed back, and got his hand loose from me, and asked him what he meant? he said, Make no resistance, young man, I am not unarmed, which put me in fear of my life; he took my watch out of my fob; he having me by the collar pushed my head against the wall, and set my foot against the bench, while he took my buckles out, and a pair of buckles from my knees, one pair silver, the other steel plated with silver, and likewise a pair of silver stone buttons out of my sleeves; after which he said he would charge the watch with me, if I made any resistance or discovery, and carry me to Sir

No, not then, but insisted on my going with him; he there asked me to drink, which I did not; he there saw Morris, a chairman, and asked him to drink, which he did, and left the box. Then he told me the watch and things he had got of me were of no value, and insisted on having 3 l. and he would return the things, and there should be no more of it; (he spoke low, that none could hear but myself) in consideration that he would return the watch and buckles, I told him I would endeavour to get the money of a friend. I recollecting the face of Morris, the chairman, that he had brought Mr. Hanway to my master's house, I asked him to go along with me; then Brown paid for the beer; we three went to Mr.

He paid for the beer, and we went out, Morris following a little after; he swore I should not go home, but go with him; he took me to the Cock and Bottle in the Strand, and there called for a shilling's worth of punch, pen, ink, and paper, and said, by G - you shall give me a note of hand for 2 l. more, and I will return you your things again, and never speak to you if I meet you in the street, and take no notice of you for the future; he brought me the pen, ink, and paper, I denied giving him the note; he took it to the landlord, and desired him to write it, which he did, and Brown, in a low voice, swore, by G -, I should sign it; there was nobody in the room but the chairman; I set a name to it, which was

We parted, and I went home, and heard no more of him till Saturday the 6th of Aug. when he sent Morris with a note to my master's house, for me to meet him at the Hampshire Hog, in the Strand; I went to him, he said he had spent all his money, and had taken a place in the Nottingham stage, to set off at 11 o'clock, and insisted on my giving him two guineas and a half more; he said also he had never a shirt but that on his back, and that he would have two shirts, and one linnen handkerchief of me; I told him I had no money, nor friend of whom to get any; he swore that any body would give the last farthing they had to save their lives, and insisted upon my pawning some of my cloaths; I told him I had none that I could spare; he said he would go with me to my master's house, and make me take them to the pawnbrokers, I took a coat and waistcoat, and pawned them for two guineas, at a pawnbroker's in Chandois-street, I dont know his name, and 8 s.

Brown said it was on the account of this note; they insisted upon my going with them, and took me to the spunging house: Brown called for thr ee or four bottles of wine, and drank very freely; he seemed very desirous for my writing to a friend, to get the money, that I might have my liberty.

            , (she being a friend and particular acquaintance) to come to me, she came accordingly, and said, she had shewed her master the letter; I told her a man had put me in there for a 5 l. note. Soon after she was gone Mr. Arbuthnot came to the spunging-house, and spoke loud, and threatened the people, withall telling me if I would tell him the truth, I should find him my friend, saying, he believed it to be a false debt, because he, or some of his family, had seen Brown lurking about his house; upon which I plucked up a courage, and told him the truth, the same as I told the court now.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not mention it before?</p>
               <p>Hodson. Because he swore, he would swear sodomy to my charge, and take my life away.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was in liquor, was you sensible enough to know what passed?</p>
               <p>Hodson. I was enough to know all that passed, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Hodson. No, never in my life,</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation are you in with your master?</p>
               <p>Hodson. I am shop-man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with him?</p>
               <p>Hodson. About seventeen months.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages?</p>
               <p>Hodson. Ten pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation of life was you before you came to this gentleman?</p>
               <p>Hodson. I lived with my father, who is a farmer, near Durham, till I came to my master; I was brought up in the country-business.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any school-education?</p>
               <p>Hodson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As you had so small wages, how came you by so much money?</p>
               <p>Hodson. I brought twenty guineas with me to London.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was not so far in liquor but you knew what you did, pray, tell me, how you came to go so far as you did, down a dark place, to the bottom of a lane, with a man you never had seen before?</p>
               <p>Hodson. I thought his advice was good that the air off the water would be serviceable and do me good.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought you would not have ventured yourself down such a place at that time of the night?</p>

               <p>Hodson. There were many people passing at the top of the lane; when I went down I was very sick.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first threatened you with that dreadful accusation of sodomy, did it frighten you to that you was absolutely in his power?</p>
               <p>Hodson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Morris you say was drank to by the prisoner at the bar, you did not take notice of that at first, how happened it that you desired to have Morris with you?</p>
               <p>Hodson. Upon recollecting his face, and being afraid to go out with the prisoner alone, I desired him to go along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of a note, what was that first note that was brought to your master's house?</p>

               <p>Morris. I brought him to the house of the prosecutor's master.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the account of being at public house, with the prosecutor and Brown, is that true?</p>
               <p>Morris. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the secret that was between them?</p>
               <p>Morris. I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176309140021"/>Q. Did you know Brown before?</p>
               <p>Morris. I did, he was a grenadier in the same company that I belong to now.</p>
               <p>Q. About the 30th of July do you remember seeing any body at the Coach and Horses in the Strand?</p>
               <p>Morris. Brown and the prosecutor came in while I was drinking with the landlord, they called for a pot of beer, the prisoner asked me to drink; the prosecutor asked me to go down into the Strand with them, we went in at the Heathcock.</p>
               <p>Q. When at the Coach-and horses did you take notice of any business between Brown and Hodson?</p>
               <p>Morris. What was spoke was in whispers, tho' not much; they called for a tankard of beer at the Heathcock, and ordered me to call for a pint, and set in a box by myself. The prosecutor asked the landlord to lend him two guineas, after that he asked the landlord for another guinea, which he lent him, I did not see what he did with any of it; I drank my pint of beer, and they their pot, and went out very quietly; I said, it is very odd I be not paid, somebody should pay me for my trouble; we went over to the Cock and Bottle, and there had a shilling's worth of bumboe, or rumboe, or punch; they both began to write a note, and neither of them could write one rightly; they asked the landlord to write one, the landlord was in a back room, I think the note was wrote there, he brought it, and Hodson, I believe, delivered it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hodson sign it?</p>
               <p>Morris. I did not see him have the pen and ink.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for the liquor?</p>
               <p>Morris. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both go out together?</p>
               <p>Morris. They did; the prisoner said, he would see the prosecutor home. I asked the landlord, if the liquor was paid for?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what the note was to be for?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, I did not. The next morning, being Sunday, I was laying in my bed the prisoner and prosecutor called me up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Morris. I live in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane. They wanted me to go with them into the Strand; I got up, and went with them to the Hole in the Wall, in Chancery-lane, to have a tankard of beer; after that they went into the Strand, and from thence to White-hall, by Lord Pembroke's, in Privy-garden, to Mr.

            's house, where Mr. Arbuthnot's housekeeper was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hodson go in without Brown?</p>
               <p>Morris. Yes, Brown staid by the centinel-box without; after that we went into St. James's Park, by the bird-cage walk, the gentleman's back door comes into the Park; Hodson knocked at the door, that is all I know that passed there; we went up the Strand again, Hodson went in and got a shirt for the prisoner at the bar, at the corner of Durham-yard, I saw him give it him. Some time afterwards Brown sent me with a note to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see Brown?</p>
               <p>Morris. I ply at Temple-bar, and have done years, he came to me there.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell the words he said to you when he brought the note.</p>
               <p>Morris. He desired me to carry it to the man I had seen before with him, to the corner of Durham-yard; accordingly I carried it, and left the prisoner at a public-house, I think the Hampshire Hog.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had not seen him at the door, how was you to have given the note?</p>
               <p>Morris. I was to have given the note into his own hands, and to nobody else. When they came to the public-house they talked about money, the prisoner at the bar desired a note for money; they went out together, and left me there, they returned in about 10 minutes, and, to the best of my knowledge, he gave the prisoner a note for 5 l.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the sum?</p>
               <p>Morris. They desired me to sign my hand as a witness to it, I heard them mention the sum of 5 l. then they parted, I saw nothing of them till the prisoner came to the Coach and Horses to enquire for a bailiff.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your hand writing?</p>
               <p>Morris. Yes, I was witness to this note.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Morris. I believe it might be three or four days after, the landlord shewed me where a bailiff lived, which was in Clement's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention his business?</p>
               <p>Morris. He did not, he said he was going to serve a copy of a writ</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who it was to be serv'd upon?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, he did not. I went to the bailiff, he desired me to go along with him, and sent me to fetch the prosecutor to the Green Man, in Half-moon-street, I lit of Mr. Hodson at his master's door, the message was that Brown wanted to speak to him; he came along with me, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176309140022"/> talked about a debt, and the bailiff told him he was his prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was you ever privy to what passed between the prisoner and Hodson?</p>
               <p>Morris. I know no more than I have mentioned, I did not know the business that was between them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think of it?</p>
               <p>Morris. I thought it to be a debt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morris. I knew him when we went on the expedition to France.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor in any remarkable confusion?</p>

I keep the Heathcock in the Strand; this day 7 weeks, between 11 and 12 at night, Mr. Hodson and the prisoner came into my house; I knew Mr. Hodson by his living with Mr. Townsend; they asked for a pot of beer, there being no company in the public room, they sat down there, believing him to be an honest man I brought the beer in a silver tankard, afterwards the chairman came in, and called for a pint of beer; I brought him a pint to a separate box; in about 8 or 10 minutes, Mr. Hodson asked me if I would lend him two guineas; he seemed to be much frightened, and in a consternation; I lent him two guineas; he trembled in a very bad manner; I saw him give the prisoner the 2 guineas; I kept walking about the room, and was as attentive as I could, thinking there was something extraordinary; in about 5 minutes after he asked me to lend him another guinea; I gave him another, which he gave the prisoner at the bar; they staid but about 5 minutes.</p>

            , Esq; On the 9th of August, in the evening, about 10 o'clock, being at supper, this servant, who had been my housekeeper near ten years, (but at this time servant to a lady who was at my house) brought me up a letter, which she said she had received from a young man who was son of a reputable farmer near Durham, and shopman to messrs. Townshend and Altham in the Strand, the purport of the letter was, that he was arrested on a note of hand he had given, was then in a spunging-house, and desired her to send him 7 l. 10 s. to discharge the debt. I advised her not to send the money, but desired to see the person that brought the letter; (suspecting indeed at that time that the lad was connected with some set of sharpers; she said there was a bailiff, and a lawyer; when they came into the parlour, the prisoner, who had called himself the lawyer, said he was only an acquaintance of the prosecutor, who had sent for him two hours before to the spunging-house, and desired him to come with the bailiff to get the money from my servant; at this time I thought the behaviour of this pretended friend very suspicious. I then asked the maid-servant how long she became acquainted with the young man, the prosecutor? and whether she believed him honest? She told me she was intimately acquainted with his parents, who were very creditable people near Durham, and had always had a very good opinion of the lad; in consequence of this, I told the bailiff if he would let the young man go home to his master that night, I would be answerable for his appearance the next day, or would pay the money myself: the bailiff readily agreed to it, and promised me he should certainly go home; on which the prisoner immediately turned to the bailiff, saying, what! will you let him go without the money? but that is your affair, not mine. This gave me strong reason to suspect a fraud; and the bailiff seeming then to make some difficulty, I said I could do nothing more in it. The maidservant, anxious to get the lad home to his master, desired to have a man-servant go with her to the spunging-house, accordingly they set out immediately with these two men; some short time after they were gone, I began to be apprehensive that the poor girl might be ill treated by these fellows, I determined therefore with Mr. Leyborne, who was at supper with me, to follow them: (Mr. Leyborne is now in the country, or he would have attended here) when we came to the spunging-house, and asked for this young man, the prosecutor, they either did not, or would not understand, but threatening to go to Sir

            , who would oblige them to produce him, the bailiff, who had been at my house, appeared, and immediately the young man was produced, who seemed much frightened, but as much rejoiced to see people whom he had reason to believe were come to his assistance. We went into the fore parlour with the young man, and were followed by the man who kept the spunging-house, the bailiff, and a woman; I asked if my servants had been there, they answered, they were returned to my house, to borrow the money of me, that the plaintiff would not release him till the money was paid down; we asked the lad what the debt was for, told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176309140023"/> him, we suspected he was either connected with some rogues, and wanted to impose on his friends, or that it was a gambling debt, if the latter, that we would protect him; the master of the house, the bailiff and the woman would scarcely let him answer for himself, but would continually be answering for him</p>
               <p>Q. Had you learned what it was for?</p>
               <p>Mr. Arbuthnot. I found it was for a note of hand, and insisted on seeing the note; they told me the plantiff (as they called him) had it; I asked who he was? they said, it was the person who had been at my house; we said, we were convinced it was a fraud, and that the lad should not pay a sixpence of it; we told the young man if he would tell the truth we would procure him justice, if not, would leave him there; on this (while Mr Leyborne was talking to the people of the house the young man whispered me that he would tell me the whole affair; I then desired the people to withdraw, and leave him alone with us; they went out, and he told us the affair, just as he has now related it in the mean while we heard a great noise in the other room, and found the master of the house was turning the people out of his house; he immediately came to us, told us we must go out of his house; that unless we would stay all night, we should stay no longer there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prosecutor tell you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Arbuthnot. He told me that this man the prisoner came to him in the street when he was sick; that he was in liquor; that the prisoner persuaded him to walk down some lane with him, what lane I cannot recollect, nor do I remember that he mentioned any thing of the air off the water; that as he was making water, the prisoner seized him by his penis, and took the things mentioned from him, and said he would charge him with sodomy, if he did not give him a sum of money; that he brought him back to a public house, and made him give him money, and had continued to do so from time to time, I cannot recollect the particulars, for in less than five minutes time the fellow turned us out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go so far as to say, that this note was one of those that this man at the bar had extorted from him, before you was turned out of the house?</p>
               <p>Mr. Arbuthnot. He did, he said this was one for which he was arrested; that he had from time to time given him several notes, that as one note was cancelled, he obliged him to give him another. I had indeed almost forgot to mention these very material circumstances, but the sequel of my evidence will make it appear, that he related the whole affair to me as minutely as the short time we were permitted to be with him, could allow of. When we were turned out of the house, we determined to go to Sir

            . I am a watchmaker; I had this watch of the prisoner at the bar, ( producing a silver watch) I received it of him on the 8th of Aug. in order to be cleaned and repaired.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that watch, do you know it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, the same that I was robbed of that night by the prisoner in Temple-lane; here are two seals on it, one is mine, the other is not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I find my character was taken away about three years ago. After this man found I was come to London and had no friends, he was persuaded to swear a robbery against me to save his own life; I am informed he was told it might easily be done. As to imagine that if I had robbed this man, I would have arrested him and put him into a Spunging-house, is quite out of character. My Lord, I was drinking at a public house, the Antigallican and had had two or three tankards of beer in the back-room, there was a whitewasher in the house, making some alterations in it, we played several games at draughts, first for a tankard of beer, then a shilling, then we departed from that place, and came to the Coach and Horses at Temple-bar, there the prosecutor called for two pots of beer, then we departed, I have seen him from time to time; after that meeting him in the Strand, as I came over in order to be a chairman at Temple-bar, I was to give a guinea and half to be broke in, we drank together and parted friends, I never attempted to rob him in my life, we were intimate together; as we were walking up the Strand once, he said he had fallen down and broke his watch, and desired I would carry it to the watchmaker and get it mended for him; I said, no, you are sufficient to carry it yourself; I believe he gave it to some chairman to carry it to the watchmaker. There is a woman that heard Morris say, that the prosecutor would give him money to appear against me, and I sent her after Morris in order that she might speak the truth.</p>

I told her I was the constable; (she knew me, for I had had her to the Compter once before for the like offence) I desired her to be peaceable, and satisfy the neighbours that she would not set the house on fire; the more I endeavoured to perswade her to govern her passion, the more outragious she grew, and both her husband and she declared the first that entered the room they would kill them, if they lost their lives for it; this they repeated many times over.

The neighbours all desired I would take the woman away, and said they would assist me; I went up, and took one of the watchmen's staves, and fell to breaking the door; the man at the bar catched the staff, and pulled it through the hole I had made in the pannel, and gave several punches at us, one man he hit over the head, but with his repeating the strokes we catched it, and got it from him, then we broke in; there was another man, a brewer's servant, they wounded in the belly with a shoe-maker's pegging awl; I took the awl out of the woman's pocket afterwards, it fitted the wound; we tied their hands and arms, and had them to the watch-house, and from thence to the Poultry-Compter.</p>

I heard a weapon taken up, it chinked somethink like a pair of tongs; I said to the constable, let us be upon our guard, for at the same time I heard the man swear, he would kill the first man that entered the room, if he lost his own life. Soon after I saw the door open and the glimpse of an arm came out, pretty low, the constable was then on my left arm, or rather behind me; the deceased turned to me and said, I am stabbed, or wounded; I said, I hope not; he said, see here; I saw his bowels out about as big as a little apple.</p>

               <p>As the indictment was laid that the fact was done in Middlesex, all the witnesses, upon being asked, answered the London Hospital was in the county of Middlesex.</p>

               <p>I had been at work very hard, and was got home to bed with my wife and three children, we had been in bed near three hours, these people came in a riotous manner and forcibly broke open my door, there were a great many of them, the streets were lined from top to bottom, some sailors and soldiers, they pelted brick bats into the room, and killed a child five years old, it died last Tuesday, they hit it on the breast, there was a gun-barrel and a hatchet thrown in, they said they would beat my brains out and knocked me down, I was laid for dead.</p>
               <p>The woman's defence was to the same purport.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lemond. After the deceased was brought down wounded, it was determined to get into the room, and a ladder was set up against the window, and there might be brick-bats thrown in, but not before; I neither saw nor heard of any, and had I, I should have taken the people up that had thrown them in.</p>

             deposed, she confessed the same to him, with this addition, she was shewed the poker which was found by the deceased, she said she did it with that, and afterwards wrenched a cupboard-door open with it and took out a quantity of halfpence, and Dickenson was with her, that he hit the deceased with a broom-stick, but she did not think that murdered him; that she took the poker and hit him several blows on his head, and did the murder herself. She said, she gave the halfpence to a man whom she would never discover; the end of the poker was compared with the marks on the cupboard, and they exactly agreed. When she saw the body of the deceased lying in a shell, she said, I am the unhappy creature that killed that tollman that lies there; poor soul! you'll have a coffin, I'll have none, to Tyburn I must come.</p>

I was answered it was not, then I took measures to apprehend her; she was met with in the street by one of our clarks, who followed her to a tavern, where she was apprehended; the day after I had word brought she had confessed her guilt, and wanted to tur evidence; I attended her at Wood-street-compter, there she told me Barlow, Richardson, and Lloyd were the men that forged it, and she uttered it, and was to have a guinea for so doing. Some days passing, and nothing done in apprehending them, I obtained permission of Mr. Alderman Cokayne to carry her before Sir John Fielding, that she might give the like evidence before him, to enable him to set his officers to look after the men. She gave the same information there, she said one of the three men made a mark, the other two signed the names of the two witnesses; Sir John advertised a reward for apprehending them. Soon a message was brought me that Barlow was in Wood-street-compter, I went, and found him with the keeper, who knew him. he having been in custody before, for a similar affair; he declared he could open a very large scene of of this kind, and desired to be admitted evidence; at that time he neither denied nor confessed it; we told him we apprehended we had evidence sufficient in the woman to convict every person concerned in this fact, and it was clear he could not be admitted; this was repeated to him often. Mr. Kirby, the keeper, was present. Barlow said, the woman was a very bad woman, and had not been candid in her information, for one

               <p>Atkerson.

            , then he put it down on the back of the other power, then I carried that to the Crown on the other side of Moorfields, but Richardson was waiting in the Street at Mr. Mure's for me, as he always did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who prepared that?</p>
               <p>Clark. Barlow, Lloyd and Richardson did. Barlow and Mrs. Richardson met Mr. Richardson and I at the Crown, I told them what the gentleman said, then they said they had made a mistake in the christian-name; we parted at that time, and in a day or two after they left a line for me at the Three Tuns in Brooke's-market, to go to them the next day at the Crown ale-house again; I went, there were Mr. and Mrs. Richardson, Mr. Barlow and Mrs. Durant; Richardson pulled out a power of attorney and gave it to Barlow to fill up, which he did in a little room joining the bar, I saw him do it, he signed Thomas Coleby to it, and Richardson signed the other witness to it, Mrs. Durant made the mark, she asked if she should make the mark, or sign the name, they bid her make a mark, she can write extremely well, when she made the mark she said it was as particular a mark as could be made; Barlow put a wafer in it, and it was carried into the tap-room before they signed it; then I carried it to the office, there Mr. Dickson told me the gentleman was not in the way, and I must come again in half an hour, or the next morning; Mr. Richardson was at the door, I told him what had passed; we went to the Crown, there they were all waiting, Richardson told Barlow it was stopped, they said they must make use of some scheme or other to get it out of their hands, as it was a bad affair to lie in their hands, Barlow said, I should not have let it go out of my hands till I saw the gentleman myself. In about four days or near a week after Richardson called upon me again at the Three Tuns, and desired, I would meet him at the Crown the next morning, I went, there was Mr. and Mrs. Richardson and Barlow, there was a letter wrote to be sent to Mr Mure, Richardson had wrote it; Barlow said it was a very improper one, Richardson desired him to write another, Barlow said his hand would be known again, as he had filled up the power of attorney, he was very loth at first to do it; Richardson said he could write a different hand to that, as the power was filled up in a very small hand: with a good deal of persuasion Barlow did write one, which was sent to the gentleman; I gave it to a porter, and he carried it, I was to wait at a public-house for the porter, Richardson went part of the way with the porter; the porter came back no more, Richardson came and said, the gentleman had taken up the porter.</p>
               <p>Q. At what house did you wait for the porter?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176309140033"/>Clark. I do not know the sign, it was on this side Moorfields. Barlow went out of the Crown, and said he would go and see for Richardson, we saw one another no more that night; Mrs. Durant called upon me once or twice after, but we had no talk about it, till I went to her one day, and said, Barlow is gone out of the way on account of the power.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Durant?</p>
               <p>Clark. She is a gold and silver button maker. Richardson and I were upon Tower-hill about a month after I went with the power of attorney, we called at a public house, I went from thence to the Castle tavern, I saw the gentleman come in with a constable, he said, that is Mrs. Cox; (directing him to me) I said, my name is not Cox; he said he did not care whether that was my name or not, I was the woman. I was taken before the Alderman, and had been in Wood-street compter three or four days before I made this discovery; the first I mentioned, Richardson, Barlow, and Lloyd were concerned, and the other, Barlow, Richardson, and Durant; I did not at first know it was a separate thing, Lloyd had no concern in this, nor Mrs. Durant in the other. I was three times at Mr. Mure's with powers of attorney; Lloyd, Barlow, and Richardson were in Soaper's; the second was Barlow, Richardson, and Lloyd; and this, Barlow, Richardson, and Durant.</p>

Soon there was an information they were at Durant's house, Clark went and shewed us the house in a court in White Fryers, we went and took Durant; I kept her separate from Barlow, I mentioned this power to her, I think she said she did make her mark, but was ignorant what it was. I had not seen the power of attorney then.</p>

               <p>Thorley. A great many of these letters are pretty much alike. I don't look upon this to be a person's common hand-writing, it is much like to Barlow's, it seems to be a fictitious hand.</p>
               <p>Ananias Wares. A woman gave me a letter to carry to Mr. Mure's, a man was with her, at the Swan alehouse, Coleman-street, I never saw her before or since. (He looks at Clark.) I can't say whether this is the woman or not. (He is shewed the letter.) This looks much like the letter.</p>

             were coming on horseback from Barnet races, between 9 and 10 at night, in the new road between Islington and London, the prisoner and another man came out of the footpath and asked what it was o'clock, he answered he could not tell; the prisoner put an oaken stick before his horse's head and stopped his horse, they both said, D - n your eyes, your money, or we will blow your brains out. He called to his companions, they fired at him directly, and afterwards struck at him several times with the stick; he thinks it was the prisoner that fired. When they found hi s companions coming up, they ran about ten or twenty yards towards Islington; he rode and got before them, and turned them back again, then the other tumbled over the rails and got off, he rode up to the prisoner and knocked him down, he got up again and was going to get over the rails, and he took him by the collar and secured him, and took the stick from his hand. (producing a large oaken stick.)</p>

I did not know she was your wife, I said no harm to her; (it was dark, but we were just by a lamp, I had not seen him before; he said, D - n you, that is not what I give me what you have got; he had a knife open in his hand, and a stick, and swore, if I offered to speak he would kill me. Then Buckley, and one Smith, not taken, came over the way to us; Buckley took my watch from my pocket; they were trying to get their hands in my pocket, I cry'd out murder! Mr. Iverson, under whose window we were, called out at the window; I begged for God's sake he'd come and assist me; Buckley and Smith set off running; I had hold of Higgins, I kept my hold, Mr. Iverson came down, and we secured him; I had him on the ground, and a knife was found where he lay on the ground; the woman continued there; she took an oath she had never seen Higgins before. Higgins gave inforformation of the names of the others before the bench of Justice on the Monday, in consequence of this Buckley was taken on the Friday, and Buckley owned he was the man that took my watch out of my pocket, and said he had pawned it with Mr. King in Horsely-down, where I found it; he owned, he, Higgins, and Smith, robb'd me on that same spot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Iverson. I heard the cry of murder on the 4th of September, at night, under my window; I went down with only my shirt on, the prosecutor had got the prisoner, and said he would never leave him, saying he had got his watch: As soon as he got up there lay this knife open, (producing a long clasp-knife) he was secured in the watch-house, the prosecutor told me, there were two more, but they were run away.</p>
