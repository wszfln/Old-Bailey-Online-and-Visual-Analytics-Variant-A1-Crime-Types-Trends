             was one of my lodgers. On that day, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140004"/>came to my house and made an agreement to lodge in my house that night. Massa went to bed about half past eleven. After that time, the prisoner came to me; I lent him three shillings. He was to come back about half past twelve in the morning; he did. I then shewed him up to bed; he slept in the same bed with Massa. After the prisoner went to bed, I locked the outer door myself, before one o'clock. About half after one, I heard somebody go down stairs; I did not see him. I heard the back door make a noise. I went down about half past one; the front door was then wide open. I went up to see who was in the house. I missed the prisoner, and nobody else. I afterwards went to the Black Horse, and had the prisoner taken into custody.</p>
               <p>LYON JONES. I live with Mr. Solomon, a watchmaker, in Nightingale-lane. On the 11th of August, in the morning, a little after five, he asked me whether I had a watch-ribbon to sell. I sold him a ribbon. I looked at his watch; I observed there was a glass wanting. I tried to fit it; he left the watch with me to fit a glass to it. The watch was a single cased watch; it opened both ways. I lent him a plain watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that watch again if you saw it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return it to you - A. No, he did not. I did not see him again until he was taken up.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I, and Butler, apprehended the prisoner I searched him, and found in his pocket this card of Mr. Solomons; that led me to Mr. Solomons, and I found this plain watch upon him.</p>
               <p>Jones. This is the watch. I lent the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I took the watch I was in liquor. Mr. Wright shewed me up to bed; I laid myself down; I felt a watch in this man's pocket. About half past three, I went out; I met this man at the door; I asked this man if he had got any watch ribbon to sell. I broke the glass of the watch. I asked the man to put the glass of the watch in; he gave me another watch to put into my pocket. I did not intend to keep the watch. I told the prosecutor I was looking after him. When he came into Mr. Lee's, in New Gravel-lane, where I went to, he said, he was looking for me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Wright. Was he in liquor when he went to bed - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. I never saw her until the officer brought her to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140005"/>house. I was at home on the 1st of August; I was in the shop. About four o'clock in the afternoon, I went up stairs; I found the door of one of the rooms open, the key of that room hung upon the bail below stairs, where it always did. My daughter, Charlotte, had locked the door of that room.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know - A. Because the key hung in the place where it always did. My daughter, Charlotte, locked the door When I entered the room, the drawers were all open, and empty; about half after two o'clock. My daughter's clothes were all in the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. to Charlotte Powell. Upon this first of August, were you in the room where your mother has been speaking of - A. Yes. I left the room about half past two; I locked the door, and left the key down stairs in the parlour. When I left the room, the drawers were all locked, except one. My clothes, and my sister's clothes, were in these drawers. In one of these drawers, was a black veil, two necklaces, and a great number of things; almost all the things I and my sister wore. On the Saturday following, I saw one of my gowns again. This happened on Monday, the 1st of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see all that was missed - A. No, not all. Some are lost entirely; a veil is now missing, a broach, some collars, and a pair of minature pictures.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that all these things were safe in the room when you went out at two o'clock - A. Yes; I had looked over the drawers that morning. I did not return home until Tuesday. I shall know all the things when they are produced.</p>

            . I keep a clothes-shop, in Fore-street; in the parish of Cripplegate. On the 1st of August, the prisoner came to my house, between the hours of five and seven; I cannot positively say the hour; she offered me for sale, five gowns, three small neck-handkerchiefs, three bonnets, a small white muslin cloak, and a shawl; she offered these for sale. I bought them all. She asked me two pounds eight shillings; I gave her two pounds five shillings for them. On the Saturday following, Miss Powell passed my door; she saw a gown hang in my window; she asked me if I knew of whom I had purchased it; I described the prisoner. I then told her every article I had bought, to the best of my knowledge, and told her, I would go in pursuit of the prisoner in Rag-fair. I had seen her at my shop three or four times before. On the 18th of August, the prisoner came to my house again; I caused the prisoner to be taken into custody. I returned to the Miss Powells all the property.</p>

We all left the room, except Miss Welchman; we went into the adjoining-room, the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. In the front room could you hear what passed in the work-room - A. Yes; we could hear. We heard him name to her, to go out to supper with him; she said, she could not go.

I desired the prisoner to go; he said, he would not go until Miss Welchman had given him a letter which she had of his. Miss Welchman said, she had destroyed it.

               <p>Q. At the time that you left the front room, how was the window that looked towards the street - A. The shutters were bolted. There are two windows; they were both so when we went into the kitchen to supper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the kitchen before you either saw the prisoner or the deceased again - A. About five minutes; I saw the deceased, Miss Welchman; the deceased came down to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner follow - A. No. Miss Welchman was in the kitchen only a minute; she said, she must return to the prisoner, not for us to wait supper for her; she must return to the prisoner, and she hoped she should soon get him out. In about five minutes, I was alarmed by Miss Welchman screaming; next was the report of the pistol, and instantly the report of another. I ran up stairs, not farther than the parlour. I did not go at all to the first floor; I stopped in the parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you called up on account of the dispute - A. I was. I went to the noise. The scream was followed immediately by the report of a pistol; the report of a pistol was followed by the report of a second pistol. I ran up stairs as quick as I could; when I got on the top of the stairs Miss Welchman was laying half way out of the room; her legs were in the room; her head out. She was bleeding at the head; she appeared to be dead at that moment, quite dead. I went into the room directly, and saw no one. I found no man there; from the back-room, I went into the front.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there a perch under that window - A. There is a lead over the door; he might have got out upon the lead of the door, and have got down without falling upon the spikes. I saw a pistol in the front room, and one in the middle-room.</p>

I gave orders that the house might be searched. I immediately went up stairs to the first floor. On entering the first floor front room I saw the deceased, Miss Welchman, supported in a chair, with two wounds upon her head. I observed a wound in the right temple. I found the pistols in about a quarter of an hour afterwards. The pistols were both found in my presence. A hat and one pistol was found in the front room where the deceased was supported, and one pistol in the middle room, called the work room. These are the pistols, and that is the hat.

               <p>MR. RUSSELL. I am a surgeon. On the 4th of August last, I was sent for to Miss Macey's; I went, and saw Miss Welchman; she was just expiring; the cause of her death was the two wounds she had received, one in the right temple, the other on the left side of the head. They appeared both pistol wounds. The pistols were found in the room. I had the holding them, and on putting my finger in them they were damp, therefore I think they had been recently discharged.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, perfectly well. On the Friday evening, the 5th of August, a quarter before ten o'clock, he came without a hat to me, and borrowed a hat. I did not hear of the murder of Miss Welchman until the Sunday following. I asked him how he came to be without a hat; he said he happened to get himself into a hobble at Bartholomew fair, and lost his hat. The fair was over that day, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you formerly know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, sir, he worked for me formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. Early in the month of August, did you see him near Salisbury - A. Yes, on Tuesday the 9th of August; I caused him to be apprehended. I read the description of him in the newspaper, and caused him to be taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How near Salisbury was it - A. Between eleven and twelve miles the other side of Salisbury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am certainly innocent of the charge. It was never my intention to murder Miss Welchman, nor ever did such a thought enter my head; and that hat Mr. Chapman, the hatter, knows is not mine. I lost my hat in Burlington Gardens. Them pistols are not mine; I never had any pistols since I left Spain. I never offered or asked for supper, the witness knows it well. I went down stairs with my hat a little before eleven o'clock, or about that time.</p>

I heard the report of some fire arms; I instantly ran to where I thought I heard the report spring from; on my coming up to Mr. Cartwright's door; the door was half open; I saw a man stand in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, is that the man - A. That is the man; he had a pistol in his right hand. Mr. Cartwright was singing out watch; I made answer, here I am. He said, that is the man, seize him; I instantly laid hold of the prisoner. The prisoner said, do not seize me, I shall not run away. I said, no, I shall take good care you shall not run away. I said, I believe you have killed the woman. He said have I; I answered, I believe you have. He said, is she dead; I said, I believe she is. He then said, let me kiss her cold lips, poor girl, I loved her. That is all I know. I secured him, and took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you observe this glass and poison - A. No. I did not stay with him in the watchhouse; I went on my duty.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did the prisoner bring any thing off his stomach after he arrived at the watchhouse - A. Yes, he vomited; it was washed away; he asked for cold water; I let him have it. He drank between three and four quarts of cold water, and vomited a great deal in the course of the night. I did not confine him as other prisoners are; I let him sit in my chair. I went to Mr. Cartwright's two or three times in the night, and enquired the state of the poor woman's health. I found one pistol in his pocket. This is the pistol that was fired off; it is bursted. It was loaded too full I understood. That pistol was delivered to me at Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in about eleven o'clock on the 4th of July, in the evening; I saw the young woman who had been carried up stairs. On examining her, I found the wound on the right side; it was a gun shot wound. She lived until three o'clock on the Sunday following, and then she died. I opened her body; I found there was a wound, and three hundred shots in her liver alone.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of shots - A. I understand they are called No. 2; very small ones.</p>

               <p>Mr. Deane. I have some of the shots that were found on the steps; here are three of them I produce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heaviside. They were about that size, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140009"/>three hundred were in the liver, and two hundred in her bowels. I have not the least doubt that was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a most serious regard for the young woman, as I had for my own child. I never thought, nor never had it in my mind to injure the poor girl. I respected her, and loved her, and would have done as much for her as I would for my own child. I declare, in the sight of a just God and your lordship, as to the manner I fired that piece off I know no more than your lordship. If I am found guilty, my sentence is just, I acknowledge in the sight of God. I hope it will be a warning to all. If I die, I die; sure am I, my soul will be happy with God.</p>

            . I am a journeyman carpenter; I live at No. 2, Swan-place, in the Kent-road. The prisoner lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lodged with you before the 4th of July - A. Nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time did he appear to you to be a person in a sound mind - A. He did not.</p>

            What did you observe in his deportment that made you think he was a man not of a sound mind - A For some few days the carpet was always drawed up in a morning, and the room was wetted all over; and several times in the morning, and late at night, I have heard him singing; his singing was humming, not singing a song. My wife was very much frightened at him; at last he seemed very wild indeed. My wife wished me to speak to him to get him out of the house; I did not; he remained in the house until the time this unfortunate affair happened. At other times he was melancholy.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you thought he was deranged - A. Near six weeks before the 4th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sleep in the room under him - A. No, he slept in the front parlour, and I in the back parlour. I have heard him get out of bed as I supposed, as I supposed he tumbled out by the noise; he would be singing and making a noise; he was more so the night before the 4th of July than he was before.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you ever mention it to any other person than your wife - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever observed anything in his department which gave you reason to think he was deranged - A. Yes, often; I have seen him very melancholy; he talked rather incoherent; he was often writing, scribbling; his writing was not as other people usually write; it was scribbling. I was afraid of staying in the room with him. I always got out of the room when I could. I thought he was deranged.</p>
               <p>MR. COHEN. I am a calico printer; I live in the Kent-road. I knew the prisoner in Locks-fields; I have had no knowledge of him for the last three years; before that, I had reason to suppose the man was out of his mind; he used to alarm the whole neighbourhood with his screams and hallooing in the night when I lived near him. I have seen him in the public-house called the Cottage of Content in a very incoherent manner.</p>

            . I am a baker; I live in Deane's-buildings, Lock's-fields, No. 9. I lived next door to the prisoner for seven years. I have not known much of him for this time twelve month; he left his lodgings, and went into the Kent-road. I have observed a great deal of derangement in him when he lived near me. I was called in one evening by his daughter; I went up stairs, and found him laying on his bed; he was biting the sheets on the pillow. This is about a year and a half ago. I asked him the reason; he said it was for Betty. He was considered by all the neighbours to be in a deranged state. I remember once he talked about throwing himself over London bridge; that was at three o'clock in the afternoon. He was formerly a clerk in the Excise; it is better than two months ago he has been out of that office; he was suspended or what they term put back.</p>
               <p>MRS. BENNETT. I live in Dean's-buildings, Walworth, within two doors where the prisoner did live. I believe the prisoner to be a very insane man indeed at times. I had not been long in that neighbourhood before he made love to me. I am a married woman, and have six children. That is about three years and a half ago; at that time I had been in no house with him ever in my life. Mr. Bennet was very angry with me; it made me very uncomfortable. Within the last six months he had poison taken from him in my presence. It was six weeks before this affair happened. The daughter and the mother took it from him. I did not see it taken. He had a very insane appearance at the time. I attended Mr. Pilcher,

In his waistcoat pocket, I found a five pound note, and a bill of sale for the cattle. This is the five-pound note, and this is the bill of sale for three beasts.</p>
               <p>(The bill of sale read.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Finch. Look at that bill of sale - A. This is the bill of sale of the three beasts; I made it myself. The five-pound note was paid him by my book-keeper.</p>

            . I am book-keeper to Mr. Finch, and I am clerk to Mr. Jones. I paid that five-pound note to the prisoner; by the direction of Mr. Finch, I took the numbers of the notes that I paid him. I have got a memorandum in my pocket. This note corresponds with the memorandum.</p>
               <p>DANIEL LEADEETTER. I am one of the marshal-men. The prisoner and another man last Wednesday were brought to the Mansion House; they were remanded until the Friday. The prisoner sent for me to come to him in the Compter. I went to him. He said, he wished to say something to me; he said, he received these beasts of Gazelie; he was induced to sell them as Gazelie owed him some money; he was induced to sell them to get the money of him. The Grand Jury threw the bill out against Gazelie.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed by another man to drive the beasts; when he came near the Fountain, he put the beasts into this drover's hands, saying to me, he wished me to go into the market, and speak to Mr. Finch, to make the best of them, and to receive the money for him; as he was something in my debt, he ordered me to keep part of the money for myself. It is a false thing to say of me I stole the beasts.</p>

I knocked at the door three times; I knocked again, and then Hannah Goodger opened the door. I entered the room; it smelled very strong of aquafortis. I told my brother officer, to lay hold of the prisoners, there was coining going forwards; the man prisoner was sitting in the room, with his shirt sleeves tucked up; there was another man in the room; I did not know him; the woman prisoner came to the door in a confused state. My brother officer, secured the man prisoner; the other man went out. I searched the room. On the fire was this cup, half full of aquafortis, and thirteen shillings in it; the thirty shillings were in the aquafortis boiling on the fire; I knew they were counterfeit shillings. I then proceeded to the cupboard at the side of the door. I found in a plate fifty shillings, all ready for circulation. I found in a paper some shillings half finished; I have got them here, and a number of papers containing a white stuff, a composition. I tried this stuff this morning, before Mr. Powell; it coloured a copper halfpenny white, the same as a good shilling.</p>

               <p>Johnson. I found in a bason some aquafortis and water. I also found two vials, one with aquafortis, and the other with vitriol, and I found this stick, what they stir the aquafortis round in the cup; it is burnt with aquafortis. In the chimney I found this coarse rag, what they rub over the shillings with after they come out of the aquafortis after being boiled. This spoon is what they mix up the composition; it is stained with the white composition; there was a saucer full of this composition. I do not know the name of the stuff. That stuff, and with what is in the jug, will colour a copper halfpenny with the white surface of a shilling. I found these white rags; they have the appearance of having been burnt with vitriol and aquafortis. I found a flat iron, which appeared as if copper had been hammered on it, and I found scowering paper. The prisoners were very much confused, and said nothing in my presence. We took them out of the room as soon as we could, for fear they should throw any thing off the table.</p>

Yes, it was on the 26th of July, she came at about eleven o'clock in the day; there were three of them; one stood outside the door; the prisoner and another woman came in. The prisoner called for a quartern of cloves; I served her; she gave me a shilling to pay for it; I gave her sixpence in change. They went out, and the moment they went out Johnson (the officer) came in. I shewed him the shilling that the prisoner gave me; the same shilling I marked by his desire. I am quite clear the prisoner is the person that gave me the shilling, and I gave her the liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her on the 26th of July last - A. I did; I saw her first in Whitecross-street; there was a party of them together; I suppose there were fourteen or fifteen of them, together; the prisoner was supplying them with bad shillings. I know that of my own knowledge. The prisoner was giving some money to the parties before she went off; she was distributing them herself. Three of them set off together; the prisoner at the bar, and two others. I knew the other two before. They went to Old-street; they at last came to Mrs. Marlar; they separated themselves before they came there; they went into several houses before they came there, and when they came to Mrs. Marlar, I placed myself at the bow window, so that I could see them and they could not see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing tendered from the situation of your place - A. I did, a shilling; the prisoner tendered it after the cloves had been served out. I am sure the prisoner is the person that tendered the shilling. They came out, and immediately I went in and asked Mrs. Marlar to let me look at the shilling; Mrs. Marlar shewed me the shilling; I desired her to mark it; she gave it me; I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>JURY. How many went in - A. Two went in and one staid out. I kept the shilling. I went after the prisoner, and took her into custody. I did not tell her what I took her in custody for; she knew. I searched her; in her pocket I found this tin box; it contained sixty-eight counterfeit shillings, and three counterfeit sixpences. In another box I found a bit of scowering paper, which appeared to have rubbed the shillings to get the grease off. I also found on her eighteen-pence in copper, good money, and a dollar good, and a sixpence good. I gave them to her. I asked her how she came by the money; she said she found them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the shilling that you received of Mrs. Marlar - A. It is.</p>
               <p>JURY. We should like to know where the shilling was put before it went from Mrs Marlar into the officer's hands.</p>

               <p>Q. You say the two other shillings had letters on them, and this is a plain one - (The shilling uttered by the prisoner to Mrs. Marlar, handed to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of letters were upon the two shillings in the till - A. One was an A and the other a P stamped with a punch. The mark on the prisoner's shilling is my mark. I had noticed the two good shillings; I know the persons from whom I had actually received them. I have not the least doubt that is the shilling I received of the prisoner.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman took a false oath. I never offered a base shilling. The other woman is lesser than myself; she gave the shilling. I poured out the liquor. I never gave the shilling; I did not indeed.</p>

I think it was between eleven and twelve o'clock she came in by herself; she asked me for half an ounce of cotton; she was particular whether it was sewing cotton or drawing cotton. I took the shilling of her; I suspected it to be a bad one; I was looking at it, and on my looking at it, Johnson (the officer) came in; he asked me to take care of the shilling. I put it on the back counter by itself. There was no other money on the counter where it could possibly be mixed. After I had placed it there, Johnson searched her, and when Johnson had searched the prisoner, I gave it to him. I am sure it is the same shilling that I received of the prisoner. The till was before me, and the back counter behind me. There wast nothing there.</p>

            . I am a city officer. I was in St. Giles's the day this took place, about half past eight in the morning; I saw the prisoner; I knew the prisoner; I watched her and another woman; I followed them through many streets, and saw them alternately go into different shops.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of knowing what they went into the different shops for - A. Yes; they passed many shillings; they were put into the till. I followed them until they came to Mrs. Ward's shop; I looked through the window; I saw her tender a shilling to Mrs. Ward, and while Mrs. Ward was looking at it I went in. I desired Mrs. Ward to keep the shilling by itself; it was a bad one. She looked at it, and put it behind her. The prisoner was present, and never mentioned a word. I told the prisoner I thought she had caution enough before, instead of going on the same game; to that she said nothing. Before I went out I searched the prisoner; upon her I found another bad shilling of the same make, and the same letter on it; there is a W. on it. There was another bad shilling wrapped up in paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Ward give you the shilling that she had received of the prisoner - A. Yes, after she had marked it in my presence. This is the shilling; I have had it in my custody ever since. I also found upon her three shillings and one sixpence in good silver, and fourpence three farthings in good copper. I found several articles upon her, threads, &amp;c. In the course of her journey she went into shops, where these things could have been bought. She went into nine or ten different shops; a pork shop, wine vaults, haberdashers, &amp;c. I have had these shillings ever since. One of them is the shilling I had of Mrs. Ward, and the other I found upon the prisoner. This is the shilling I had of Mrs. Ward.</p>

They walked along the street until they came to New Gravel-lane, and when they turned down there, Dan told me to go for an officer. I went for an officer; his name is Willan. When they came to New Gravel-lane, Roberts walked on very fast, and Dan with him. I then went to Shadwell office for an officer. I got some boys to watch where they went to. When I returned, they told me where they went, and when I came back, I took the officer to Mr. Lee's house, in New Gravel-lane; I found the prisoner there when I went in with the officer. The prisoner said, he had no notes in his pocket. I had a child with me. I went out of the public-house. Afterwards when I was called in, I saw some notes. That is all I know.</p>

             came and fetched me; I went with her to Mr. Lee's; I saw the prisoner there; he was surrounded by a great many people in the tap-room, waiting until an officer came. I searched him. I found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had searched him, did any body say any thing to you, that led you to a farther search - A. Yes; Mr. Lee, he is here. I went into the privy; I searched the privy. In a crevice I found a two-pound note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Dan. How many of your notes did the prisoner snatch out of your hand - A. Four two-pound notes, and a one-pound note. I got two of the two-pound notes, and the one-pound note back; I catched them out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. to Willan. You found only the two-pound note - A. Here are the other two-pound notes; I took them from the prosecutor. The magistrate ordered me to give him other money for them. The three two-pound notes are successive numbers. I have kept them ever since. The prisoner made very great resistance; it was with great difficulty that three of us could get him to the office; two other officers came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dan. Were there any marks on the notes when you lost them - A. I am no scholar. I had them just as the gentleman gave them me at Chelsea. I did not look at them</p>

            . I keep the Black Horse public-house, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - A. I know him very well; I had known him a good time before; he is a coal-whipper; he whips the coals out of the hold. On Wednesday, the 20th of July last, he came to my house, between two and three o'clock; the prosecutor immediately followed him; he said to the prisoner, you have robbed me; the prisoner answered, I have taken nothing from you but what you owed me. I said, if he owes you any thing, you have no right to rob him, to take it from him in that way. He struck the prosecutor in my house. I said to the prosecutor, fetch an officer; he shall not go off until an officer comes. During the time the prosecutor was gone for an officer, the prisoner went out into my back yard; when he went out, he had some paper in his hand, it looked very white. I went to the privy; I said, Roberts, you should not have robbed the man; he then got up, and I think I then saw one or two duplicates in his hand. When he came into the tap-room. I secured him in the tap-room I stood at the door, and would not let him go He staid in the room until the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the officer he had better go and look in the yard - A. Yes; I went with the officer, and saw him find one two-pound note. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dan. Had you any previous acquaintance with the prisoner before that day - A. I had no acquaintance with him. I had never spoken to him before. I had seen him working at the coals.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man said, he did not know me; I am a pensioner; he is a pensioner. We had been drinking together at a public-house at the top of the street, the sign of the Red Lion. This man worked in the rope-ground, and I jobbed in the rope-ground. I lent him eighteen shillings; I asked him for it several times; he owned to it once or twice; he said, he would pay me. I threatened to summons him. On this day, as I was coming from my work, I met this man; I asked him if he would pay me this trifle. I said, you have had your pension; he said, no; I owe you nothing; I will pay you nothing. He pulled these notes from his waistcoat pocket. That woman was not by him then; she came afterwards, and said, I had robbed him. I said, you are telling a story. There were people then walking thick and fast. This woman came from Shadwell office with an officer. After I went into Mr. Lee's house and called for a pint of beer; they would not draw me any beer, because this man said I had robbed him. I walked out into the yard, and returned into the tap-room again. I never struck the man, nor any thing of the kind; it was broad day light, and not two stones throw from Shadwell office, and there were many people passing.</p>

I stood a distance from the shop; the prisoner was then in the act of locking the door up; as he generally did of an evening. He then came up to me; I observed something bulky at the side of his coat, rather more than of an ordinary size; I asked him what he had got there; he replied, nothing. I said, I must see. I took out of his pocket ten or twelve pounds of lead. I asked him if he was not ashamed of himself; he begged of me to forgive him, and he would come to work in the morning; he supplicated very strong for mercy. I sent for an officer, and had him taken to the Compter. That night I went to his lodgings with an officer. There I found lead and solder; I cannot charge the prisoner with that. Upon examining the lead the prisoner took, one piece was stamped with a particular mark; I knew it to be mine.</p>

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Rivingtons; their names are Francis, Charles, and John.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you accuse these prisoners of - A. On the 19th of July, we had six books come from the binders, and on the 20th or 21st following, one of these books were missing; which circumstance I mentioned to Mr. Rivington. I was desired to attend Hatton Garden office; where I saw the book that was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man and woman prisoners - A. The man was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to the shop for some little articles; he was porter to Mr. Smith, one of our bookbinders. He used to come to our house with the books. I know nothing of the woman.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ILEBURY. I am foreman to Mr. Bird, bookbinder. We bound these books, and sent them home to Mr. Rivingtons on the 19th of July last. I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THISSELTON. I am an officer. I received private information that the female prisoner had pledged a quantity of books that she had received from her husband. I went to Mr. Hill's, the pawnbroker; there I found some new printed books, Bibles, and religious books. I at last, found the man prisoner worked at Mr. Smith's, in Albious-buildings; he is a bookbinder; he works for Messrs. Rivington. I went into the house, and apprehended the man prisoner. The woman was waiting in Albions-buildings; I apprehended her. I afterwards found that the book mentioned in the indictment was bound at Mr. Bird's, in Hatton Garden. I discovered there were thirty pledges at Mr. Hill's; all new books. Out of these, several were claimed by Mr. Rule, as the property of Messrs. Rivingtons. The prisoner acknowledged that he had done it through distress. I asked him how he had done it; he said, he took home the work between boards, when he delivered his work he used to purloin books, and put them between the boards; he told his master so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a false thing his saying I took them between boards and brought them away.</p>
               <p>Thisselton. He did most positively say, he took them away between boards. He told me his wife used to pawn them. He said before the magistrate, he did it through want.</p>

On Saturday, the 20th of August, between the hours of two and three o'clock, the prisoner came into my coffee-room; he called for his dinner; it was given him by the waiter. There were three or four spoons on the table. I had a suspicion of the prisoner. I desired the waiter to look out, as I suspected the prisoner to be the person who stole two spoons on the Wednesday preceeding. According to my order, he looked out, and missed two spoons off the table where the prisoner sat I desired him not to take notice, to go backwards and in his business. As soon as I was satisfied the prisoner had the spoons, I sent for an officer; which I had detained in the bar until he had paid the waiter for his dinner, and half a pint of wine. I desired the waiter to go to the bottom of the court, and to wait there, and the person that I should follow, that was the man that I suspected. The prisoner went out of my premises; I followed, and stopped him. I told him that I had a strong suspicion that he had some of my property about his person; I had sent for a constable, he should search him, and to avoid a noise in the street, we would go back, he should be searched in my house; the officer came and took him up stairs, and searched him. I heard the spoons rattle in his pocket as he went up stairs, and during<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140016"/>the officer had his hand in his right hand pocket. The prisoner produced the two silver spoons from his left hand pocket; he said, there is your spoons; I believe it is your intention to give me in custody; I said, most certainly. He was taken to the Compter. The officer has the spoon.</p>
               <p>JAMES HAND. I am an officer. As I was searching the prisoner's right hand pocket, he pulled these spoons out of his left hand pocket, and delivered them to the prosecutor; he said, these are your spoons Them are the spoons; they have never been out of my custody since. The prosecutor delivered them to me.</p>

               <p>EDWARD CRAMP. I am a dealer in cattle. On the morning of the 22nd of July, I was in Smithfield market; I observed there five bullocks, and while I was handling them the prisoner asked me if I would buy them; I said yes, if he and I agreed about the price; he asked me, twelve pound a piece for them, and agreed to sell them for eleven. They were small Scotch cattle. I marked them at the tail, and after I had marked them I went round the market. The prisoner came to me for the money; I asked him what his name was; he said,

I enquired of three salesmen if they knew such a person. I returned to the prisoner; I told him it was not customary without he knew any body in London, and giving reference, to pay money to a stranger. He said he did not know any body in town. He then said if I did not pay him for the beasts he would put them to somebody else to sell, which he did to Mr. Biggs. I then, went to Mr. Biggs, and told him not to sell them, as I had bought them. The prisoner said he would drive the beasts away. He was in the act of doing it; I called an officer, and told him to detain the beasts until he could prove he came honestly by them. The beasts were detained, and taken to the Fox and Knot yard, the regular lock-up yard I then went to the prisoner, and told him he and I would have no more words about it; if he could prove he came honestly by them I would go with him to Hadlow, and pay the coach hire, and I would pay him at his fathers. A drover informed me that Mr. Adair's bailiff was at the Fox and Knot yard. I went to Fox and Knot yard, and saw Mr. Pick; he claimed the five bullocks as Mr. Adair's property.</p>

               <p>JAMES PICK. I am bailiff to Alexander Adair, esq. On the morning of the 22nd of July, I was informed of the loss of these five bullocks; I took my horse, and came to Smithfield. I found the bullocks in Fox and Knot yard; Cramp and I looked at them together. These five bullocks that Cramp and I saw together, were Mr. Adair's property. We sent them back to Mr. Adair.</p>

On the 25th of July, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my master's shop; he asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed him some. After he had looked at them, he asked to look at some others that were in the window. I turned round to get them, and when I returned to him with the other handkerchiefs I perceived his left hand behind his coat. He looked at these other handkerchiefs, and of them he offered me five shillings for it; I said I could not take it. He turned round to go out; I saw a piece of handkerchief behind his coat; I called to him to stop; he then began to run. I set off after him; a man stopped him, and took the piece of handkerchiefs from him. I got up to the prisoner; the man gave me the piece of handkerchiefs. I took hold of the prisoner, and took him back to the shop. This is the piece of handkerchiefs; they are my master's property.</p>

In the afternoon the prisoner came in and had three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140017"/>pints of ale. I went in the parlour, and saw him there. I heard my wife give the alarm; I came down stairs immediately my wife said, only think the man that is just gone out has taken the clock. We pursued the prisoner. In the course of ten minutes the prisoner was stopped by the patrol, and taken to the watchhouse. I went to the watchhouse, and saw the prisoner and the dial; it was given in the charge of the constable. That is all I know of the transaction. This is the dial; it is mine. I am sure the prisoner was in the parlour at the time I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BOND. I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner came in about ten o'clock. I served him with some ale; he had two or three pints of ale; he asked the waiter for a bed; I told the waiter to tell him he could not have a bed; we never let strangers have a bed; the waiter told him. He paid for the three pints of ale, and had change of a one pound note. About twelve o'clock he passed by the bar; I was sitting in the bar; he wished me good night; I got up, and wished him good night. I saw he had something in his hands which he held under his arm; I thought it did not belong to him. I gave the alarm and several went after him; but they did not see him until he was just taken. When I locked in the coffee-room I saw the dial was gone. That was between twelve and one o'clock.</p>

            . I called at the manufactory about twenty minutes after nine on Sunday evening, the 31st of July. We have two entrances to our manufactory, one a carriage entrance, the other a private entrance for the men to enter the workshop, about two yards from each other. The moment I put the key into the lock of the door where the workmen enter. I heard a great noise; I did not go in; I enquired who was within two or three times, and receiving no answer I called out for assistance. In a short time two men came up; one informed me he was an officer; he begged me not to open the door until he got farther assistance, conceiving they were desperate characters within. He went for assistance; the other remained with me. A few minutes after he was gone two men rushed out of the carriage entrance. We pursued them. The prisoner Godden I secured in Fore-street, about one hundred yards from the manufactory; we lodged him in the Compter; and on our returning we met the prisoner Williams custody; he was taken in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know they are the same men you saw come out of the manufactory - A. I do not; I have every reason to believe they are. I lost sight of Godden, for a moment; he was walking when I stopped him she was pointed out to me by every one that knew him. When I stopped him all the things in the indictment were missing. The property was found on the staircase, ready to be taken away. It consisted of a portable desk: that was mine; it contained brass work and and wire, my father's property. I believe the prisoners to be the persons.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday night, the 31st of July, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock; I heard the cry of watch. I immediately ran to the spot where the voice came from; young Mr. Rolfe said there was somebody in his premises. I went immediately to get another officer. As I was returning with the officer there was a cry of stop thief. The prisoner Williams was running towards Moorfields. I got sight of him just as he turned round Moorgate. Williams is the man I pursued. A man after him on horseback. I am sure Williams is the man I was pursuing. Another man stopped him in Moorfields; I came up just as he was stopped. When I got up, he said do not hurt me, I wish I had not taken to this way. I took him to the watchhouse, and searched him; he had only a few halfpence about him. I took him to the Compter, and returned back with Mr. Rolfe to search the warehouse. When we opened the door, there were a great many things tied up in different bundles. This chisel was laying against the bundles; here are two skeleton keys that laid close to the bundles. This key opens the warehouse door; this opens another, and here is a handkerchief; he had no handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140018"/>round his neck when I stopped him; this handkerchief contained some doe skins.</p>
               <p>Godden's Defence. I was at home at half past five in the evening; I had occasion to go towards the Tower. On my return home I came through the Church-yard, and up Fore-street, in my way home to Golden lane.</p>

               <p>Q. What makes you accuse him of taking your coat and waistcoat - A. My coat and waistcoat was taken out of my cabin, on Monday morning last, about half past four o'clock, and they were found in another vessel. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>JOHN CARR. I was on board a collier; that is not Mr. Robinson's ship; there was one ship laid between Mr. Robinson's ship and ours. I slept upon the half deck; our dog barked; I jumped out of bed; I looked into a lighter; there was a man there; I asked him what he was doing there so early in the morning; he came on board our ship, and asked me to lend him our boat to put him on shore; I refused. He said, he would get a scaller. I stepped over our ships quarters; I saw a little bundle laying upon the lighter's gunnel; the prisoner was standing about a yard off the clothes. I called out here, a hand here, I suspect this man, here is a thief; the Captain came, and looked at the clothes; he said, he is a thief. I directly took hold of him. One of our men went on board the lighter, and fetched the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner - A. No; I never saw him before. It was between five and six in the morning. The dog barking, I looked into the lighter; I then saw the prisoner, and the bundle.</p>

The other struck me; I throwed him down, and held him there until assistance came; Collins is the man that came to my assistance. This was at eleven o'clock at night; it was a dark night. I was quite near to Morley when he dropped the pig.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLLINS. I am a sailor. I was with Mr. Hales, he asked me to come to his assistance. I saw both the prisoners come out of the gate; I saw the pig close by one of their feet. I gave chace of them; I got Morley down, and gave him into Mr. Hales possession. I pursued Besher; I got him down, and kept him down until more men came up.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of all this property - A. I cannot say; the silver articles were new when I bought them; they cost five pounds; they were second hand when he took them. The watch I had a long while; the handkerchiefs was worth a few shillings. The key of the parlour was left in the door.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 30th of August; he was going to the East India House to receive his pension. I found a hat and a pair of pantaloons on him that belonged to Ralph Scowler. He had no more clothes; I left them with him. He then told James Scowler, when he got his pension he would pay him for the things he had taken out of his house. He was charged with stealing the silver articles.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; he lived in her service about twelve months ago. On the 3rd of September, I missed a black coat, a pair of grey trowsers, a fifteen-pound note, a five-pound note, a two-pound note, and five one-pound bank notes. These things were put in my box; my box was at the top of the house; the bake-house was in the lower floor. I missed the property on the 3rd of September, about eleven o'clock. In consequence of that, I traced out the prisoner; I suspected him. I had seen the prisoner about two months before that, at my mistress' house. I traced out the prisoner at the Edenburgh Castle public-house, at Wapping; I found that he had lodged there on Saturday and Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was the 3rd of September - A. That was Saturday. I enquired if he was at home; they expected him soon. I waited, and in about half an hour, he came in. I told him he was the man I wanted; (however, in the mean time, I sent a young woman down, to the Thames Police office, for an officer.) When he came in, he was without his hat. When I asked to speak to him, he wanted to go out of the room; I kept the prisoner in the room. The officer came, his name is

He came in for his box; he was very much intoxicated. A friend of his seeing him have a great deal of money, advised him to give it me to keep for him; he gave me a fifteen-pound note, a five-pound note, and five one-pound notes. Then I helped him down with his chest, and put it into the coach. I went with him to the Edinburgh Castle; we put the box down there. His sister came there; I gave her the money at the Edinburgh Castle; I gave to his sister twenty-one pounds eleven shillings and sixpence; a fifteen-pound note, a five-pound note, a one-pound note, and eleven shilling and sixpence in silver. The rest he paid to a young man.</p>

             delivered the prisoner into my charge. I told the prisoner I must search him; which I did, and found nothing. I told him he must go with me to the office; he rather refused. I asked him if he had any clothes there that belonged to him besides what he had got on; he said none but what he stood up in. In taking him to the office, he tried to make his escape, by jumping over the rails into the water; he turned himself on his back, and swam like a cork: he was taken up by a boatman. I got him again, and I took him to the office, and went back and enquired if he had any box there; they readily told me he had, and pointed it out. The box is now in court. My brother officer and I searched the box. In the box we found this coat, and these trowsers.

            . I am an officer. I went with Dyeball to the Edinburgh Castle. I waited for the return of the prisoner's sister; she came in company with her husband. I informed her the situation of her brother, and requested to know if she had received any money of him; her husband answered, we have received three bank notes of him. The sister pulled them out, and shewed me two bank notes, not the third; one is a fifteen-pound bank note, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140020"/>other a five-pound bank note; these are them; I received them of the sister; I have had them in my possession ever since. The other was a one pound note they had broke into. They likewise acknowledged that they had received eleven shillings and sixpence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that coat and trowsers - A. The trowsers and coat I am quite clear are my property. The fifteen pound note produced by Mr. Smith; and the five pound note, are part of the property I had in my box. I know them by my handwriting being upon them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of July, I was coming up Tabernacle Walk, some distance from Mrs. Brown's house I saw the prisoner Garrett running; a mob was coming after him. I ran after him; he turned down Paradise-street; he ran through a court there; I catched him. I received information that he had stolen a watch; I asked him what he had done with it; he said he did not steal it, he had it of the other boy. I asked him what he had done with it; he said if I would go with him he would shew me where he had put the watch. I then met the prosecutrix, she had the watch in her hand. The watch had been picked up and given to her before I came to her. I have the watch now. The prosecutrix gave me the watch. Topping and Garret asked the prosecutor to forgive them; she said she would not. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my husband's watch; a strange person picked the watch up, and gave it me. I overtook Topping and Garrett in Tabernacle Row.</p>
               <p>Topping's Defence. I was very dry; I went up a passage, and into this lady's house; I found the door open; I asked for a drop of water; there was nobody within; I came out again, and asked the lady at the next door; she said what have you been in there for; I said I went in to ask for a drop of water; in half a minute after, there was an alarm after me that I had stolen the watch; I told them I had not.</p>
               <p>Garrett's Defence. I was going along the street; a constable came and look me, and said I had been stealing a watch; I said I had not. I never told any body the other boy gave it me; he had not.</p>

I came home to my dinner. The prisoner asked me to purchase the duplicate of a watch. I said, Taylor, what do I want with a watch, there are two hanging there. I shewed him the two watches; they were hanging over the mantle-shelf; he said he wanted money for this duplicate; he must have money. He asked me if I could inform him where a Jew lived, that he might sell this duplicate. I said this is the Jews sabbath. It was on Saturday, at half past twelve o'clock. The Jews will not purchase until their sabbath is over. I sent him to Hyams, a Jew, on the ruins. Then the prisoner left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room with you besides the prisoner - A. My wife was. It being dinner time after the prisoner went to the Jews, I had my dinner, and went away to my work; it was then about half past one o'clock. My watches were both hanging there when I went to my work. The prisoner went away almost immediately when I directed him to the Jew. About four o'clock my wife came to me at my work, and said Taylor had been there after I was gone. She told me my watch was gone, and Taylor had taken it. I went home, and took Taylor with me. My wife told me where he was drinking. I went and took him home with me. I said nothing what I wanted with him until I got home. Going along, he said he was surprised why I should have the impertinence to detain him from his business, I being an officer. I had no staff with me to secure him in the open street. When I got him to my home, I put on my coat, and told him I was a constable. I took my staff out, and said I must search him. I searched him; I found nothing on his person whatever. He began to be very impertinent to me. I sent for a brother officer to assist me; we secured him. We went to the house where two men were in company with him drinking. Me and my brother officer took the prisoner to the Rose and Crown, the corner of Dartmouth-street, where the prisoner had been drinking with the other two men. We searched one of the men that were drinking with him. The man that we found and searched had offered this watch to pawn at Mr. Thompson's, a pawnbroker. Mr. Thompson was ordered to deliver the watch to me by the magistrate. This is the watch; it is one of the two that were hanging over the mantle-piece. Mr. Thompson delivered this watch on the Thursday after the Saturday I lost the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 20th of August last, the prisoner coming to your house - A. Yes; he was there twice; the first time was between twelve and one; he asked my husband to buy a duplicate of a watch. In the afternoon, he came a second time, in company with another man. The first time he came alone. When the prisoner went away the first time my husband was at dinner. My husband went to work between one and two; when the prisoner returned, it was after three. A soldier of the name of Brown was with him; they came to see a woman that lodged in my house, up stairs; she happened to be in my room. They all three went up stairs. She was speaking to me at the time they came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When your husband went out were the watches all hanging up there - A. They were; they were there when they came at three o'clock; I am certain of it; they were hanging over the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay up stairs - A. About ten minutes. Mr. Taylor came down to my room; he might set there about half an hour; he then asked me to go to let them know he was going. I did. I went up the first staircase and called them; they came down stairs with me to the street door.</p>

The prisoner was then at the street door; he was waiting for Brown. The two men then went away together. In about ten minutes after they were gone I missed the watch from the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed one of the watches from the mantle-piece - A. Yes. When the prisoner went away, and Brown, the young woman went up stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that when the two men were there she was not in the room - A. When they came she was there, but not afterwards. When Brown went up to her she was not in my room. When Brown came down, she came to the street door with him, and when they were gone she went up to her own room immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, between the time of their going and you missing the watch, had she come into your room - A. No, nor any one else. When I missed the watch, I went to my husband and told him of it. I told him the house they were at. I saw them standing at the Rose and Crown door when I went to my husband. My master came home faster than me. That is all I know.</p>

The prisoner came for a small quantity of len muslin, and while I was ringing the bell for assistance to come into the shop. she took the shawls. I did not see her take the shawls. There was no other shopman in the shop at the time. When I returned from ringing the bell, I missed the shawls from off the counter. I advised the prisoner with having them; she said she had not got them. I still said she must have taken them off the counter. The three shawls were taken off the counter; they were concealed by part of her apron being over them. They were taken entirely from the counter.</p>

Yes, about a quarter after eleven o'clock at night, I was going home, and just before I went to the rope house, Anderson came up and took hold of my arm; I had never seen him before; he asked me where I was going; I told him I was going home. Foreshaw then came up and took hold of my right hand. Anderson said to Foreshaw, we must look to see whether he has any money I had my coat and waistcoat buttoned. The prisoner pulled my coat open, and tore my waistcoat pocket. I hustled with them to get away; I got away from them, and ran about. An hundred yards; they ran out right over Mile End-road. I went into the rope-house, and looked at them, and then I went into the road, and sung out robbers. I went to the Ship public-house; some gentlemen were coming out of the public-house; I told them what had happened to me six of us pursued them. I took the way I had seen them ran. I was not present when the prisoners were taken.</p>

            . I was at the Ship public-house when Lewis came past the door, it was about a quarter past eleven at night; he said, he had been stopped by three men in the fields, but they had not robbed him of any thing; he described their dress. There were six or seven of us at that time; we divided ourselves. We knew the spot Lewis had described. We went where it was most likely we should fall in with them, we passed through the posts by Mr. Steven's rope-house, of rope-ground; Foreshaw was laying there about thirty feet from the foot-path, close another side; we asked him to get up; he readily got up. He asked what we wanted with him; we told him there had been an outery that a man had been stopped there. It was in the moonlight night. When Foreshaw got up, I asked him what he did there; he said, he had been in the French prison and in a Spanish prison; he had no work or lodging; he was going down to his master; he had promised to get him employment.</p>

I found Anderson between the ground and the George public-house; I touched Anderson as he was laying in the field with my stroke; he started up I asked what he was doing there; he said, he had no lodging; he laid there to sleep. He was taken charge of. He had a jacket and trowsers of the as he in now.</p>

On Sunday, the 28th of August, it happened I was standing on London-bridge to see the contagiation; most unfortunate for me. I was standing close to a person who had lost his watch, by being taken out of his pocket. The prosecutor said he had missed his watch he upon that turned round, and discovered his watch laying on the ground. I humbly submit bow I can be the person that took it; the reason of my being close, to the prosecutor was on account of the people being so close together. Can it be supposed that I took his watch, unless he had laid hold of my hand with the watch in it, and then I dropped nothing; yet, he has brought me before the court on suspicion of my taking his watch. I am perfectly innocent of the slightest suspicion of any thing of the kind.</p>

            , junior. I lost the hessian on the 1st of September; on the 2nd we found it. I went to the Mansion House, and desired Matthews to come to my house, and take the prisoner into custody; he came, and after he took him into custody, the prisoner asked Matthews what was the matter; I told him he was a bad man; he had robbed me; he said, he had not. I then told him to take his hat and go about his business, and take his bag with him; this bag contained shreds, which are swept up; the shreds we allow the porter, as perquisites, with the straw, which is another perquisite for the porter. He went then into a lower warehouse by himself, and fetched his bag, and brought it into the upper warehouse. I then asked him if there was any thing in the bag but shreds; he said, no. The officer took him to the Poultry Compter; there the officer asked him again if there was any thing in this bag but the shreds; he answered, no, nothing but shreds. The officer turned the bag upside-down, and out came this hessian; four yards of Scotch sheeting, called hessian. The officer asked him if the sheeting was shreds; he said nothing then. The officer marked the sheeting. The prisoner acknowledged that he took it, and meaned to make a pillow-case of it. I told him he had stolen many other articles, and he had better tell me all he had done, and whom he was connected with. We then went and searched his lodgings, 59, Vere-street. There we found many other goods our property; we found there a piece of calico.</p>

               <p>CHARLES MATTHEWS. I am a constable. Mr. Pope came to me at the Mansion House; he told me he had a porter that he thought had been robbing him. I went with him to the porter; I asked the porter if he had any box there; he said, no; he had a bag. I put my hand into the bag twice, and pulled out these shreds. I told him to come with me to the Poultry Compter, and there at the bottom of this bag I found these four yards of sheeting. He said, he was going to make a pillow-case or something if that sort. Then I went to his lodgings. I found some of the prosecutors property there, and through a paper in this bag, I found a quantity of goods at a public-house in Camberwell.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The hessian sheeting was taken from the prisoner's bag; it is our property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

He called again; these pieces of cloth were delivered to him by a relation of mine, of the name of Crosby, to take to Basinghall-street. He did not return any more that day; he should have come back to take three more; there were six to go. In consequence of that, we were alarmed, and made enquiry to know whether the goods were delivered; they were not delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the goods - A. They were never heard of; we never found the goods at Messrs. Dalby and Company's in Basinghall-street; he never delivered the goods. After waiting two or three days, we offered a reward, and three or four days after that he was taken, and after going before the Lord Mayor, he was fully committed.</p>

I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings in St. Martin's-le-grand; I there found the three yards of corderoy among other things. I matched the three yards of corderoy with the remainder of the piece in my warehouse; it matched exactly. This corderoy is my property. I am sure that piece was cut off the bigger piece.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of August, I received information that the prisoner was endeavouring to pledge a wet counterpane at Mr. Flemming's, pawnbroker, Fleet-market; I went and met the prisoner coming out of Mr. Flemming's door; she was endeavouring to roll this counterpane in a dirty rag. At that time the counterpane was quite wet. I asked her what she had got there; she made no answer. I told her I was an officer; I should see what she had got I asked her whether she had taken it from her lodgings; she said, no, it was not hers, she did not know any thing about it. I locked her up, and made enquiry about the way I understood she came; I discovered it belonged to Mrs. Gillies; I went and told the prisoner I had found out an owner. This is the counterpane.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Cardosa - A. On this night, Cardosa and two others ran out together; a girl came, and called Cardosa. I am confident that Cardosa and Da Silva went out with the two other men; I did not follow them. Cardosa was the first that returned; Da Silva returned in about half an hour; when Da Silva came in, he had a knife in his hand, a table-knife round pointed; he said, it was his landlady's knife. Staples, a young man, came in, and said to Da Silva, you have stabbed the man; Da Silva made no answer. I asked him if he could swear to stabbing the man; he hesitated, and said, he could not. I said it was of no use detaining Da Silva. I had heard there had a man been stabbed; I had not been out to see. Da Silva went out immediately,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140028"/>leaving the knife with me. It was a common case knife; there was nothing remarkable on it. When I saw Cardosa next was at the Police office. Da Salva I have not seen until these three or four days.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you discover enough to make you say what was the cause of his death - A. I attribute that he died from that wound. That wound night have been made with some sharp instrument; a common clasp knife would have made such a wound as that.</p>
               <p>(The conviction of Antonio Cardosa read in court.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the public-house when some women cried for assistance, saying, they had been illused; at the instant I came out of the house, I received a blow in my face. I did not return another. I received a second blow, and fell to the ground. I then got up, and run away to my lodgings, and remained there until I thought the disturbance was over; I took a bit of bread and meat in my hand, with a knife and went to get a put of beer. I heard a man had been murdered by a Portuguese; I had a knife in my hand which I brought from my lodging; I was fearful of taking this knife to the door, for fear I should be accused. I never concealed myself, or absconded from my lodging until I was shipped on board a ship bound to Guinea. I never had any thought that any one could blame me that I should be accused of such a tyrannical deed. I have been twice in this country since; I had my lodgings near Nightingale-lane On the day I was accused by the brother of the deceased, it is a false accusation; it originated by a lady of the Francis, my landlady; on the day I received my money on board the ship going to Guinea, I would not give her any money; she said, she would have me taken out of the ship, and said, I was the man that committed the murder. This worthy gentlemen, is all I have to say in respect to this cause. I call God to witness that I am innocent, nor had I any knife in my hand when I went out of the public-house, nor ever had I the thoughts of it. I swear solemny, like a Christian, that I did not know of the murder of Davis at the time this misfortune happened, until I came to the public-house again. I certify to the gentlemen, that I ab hor the using a knife, nor have I been accused of a smaller crime. A long time have I been in the English service, always behaved properly, have been esteemed by the officers and ship mates in every ship I have been in, and welcomed by all my friends. I have no more to say. It is a very improper thing, after being so many weeks in this country, that I should be accused of this offence.</p>

               <p>Q. Where you at the house on the night she came home, when she received her death - A. Yes. She was very much in liquor when the husband came home; I desired him to go up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the son of the deceased come down stairs - A. No. He came down stairs, I did not see him. The prisoner came and knocked at my door, he asked me to go up to his wife he said she was very ill; I went up stairs; I saw the deceased, she was partly on the bed and partly off. He asked me whether any thing could be done for her; I told him he must get a doctor; he went out for a doctor returned back, he said he could not ring the bell; he went back again, and brought the doctor with him. The doctor said, she must be taken in a coach to the Hospital.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know his person - A. Yes. On Friday the 24th of June, he applied to me for work; we engaged the prisoner to come to work on Monday morning. He came on Monday, and continued working for us until the Saturday week following. On the Saturday week following, I received an order for some garnet ear-rings; in the evening I looked out a small box to pick out these small garnets; I immediately perceived a considerable number had been taken away; I informed my partner. We referred to the stock-book, and found a number gone; there was fifty-two gone. We had never missed any thing previous to the employment of the prisoner; suspicion then fell on the prisoner. I told the prisoner the work he had in hand was particularly wanted; he offered to come the next day, Sunday morning; which I wished him to do, because no other person should be there but himself. On the Sunday, about one o'clock, I took a small topaz from the box when he was there. (Previous to this, I had counted all the stones in the box, and weighed them also, there were seventy-two stones.) The prisoner continued to work himself, and me only, until he talked of going to dinner; as an excuse, I told him I must fetch him some water from the bottom of the house. On my coming up with the water I met him going out to dinner. I immediately went to the shop, and counted these stones; I missed eight. I then told my partner of it, and thinking he would come on the Monday morning, I took no further notice of it then. He did not come on Monday morning at his usual time; at twelve o'clock at noon I went to the Magistrate at Queen-square office. I found out the prisoner's lodgings, but there he went by the name of Wells; I never knew him by any other name than Palmer. I considered it might possibly be some other person. On my return home. my servant told me he had come to work. I immediately returned to Queen-square, and obtained a warrant; the officer came with me. When I came home, the prisoner was in the work-shop; I went into the work-shop; I told him it was needless his coming to work on the Sunday, and to neglect his work on Monday. I asked him the number where he lived. I said, if I had known where he lived, I would have gone to him; he said he lived at No. 2, Arabella-row, Pimlico. I told the officer his address, and called the prisoner into a back-room. The officer searched him, and found a number of duplicates on him, and some pieces of silver; one of the pieces of silver I had given him as materials to work with. I went with the officer to look at twenty-nine stones, pawned at Mr. Lane's in Holborn, with the duplicates; the pawnbroker's man has them now I, and the officer, Popal, searched his lodgings. We found a little box of stones; some of which I knew to be mine. I found eight topaz stones, and fifty-two garnets; I found the eight topaz stones I lost on the Sunday; the fifty-two garnets were missed on the 1st of July. The twenty-nine stones at Mr. Lane's were a variety; I could not speak to every one of them. I am positive I lost fifty-two garnets, and eight topaz stones, and the twenty-nine found at Mr. Lane's, I know some of them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 11th of July, me and my brother officer were applied to by the prosecutor. I went to the prosecutor's house, Castle-street, Leicester-fields; I there took the prisoner into custody. On searching him, I found two pieces of silver and a duplicate of twenty-nine stones pledged at Mr. Lane's, Holborn, for five shillings. I and the prosecutor went to the pawnbroker's; the prosecutor saw the stones; he identified some of them.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Watson. Look at the twenty-nine stones pawned at Lane's - A. I can assert three out of the twenty-nine to be mine and my partner's. The garnet stones found in the prisoner's lodgings, I can swear to be our property, and the eight topaz stones are ours, and the silver the officer has produced is ours; the silver is worth two shillings, and the stones altogether eight pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner use to sleep in the same room with you - A. He used to sleep in the room, but I did not see him sleep there. I had slept there two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner slept there the night before this matter happened - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How early did you first see him in the room - 
               <persName id="t18140914-48-person479">A. </persName>
            About ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak to you - A. No, he appeared quite deranged. I thought him a madman. At that time he was down upon his knees, with his hands lifted up; he said, Jesus, come down from Heaven, and take the evil spirit from me. I did not at all apprehend any mischief was intended for me. He continued in this way nearly an hour. I believe all this was real madness. He then came to the foot of the bed; I persuaded him to lay down, in mild language; I said, my good fellow, you had better lay down, and take a nap; he gave me no answer; he spit in my face; he never treated me in that way before; he always behaved remarkably civil. I did not resent his spitting in my face, because I thought he was mad. I only told him to lay down; he said, come out, you imp of Hell, come out; he immediately cut me with a pen knife on the cheek. I could not see he had a knife in his hand, he did it so quick. There was nobody in the room but our two selves; to avoid being cut the second time I got under the bed; he continued walking about the room. It was about twenty minutes before any assistance came. He did not follow me under the bed to cut me again; he continued falling on his knees and clinching his hands, and making use of the same expressions. The landlord came into the room; the prisoner then ran out of the room. The cut in my face did not do me much injury. I thought he was a madman then, and I think so now.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the house. The prisoner came into my house about eighteen months ago, and the prosecutor lodged there; he was then in his sound mind, a civil quiet man. About a week before this affair happened he returned from a voyage; he told me he had some money to receive at Greenwich; he asked me to lend him a few shillings until he returned from Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know Mighill lodged there - A. I believe he did; he did not appear to be insane at that time. He did not return so soon from Greenwich as I expected by a day or two. On the 9th, the night before this affray happened, he came in between eleven and twelve; he was in a great perspiration, with no handkerchief on; he rather looked wild, and seemed in a very agitated state. I said, Clowes, what is the matter with you; he wished to tell me a long story; I was busy at the bar, I could not attend to him. I begged him to sit down in the tap-room until I was more at leisure; at the same time I told him I had no bed, I would allow him to sit up in the taproom. He remained there all night. I found him very restless; I thought it was the effect of drinking. At the time I went to bed he was very calm, and much disposed for sleep. I had every reason to suppose he was a quiet civil man. When the maid got up in the morning, she found him very restless, kneeling in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any of these eccentricities - A. When I went up at eleven o'clock in the day, I saw him in such eccentricities; he was going down on his knees in this extraordinary way; I spoke to him very sharp. Mighill came from under the bed, called out, Mr. Bristow, he has cut me with a sharp knife; that cause me to act cautious with him; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140031"/>thought then he was actually in a deranged state. I coaxed him; I got him down stairs; he stopped below a little with the knife in his hand. Being a strong powerful man, I was afraid to interfere with him; he went out in the street, and the officer secured him. He has been with Sir

             HARPER. I am a constable. On Saturday the 10th of July, I was sent for to the White Bear, Bride-lane; I went out, and saw the prisoner going towards Blackfriars-bridge; he had the knife in his hand when I took him in custody; he was sometimes praying and sometimes swearing. I believe him to be mad at that time. I secured him, and took him to the Compter. I took the knife from him. I was obliged to get a person to assist me; he was very violent.</p>
               <p>MR. WALDRON. I am a surgeon; I attend Giltspur-street compter. I saw the prisoner while he was in the compter; he was certainly deranged at the first part of his being in the Compter. I examined his head; there is evidently a fracture of the bone; that, joined with liquor, might produce derangement. He was under an irritable fever, under an impression of religious terror. After a day a two, he became perfectly tranquil. He behaved very well from his recovery during his continuance in Giltspur-street Compter.</p>

I went on, and took my oysters into Wood-street. I returned in about ten minutes. I gave information to Harrison; I told Harrison to come to my assistance. When I returned to the door, I saw Radley standing at the door; I pointed him out to Harrison; Harrison catched hold of him, searched him, and picklock keys were found on him. I went into the house; I saw Gilkes n the house; he was coming round to Harrison; I catched hold of him; he was at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

            . I am an officer. Brock gave me information. I went to the house. Going up Aldermanbury, I saw Gilkes at the prosecutor's door; I told Brock to follow me; instead of that he went round Basinghall-street way. I saw Radley instantly came towards me when he saw me. I instantly laid hold of Radley by his collar; I dragged him to Mr. Rhodes's door, and pushed him. The door was upon a jar; the door had the appearance of having been forced open. A scuffle ensued in the passage; Gilkes came running down stairs; I laid hold of him with my left hand; he wanted to put his hand in his breeches; I gave him two or three violent kicks, and then I handcuffed them both together. Brock came in. We searched Radley; I found ten picklock keys, a knife, and some twine upon him. I searched Gilkes; I found thirteen picklock keys, a knife, a gold ring, and a one pound note upon Gilkes. The one pound note I gave him back since. I took him up one pair of stairs, into the back kitchen; I found the copper was laying in the back kitchen; it appeared to me to have been recently taken out. On the dresser I found this iron crow all over lime, that was the instrument we supposed raised the copper; it was smothered with lime when I took it. The copper was removed about eight feet. I tried the crow on the middle door and the outside door; it fitted the marks on the doors. I secured them, and let Mr. Rhodes know; he claimed the copper. This is the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Rhodes. What is the value of the copper - A. It is worth twenty shillings; I paid more than twenty shillings for it. It is mine.</p>
               <p>Gilkes's Defence. Harrison found nothing at all on me.

He was driving it faster than he should, he owned, and I saw the deceased fall; I could not tell whether it was a fall, or whether it was the off horse that knocked her down; the horse on the off side was upon her when she was down. The driver immediately pulled up, and stopped the horses, with the horse upon the woman.</p>

The two horses walked on together until they came to the White Horse public-house; the prisoner then touched his horse with his heels, the horse went on a trot, and afterwards full speed; it was near eight o'clock at night. I did not see the prisoner ride over the man; I was too far behind.</p>

            . I am one of the cashiers in Perring and Company's house. On Saturday, the 13th of August last, the witness, Hinney, presented a draft at our house for payment, a porter did; I cannot positively swear to the porter again. He put the check on the counter; when the porter put it into my hand, I did not think it was the hand writing of Mr. Livey. I asked the ticket-porter from whom he received it of; he said if a person in Lincoln's-inn-fields. I suspected it was a forgery, and took it into Mr. Barber.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen of the City of London. On Saturday, the 13th of August, I was sent for to Messrs. Perrings banking-house, upon this occasion. I accompanied the porter,

            , to Lincoln's-inn; I placed myself at a distance, to see if any person came to claim the charge of the check. I saw the prisoner come towards Hinney; upon my seeing them together, I immediately went towards them. The porter said, this is the person, that gave him the check. I asked the prisoner if he had given that check to the porter; he said, yes. I told him he was my prisoner. I asked him how he came possessed of that check; he rather hesitated at that moment. I asked him who the gentleman was; to that, I believe, he made no reply. I asked him what profession the gentleman was; he said, he did not rightly know. I asked him the gentleman's name; he said, he could not recollect. I thought it a strange account. I asked him where they were when he had taken it; he said, in the street, near the square. This passed in the square, in Lincoln's-inn-fields. It was in a street near the square, but he could not tell the name of the street. I told him he would have to give a better account of it than that; I was under the necessity of taking him with me. We then went through the court, into Chancery-lane; he stopped at the printers in Chancery-lane; that was at my instance, we went in there. I desired him if he could recollect the gentleman's name and where he lived, to put it down in writing; he seemed to be apprised of my intention, and said, I am not afraid of giving you my handwriting, I assure you the check is not mine. We then went to the printers on our road to the Compter, we got as far as St. Dunstan's church, he then said, he had made an appointment to meet the gentleman in the street, or in an eating-house, which is a few doors off the Bar. I told him I would take any steps that he thought proper, in order to discover the party. He then said, if the gentleman sees me in the street with you he would not come up, and then we should not be able to see him. I was in my private dress. I told him I could not with any degree of propriety leave him; we would do the best we could. We went to the eating-house, and found no one. He had put down the name of Sampson on the paper. He then told me this Sampson was a brother clerk; he wished to go to Carey-street. We went into Tooke's-court; I sent the porter up to Mr. Hewett's to know whether Sampson was at home, and while we were waiting at the end of the court, Sampson made his appearance, about an hundred yards from where we were. The prisoner perceived him first, and beckoned him; Sampson hastened his pace, and came up to us; Carley spoke to Sampson; he said, Sampson, this check you gave me is a forgery. I said, it is challenged as a forgery; tell all you know of it. I asked Sampson how he came possessed of it; he said, he had given it to Carley. Sampson said, he had taken it of Mr. Livey in a money transaction. He said, Mr. Livey was a tallow-chandler, living in Chancery-lane. I went with both of them, holding one in each hand. Mr. Livey was at home; the check was shewn him. I asked him if he had paid away a check for forty-three pounds; Mr. Livey said, he did not recollect paying any check of that amount; he referred to his book, and said he had not. I asked Mr. Livey to write his name; which he did. I then produced the check which I had with me; I asked him if he had any knowledge of it; he said, he had not; it was not his hand-writing. I told him it had been presented to his bankers for payment, and found to be a forgery. Mr. Livey then turned to Sampson and Carley, and said. I hope you have not been doing this; you will both be hanged together. Sampson said, he had. This was in the hearing of Carley. He said, he had done it; he began to tell the motive of his doing it; he said to Mr. Livey, do not you recollect paying away a check of eight or ten pounds; Mr. Livey said, he did. Sampson then said, I spoke of the impropriety of giving a check in writing, not using the printed check; how easy it was for any one to forge a check of that kind. He then said, he did not do it with intent to keep the money, only to shew Mr. Livey the impropriety of so doing. I told them I was under the necessity of taking them both to the Compter, but we had better go to Messrs. Perring and Company first. We took a coach, and went to Sir

               <p>Q. While Sampson and Carley were together, did Sampson say any further - A. I put him in the coach; I think he began first I do not recollect whether Mr. Livey began first. The conversation began about the dangerous state he was in; he was saying he did not mean to defraud Mr. Livey out of his money; he intended to return it him. A question arose how Carley came to be possessed of the note, it being a forgery; Sampson said it was prepared in Carley's presence. I spoke further of the danger of the case, what an unpleasant state they were in. Sampson said, Carley had spoken first to him; he said, he wished he knew of any way of getting a little money, it would be of infinite service to him at that time; Sampson said to Carley, he did not know any way, unless by preparing a check; Carley said, in whose name; Sampson replied to Carley, I saw Mr. Livey some time ago prepare a check, I think I could make use of his name; the check was wrote, excepting the number of Sir

            's house, Carley took down the directory and gave him the No. of the house and I believe he mentioned No. 72. I rather think Sampson put it down, as a direction for the porter where to go. All this passed in Carley's presence, and in mine. We never separated until they got into the Compter. I asked Carley whether he had taken the direction from the directory; Carley said, he had taken it down, he did not know for what purpose. Carley was endeavouring to clear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140034"/>himself of any knowledge of it being a forgery; he said, if I had any knowledge of it being a forgery I should hardly have given the direction to the porter where to come.</p>

            . Q. Now mind, tell us the truth - A. I am upon liking with Mr. Drewitt, the attorney. I am seventeen. I had been in Mr. Drewitt's office six weeks before this happened. The prisoner was a clerk there some time before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that check; who wrote it - A. I did; I wrote it. The prisoner and me only were present when I wrote it. On Saturday morning, the 13th of August last, at the time that Mr. Drewitt, junior, was out of town, Carley had a list of debts that he had to collect of a client of Mr. Drewitt's; he said he wished to know how he could get some money, he wanted money very bad; I told him I wished I could inform him how; he then asked me if I knew any way; I said, no. He asked me a second time; he said a few pounds would make him happy; I then asked him what he would say if I would write him a check; he said, could I? I said, I did not know; I had seen a gentleman write one at my father's house about a week ago. He then seemed very much pleased, and reached me half a sheet of paper, and told me to do it. He asked who the gentleman was that I saw write the check; I told him Mr. Livey; he asked me whether he wrote on a blank sheet of paper or a printed one; I said, on a blank bit of paper. I then fore a piece of paper off, and began to write it. I wrote that check. He previously asked me whether I would not date it back; I said, what for? he said, it would look a little better to date it a few days back. Before I gave it him, I asked him whether I should write it for forty-three pounds; he said, yes, that would do. Before I gave it him, I asked him who should take it; I told him he must not take it himself; he said, no, he would not take it himself, he would send somebody with it; he said he would send a porter with it from Lincoln's inn; I said, very well. I held it in my hand, and he took it from me. When he took it, he asked me if I knew the number of the house; I told him I did not. He then took down the Directory, and looked in it; he found it was Messrs. Perring, Shaw, Barber, and Company, No. 72, Cornhill; he then remarked that I had left out a name in the firm, I had left out Mr. Barber's name; I told him that was of no consequence, Mr. Livey did not put it in; he asked whether I was sure I was right; I said, yes; he tore a piece of paper off, and wrote a direction for the ticket porter, and wrote the number of the house; he went out with a view to give it to a ticket porter; he came back, and said there was not any ticket porter on the stand. I had got to go to York-street, Covent Garden; as I was going along I thought I had done wrong; I asked him for the check again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you write the check - A. Yes. He said, oh, no, it is of no consequence, I will go myself; I said, you must not, give it me; he said, no, I will send a porter with it. He afterwards sold me he had given it to a porter, but not the direction; he told him at was 72, Cornhill, and he was to meet the porter precisely at two o'clock in the inn. He then tore up the piece of paper that he had wrote the direction on; he said, if anything should happen he would having nothing in his possession; he said he could work no longer; he longed to have the money in his possession, and put his pen of oneside; he said he would go and meet the porter, and if I would be at the eating-house, Temple-bar, he would meet me there.</p>

                  <persName id="t18140914-53-person539">Q. </persName>
            How much were you to have - A. That was not said; he said he would stop five pounds directly he got it; he told me he told the porter to bring small notes; he was very urgent for the time to come. At two o'clock he went out to meet the porter; I was close after him; I was frightened; I knew I had done wrong; I kept watching him all the time. When the porter came, he held out his hand as if he had got the notes; the porter took hold of his arm; the officer came then. I followed them until they came to Took's-court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The first word on this business was, Sampson said, Carley, do you know where I can get a porter; I said, yes, in the inn; I said, perhaps I can go. I was in the habit of seeing him have checks and notes; I thought he came honestly by it. Sampson appeared confused to the officer. I am quite innocent.</p>

My brother was with me; he went into the shop and informed them.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Ainsley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of this firkin of butter - A. About ten minutes before this firkin of butter was taken I saw Edwards in the shop bargaining about some pieces of bacon; he did not buy any. When the alarm was given we looked about; and missed the firkin of butter. It stood behind the door.</p>
               <p>ANN BARRETT. I am an unfortunate woman. On the 11th of July, I was in company with Edwards and Williams at the City of Carlisle in Rosemary-lane; we had a pot of stout there. It might be nine o'clock. Between nine and ten the robbery was done. Edwards asked Williams and me to go out to Ratcliffe-highway. Edwards went into this shop; he looked at two pieces of bacon. Edwards asked Williams to go into this shop to buy a relish for supper; I went in; he looked at many pieces of bacon; he had one piece weighed; he bought none. That is all I have to say.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS JACKSON. I am an officer. When I took Edwards into custody he said he had the firkin of butter of a man, he was to give him a shilling for carrying it. The next morning he said he would tell me the man, if I would go after him. I went after Williams. I brought Williams to the office; he then declared Williams was the man that gave him the butter; Williams denied it. I produce the firkin.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my firkin.</p>
               <p>Edwards's Defence. When I came out of Mr. Ainsley's shop a tall man said to me. will you earn a shilling; I said, yes; he put the tub of butter on my shoulder. I told the patrol when he laid hold of me, a tall fellow gave me the butter.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. I am an innocent man. I know nothing about the butter, so help me God Almighty.</p>

            Look at the prisoner, do you know his person - A. Yes, I knew him to be the same man, he came with some fringe for a gentlemen; he came to a young man at the back of the counter at work on the hat now in question. The young man went into the further end of the shop, at the back of the house, to make enquiry; he brought some fringe for a gentleman to have at the upper part of the house; he gave the fringe to a young man that was behind the counter; the young man not exactly knowing who it was for, he would go and make enquiries about it; accordingly he went to the back part of the shop with the frings, and left the prisoner at the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you - A. I was in the shop, in a little enclosed place, at a distance from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody with the prisoner then in the shop - A. Not anybody. Before the young man returned the prisoner concealed a hat under his coat. I did not see him put the hat under his coat. I observed the prisoner standing by the counter, and a person coming in to speak to him; that person went but immediately after he had whispered something to the prisoner; in about two minutes after that, the prisoner went out, before the young man returned.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe him do anything yourself, did you - A. No, I was at work upon a hat. The prisoner was not in the shop more than five minutes. Upon his going out, I saw something at the back of his coat, which I suspected to be a hat. It was a close coat he had on; he went out with it in that manner. I immediately followed him, laid hold of him, and told him he must come back to the shop with me; he came back; I told him he had got a hat underneath his coat; he denied it; I said, I will take it from you, and on my turning round the hat fell from him. I secured him, and kept him until my master came. This is the hat that fell from him; I delivered it to Foy, the officer.</p>
               <p>MR. LEVIE. I was going up Bond-street when the prisoner came out of the shop; he attracted my attention; I thought he was tipsey; the shopman followed him. I saw something sticking out. The shopman took the prisoner into the shop. I saw the hat sticking out. When the shopman brought him into the shop the hat fell from the prisoner. The prisoner then asked what we detained him for.</p>

               <p>Q. You had removed the greatest part of your furniture - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you removed your bed - A. Some of them; I had left one mattress bed in the house, in case I might want to sleep there. I have been continually backwards and forwards to the house; if circumstances would permit, I was determined to come back again.</p>
               <p>Q. You left your house about the 15th of July, did you - A. I did. I was in the house on the 27th, I left it between eight and nine o'clock at night, all safe. I paid for the copper, that was in the house as a fixture, so as to have a right to move it when I went elsewere. I left a mahogany tea-caddy, with brass feet, two small straw baskets, a leaden sink, in the front kitchen, and the keys were taken from the doors from the top to the bottom of the house; I had left the keys in the doors. I went to my house on the 30th, between eight and nine in the evening, it was nearly dark: at that time, I found all the doors were open both front and back.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a house by itself - A. No; it is a house in the street. I went in, and found the articles which will be now produced, missing. I lost some other trifling articles; even the keys were gone, and the brass finger plates were broken off the doors. On the day following there was nobody in the house, nor had I given leave for any body to be in the house. We went again on the 30th, and saw the house in this condition.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your house again - A. On the 1st of

In the morning of the 28th of July, between five and six o'clock; I saw the prisoner coming with the copper on his head, and a bundle in his hand; he was alone; he did not come direct from Mr. Skinner's house, he came down another street. I went up to him, and asked him what he had got there; he said, I am moving. I said where from; he said, only up here, a little way. I asked him where he brought the copper from; he said, he was going to get it mended. I told him he must go to the watchhouse, and give a better account of himself. I took him, and the property to the watchhouse; I took hold of the bundle that he had in his hand. At the watchhouse I saw there was a mahogany tea-caddy in it, with four brass feet.

On the 28th of July, between five and six in the morning, the acting patrol and the watchman brought the prisoner into the watchhouse, and a bundle in has hand. I asked him where he was going; he said, to the coppersmith, to get it mended. I asked him the name of the coppersmith; he said, he did not know; he should know when he got there. I searched his handkerchief; I found that tea-caddy in it. I asked him whether he was going to the coppersmith with that; he made no answer to that. I searched his pockets. In his inside coat pocket I found a bag, containing five skeleton keys and nine other keys; the fourteen keys and a screwdriver, have been in the custody of the officer of Hatton Garden office ever since, by order of the magistrate. The officer is here, his name is Limbric.</p>

            . I was watchman on the night of the 27th, and I was on duty on the morning of the 28th. I met the prisoner with Cowley; we took him to the watchhouse; there he was searched. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140037"/>JOHN LIMBRICK. I am an officer. Mr. Whitehair sent to me on the 28th, to come and look at the man. I went to the watchhouse, and saw him; I told him. I knew him. When he brought him to the office, I searched him. In his hat I found these two baskets. I got the keys of the house from Whitehair, the constable. I went to Skinner's house. This skeleton key opens the street door, and these other keys fits every lock in the house. These things have been in my custody ever since. I produce the copper.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to it being my copper; there had been some acid in the copper, which eat the copper in a circle quite bright. I have not the least doubt it is my copper; the tea-caddy is mine, and the baskets; they were made by the French prisoners; these keys belong to the parlour, and the first floor doors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I cannot deny that the property was found upon me; I am innocent of stealing them. I was met by two men, who asked me to carry the property as far as Holborn; I had not proceeded far, before I was taken into custody. I was to have three shillings for carrying them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the copper worth - A. Thirty shillings: the tea-caddy six shillings.</p>

               <p>Piall. I took the prisoner into custody; I charged her with the offence; I neither threatened her or promised her any thing. I asked her how she could rob so poor a man as Mr. Hutchins, with a large family; she told me, she believed the devil was in her when she did it; she said, she opened the drawer with a key. I found a number of keys in her room. She pointed to this key; it opens the drawer of the box. She told me, she paid one of the notes to Mrs. Chapman, the other to Mrs. Goodage. I have known the prisoner some time; I never knew any thing against her until now.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hutchins. Does the prisoner bear a good character - A. Yes; I never heard any thing against her.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money was it altogether - A. Eight pounds. I was deprived of my money between seven and eight o'clock; I was in Phoenix-street, Bloomsbury, going into George-street, I was opposite the Turk's Head, sitting on a step counting my money in my hand, and my hand in my hat; I was sitting down; the prisoner came behind me, rushed herself upon me, and forced eleven one-pound notes out of my hand; she got the notes out of my hand before I was aware of it; when she had done this, she crossed over the street; I ran after her as soon as I had power to get on my feet. She went into a public-house, in at one door, and out of the other; I pursued her through both, I cried out as loud as I could that I was robbed by that person. She run down George-street; where I was jostled by several persons. I did not lose sight of her until she run into No. 4, George-street; when she got in there I was afraid of my life; a great multitude came about me, and I had been jostled in the street; I did not go into the house after her. A person said, if I would stop there he would get me a constable. The prisoner was taken that night. The next morning I saw her; I knew her person; I am sure it is the same person.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you find five-pounds of your money - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM O'BRIAN. I am a taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of the prisoner and Farrell - A. Yes, I do. On the 27th of July, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was sitting in my room at work, I heard a noise in the street; I looked out of the window. I saw the prisoner run away from the prosecutor; she went into No. 4, George-street. Farrell told me the woman had robbed him of eleven pounds; I said to Farrell, you stand there; I will get a constable. I went for a constable, and brought two.</p>

Going through Wellclose-square, three or four men were wrestling one with another, this gentleman was among them; there was another gentleman looking on, as well as me; he turned round to me, and said, you are one of them; he laid hold of me, and I laid hold of him, the same as he did me; I said, do not tear my clothes. Mr. Jackson came up, and asked the charge; he said, two or three men had assaulted him, this was one of them that tried to get the bundle out of my hand; he never mentioned his pocketbook. A gentleman came into the watchhouse; Mr. Jackson asked him what he had to say; he said, he had seen the whole of it. Mr. Jackson said, I believe you are concerned with this party; no, said the man, I am not; he gave Mr. Jackson his address. Jackson gave me no address. As soon as I said he was no good, but a pick-pocket, he walked out. I am innocent of this affair.</p>

I saw the prisoner at M'Knight's on the 30th; I asked him how he came by these forty pieces. I told him the extent of the robbery. I suspected these prints had been stolen. I told him that a bale had been stolen to the amount of fifty pieces. I asked the prisoner if he had any objection of giving up the person of whom he had purchased them; he declined telling me of whom he had purchased them. I informed him in the presence of M'Knight and Elsworth, that if he did not give up the name, I must take him before the magistrate; at last, he told me that he had them of a young man, a neighbour. He did not tell me his name. He said he was a customer. I took him to the office. Before the magistrate, he mentioned the name of Pratt, who lived near the prisoner's house. I had a search warrant, and searched Pratt's house. I could not find Pratt. I took thirty pieces away from Mr. Elsworth. These are them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Glover I believe you first saw these in the warehouse of Mr. Elsworth, as the pieces you sold; are these your patterns - A. They are. I had sold them to a Mr. Casley; they are most of them new patterns. I sold them for two shillings and two-pence per yard, cash.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I purchased the goods in question, of a man of the name of Pratt, residing in Brunswick-street, Blackfriars-road; I knew the man as a general customer at the shop. He came to me on the morning of the 22nd of June, he said, he had a friend in embarrassed circumstances; he applied to him to sell forty pieces of cotton, could I assist him in selling them; I replied, I could not tell; I would take the opportunity of going and looking at them. I said, they would not suit my trade. I was going into the City, if he would let me have patterns. I would endeavour to sell them. That is the whole of the transaction; I leave it to your minds, whether under such circumstances I am guilty of the fact I am charged. I purchased them for the sum of sixty-five pounds, and sold them again for seventy pounds; I sold them to M'Knight.</p>

            . I am a waterman, and constable of the Thames Police office My wife, the deceased, was a woman very much given to liquor. On the 25th of June, she was in liquor. She would have cut me down with the shovel, if I had not prevented her. She was desperate in liquor. I never struck her, or pushed her. I took the shovel from her, she fell upon her head. She was very much intoxicated when I left her, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning. She said, upon her death bed that Mrs Collins had given her her death blow. She was then in immediate apprehension of her death, she always said so, from the time she was taken ill. She said, that Mrs. Collins had struck her under her heart, and had given her her death blow. She died about eleven days after, on the 5th of July, last year.</p>

            . Mrs. Collins came into my mother's shop, and threatened Mrs. Bolus very much indeed; that was the morning the fight was. Mrs. Collins had not offended Mrs. Bolus. Mrs. Collins' boy came for a quarter of a pound of cheese. Mrs. Bolus came in the morning; we asked her whether she had it or no; Mrs. Bolus said, she had not sent for any. Mrs. Bolus went and fetched Mrs. Collins' boy to our shop; the boy would not say whether he had it or no; he would not come in doors. Then Mrs. Collins came, she swore she would have Mrs. Bolus' life before night. Mrs. Bolus accused the boy of getting the cheese without any order. Mrs. Collins was very angry about her accusing her son. I did not see them fight.</p>

            . I saw the fight between the prisoner and the deceased. The beginning of this quarrel was, with respect to three three-shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140040"/>pieces that were deposited in a drawer, they were to defray the expence of reparing a boat. This boy was in the habit of going for errands for Mrs. Bolds. She spent one of these three-shilling pieces in liquor; she accused the boy of taking another to get the cheese with; the quarrel began upon this, and lasted six hours in the street. The deceased flew over into Mrs. Collins' room, she began to beat the boy; the mother defended the boy; they catched each other by the hair of their head, they pulled off each others caps, and the window being open, Mrs. Collins and Mrs. Bolus both fell over the ledge of the window. I cried out murder. This was about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>MR. TOULMAN. I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend Mrs. Bolus; she complained of a great pain across her chest. I attended her till her death; she constantly complained of pain across her chest. She died on the 5th of July. I opened her body; there was no inflamation, but a very large extraversation of blood upon the lungs; the head appeared to be much bruised. The extraversation of blood on the lungs was the cause of her death. I think her life was not worth one years purchase; her life was very precarious. I rather think it was the effect of violence. I saw no external appearance of a blow near the heart.</p>

On the night of the 14th of August, I saw him come out of the Cross Keys at ten o'clock; I advised him to go home, and to go to bed; he was in liquor. He never mentioned that he had lost his watch to me; if he had, I could have found out the lad in two or three hours.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I had been upon business with a gentleman, and I was going home when I met this girl; I went to bed, and went to sleep. I awoke between one and two o'clock; when I awoke, the prisoner was gone. I found my pocket-book, but the notes had been taken out of it. I did not see the prisoner afterwards until the 11th of August and then I saw her in St. Andrew's watchhouse. None of my notes have never been found. I am certain she is the same person.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 28th, there was a disturbance in Kent-street; the prisoner was brought to me by two men, charged with robbing a young woman of this small handkerchief. I searched the prisoner. I found this turnbridge-ware-box on the prisoner. I searched his lodgings in Kent-street I found this piece of flannel, and this pawnbrokers duplicate. I went to the pawnbroker's; then I found out the prosecutrix. I shewed her the goods; she claimed them. The other unfortunate young woman drowed herself on Monday; through distress of losing her things.</p>

            . I live at 150, Kent-street, in the Borough. The prisoner came in on Sunday morning, with a bundle; he went up stairs, and opened it at the foot of the bed; a pair of jean shoes dropped out of the bundle, I picked them up, and delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That shawl, and the turnbridgeware-box is mine, and the other shawl is mine, the red shawl, pledged with Jones. This is the shawl that I accused him of taking on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A day after I arrived in London from Liverpool, I was going through Gray's-inn-lane I was disappointed in business that I came after. I met this girl, she was standing in an entry in her shift; she asked me to give her something to drink; I said, I did not care if I did. I not being accustomed to drink in the morning, it took effect of me. She prevailed upon me to go up into her room. After being in her room, she told me all her clothes were in pawn. I very imprudently, knowing my own circumstance, released her gown and shawl, which cost me fifteen shillings; after that, she got me to send out for more drink. She then took me to a milliner's shop, where I purchased a bonnet for her, at sixteen shillings. We went into a confectioners, where I bought more articles. Then after that, she told me that the other young woman had some things out; she got one pound seventeen shillings of me, and during the time I was with her, I was nine pounds the worse for being in her company. She took me to the Bull and Gate inn, Holborn, she there demanded a one-pound note before she would go to bed with me. The other young woman seemed to have something very heavy on her mind; she said, as soon as she could, she would charge her lodging. I gave her five shillings, and a one-pound note. I went up to these girls room, a black-smith was in the closet, which she called out into the room.

We went to bed at half after ten o'clock, on the 8th of August; we got up on the 9th, at seven o'clock in the morning, it was day light then; I missed my coat and shirt, they hung up in back parlour. I heard no noise in the night. It was the celler partition that he broke open, and crept out of the shop through a trap door.

               <p>Prosecutor, I found the things in the bag in the morning of the 9th of August, they had not been taken out of the house; only put in the bag. He had on a shirt, a shift, and my stockings on his feet. I was present when he was found; he was found in the outer shop; he pretended to be asleep, he was laying on the bag that he had packed the things up in. I can swear to all the things produced are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was with a young woman at the Trumpet public-house; I said it was late, I could not get in; she said, she would find me a bed. She went to this house, and asked for a bed; the door was wide open. I crawled down into the kitchen; I there found some flocks, I laid down. This woman came down, she took my shirt, my clothes, and all my money in my pocket. I never heard a soul come in; it must be her that robbed me. As to a hammer, Mr. Weston did not find on me. They dragged me out of the kitchen; I had not a thing to cover me. I put a shift on instead of a shirt. I being blind, did not know what I laid hold of. I have been blind six years.</p>

               <p>Q. On Sunday, the 31st of July, did you go to Church in the afternoon - A. On Sunday, the 31st of July, about three o'clock, my wife, daughter, and servant, went out of my house first; I went out about ten minutes after three o'clock; I left the door locked, as we usually do; the door of my apartment I locked myself; I took the key of the street door in my pocket, and pulled the street door upon the spring-lock; I left the door fastened upon the spring-lock. I went to Church, and staid until divine service was over. I was the last person that came out of the house; I left a widow woman in the garret, her name is 
               <persName id="t18140914-69-person692">

            ; I left her in the house that day. When I returned, I found the street door open, and the one pair of stairs door open; I missed some of the property. My wife can speak to more than I can. I found the drawer that the property had been in, was wrenched open; the things taken out of it are mentioned in the indictment, money and notes; my wife can speak to the money better than me. One note for ten pound two shillings and sixpence, given by one Mr. Shury, I can speak to; he is an attorney at law. I have a perfect knowledge of that note; that note was stolen out of the drawer that stands in the one pair of stairs room, just by the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. What business are you - A. I am a patten-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the house your own - A. No; I rent it; the house is entirely in my own occupation. I came home about five o'clock; my wife and daughter came home together, they were sent for; they did not know any thing about it. I am sure I fastened the door after me.</p>

He said, I am the man, do not you know me; he said, there was a forty pounds reward for him. That still induced me to keep in his company, to find out what he had done. He then told me of one in the Lambeth-road, were he and Rowe had been concerned together. He told me what he was going to do that morning; he said, he was going to do a good one in Gray's-inn-lane, where he was sure of two hundred pounds in notes; he said, it would be too late to do it then; it was to have been done in the morning, when the people were at Church.

He said, he had left his wife on Saturday morning, with the intention of getting some money for a bill, that he had been out all night, and money he must have. After talking together some time in Gray's-inn-lane, he asked me if I had got any halfpence in my pocket; I told him I would feel, I put my hand in my pocket, I pulled out a shilling, I gave it him, in silver.

While he was in the public-house, I met two City officers, I told them the transaction that was going to be done; one of them went into the George public-house, facing of Gray's-inn-lane. where he could have a view of the house, and see who went in, and who came out; that officer's name is Bray. While I was looking about, the prisoner came out, and said with an oath, the old woman is out, and her daughter, but there is the old man in He went into the public-house again for a quarter of an hour. He came out again, a second, time from the public-house, there, said he, now, the old man is out. He then said, his hand itched, he must have it; here goes! he went up to the door. I stood underneath the George window. He went up to the prosecutor's door; he opened it with a key in his hand; I was at a distance. I immediately went to the prosecutor's door, and as I got to the door to see how the door was, he came out: he said to me, my things will not fit, meaning his keys, but he said, he must have it. He immediately went back again to the house a second time, and went into the house; he stopped in some time, and then I crossed over the way. I saw the curtain of the one pair of stairs let down in the prosecutor's house; I stopped about ten minutes at the door. He came down; I observed his pockets were bulkey; I immediately then took him into custody at the door, and gave Bray the signal to come to me. I took the prisoner then to the public-house; Bray came. When I got the prisoner in the public-house; I searched the prisoner. In this breeches pocket, I found sixteen pounds in silver, three pocket-books, a little tin case, with six half-guineas, a seven-shilling piece, a pair of money scales and weights; and one silver spoon broken; in the pocket-books there were several bills; the bills are now in the pocket-books the same as then. I searched the prisoner in the presence of Bray.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came to know how there was property in the house - A. He did; by his brother formerly keeping company with the prosecutor's daughter, and the family being well acquainted with each other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How long have you been an officer - A. Five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Johnson, tell me honestly; did not you tell him first, you could tell him of a good place to go to - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him, you would put him in a way where he might get something worth while, and did not you give him one of the pick-lock keys - A. Certainly not. I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the watchhouse-keeper after you took him there - 
               <persName id="t18140914-69-person707">A. </persName>
            Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a conversation there - A. No. In the confused state we were in at the watchhouse, we were in a hurry to get back to the prosecutor's house; we were not certain there was any person to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came out of the house, did not you say something of this sort, d - n your eyes, go in again, do not spoil a good job, there is nobody coming - A. No; that is false.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you have persuaded him not to do it - A. No; if his inclination led him to do it, let him do it, and bring him to justice, or else he would commit other depredations.</p>
               <p>JAMES BRAY. I am a City officer. On the 31st of July, I met 
               <persName id="t18140914-69-person708">Johnson</persName>
             a little before two o'clock in the afternoon. In consequence of what he said to me, I concealed myself in a public-house, facing Gray's-inn-lane, in Holborn. I saw the prisoner come across, and go to the door of the prosecutor, Mr. Snowsill; he was at the door about four or five minutes; he then came out of the door, and crossed the way. He then came to the door again, and went in at the door again, he was in some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he was within - A. Nearly a quarter of an hour; he came out, and went across the way; then Johnson gave the signal; I ran over to the house where he took him in. I saw him searched, and I saw Johnson find that property on him. Johnson said, where is there a watchhouse near; I said, in Eagle-street; we will take him there, and left him in the custody of the watchhouse-keeper. The prisoner asked Johnson for some silver which he said was his own; the watchhouse-keeper was present. Johnson said, he should have none; if the watchhouse-keeper would let him have a little bread and cheese, or beer, he would pay him on the next day for it. We hurried back again to the prosecutor's house, not knowing there was any body in the house to take care of it. We found an old lady in it; shewas up in the garret. We knocked a good many times before we could gain admittance; we acquainted the old woman with what had been done, and waited until the old gentleman came from church, and acquainted him of the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Did the old woman ever go out while you were watching the house - A. No, not at all while I was in the street.</p>
               <p>MRS. SNOWSILL. My husband always trusts me with all his valuables; he never keeps any; he always gives them to me as soon as he gets them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you on the 31st of July, money and bills of exchange in your care - A. Yes. These pocketbooks are not finished, I can swear to all the three pocket-books, and I can swear to the silver-spoon, I broke it myself, I know this half-a-crown to be mine, it was in this bag with the other silver, I made the bag myself; I had six half-guineas, and one seven-shilling piece; they were in a little dirty tin-box; I know the tin box, it is an old acquaintance.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse-keeper of St. Andrew's, Holborn. I was up stairs at the watchhouse when the prisoner was first brought to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Johnson say any thing about any concern in the business - A. When he gave me charge of this business, I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he told me he did. He knew it was going to be done at ten o'clock in the morning; he saw him going into the house, he told me. I asked him how he knew it was going to be done; he told me he was introduced by one of the party, a crack; he saw him go into the house, he was in some time, and came out again; he did not see any thing about him; he went up to him, and said you d - n fool, go in again, do not spoil a good job, there is nobody coming, go in again; he went in again, and came out again, and then he saw he had got something about him; then he secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he had been in once - A. Yes. He went in the first time, he came out again; he had nothing about him; he then told him, you d - n fool, go in again, there is nobody coming, it is all right; he came out the second time, he saw he had something about him; he then secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. So that his going in the second time, was by the advice of this worthy officer here of Justice - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You are the watchhouse-keeper of St. Andrew's, and St. George, the Martyr - A. Yes, I have been in the service of that parish twenty-two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when this conversation was - A. Another officer of justice.</p>
               <p>Q. His name is Bray, is it dot - A. I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>

            Are you upon your oath - A. Certainly. I took it down at the moment; I have some part of it here; I do not know whether you can make it our. (Witness shewing a paper) I wrote it the moment they were gone. I did not like to take the charge until I knew the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of making memorandums when you take a charge - A. I generally do make a memorandum when there is any thing particular; I made it upon a piece of paper. They are all total strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to the magistrate - A. No, I did not; I had no business. They told me there was a ten-pound reward in our parish; I told them there had been, there was not then.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was an extraordinary thing of an officer - A. I did. It is all truth. I have no interest either one way or the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. Johnson, stand up; you have heard this; did you make use of any such expression - A. No. There was not time to mention all that; I was not in the place three minutes. The man is a villain to say what he has; he is a villain for so saying.</p>
               <p>Q. Johnson, I understand you to say, you did not hold that language - A. I did not. There was not time then to say it; I was not there above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there time to say any part of it - A. The only thing I mentioned to the watchhouse-keeper was, when he asked for the money, I said, he should have none; if he wanted a little bread and cheese, or beer, to let him have it, and I would pay for it the next day.</p>
               <p>

            to Bray. Were you present during the whole time Johnson delivered the prisoner to the watch-house-keeper - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell this man, after he saw the prisoner come out once he went up to him, and said, you d - n fool, go in again - A. He never said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Johnson has false sworn himself. Do you remember putting your hand into your waistcoat pocket, and pulling out a handful of bad shillings.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I had but two shillings in my pocket; they were not bad. You passed one of them, or else took another out of your pocket. It is false to say, I took out a handful of bad shillings. I had no other money in my pocket but the two shillings.</p>

This is the tin-box; it belongs to me; I have had it five years. He gave it me before he was taken into custody. A young man that he shewed the notes to, said it was mine. I asked the prisoner if he had any money left; he said, he had three shillings. He told me he picked it up on London-bridge, where I was asleep; he throwed my protection over London-bridge, he kept the notes, and went and bought clothes with it; he told me that before he was taken up.</p>

On the 12th of September, about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and requested to look at some French cambric; I shewed her some. She bought three nails at fourteen shillings a yard; I took two shillings and seven-pence halfpenny of her for it. From her manner, I suspected her; I let her go out of the shop, and then I perceived the parcel of cambric was diminished. I pursued her, took hold of her arm, and told her, I believed she had got something that was not her own, and as I was bringing her back into the shop again, I perceived a piece drop from her clothes. The officer being on the spot, I gave her in charge. He searched her, and found nothing else. About two minutes afterwards, a man came in the shop, and brought two quanties more of French cambric; they appeared to be Mr. Stiles's property. There was no other customer in the shop at the time the prisoner was there.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of September, between eight and nine o'clock, I was coming by Mr. Stiles's shop, I saw the prosecutor have the prisoner in his hand; he said, here Sapwell, take her. I instantly began to search her, and close to her right foot, I saw this piece of cambric muslin; I cannot say I saw her drop it; it is five yards, and these two other pieces, I received of the prosecutor. I produce them.</p>

I put two ten-pound notes, a five-pound note, and a one-pound note, on the table, bank notes; a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140048"/>woman took it off the table, and put it in her pocket.

            . I am an officer. The sailor came to the office, and said he had been robbed by a tall man, in a fustian jacket. I took the prisoner at the Ship public-house. As soon as the sailor saw him, he said, he was the man. The prisoner said, is that what I am taken for; I never saw the man before in my life. The money has never been found. The coachman that brought the sailor up from Woolwich, said he could swear the prisoner is the man that look him away from the coach, but he could not attend here, he must drive the coach. The sailor could not point out the house to me where the prisoner took him in, nor have I been able to find it.</p>

On the 22nd of June, I went out in my yard to draw some water, my back window was up; I saw the prisoner going out of my shop; I went into my shop, and missed five pair of stockings. I pursued the prisoner, and saw her under a gateway, in Commercial-street; I took hold of her, and said you thief, you have taken my stockings. My stocking then were in her apron. These are the stockings; they are mine.</p>

            . I am butler to Mr. Schneider. I saw the billiard room on the night of the 2nd of 
               <persName id="t18140914-79-person785">August. On</persName>
             the morning of the 3rd I saw the billiard-room again; it appeared to have been entered, and the property gone. The prisoner came to me on the 8th of august, he asked if Mr Schnieder was at home. I told him no. He then said, that he wanted to see him, as he had found the chairs that were lost. I asked him where; he said, in the wood. He told me he was going home betwixt nine and ten o'clock on sunday night, that was the 7th, he saw a man before him in the wood, he walked on; something catched his toe, and throwed him down; as he fell, he saw a man in the wood, he fired a pistol at him. The prisoner got up, and said he had two more and he should have the contents of them; he went up a little farther he saw something under a tree, he went to see what it was, he saw, this chair; he took it home he asked me what he had better do; I told him to consult Mr. Walker, his master. The prisoner is Mr. Walker's bailiff, I believe he lived in Mr. Walker's lodge. He went away from me between twelve and one; he brought the chair in a cart; it is a sort of a merlin chair; I did not observe there was any injury done to the chair. I am confident it is the billiard chair, that I had seen in Mr. Schnieder's billiard, room.</p>

            . I lodged with the prisoner, in Mr. Walker's lodge, the lodge is near the road, about three hundred yards from Mr. Schneider's ground. The prisoner was Mr. Walker's bailiff, he had the care of the barn, and the yard. I did not hear of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming home any time of a night - A. on the 7th of august, sunday night, between nine and ten o'clock, he came home with this chair; he said he found the chair in the road, as he came along he saw a man stand on the road, on the left hand side; he went up to the man; the man told him to keep off; he said to the man to fire away, he had got two loaded pistols; he stumbled against the stump of a tree; the contents of the pistol went over his head; he supposed it was providential. he went up the wood, he found the chair, he brought it home on his back.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is nothing to bring it home to the prisoner.</p>

            . Q. How old are you - A. I am nineteen. My father is a hackney coachman; he lives in Nelson's-place, in the City-road.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. Yes; I have known Powell, and Wood, six months, and Hart, about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with the three prisoners on the night this robbery has been said to be committed - A. Yes; I was with them from seven o'clock in the evening until nine; we were at the King of Prussia-row, Hoxton, altogether; Mr. Wood told me I was to get the horse and cart out that night, and to meet them at the Westmoreland Arms, Westmoreland-place, City-road, at ten o'clock at night. I went home to get the horse and cart; I got it I went to the City-road; Wood met me, and took the cart of me at the bottom of Westmoreland-place; Wood was by himself. Then he told me to go home, and to come back to him as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you to go home - A. Because I did not want to let my father know I was going out. I went, and returned to the Westmoreland Arms a little after eleven o'clock; I found Hart there then, nobody else. I expected to find Wood there; I found Hart. I went with Hart to the Blue-coat Boy public-house, at the top of the City-road; when I came to the Blue-coat Boy, Wood and Powell were there. Powell got in the cart, and laid down in the cart; Wood led the mare by her head, and walked on. I and Hart walked on fast, and followed. We turned down a turning to go to Bagnigge Wells; we at last, got to Battle-bridge; Hart and me went down the left hand, towards Bagnigge Wells; Wood and Powell went another way with the cart and horse, towards Maiden-lane way. A little after twelve o'clock, Hart heard the horse and cart coming back to us. Wood said, it was too soon to go. We all got within the cart, and went towards Maiden-lane; it being too soon, we drove up Maiden-lane, to a large brick field; the mare and the cart we put into a barn. Wood directed me to stay with the horse and cart until they came back again; they all went together down Maiden-lane, towards Battle-bridge, all three. I stopped there until a little after two o'clock, then Hart came, and throwed some dirt in the cart, to rouse me. I laid down in the cart, and fell asleep. Hart throwing the dirt in roused me. Hart told me to follow him; I followed him down the road that leads to Bagnigge Wells; I drove the cart; Hart went on foot first. I drove on; when Hart stopped, I stopped; I saw a man coming along the road, that I was informed was Mr. Hutt, the officer, he came from the turnpike out of Spa-fields, towards me, and looked into the cart. Then just as we got to Baggnigge Wells, Hart jumped into the cart; he told me to drive on. I asked him what for; he said, never mind, drive on; he struck the mare with the pin out of the tail-board on the rump. I drove on very fast; I could not hold the mare; then we went down to the turnpike; he kept saying, I hope the turnpike-gate is open; we stopped at the gate, the gate was open; we drove on, and went up a lane by the Workhouse, into the City-road. We put the cart and mare up just about three o'clock, in my father's stable. On the next day, Hart and I went to Bagnigge Wells. Hart said, Wood and Powell were fools for packing up so much, it would have broken the cart down.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what the hampers contained - A. Hart told me red wine; he said, they packed them up; he said also, there was brandy, rum, gin, and peppermint.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him, whether they had packed up all the wine - A. No. Hart told me they had put it in hampers. He said, they had only drank one bottle, and he had spilled some over his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. When Hart jumped into the cart, do you remember his telling you any thing at that time - A. Hart told me the man in the road, was Hutt, the officer, that weighed his bread once at Battle-bridge.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. How old are you - A. I am nineteen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a thief - A. Not long, three or four months. I gave information of this when I was taken up.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went in company with Hutt, and searched the prisoner Hart's house, in Cloth-fair, on Friday, the 19th of August; I found a pair of breeches with the remains of port wine upon them, and I also found a phosphorous-box at Hart's house. Hart told me he had not done any baking for a year and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it contain hampers of wine and gin - A. No; the hampers were in the yard; they were empty. There were wine, gin, anniseed, and noyean, they were all in the cellar, except the anniseed and peppermint, they were in casks, or stone bottles; the port in quart bottles; one cask of wine; there were sherry and lisbon wine also; there were a quarter cask of red port, that was in the cellar; that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140051"/>moved the next morning from where I saw it the over night. At three o'clock, I was alarmed; I went to my cellar; I saw the cellar door had been broken open by an iron crow, which was found in a hamper. Afterwards, I saw the crow fired to the cellar, by Hutt; the crow corresponded with the marks exactly. The cask of port wine was not in the cellar. All the rest were removed completely out of the cellar: the port cask was removed completely out by the door. The port wine and spirits were under my charge.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the wine - A. I do; it is marked with the initials of the person I bought it of. I have no doubt if it being my property, not in the least. I had the charge of it. Stephen Stock Gower is the owner of Bagnigge Wells. It is under my charge.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 26th of July, did you loose a watch - A I believe it was on the 27th in the morning; I saw it about eleven o'clock on the 26th, when I went to bed; I laid it on the table, at the foot of the bed, in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it - A. I gave five guineas for it, three years ago. At two o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by my wife, saying that there was somebody in the room; I got up in the bed, and called soldier; I heard a man run out of the room, when I heard that, I got out of bed, and heard a footstep going up stairs; I followed it; he was going up into the garretu; I went into the room where I heard him go into; there I found two men in bed, one of them was the prisoner. I sent for an officer, and one of my children when she went to an officer, she brought in the watch; it was thrown out into the street, and knocked all to pieces. I said to the two soldiers, one of you have been into my room; the other man laid furthest from the window: he said, have you lost anything; I said, I did not know until I get a light. I got a light and missed my watch off the table. The other man said, if have missed any thing, it is the man that you have just drop into the room has taken it. My child brought the watch in not of the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I awake or a sleep when you came in the room - A. You were asleep, and snoreing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TILLEY. I am a soldier. I was billeted at this house on the 26th of July. The prisoner slept in the same room with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the room that night - A. No. I heard him come in the room, the landlord of the house followed him in about a minute afterwards. When the landlord came in, I told him I was awake; if he had been robbed to go and see what he had lost; if he was robbed, it was the left hand man. He went down stairs, got a light, and said, he was robbed. I was there when the watch was brought in by the child, and the officer was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in your room - 
               <persName id="t18140914-83-person828">A. </persName>
            Yes, another soldier. I am confident it was not the other soldier that came in.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18140914-83-person829">Q. </persName>
            Did you observe the prisoner go near the window - A. The window was close to the side of his bed; it was open. I did not observe him go to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How old was the child that brought in the watch - A. Eleven years; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 26th of July, or on the morning of the 27th, the prosecutor came up into my bed-room, he asked whether any man had been out of bed; he was answered by Tilley, no. I said, my partner had been out of bed, he must know it: he asked him if any thing was stolen; the landlord answered, he did not know. I was asleep at the time. The landlord went down to his room; he said, he missed his watch. I was instantly searched, and nothing found upon me. The watch was picked up by the landlord's daughter in the middle of the turnpike-road. Tilley, the soldier, offered me twelve shillings to acknowledge the thiefs, which I would not do. I have no doubt the said person, is actually the person; he must have throwed the watch out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tilley. Did you offer this man twelve shillings - A. I did, to confess the truth, to let me pass the board, knowing I was at Hammersmith when I should be at Chelsea; seeing the Doctor, I told him, that he was injuring me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come and offer anything at your shop - A. Yes, on the 22nd of July, she offered a gold chain for eight shillings; she did not pawn it. I asked her who sent her; she said, her mother. I asked her whether it was gold; she said, she did not know. I found it was gold, but rather inferior gold. I sent it up stairs to my master, she was told to fetch her mother; she then said, he had no mother; her mistress sent her. She had a mistress in White Lion-street; she said she worked there. She was told to fetch her mistress; she said, she would; she went out, and came back with a person, she called aunt; her aunt then stated, that while she was at Newgate market, she broke open her fathers box and took the chain out, we returned the chain to the aunt. The prisoner's farther came to the shop the same day, and offered a silver watch, and a gold chain to it for four guineas; I examined it; it was the same chain. I bid him 3 l. on it. I stopped the watch and chain, he said, he would jump over the counter, and get it. I told him, he need not be afraid, he should have it when my master came home I stopped the watch and chain untill my master came in. I thought I knew the chain, this is the chain.</p>

I took up the key of the front door into my chamber after I had fastened up the chain. In the morning between six and seven o'clock, I was alarmed; I came down stairs, I found that my house had been robbed, that the thieves had got into the house. I went into the garden; I found that they had cut a pane of glass out of the pantry window; they had then, I imagine, taken out the pin that fastened the two shutters together; it was laying upon the garden ground; when they had opened the shutters the pantry door lock had been forced; by opening the windows, they got access to the pantry; they then forced the pantry door, and got access to the house, tracing their progress; the next door lock was also forced, and then they had access to the whole house.</p>

They had broken open the desks, and scattered the letters and papers about. They had also broken open a side drawer. I found dropping of wax candle in the back parlour, on the desks; they had broken open two desks, and upon the table also there were droppings of wax candle, in my dressing-room.</p>

I said, you have some sharp instruments about you; then he told me he was a carpenter, and they were his tools. I took him to the watch-house, and searched him. I found a dark lanthorn, a center-bit, four pieces of wax candle, a phosphorus-bottle and matches, a skeleton-key, for a front door, two chissels, a screw-driver, a knife with two bladles, a rope-ladder, for the purpose of getting out of a window, and this pistol, loaded with ball; the charge is down here, here are the bullets and powder.

            . I was present when the prisoner gave directions to the last witness of his lodging, and I was present at the searching of his lodging, and when I came back, I asked the prisoner where he got the property I found in his lodgings; he told me he bought it. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at these things, and tell me whether they are yours - A. These boots are mine, although they have been worn by another person since they have been taken; I know them to be my boots; these razors are mine, I should know them among a thousand, there is my own mark on them; the memorandum-book has some of my own memorandums in it now; the razor-strap I cut to make it fit my shaving-box; these little ivory boxes contains dentifice powder one, the other is charcoal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The officer asked me where I lodged, I had no reason not to tell him, had I been conscions of any thing improper, I should not have told him; I had not. I would submit to the law. Ask the officer what was my conduct when the other man ran away.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. to Wainwright. Did the prisoner attempt to get from you - A. As soon as the other man ran away, I told the prisoner I would knock him down if he offered to run away; I saw him attempt to throw something away. I threatened to break his legs if he stirred hand or foot. I had a stick and a cutlass. I saw him put his hand to his coat, that induced me to threaten him. We found this phosphorus bottle and matches in his box at home, besides the one I found on him.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH MARTIN. I am a City constable. On the 25th of July, I was coming up Great Saffron-hill; I met the prisoner coming down Great Saffron-hill; I perceived he had something bulky in a blue apron, which he had before him. When the prisoner had passed me, I observed him turn his head, and look after me. I suspected that he had got something that did not belong to him: I watched him into Bleeding Hart yard. I ran after the prisoner, and collared him with my left hand. and the bundle with my right hand, and asked him what he had got there; he was so agitated, he could not speak; he only cried. I took him to the office; the magistrate not sitting then, I delivered him into the charge of Brown, the officer. I asked the prisoner when he was going with the things; he said, he was going to Mother Dench's; she is a noted receiver, particularly of boys. He said, he had them of a boy in a field, he gave them to him</p>

Ferguson came up stairs, and tried to put the pocket-book into my pocket, it fell down; I picked it up, and found all the notes were gone. Ferguson then took out the key, and said I might go if I pleased. After I picked up the pocket-book; I said to Furguson, you have taken my money away; they told me I was wrong, I said, yes, one of us must be wrong; I shall go and find a constable.

            . My father has eight houses opposite of Mr. Mayor's building. On Saturday, the 27th of August, I saw a man come to the area of one of Mr. Mayor's houses; I saw him draw a fir joist out of the front area; he put it on his shoulder, and carried it away; I followed him into the Edgware-road; he took it into Watts' premises; Watts was on the premises. I heard nothing that passed. Watts sells wood and coals. I gave information at Marlborough-street office. I knew Shackell to be the man that took the fir joist out of the area, and carried it to Mr. Watts' premises.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KRENE. I am a servant to Mr. Markey. I saw Shackell come and take the joist out of Mr. Mayor's front area of one of his houses. I am positive to his person. I saw him draw the joist from the area; he then put it on his shoulder; I followed him; he took it to Watts's yard; Shackell left the joist at Watts's yard.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HORNEY. I am a constable. I apprehended Watts in his own yard; I saw the joist there, there were six joists there I apprehended Watts on this charge. I told him he must go before the magistrate with me; he said, where to; I said, Marlborough-street. He said he would endeavour to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140058"/>find out the person he bought the joists of. I and Watts were going along Oxford-street together, Shackell came up to him; Watts then said, this is the man I bought the joists of. I told Shackell he must go with me; he said, I had no business to take him. I shewed him my staff; he set off running. Mr. Watts then laid hold of him, to prevent him going away; Mr. Watts and I took Shackell to the office. At the office, Watts was bailed, and surrendered here this morning.</p>
               <p>Watts called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I am sure the new hat I saw him put on his head, belonged to the shop; a few minutes before, I had just finished it. I gave the prisoner into the custody of an officer.</p>

In about an hour and a half after, this piece of silk handkerchiefs was brought in by Mr Lee, the constable; that piece of handkerchiefs was placed in the frame of the window; he must have slid back the frame to get at it, while the two other boys were at the counter; he was near enough to open the frame; the frame was not fastened. They said when they went out, they had not money enough to pay for the handkerchief they had fixed on; they would call again. I am quite sure this piece of silk handkerchiefs were in the shop when the three boys came in; I had placed them in the frame some time before; I am quite sure I had not sold them.</p>

            . I am a constable On Monday, the 18th of July, about a quarter after eleven o'clock, I observed the prisoner and two other boys, which I knew to be suspicious characters; the two other lads were older and taller than the prisoner; I knew the three boys were companions. I observed the prisoner had something in the breast of his coat; I followed him; the other two kept behind when I followed him. I caught hold of the prisoner by the collar, I said, what have you got here; he said, a little boy has given them to me. I asked him to tell me who the other two boys were; he would not tell me. I locked him up in the counter. I took from him this piece of handkerchiefs, it was under his coat, at his breast. I took the piece of handkerchiefs to Miss Grant; she claimed them directly. On the next day, as I was taking him to Bow-street office; he said, he found them in a gateway in Fleet-market. This is the piece of handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am sure this piece of handkerchiefs are mine; it is worth fifty shillings.</p>

            Was there light enough to distinguish the colour - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the moon up - A. The moon I believe was near upon rising. I am positive the red jackets were turned up with green. They asked me how far it was to Bedfont; I told them I thought about a mile. They then said one to the other, they would go back from whence they came. I walked on fast: they walked on after me; they met me; I was coming from Bedfont; they came as if from Staines: they turned after me. I thought what they wanted was to rob me; I ran. They ran after me; they ran about an hundred yards before they came to me; I fell: one of them caught me before I got up. They said they wanted my money; the others came up. As soon as I was up, they dragged me through the hedge, out of the turnpike road, across the field, the distance of about forty yards, into a pit; they then demanded my money; I gave it them, and my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you give them - A. A ten-pound country bank note of Ashby's, the Staines Bank, and a silver watch; no other cash.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your silver watch worth - A. Five guineas. They stripped me of all my clothes from my person; they took my coat, waistcoat, breeches, stockings, gaiters, and shoes; they stripped me entirely naked of everything. I then asked them, if they would be so good as to let me have some of their old clothes to put on; I thought I should catch my death of cold. They gave me the prisoner's old trowsers, and a thin waistcoat; in that condition they left me. After they had got my things, they tied my hands together behind me, laid me down in the hedge, and then tied my legs. Two of them left, and told the other to stop until they came back again; near half an hour this man stood centry over me. When they returned, they examined my hands and feet, to see whether my hands and feet were fast, I suppose; they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they use any violence towards you before this - A. No; they never struck me at all. They left me at ten o'clock. I heard a clock strike ten at Stamwell, a church clock, and Sir

               <p>Q. Did you attempt to cry out - A. Yes, I did, at about an hour and a half after they left me. I then endeavoured to make myself heard; I laid still for about an hour and a half, I was afraid of making a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you get any body to come to your assistance until six o'clock - A. No; I was heard by a great many people, but nobody came to my assistance till six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, they were three persons in soldiers clothes, were you able to distinguish the persons of either of them - A. I cannot possibly say; I believe their coats were turned up with green; I will swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to believe you have seen either of these persons since - A. Yes; I believe the prisoner at the bar is one; he was the person that changed clothes with me; I believe he put my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he was left over your person - A. About half an hour; he was not the person that was left centry with me; the prisoner was close to me near half an hour, as near as I can guess. I firmly believe him to be one of the three.</p>

            Have you ever seen your property again - A. Yes; on the Tuesday following; this was on Wednesday, the 7th. On Tuesday following, the 13th, I came to Bow-street, I enquired if they had heard any thing of the man; I saw the prisoner; that Tuesday I went with the officer, he took me with him to the Piazzas, Covent Garden; there I saw a bundle, with my gaiters, shoes, and umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sure the shoes, gaiters, and umbrella, were your property - A. Yes; that were taken from me that night I was robbed; I am positive that they are mine. The officer then said, he thought he was not far off. We went up James-street, and found the prisoner at the Nag's Head, in James-street; the prisoner had a black coat on, a black waistcoat, and light coloured breeches, and other things; I did not notice much. The coat, the waistcoat, and one handkerchief, he had on, was mine; I was quite certain they were my property; the handkerchief round his neck, I am sure was mine. They were the property of which I was stripped of that night. He was then taken to Bow-street by the officer, and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw him, had you any recollection of his person at the time you saw him - A. No; I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What, you can be more certain now, than you were then - A. I believed the prisoner to be the person that took my clothes, and put them on. When I saw him in James-street, I thought him to be one of the persons that robbed me; I cannot speak positively, I believed him to be one of them then. After the officer took the prisoner into the room, he said, he bought the clothes of two soldiers, the morning after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the morning - A. He said the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him what day the robbery was committed - A. Not to him, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Under the Piazzas you found your shoes, gaiters, and umbrella; was the prisoner shewn that bundle - A. Not then, I believe he was not; I do not recollect he was shewed that bundle. I never heard the prisoner claim the shoes and gaiters. My watch has never been found.</p>
               <p>MARY GRIGG. I keep a pastry-cook's shop, under the Paizzas, Covent Garden, and sell breakfasts for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140060"/>the market people. On Tuesday morning, after the robbery, three men come into my shop, between five and six in the morning, they were two soldiers, and the prisoner was dressed in a black coat and waistcoat; they were taken up on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them a bundle with them - A. No; they came into breakfast. The prisoner wanted change of a ten-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you the note - A. No; he only asked if I could give change; I could not give change. He went out, and came in again, and paid for all the three breakfasts. I changed a shilling cash.</p>
               <p>Q. to Longhurst. Do you recollect you were robbed on Wednesday, the 7th of September - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grigg. It was on Thursday, the 8th, that they breakfasted at the Piazzas.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me, it was Tuesday, the next day after the robbery; how came you to say it was the 8th of the month - A. I recollect the 8th, by being market morning, the market mornings are Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18140914-106-person1005">Q. </persName>
            Had you heard that this robbery had been committed at Staines before these person breakfasted with you - A. No. Afterwards I heard of the robbery at Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officer come to you on the same day that these people breakfasted with you - A. No; on the Tuesday after the robbery.</p>
               <p>

            How came you to say the first time, they first came to breakfast with you on a Tuesday - A. I think it was on a Tuesday; I may be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me any reason why you thing it was the 8th - A. I cannot rightly say. On the Tuesday after they had breakfasts, the prisoner came alone, about eight o'clock in the morning as high as I can guess, and after breakfast, he asked me whether I would be so good as to take care of that parcel, he would call again. I took care of the parcel for him. That is the parcel, contained the shoes, gaiters, and umbrella, claimed by Longhurst.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did Longhurst come - A. I think between three and four in the afternoon. The officer and Longhurst took the prisoner together. Nobody was with the prisoner when he left the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, the prisoner breakfasted with two soldiers, what was their uniform - A. A person in the shop said it was red turned up with green. I cannot say any thing.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. The first information I received was from Longhurst, I think on the 8th; I patrol that road. It was in the day time he came to me; he said, he had been robbed the night before. I sent him to the office to give information there; during the time after he was gone, I received another information; in consequence of that, I went to London myself; I was then given to understand, that they had been to Covent Garden, and breakfasted. I went to Mrs. Grigg on the 9th, I examined her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was not the same day that you first received information from Longhurst - A. I am not certain; I think it was the 9th, the day after Longhurst had been with me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Grigg. Do you recollect Bacon coming to your shop about the robbery - A. Yes: I think it was the day after the men breakfasted with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect the soldiers that were with me, having the bundle, and leaving it there the morning they breakfasted with me - A. No, they did not. It was left the second breakfasting time, you breakfasted there by yourself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Bacon. You went to this woman's shop and made enquiry - A. I did. On Tuesday, the 13th, I got another information, I came to London again; when I came to the office, I saw the prosecutor again. I took the prosecutor with myself; I said, come along with me; I took him to Mrs. Grigg's, and shewed him the shoes, gaiters, and umbrella; he said, they were all his property, as soon as he saw them. After that, I said, come along with me, he is not far off; at last, we found him at the Nag's Head; the prosecutor saw the clothes at the Nag's Head, and claimed them. I asked the prisoner how he came by them; he said, he bought them of two soldiers. At that time, the prisoner did not know that we had got the the bundle at Mrs. Grigg's. He said, he had bought them of two soldiers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who the two soldiers were, or where he bought them - A. I asked him if they did not belong to the 45th.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the uniform of the 45th scarlet turned up with green - A. It is. He said, the two soldiers were of the 45th. I said, you are a deserter as well as them; he acknowledged that he was a deserter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from Exeter with two of these men, there was a third man, he was dressed in regimentals, his name was Brown; they said, we had better go on; they walked on before me; about four miles from Salisbury, we went into a public-house; when we went out, I walked on before them. The third man had some coloured clothes, he shewed me a black coat and waistcoat. I have not seen the other man since, until I came into London. I gave the third man, six shillings and an old brown coat for the black coat and waistcoat, that the officer took from me. They told me when I saw them again in London, they wanted me to buy some clothes for one of them; I told them I would do it, but at that time it was too early, there were no shops open. They then said, they would go and have something to drink, and the two soldiers had this bundle with the shoes, gaiters, and the umbrella. We went to a public-house, and asked the landlord for change of the ten-pound note; he could not. They had no money; one of them gave me his watch to get some money until he got change for the ten-pound note; he gave me the watch to get three shillings on it, that they might get something to eat; I went with it. I then asked the landlord where we might get something to eat; the landlord directed me to this house. We breakfasted there; she charged three shillings and sixpence for the three. I went back for sixpence of the man where I had left the watch; I then came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140061"/>back, and paid the sixpence; we all came out together, and one of the men that had the bundle left it there: we all then went to where I had left the watch, from there to the public-house: there I left them, and went and bought clothes for one of the men. I brought the clothes back, and the change of the ten-pound note. I paid for what they had, and three shillings and sixpence for the watch. I then put the clothes on; I took a handkerchief out of the bundle, and put it on my neck; the shoes and gaiters I never wore. I put the coat and waistcoat on; the waistcoat I exchanged for a linen one; the black waistcoat belonging to the black coat being too short for me, I paid two shillings for the linen waistcoat and the black one. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I slept at Mr. Salter's house; Monday was the first day I came into London.</p>

I lost the money between Sunday week and last Sunday night; last Sunday week it was in my box the bank notes, gold, and silver; there were eight one-pound notes, two guineas, two three-shilling pieces, two shillings, and two sixpences, all my property. On Thursday morning I found my box was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this man of taking it - A. On Saturday evening, I had occasion to go to my box for change, and saw all my money was gone. I suspected the prisoner; he lodged in the house, and he slept out of his lodgings. On Sunday morning, I went to the officer, we went in search of the prisoner, and found him in Leg-alley, in a one pair back-room; the officer, and me, went into the room, and saw the prisoner; I told the officer that was the man; as soon as the officer had got hold of him, he pointed to me, and said, that is the man have robbed; he said, spare my life, my mother will make up the money to you again that I have made away with. The officer went to search him; he would not willingly be searched, he was obliged to tie his hands; we found on his person three one-pound notes, one guinea, and five three-shilling peices. That was all that we found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you identify the notes - A. One of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other lodgers in the house - A. Yes; four or five besides the prisoner and me.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HUMPHREYS. I am an officer. On Sunday morning, the prosecutor came to me, and said, he had been robbed; I went to Leg-alley, and there I found the prisoner in a one pair back room, with a bundle in his hand, and a great stick in the other; he was just going away. The prosecutor pointed him out to me. I proceeded to search him he said, that is the man that I have robbed; he hoped the prosecutor would spare his life. He would not be searched; I was obliged to tie his hands; I then searched him, and found three one-pound notes, a guinea, and five three-shilling pieces. He wanted the prosecutor to forgive him; he said, his mother would give him the money again not to appear against him, it was a drunken job; he was very sorry for it. These are the one-pound notes that I found upon him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is one of the notes that I lost; I am sure of it; I marked it upon the corner; I wrote upon it before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out to get a place of work; on my return, I met five of my shipmates; I stopped with them until Saturday. On Thursday they passed the board of Admiralty at Greenwich; on Saturday they made a subscription for me; I got five pounds and some silver.</p>

               <p>MRS. MEDCALF. On the 6th of August, I sent my little girl with the mangling I had mangled; the gentlewoman returned them. I heard the child scream, this is my mothers door; I went out directly; I saw the prisoner running, with the bundle under her arm, and the child running after her. The prisoner dropped the bundle; it was picked up, and given to me, I saw the prisoner with the bundle under her arm. These are the things; they were in my care; I had them to mangle.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . I keep the house No. 12. in Leather-lane About half past three, on the 31st of August, I heard a great noise in my garret; I went into the room; I saw Hookham in the room, he had his right foot on a chair; he got out, and went on to the other house, and when I got out, I saw another person on the roof; I said, what, are there two theives come to rob me; Hookham said, I am come to see if any plumbing business is wanted here. I then saw the prisoner Woolley on the roof of the other house; I did not see any thing in their possession. When I saw them at the house where they were it work at, I said, you are the fellows that got over the roof of the house; Woolley then said, whatever is deficient I will make it good, because he had engaged Hookham to come and work for him that afternoon.</p>
               <p>MR. MOORE. I am the employer of Woolley and his partner; I employed Woolley to paint this empty house, it is mine.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS NORRIS. I heard Mr. Clark's house had been robbed, I went to Mr Moore's empty house to look for the things that were lost from Mr. Clark's house; I found the shirts, stockings, and handkerchief, in the cellar of the empty house. I produce the property.</p>

               <p>JOHN HOLLEY. There was an alarm that Mr. Clark had been robbed; I went to the door of 39, Charles-street; a man attempted to come out, my brother stopped him. I then kept a strong guard, that no man should come out; I went into the first room; I saw Hookham; I asked him where the other man was. I said, you were robbing Clark just now; then I saw Woolley in the back parlour, with the paint-pot in the window; he was attempting to mix paint. He was not there on my entering the house.</p>

He said, I had; I said, I had not. I proceeded on with my work.</p>
               <p>Woolley's Defence. I had this house to paint in Charles-street for Mr. Moore; I employed Hookham to clean the wood work, to get it ready for me to paint; they came into the house, and said, some man had made his escape; after that, they said, they had found two pair of stockings, after the man had escaped.</p>

            . I am a widow woman; I live in Well's-row, Islington. On the 26th of July, I gave the prisoner these things to take to the manglers, about one o'clock in the day; she never returned with them. The prisoner lodged with me two nights.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CAREY. Margeret Ryan brought me these things to mangle, on the 26th of July, in the forenoon; she came for them again, and paid me for the things, and took them away. The things have never been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to look after a place, Mrs. Davis gave me these things to take to the manglers; she told me to fetch them back again; when I came out of the manglers with the things I met a woman, she asked me if I was out of a situation; I said, I was. She told me, she knew a place; she sent me after a place; she held the things until I came out, and when I came out, she was not there.

I lent him some money, and gave him a supper. I left the house in his care, and went out, and when I returned the prisoner was gone; I directly missed my looking-glass, four pictures, and a tablecloth. There was nobody in the house when I went out but the prisoner. I have never seen the articles since. I saw the prisoner the next morning at the Sun public-house in Sun-yard; I took two officers in with me. I was afraid of going in by myself; I charged him with robbing me; he said, me rob you.</p>

               <persName id="t18140914-116-person1076">August. Hooper</persName>
             made no reply. I had a brother officer with me, and Mr. Dill. I repeated the question, and told Hooper that I had a search warrant, that he had better give it up. He told us it was in the drawer; he shewed us the drawer; the drawer was full; he had emptied the flour out of the sack in the drawer; he shewed us the sack, it was on a shelf; I asked him how much he had paid for it; he said, nothing. I told him to empty the flour into the sack, which he did. Mr. Dill said the sack was his; he gave no account how he came to receive it so soon in the morning; Hooper was then taken into custody. I afterwards took Gibbs into custody for stealing the flour. Gibbs denied the charge.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you employed by Lister to take any property of his - A. Yes; on the 27th of July, I had six two-pound bank notes, and instructions of his; this tin box was in my left hand coat pocket; I went to the Angel inn, to go by the coach, about five o'clock in the afternoon. I know the tin box was in my pocket when I was at the Angel inn. I saw the prisoner and another man with him at the Angel inn tap-room. The prisoner was by when Lister handed me the tin box, with the notes, to take care of for him. We wanted to go by the coach; I went out to see for a cheaper coach at the Bull and Mouth.

             remained in the tap-room. The prisoner and his companion left the Angel tap-room when I did. I had come half-way down Angel-street when the prisoner's companion laid hold of my arm, as if to scrape acquaintance with me. The prisoner came behind me, and picked my pocket of the tin box, the six two-pound notes, and the instructions. I felt the prisoner do it; he ran away; his companion ran in the rear; the prisoner before me. I pursued the prisoner, seized him, and took the tin box out of his hand. An officer came up, took the prisoner into custody, and took the tin box from me. It was examined; the six two-pound bank notes were in it.</p>

I lost four one-pound notes on the 20th of July, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I had been at the George in St. Martin's-le-grand, at my benefit club; I went into the public-house about nine o'clock; I staid till ten o'clock.</p>

            How came you to lose your notes - A. I met with this young lady, the prisoner. I spoke to her first; she asked me to go with her; I went with her to Mr. Cohen's house, in New-rents; it is a house for the reception of men and women. I was perfectly sober. At Mr. Cohen's I had a glass of shrub; I had five one-pound notes in my pocket-book. I changed a one-pound note there I staid with the prisoner half an hour there; there was nobody else in my company, only the prisoner and me.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the George at ten o'clock; where had you been - A. I went home, and then a friend and me walked about the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been picking up women together - A. We were looking about us; we were returning home when I met the Molloy, my friend, took a woman with him into the house. I went up stairs with the prisoner. Molloy stopped down stairs, waiting for me. I returned down stairs. She came out of the house before me. I paid the people of the house as I was coming out. I felt for my pocket-book, I found my notes were gone. I did not look at my pocketbook before she left me.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was not gone before that time - A. I looked at my pocket-book when I went into the house; I am sure I had four one-pound notes with me. I looked after she; I could not tell which way she went. This was on Tuesday night. I did not see the prisoner until the next Tuesday, a week after, and then at the watchhouse she said if she had so much money she would return it me. She never admitted that she had taken it.</p>

When he went into Cohen's, I knew he had five pounds, and as Vaughn came down stairs, he said let me see if my money is right. He examined the pocket-book; the notes were gone. This was between the 19th and 20th of July. The prisoner was not taken till a week afterwards; she then said if she had so much money about her she would return it.</p>

             was lost from the waste where it was grazing, about Little Stanmore.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this man of taking the pig - A. I have lost several things out of my garden, and one night in particular I had all my lines cut down. I suspected the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. A patrol.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about this pig - A. I bought this pig to fatten; I never saw it after it went out; I sought after it. On the evening of the 31st of August I was against the prisoners back gate of his garden, the prisoner's wife saw me, she shut the door as soon as she saw me. The next morning the house was shut up. I got a search warrant. We found the pig's entrails under ground in the garden. They were scarcely cold, and the hairs of the pig were in the garden, where they poured the water down when they scalded the pig.</p>
               <p>Q. By hair, you mean the bristles - A. Yes, and underneath the entrails was a calf skin likewise.</p>

            . I am a farmer. I was there after the search was made. I saw the entiails of the pig dug from a wall at the back part of Wright's house. I also saw the hair of the pig that formed the sediment of a pail of water, by which it had been scalded. I also saw part of a calf skin that was dug out near the same hole that the entrails were, in a putrid state, as though it had been buried some time. I saw the head of the pig, together with some of the rest of the carcase after it had been found in a pond in a different place. The pond was about two fields from Wright's house; it is the nearest pond to Wright's house. The pig was cut to pieces in a bad manner, not in a butcher-like manner. From every appearance it had not been stuck; his skull had been dashed in, or beat in, smashed to pieces. There was to two or three guts, parts of the tongue. There was also in the pond the other part of the tongue; it was torn in two; I should not suppose it was cut; it was in a ragged state; the other part of the tongue was to the head that I saw on the 1st of September. The water in the pail had been emptied. It appeared as if done with caution.</p>

We searched all over the house, and found nothing; then William Prentis went into the garden, he saw a piece of ground that had darely been opened; it was out of that hole the pigs onward were picked up. I told Wright he must go with us. I secured him in the cage until the next morning. The next morning I heard he had broken out of the cage. We thought he would go to Bow-street for his money.

I am in the habit of mowing ground, I saw the ground had been fresh mowed. The pales are four feet high. The paling was not broken then. The prisoner broke the paling down about half after two o'clock in the morning, when he took the horse out to come to Bow-street. That was after we had left him in the watchhouse.

I think as many as seven or eight came; it was just after dark; they asked for a halfpenny worth of small beer; the girl drawed it; they drank it; they handed it from one to another. I did not notice the boys going away. I can only identify them from seeing them in the watchhouse; two of the boys are here were in my shop; and Dearns. My wife missed a piece of bacon the next morning, it was laying in the shop under two sugar bags. The next morning Barnley brought the bacon to me.</p>

               <p>Q. For what purpose did you go there - A. To endeavour to take this piece of bacon. When I went into the shop, I asked for a halfpennyworth of small beer; the beer was given us, and while it was handed about, Tucker took this piece of bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take it -

            What became of the bacon - A. We sold it to her; Ward and Tucker took it to her; we waited at a place while they went in; Ward and Tucker went to her shop. When they came out they brought a shilling; we spent the shilling, some bought fruit and others bought bread with it; we divided it; we all had two-pence a piece. About four o'clock the next afternoon, we were all taken up.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARNLEY. I am an officer. On the evening of Friday, the 12th of August, I was in a shop directly opposite Mrs. Broadfield's; I was in Mrs. Cook's shop. While I was there, I observed the boy, Tucker, go in with something under his jacket, and hand it over the counter; I then saw Mrs. Broadfield take it into the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it - A. I could not exactly see what it was then; she took it into the back room; she either put it on a shelf or hung it to the ceiling; she reached up high with it; she then came back into the shop, opened the drawer, took out some money, and gave it to the boy Tucker; Ward was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Ward go in with him - A. I think he did; if he did not, he went to the door with him. I got a search warrant, and searched Mrs. Broadfield's house the next day; I searched that place where I saw her reach her hand up; my brother officer would search the place and found that piece of bacon; it was hung up to the ceiling, just at the place where I had seen her reach her hand up. I had learned of the boys where they had taken it from. I sent for Mr. Griffiths; he claimed it. This is the piece of bacon. Mrs. Broadfield told me if I could get the bill thrown out, she would give me forty pounds; I told her it must go on in its regular course.</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffiths. This is my piece of bacon; I cut it myself. The moment I saw it, I knew it.</p>
               <p>Tucker's Defence. She told me to get more bacon, she would give me more money for it, and Mrs. Broadfield told me to cut gentlemen's seals off, and afterwards Mrs. Gillingham said, not to bring bacon, to bring better things.</p>
               <p>Ward's Defence. She told me not to bring bacon, but to bring better things.</p>
               <p>Broadfield said nothing in her defence.</p>

            No. As I took hold of Catherine Henley, the other ran off as fast as she could. Directly I saw her run, I felt in my pocket, and missed my watch. I charged Henley with having a hand in stealing the watch. I said she knew who the other girl was; she said, no, she had never seen her before that night. I told her if she would tell me where to find Norris, I would let her go; she told me she would not tell, because she did not know. I left her with the watchman, and charged her with stealing my watch. I have seen my watch since.</p>

            . On the 9th of August, I was met by Clark in Smithfield, he said are you going to Arnold's; I said, yes. He said, where have you been all this while, Mr. Russell promised to send me them three hours ago; he said; he was going back to measure the remnants. He asked me if I had brought the buttons; I said, yes. He said, he wanted six yards of the best black cloth, and some galloons; he told me to go back with him to Mr. Russell's; I went back about three or four yards with him; he then said, I need not go all the way to let him have the goods, and I had to run for the French cloth for Mr. Arnold; he took the goods off my shoulder, and took the buttons; I went back, and told Mr. Russell; he said, I had been swindled out of the goods. I am sure Clark is the person that took the goods from me; Piper was behind him; they seemed as if they were companion's together.</p>

            . I keep the George, in Wardour-street, Soho. I saw the prisoners in the public-house on Friday, the 12th of August, about twelve o'clock; they were together. Mr. Foy came in shortly after; I had sent a person for Mr. Foy; I thought there was an improper transaction going forward; they had a jew with them of a suspicious character; they were in the parlour a long while.</p>

The jew came in afterwards; as soon as the jew came in, Clark went out; he returned in five minutes; he brought the cloth wrapped up in green baize; he took them in the tap-room; the parlour door is partly glass; he beckoned the jew, and Piper came with him into the tap, and shortly after Mr. Foy and Bennett came in.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday, the 12th of August, about eleven o'clock in the day, a person came to me from Mrs. Savory, stating that there were some suspicious characters at their house, and bid me go up to look at them in order to prevent their coming there another time. I went into the tap-room; I saw Joseph, the jew, sitting in a box, and the prisoner opposite. Joseph gave evidence here last April. On the left hand side of the jew, were these remnants of cloth, which I now produce. Joseph got up to go; I beckoned him; I immediately went in, and asked who the parcel belonged to; the two prisoners said, it did not belong to them; the other persons that were there, denied all knowledge of the bundle. I asked the prisoners whether they knew Joseph; they said, no, they did not know him at all. I opened the parcel, and found it contained a quantity of cloth. I took the prisoners into custody, and took them to the office. I advertised it; this gentleman came forward and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Savony. Are these the things that were wrapped up in green baize - A. Yes, I had seen the jew repeatedly with the prisoners at my house. I have never seen them since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at these things, and see whether they are your remnants - A. Yes, they are mine; they tally with my stock-book.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH FRANCIS. I keep the Sampson and Lion public-house. On the 20th of last month the prisoner and the prosecutor came into the house with six men in company with him. Mackdonald called for a pint of beer and half a pint of gin; the prisoner called for a pint of beer. The prisoner offered the prosecutor his beer. The prosecutor said, you had better come and sit here. He sat down. The prisoner drank some of his beer; the prosecutor offered him some of his gin. The prosecutor got drowsy; he laid his head upon the table. The prisoner thrust his hand over the table into the prosecutor's pocket, and took the black handkerchief out. I hallooed to him that insisted upon his giving the man his money back; he said he took nothing. I asked him the second time to give him the handkerchief. As soon as he went away I ran after him, and took the handkerchief from him. This is the handkerchief and the money.</p>

I asked him to lock the door, and return the key to me. I waited till he came down stairs. I took the key from him. I went up stairs directly, and missed my sheets and Miles's boots. My husband ran after him. I saw him in St. John's church-yard. I saw him with this small basket with the boots in it. I said, you have got the sheets. He went into the back parlour, and pulled the sheets from under his waistcoat, and the stockings. I saw the handkerchief; I said, you have got Miles's pocket handkerchief.

I saw them about the canal where the naval fight was. I saw them very busy attempting to pick people's pockets about the canal. I had missed them about two hours. They went into the green park at the time the fireworks were going off. I saw them at the same actions there; they were picking pockets in the green park. They were going out; they were met by another: I knew him. I knew the prisoners. I knew the other man they met to be a thief. They were going out then. I followed them until they got to a public-house. I let them go into the public-house. When they were picking pockets it was impossible for me to get hold of them, the crowd was so great.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them under any circumstance that you are quite sure they had actually taken pocket handkerchiefs - A. I was sure they had a number of handkerchiefs about them, and that they had actually effected their purpose. I followed them into a public-house to see what they had about them. I searched them regular. On 
               <persName id="t18140914-137-person1234">Keith</persName>
             I found concealed in his smallclothes and at his back seven handkerchiefs. On Eves I found five in his smallclothes and pockets. I secured them. The handkerchiefs have been all advertised.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of those people whose pockets they were picking - A. I do not. I could not bring them forward.</p>
               <p>Eves Defence. I am quite innocent of the charge in taking anything from any person whatever. I went to Hyde-park at the time of the fair. I fell in company with Keith at six o'clock in the morning. We came out of there, and went into the green park to see the fireworks. This young man kicked his foot against a bundle; he picked it up, and opened it; it contained these handkerchiefs. We went to the public-house, and called for a pot of beer. Johnson came and took us into custody.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. I am a officer. This happened on the 1st of August; after I had taken the other prisoners into custody, I went into <placeName id="t18140914-138-crimeloc771">St. James's Park, close by Spring-gardens</placeName>

I saw the lad turn up a number of women gowns; I saw him take a white handkerchief from a lady's pocket; when he took the lady's handkerchief, he crept in between the people. The mob was so great, I could not see him; the pressure was so great, I could neither lay hold of him, or acquaint the lady. This was the handkerchief; it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night. I have not been able to acquaint the lady of her loss. I saw the prisoner attempt a gentleman pocket. He was in and out of the crowd near an hour, at this work before I could lay hold of him. At last I caught the prisoner in my arms, and brought him out of the crowd. The prisoner pretended to be in liquor, and by his own account he had enough to make him in liquor, by what he said. He was not in liquor. I searched him, and found sixteen handkerchiefs all about his body, from his chest to his knees. There were soldiers breast plates, bells, and toys, in his pockets. One of these white handkerchiefs I saw him take from a lady's pocket. Nobody appeared at the examination except his father. He acknowledged he had taken three handkerchiefs: he said he had only been out a month upon the game.</p>

I had seen it in the morning about ten o'clock. Between two and three o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came into the shop and had a halfpenny worth of beer. I saw the spoon in the shop before she came in; after she was gone I missed it. I went round to the pawnbrokers to see anybody had offered my spoon. I have seen the spoon again (it is broken now) at Mr. Armstrong's. I met with a broken spoon; he was going to buy it for old silver; I thought it was mine. The prisoner was present. As the spoon was broken, I should not like to swear to it.</p>

               <p>JAMES M'DONALD. Q. Perhaps your wife knows more about this than you do - A. No; we were both together. I live in Church-lane, St. George's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose a little boy at any time - A. Yes, about four months old. On the 10th of August I lost him. My wife and I were going to market together. We left our house a little before six in the morning. We took our infant with us; it was a boy; it was dressed. I carried the child. We were going to Billingsgate. I carried the child as far as the Seven Stars. Rosemary-lane. The prisoner stood at the door; she said, it is a fine child, let me kiss it; she took it out of my arms. I never thought of her taking it away. I went to the bar to drink my porter; my wife went with me. The woman staid outside at the door. I left the child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with your wife drinking your porter - A. About ten minutes, leaving my baby in this woman's arms, supposing it would be safe, and on my going to the door, the baby and the woman was gone. The bell of St. George's in the East was just ringing six o'clock. I looked up every place, I could not find the child. I got the bellman to cry the child. I am sure the prisoner is the woman that admired the child, and wanted to kiss it. I went home.

            , the constable, brought the child to the Seven Stars, where it had been taken from. The next morning I saw the prisoner at the watchhouse in Poplar. I knew her. I am sure she is the woman that took my child. My child had no marks of violence on it when I got it again, only stripped of its clothes.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH M'DONALD. Q. Is that the child that was lost - A. It is; it is about five months old now; it is a boy. I and my husband went to market together on the 10th of 
               <persName id="t18140914-145-person1291">August.</persName>
             I left the child in his arms while I went into the Seven Stars to get a pint of beer. I did not see who he permitted to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman when you went into the Seven Stars - A. I just saw the glimpse of the woman; I did not speak to her. My husband can speak to her. I was about ten minutes in the house; when I came out, the child was gone. I had the child cried by the bellman, and the lady of the house writ bills. I saw the child in the evening again. The constable brought it me with no shawl nor petticoat on. It had a shawl and a petticoat on. The shawl cost fourteen shillings; the petticoat was worth a shilling. I saw no violence on the child, only as I heard the prisoner beat it very much, because it would not suck her dry breast.</p>
               <p>JOHN WHEEL. I am a constable of Poplar, Blackwall. I was called into the Green Man, Poplar, saying, there would be a bargain of a child for the parish if I did not look after it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Green Man, Poplar, from the Seven Stars, Rosemary-lane - A. About three miles and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner have any child - A. Yes; she beat it, and used the child most violently. The child appeared as if it was starving almost. It was in a girl of the town's lap when I saw it first.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140074"/>The prisoner was by her. I thought the child looked too decent for the prisoner; the prisoner was very dirty, and the child very clean. I took the child from the girl of the town, and went to the prisoner with it; I said to the prisoner, where did you get this child; she said, it was her dear boy; that she had born a mother's pains for it; nobody had a greater right to it than herself. The child was crying; she beat it; she said, it was a cross young devil. I told her if it was her child, she had taken spirits enough, she might have a glass of water or so. I thought she had taken too much liquor for a woman to take care of a child. I watched her for nearly a mile, until I saw her out of our hamlet. At that time, I had no suspicion it was not her child. At the time I saw the child, it was very thinly clothed; it had neither shawl or petticoat on; only a frock.</p>

            . I am the headborough of Blackwall and Poplar. On the 10th of August, I saw this woman, between four and five o'clock, I was called out of our drinking-house; I am a shipwright. The inhabitans called me out; the child had been cried that was lost. The inhabitants, by the child crying, did not think it her's. I went up to the woman; she was given in my charge by four housekeepers. I asked her if it was her child; she told me she would answer me to-morrow. The child had no shawl on then or under petticoat. I took the prisoner into custody; I suspected she had stolen the child. I found out the parents of the child; I gave the child afterwards to Mr. and Mrs. M'Donald; I kept the child half an hour after Mrs. M'Donald saw it, before she could take she fainted away at seeing the child; the mother has it now.</p>

I asked him what became of them; he first said, the porter at Northumberland's house had his allowance out of it; he afterwards said, he had taken them out of the box and put them in the basket. The candles in the basket were considerably larger than those in the boxes, and there were none in the basket of the size of those in the boxes. I told the house-keeper to keep the candles separately. I corded up the boxes: she put them in a closet, and kept the key. The prisoner then brought home the truck, and when he had delivered the truck in the shop, the officer that I had with me, immediately took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw there was six pounds deficient - A. Yes; the value of them was seven shillings. I weighed the candles myself.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old; I work at a rope-shop, the corner of Drury-lane. On the 26th of August, I saw Stiles take a box of candles off the truck; he put them on his shoulder in St. Martin's-lane; he took them into a court; I saw him take the candles out of the box, a good many; I cannot say the quantity; he put them into Hodder's basket; I followed Hodder to the top of Long Acre, but no further. I saw them again at the magistrates. That is all I know of this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what Stiles did with the box afterwards - A. He put it on the truck again, and went towards Charing Cross.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of August, I was sent for. I saw Stiles coming out of Northumberland house; I followed him to his master's; I then took him in custody; I told him his situation. After some little hesitation, he owned that he took forty-seven or forty-nine candles in number, he was not sure which; that he had given them to Hodder, a shoe-maker, that he worked in a stall at the corner of Stone cutter-passage, Lincoln's-inn-fields, opposite of Whetstone-park. In consequence of this, I went to Hodder, and told him what I had against him; he denied it, and said, he knew nothing about the candles. I found five candles in his stall. I asked him where he got them; he said, he had them two months. They appeared to me to be of the same manufactory. The prisoners were then brought before the magistrate; there Hodder said, these five candles were part of what he had received of Stiles; the rest of them he had sold to a jew, with a bag at his back; he did not know the jew. From information, I went to the house of

               <p>Q. Had you some time ago, some valuable property to dispose off, some precious stones - A. Yes. The prisoner was introduced to me by a man of the name of Harding, as the son of a rich merchant; the prisoner told me himself, he was the son of a rich merchant, residing at Paris; he represented that he was a partner with his father, a rich merchant, in Paris; that he transacted business in London for his father in Paris. This is his card</p>
               <p>"M. W. Leipman, Gun-square." He pretended to me that he was introduced by the Rev. Dr. Erschall, of St. Mary Axe; he came with a reference to the house. He told me he attended the Exchange in the foreign mercantile walk. He obtained of me eight hundred pounds worth of goods. I shewed him a couple of coverlids of my own work; he desired to see them. I only mentioned having them. He said, he wished to make his father a present of them. I have seen him write; I believe this letter is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>"66, Cavendish-square, 31st July, Madam, I am just now in the square, and may-be I can sell your two counterpanes; send them by the bearer, and let me knew the lowest price, and give him something to put them in; he shall bring them back to you by to-morrow, or next day; addressed M. W. LEIPMAN". This is the letter; it was brought by a boy. I gave the boy the counterpanes. I saw the prisoner afterwards in the course of two or three days; I then asked him, why he did not send the counterpanes back; he said, he was afraid to send them back, the Custom House officers might seize them. I told him they were not contraband; the same boy that took them to him, might bring them back to me. He then said, he would send them back immediately. They never did come back. After some time, I found I was taken in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him at No. 7, Gun-square - A. I did not; he was removed from thence. I got no money of him. I put too much confidence in him; I thought he was an honest man. Mr. Harding came with a message from the High Priest; instead of coming as a servant, he came as a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the counterpanes and the tapes, which were illegal goods.</p>
               <p>COURT. If they were illegal or smuggled, that does not alter your offence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent the boy for them with a note; the lady cautioned me that they were illegal. I do not know where the person lives that purchased them. The lady told me not to send them up; she was going in the country; if she wants the money, she may have it. The lady particularly desired me not to send any money in a letter.</p>

Balls Pond brick field is by the side of the road; some evil disposed person knocked the stock off the table; the moulder knocked the two nails out, and got two spikes with two large heads; that made the alteration in the stock; after that, all the bricks had the impression of the heads of the two spike nails; I found ninety-three thousand were missing; these bricks were about two pound a thousand; we had originally about four hundred thousands; we had two hundred thousand made last summer with that mark.</p>

             - A. Yes; I recollect his ploughing the field a week before I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140076"/>dismissed; while he was ploughing there, Elliot came with his horse and cart; he took away five hundred bricks from the kiln; I helped him to load them; he paid me two shillings a hundred,</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any ticket with him - A. No; he must know they were stolen. Master sells them at four shillings a hundred. I was afterwards dismissed. I did not give any information of the robbery untill I was in custody myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have carted bricks from Mr. Scott's fields five or six years. All that Tripp has been saying, is wrong. Shortly before Christmas, I carted three or four thousand bricks from the prosecutor's; I had tickets for them, and then Tripp told me if I wanted any more bricks, to come to the field, he was authorised to sell them. While the road was snowy, I had only a one horse cart; I could not go down the lane; I went afterwards for some bricks, and paid the whole value. I repeatedly asked Tripp for the tickets; if he did not make the return to the master, it was not my wish that he did not. Gentleman, if he is permitted to swear that I had the bricks for less than the value, I trust you will not think that I bought any bricks knowing them to be stolen.</p>

            . I live at Wapping. On Friday, the 9th of September. I observed the prisoner coming out of a warehouse, where Mr. Burgess's porters were landing linseed; I had in the early part of the day seen the same man go across the wharf; shortly after, I saw the prisoner go across the wharf, and by his dirty appearance, I did not think he belonged to Mr. Burgess's porters. I asked the prisoner whether he belonged to the gang of porters; he said, yes. I let him pass, and shortly after, I saw him come from the warehouse; in coming from the warehouse I observed us he passed me, his jacket pockets full; I touched it, it felt soft. I informed Mr. Burgess's foreman; he took his jacket off. This is the jacket; there is a peck of linseed in each pocket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. We had such linseed as that in our warehouse.</p>

I felt an unusual pressure behind me; it induced me to turn round. I saw then the prisoner was behind me with my handkerchief in his hand. I accused him of picking my pocket; he said he had not; he picked it up, and was going to give it me. I told him I was not satisfied. He said he was well known in the neighbourhood; I said, where? he said, the landlord of the Swan Public-house knew him. I went with him; the landlord said he had seen him, he did not know anything about him. I took him before the magistrate. This is my handkerchief that I lost from my pocket; the prisoner gave it me.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM PATRIDGE. I am beadle and night officer of Whitechapel. On Saturday morning, the 13th of August. about four o'clock in the morning, I was coming up Church-lane: I saw two men come along each with a bundle on their back. I followed them, and asked them what they had got; they said they had got some cloths, they were going to work at a slaughter-house. I put my hand on the cloth, and felt a knuckle; it was a knuckle of a leg of of mutton. I opened the cloth; it was a shoulder of mutton on Turvey, and on Watkins a leg of mutton and a piece of beef. The two prisoners told me they worked for Mr. Warmington. I informed Mr. Warmington; he came forward and claimed the meat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The meat was the property of myself and partner.</p>

            . On the 26th of July, I was at work at a cabinet-maker's shop opposite Mrs. Headeach and Gibson's shop; I saw the two prisoners at their shop window. I heard a voice say, Jack. Roberts came to their private door; Thornborough went up to him; I saw them make immediately to the front of the window. I saw Thornborough give Roberts a five-shilling paper of halfpence. Roberts was in the act of concealing them while Thornborough<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140080"/>was leaning over the counter. I ran over the way, and seized Roberts with my right hand, and Thornborough with my left. I then said to young Mr. Headeach, these men are robbing you. I saw him take the halfpence off the counter, and I saw them taken from him.</p>

On Tuesday, the 2nd of August, I went into the Rose public-house, the corner of Wimpole-street and Wigmore-street, to have a glass of porter; which I drank in the parlour. I came out, and left the three halfpence upon the bar door. A person called Mr. Callaghan, how do you do; that was by a man of the name of Allen; Riley gets up, and called me out of the tap-room into the street.</p>
               <p>COURT. This man you charge with a highway robbery, called you out into the street - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. Yes; I dare say I had known him five or six years before. I knew him in place as a gentleman's servant, when I kept a public-house in Grosvenor-street; I had not known him in any other situation than as a gentleman's servant, in and out of place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him as a Custom House officer - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Excise officer - A. No; he was chiefly out of place. He called me out of the house into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the street - A. Yes; we went into the street, and then he laid hold of my bundle; it was then five o'clock, in broad day-light, at the door of the Rose in Wimpole-street, and the corner of Wigmore-street. He said, I have been laying wait for you a great while, now I have got you, I hope I shall make my revenge of you.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in this bundle - 
               <persName id="t18140914-171-person1456">A. </persName>
            Thirty-one piece of British lace, value twenty pounds and upwards; all British lace.</p>
               <p>Q. What revenge did he take - A. He laid hold of my bundle; I laid hold of it also. He took it away, and I took it away again; I had it best part away from him, with that, I laid hold of it again. He said, it is of no use; I am a Custom House officer, and I will show you my commission; I was too agitated to read it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say it was not a commission, can you; was it on parchment - A. I don't think it was; it was paper. I cannot be positive whether it was paper or parchment; I don't think it was parchment; I think it was paper; it was paper.</p>
               <p>Q. It was paper, was it - A. Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the paper that he produced to you, did you satisfy yourself, and read it - A. I did not. I was too much agitated in mind to read it. He wrapped it up in a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you it in your possession - A. I saw nothing more in it than the name of a gentleman in Devonshire-place, and

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it was a commission or a letter - A. It was a letter in my opinion; he did not give it into my hands, he shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you an opportunity of finding out it was a commission - A. He had one part, and I the other; he pulled it away before I had time to read it all over. I thought if he was a Custom House officer, there was no danger of the goods; I thought Mr. Hughes goods would be in no danger, as they were not foreign.</p>
               <p>Q. We know British lace is near the foreign - A. He did not seize as a Custom House officer; I am certain he seized it to keep it. I called out, I was robbed, and called for assistance; I secured him so long, he did not get out of my sight, until he went to the Custom House; he did not go in; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140081"/>believe he knew better. After he had hold of the bundle, I opened it to him; he said, he was not a judge. I said, bring it to any of these people in Holborn, or Oxford-street; I thought he was going into the lace-makers in Oxford-street. I said, why do not you go into here, that is a lace-makers. I told him at the time, all was of no avail. He took it to the Custom House, or at least unto it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this man that committed the highway robbery upon you, takes you through all the streets in the face of the whole world; what became of the bundle - A. He had it on his arm all the time. When we went into Mincing-lane, he said to Allen, take care of this bundle until I come to you. I kept in sight of the bundle, and Riley came in ten or twelve minutes after; he said, he should go before a Peace officer. I took hold of the bundle, and walked after him; he went towards Whitechapel, near Aldgate-pump. I said, Riley, where are you going; what is the reason that you will not go to the Custom House; he said, he must go before a Peace officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your bundle - A. He had hold of it all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. After going up Whitechapel, did he say he would lodge it any where - A. Yes; I brought him to lodge it in the Custom House.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the impudence to go before the Grand Jury, and swear this is a robbery - A. Why, sir, what do you call it.</p>

I went out to make water; the prisoner was then breakfasting with the landlady. As soon as I came in again, I saw the prisoner going out; I then found my money was gone, and when I awoke I found my neck handkerchief had been taken off, and the pad of the handkerchief laid down by me where I was asleep, and my bundle was taken from me; it contained two frocks, and a pair of trowsers; the bundle was tied up in an handkerchief I pulled off the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the bundle before you went out - A. No. A frock and a pair of trowsers were taken out of the bundle; the handkerchief was tied up again. I was leaning on this bundle. He took out of the bundle two frocks, a shirt, and a pair of trowsers; he tied the handkerchief up again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned and found these things taken out of your bundle, did you look for your money - A. Yes; I did not perceive it was taken away untill I went out, and saw him crossing the yard; I then missed a one-pound note and ten shillings from my right hand jacket pocket. When I fell asleep, there was no other person in the taproom but the prisoner. Seeing the prisoner crossing the yard, I asked the landlady where he was gone to; she said, she believed to the privy. I went out of the house, and went down Wych-street; I went to the King of Pruissia in Wych-street; the landlord asked me if I was looking for any body; I told him I was looking for a man that had robbed me; I said he was a tall man with a green coat on; he told me to come with him; I went into the house with the landlord, and I saw the prisoner. The prisoner would not let me see the bundle; he had my handkerchief in his pocket. I was present when part of my property was taken from him; the magistrate ordered it to be given to me. I found my two frocks, a shirt, handkerchief, and a pair of trowsers. These are them, they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had no intention of keeping them; he left them in my care; he followed me to the King of Prussia.</p>

I offered him an eighteen-penny piece to pay for this sixpennyworth of oranges; that was a good one; he said he could not change the eighteenpenny piece; he said if you give me a three-shilling piece I will give you half-a-crown. I gave him a three-shilling piece; he put it into his pocket, and said he could not change it; he said, if you give me an eighteen-penny piece I will give you a shilling. I put the three-shilling piece he gave me into my pocket. I gave him the eighteen-penny piece I first offered him, and he gave me a shilling. I did not take particular notice of it at the time. I put it into my pocket along with the three-shilling piece. I had no other shilling in that pocket, or three-shilling piece. My brother Henry was with me; he bargained with the man; they were both at one time. I then went to an aunt of mine, and after some conversation I examined the money I had received of the prisoner; upon that examination both the shilling and the three-shilling piece turned out to be bad. I marked them. I delivered the shilling that I had received of the prisoner to Draper, the constable. I am sure it is the same shilling I received of the prisoner. In the course of the day, I saw the prisoner again between four and five in the afternoon, in Cornhill. My brother was in company with me, my mother, and my wife. The prisoner saw me, he kept eyeing of me, and was walking away. I pursued him; he ran as soon as he saw I followed him; I overtook him; he had a basket of oranges with him; he throwed them down in the street, as I supposed that he might run quicker. I overtook him in Cornhill, and delivered him to the constable, Draper. I knew the prisoner directly; I have no doubt of his person in the least.</p>

            . I live at Pickstead; I was with my brother on Sunday the 28th of August on London bridge. I observed the prisoner selling oranges there. I agreed to buy sixpennyworth; I was to have four for sixpence. I offered him a sixpence first; he refused it; it was a good sixpence. On his refusing the sixpence, I offered him a dollar; he gave me two shillings and two shillings and sixpence. At St. Mary Axe I shewed them to my aunt, and found they were bad. Afterwards I saw the prisoner at the same time as my brother did; he ran away as soon as he saw me; he flung the oranges away. Draper secured him. I know one of the shillings he gave me; he bit it, and said it was good. The mark is on it now. This is the shilling he bit, and said it was good. I am quite sure of that shilling.</p>

Upon searching him, I found one three-shilling token and twelve shillings, all apparently bad. These are the part I received from Moss, and these are them I found on the prisoner.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Griffen's. On the 31st of August, the lad brought a dollar to me. I went with the lad, and I said to the prisoner, this is a bad dollar, where did you get it? you have before offered the lad a bad three-shilling token, will you let me look at it; he instantly gave it me. I took it in my hand, and said to the prisoner, it will be necessary for me to detain you. These are both bad, the three-shilling piece and the dollar. The prisoner attempted to escape; he got out of the door. I brought him into the shop again, and sent for a constable. I marked the three-shilling piece. That is the three-shilling piece. The constable searched him, and found ten three-shilling pieces on him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARNARD. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner, and found upon him ten three-shilling pieces, all bad. These are them. I marked them. I asked him how he came by them; he said he picked them up near the Mansion house.</p>

            . I am one of the tellers of the Bank. I am perfectly acquainted with the coin issued by the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Look first at the dollar, and tell us whether that is a genuine bank dollar - A. It is a counterfeit; it has the resemblance of a bank dollar. The three-shilling token is a counterfeit, and the ten three-shilling tokens are all counterfeits. They are all of the same manufactory. They are all made from the same die.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the money near the Royal Exchange. I do not know good money from bad; if I had I should not have offered one after the other. I told the same when I was taken as I do now.</p>

            . I have lately come from Ireland. On Wednesday the 17th of August, I was walking down <placeName id="t18140914-176-crimeloc996">Cornhill</placeName>

I asked the prisoner what he would take for a dozen plumbs; he said, nine for sixpence. I looked out sixpennyworth. I drew out a sixpence, a shilling, and a three-shilling token. I had them in my hand open, so that he could see them. I put the plumbs in my pocket, and offered him sixpence: he said the sixpence was bad, give me that three-shilling piece, I will give you two shillings and sixpence. I gave him the three-shilling piece. I had a suspicion of the man, because I knew the sixpence was a good one. He put the three-shilling piece in his right hand breeches pocket; he began to make a bustle with the silver in his pocket; he said, here is your three-shilling piece again; he said, he had no change; he took the three-shilling piece he gave me out of his left hand pocket. I looked at the three-shilling piece; I perceived it to be a bad one. I looked at him, and asked him what his name was, and where he lived; he told me. I sent an old woman for a sheet of paper to take down his name and residence. I said, my lad you want to go to Pat with me now. There was a comrade with him; he said , sir, what are you about, I will give you a three-shilling piece if you do not like that. I said I liked it so well I would keep it and him too. The constable, Brown, was near. I gave the prisoner in the charge of Brown, and I also gave

             I took the prisoner into custody. Mr. Fitzgerald gave me the three-shilling token; I gave it Mr. Westwood before the Lord Mayor. I searched the prisoner; he said he knew nothing about it. In his right hand pocket I found two or three three-shilling pieces, and under the leaves in the corner of the prisoner's basket I found a bad shilling. This is the shilling, and this is the three-shilling token uttered to Mr. Fitzgerald.</p>
