               <p>I am servant to Mr. Newby. I was at my master's house at Islington. On Saturday the 25th of October I went accidentally, between the hours of twelve and one, into a bed-room, and caught the prisoner Storer at the drawers. I asked him what business he had there; he told me two men sent him in at the window; the window looks towards a field. I found a cloth apron, a napkin and a pair of cotton stockings, upon Storer; he had them in his hands; they were taken out of the drawers in the same room. I found the knife-case hid under some rubbish in the field. I did not see the prisoner Blakey near the house.</p>
               <p>Do you know the ages of the prisoners? - I understand Storer is fourteen years old, and Blakey twelve.</p>

I went according to his direction, and found Blakey, and took him into custody. He owned to me that Storer had had this tobacco-box. He took me to some rubbish near Mr. Newby's house, where I found the tobacco-box.</p>

When I came down the next morning at a little before seven, I found the door of the tap-room, which goes into the passage, standing open. I found my bar open, and I saw a pane of glass was broke, so that a hand might have been put through to open the bar. Then I found that the halfpence, which were kept in a basket in the bar, and which I had seen there the preceding day, were gone. I did not know exactly how much there was, but I suppose there might be about forty shillings worth. I had barred and locked both the doors over night; I found them open in the morning when I came down. A person told me, two or three days after, of a boy's having been stopped with some half-pence; that led to a discovery.</p>

I saw that particular half guinea on Wednesday at about nine in the morning; I went then up stairs in order to count my money, and in the chamber there were twenty-four guineas and eight half guineas, this was before the Bank Note was changed; I came home between five and six in the evening, and saw this money at about seven or eight at night.</p>

               <p>Mr. Macdonald, who keeps the Lord Tyrawley's-head, had said, that he suspected the bricklayers to have stole this money; accordingly myself and another went to search Gahagan's room; we found only Gahagan and his wife; when I was about to search t he cupboard, I saw a tin box in Mrs. Gahagan's hand, which she put between her legs; I took the box from her, and it contained four half guineas and four guineas; and we found a guinea and four half guineas sewed up in her petticoats, which together made nine guineas. Mr. Macdonald told me, before I shewed it him, that one of the half guineas was very remarkable. I found a key in Gahagan's passage, which upon trial opened the door of the prosecutor's room; I tried it; I asked Mrs. Gahagan how she came by this money.</p>

I asked him what he wanted: he said he had jumped in to get his hat out. He tried to go away. I took hold of him by the shoulder, and said he should not go till I was a little better satisfied. I called out to Mr. Sexton, who was coming by, and Mr. Murrell the constable was also coming by at the time the boy was endeavouring to get out at the window. Mr. Sexton seized and secured him. I saw him searched in my back parlour, and in his waistcoat pocket was found the box, containing the stones and paste.</p>

Mr. Clements said, North had gone away that morning, and he supposed he had taken the horse; Furning and I enquired at several turnpikes; we got intelligence that he had been seen with the horse, we then went down to Marlborough, and found him at the house of his mother-in-law; at first when we enquired for him, she suspected us and hesitated a little, she called him down stairs; he asked who wanted him; as soon as he came near enough I laid hold of him, and said, I wanted him, and bid Furning take charge of him; he asked for what; I said for stealing his master's horse.</p>

I told them I was very busy, and could not shew them any. Upon that the tallest (Ware) advanced further into the shop where there lay a parcel of silver buttons, and clapped her hand upon them. There was no one in the shop but myself. I said, are you going to rob the shop? She said, no; she only wanted to see what it was. The next day, while I was at dinner in my back parlour, I sat so that I could see all over the shop, and into the street. I saw them in an instant all three in the shop. The little one (Harriett Davis) catched up the plate, and ran out of the shop immediately. She took this silver cup and broken lamp (producing it): it was standing just as it is. I cried out the shop is robbed, and ran after her, and cried stop thief. A carter and I followed her, and took her in a stable yard in York-street, and we found the plate upon her. We brought her back to the shop: when we came back, the boy and the other girl were secured. I sent for a constable: he got a search warrant and searched their lodgings, but there was not any thing of mine found.</p>

I had not shut it ten minutes before that, and I found the prisoner in the room making off with the things upon her. I secured her. I latched the door before I went out.</p>

In the morning, about seven o'clock, my shopwoman came down to open the door; she returned instantly, and told me that the shop was broke open. I came down in five minutes. There were a great many marks of dirty feet in the shop; the window in the door had been broke open, I believe with a crow; a pane of glass was broke and taken out, by which they could get in to open the shop door. I missed more goods than I have put into the indictment. The counter was broke open where the valuable things were kept, and there was stolen from thence and the glass case all the goods mentioned in the indictment (reading a list of them). I saw some of these things on the Sunday night when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030011"/> came down; all my goods were then in the shop, and I saw that the padlock was on the chest. Miss Jennings, who had likewise been robbed, informed me that she had seen some goods in Holland's house which she thought were mine. After that I went with Miss Jennings to Justice Sherwood's; there I saw three or four bundles containing some goods of mine intermixed with some of Miss Jennings's.</p>

We went to his lodgings at Cow-Cross. I found in one corner of the room a great quantity of goods hid under some cloaths and some baskets. His wife said that her husband gave forty guineas for them to one Harris.</p>

               <p>Did you buy any goods of him at any other time but that last day of October? - No: I bought these at twice; I had half at one time and half the other.</p>
               <p>What distance of time was there between the two days? - Three days.</p>
               <p>What was Harris? - A house-keeper: I never bought any thing of him in my life before, he was recommended to me to sell me a parrot; I took it of him for a debt. He told me he had been a shop-keeper, and had some goods on his hand which had lain by him a long while. and he should be glad to dispose of them because he wanted money. I bought some of the things that are here of Mr. Tillings a shopkeeper in Cloth Fair.</p>
               <p>Do you live with the prisoner? - I have lived with him.</p>
               <p>Do you know where Harris is now? - I believe he has made his escape since. Harris said before the justice that he had never seen us before.</p>

On the morning of the 23d of October, when I came from Pockham, I was informed by some of my men, that they suspected that the prisoner, who worked for me, had stole something. I saw the prisoner cross the way; I pursued him, and seized him by the collar, and brought him into my shop, where one of my men, in my presence, took these screws out of his pocket. The prisoner begged for mercy.</p>

She immediately cried out for assistance, upon which two other women came up, and she gave something to them. I suppose my money. As she took her hand out of my pocket, she drew my pocket almost out, I am sure it was the prisoner's hand that was in my pocket. My money was lose in my pocket. I could not see what it was she gave to the other women. She shoved her hand in their face. I took her to the watch-house, where she was searched, but nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Was any one else near when her hand came out of your pocket? - Nobody so near as she was. She called out to the others; they come up and blasted her, and bid her give it to them.</p>

               <p>I had been at a christening, and had drank rather more than did me good. As I was coming down Ludgate-Hill I was sick. I turned up a court; two women were coming out of the court, the gentleman laid hold of me, and said he believed I was one of the women he was with. He laid hold of both my hands, and led me to the watch-house. I was searched immediately, and nothing found upon me but a shilling and a thimble. He never loosed my hands till he brought me to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Messrs. Streeton and Company. I had the charge of some silk to carry to the Swan on Holborn-Bridge. I took it in a coach. It was in an hamper and a truss. While I went with the coachman to carry the hamper down to the warehouse, the truss was taken out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Do you know who took it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you find it on any person? - No, we immediately advertised it.</p>

               <p>I attend the rotation-office in White-Chapel. On Sunday the 23d of November, I was informed by a man that three suspicious persons were gone into the Bull with three bundles. I looked through the window, and saw Cloak and Hawes in the room. I went in and asked where the 3 d man was, they said he was gone up stairs. I desired them not to let any one out. I went up stairs, and saw Minsher in the chamber with three bundles. I told him he was my prisoner. I secured them. Hawes asked to be admitted an evidence. He took me to No. 10, in New-Court, Fleet-Market, where we found the rest of the silk. I locked up the prisoners, and the next morning I saw the silk advertised.</p>

               <p>Cloak, and Minsher, and I were at the sign of the Butcher's Arms in Chick-Lane; we agreed to go out together. We saw a coachman take a hamper down the inn-yard. When the coachman and the man went down the yard, Minsher opened the other door of the coach and took the truss out. We went to No. 10, in New-Court, Fleet-Market, with it. We afterwards took it to the Bull in Petticoat-Lane to dispose of, and there we were secured.</p>

               <p>While I was sitting in a public house Hawes came up to m e. He asked me to take a walk with him. I went with him to No. 10, New-Court, Fleet-Market. He tied some silk up in a handerchief of Cloak's. He told me he got the silk from on board a ship. I went with him to the Bull in Petticoat-Lane.</p>

               <p>I met Hawes. He asked me to have part of a pot of beer with him. I went with him to the Bull's-Head. I never saw him before.</p>

I stop'd at a shop and asked what they would take for a seal that I saw in the window, they asked me one shilling and sixpence; I said I would give a shilling for it if they would give change, they agreed to that. I took a little box out of my pocket, in which I kept my money, to pay for it; the earrings and ring happened to be in that box. The prisoner stood by me; when she saw them, she said, let me see what you have got there; I held them at a distance, and said, why you can see them here; upon which she snatched the box and the rings out of my hand and ran away with them.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with her? - No, but I know her by sight.</p>

On the twenty-first of October, as I was very busy in the shop waiting on two ladies, there was a cry of stop thief, my young woman ran out to see what was the matter, I thought some of the neighbours had been robbed; she told me a piece of cloth had been taken from our window. The prisoner never was in the shop; the windows are open, there were twenty-two piles of cloths lay in the window; it was about nine o'clock at night. The cloth was brought to the shop afterwards.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner take the cloth out of Mr. Macdonald's window; I am sure he is the man; I pursued him; he was taken in a few, minutes in White Hart-yard; the linen fell from him as I was running after him, it fell on the groud in Russel-court; I was so near him that I did not see it fall, but I had like to have stumbled over it.</p>
               <p>Was it wrapped up when he took it? - Yes; there were eighteen or twenty pieces in the window. I believe, I did not stop to take the cloth up, but pursued the prisoner. I saw the cloth in motion on the ground.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. It is a good way from Russel Court to White Hart Yard, where you took the man? - Yes; a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of him in the pursuit? - He might be out of sight, but I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Macdonald. On the twenty-first of October in the morning, I laid twenty-two pieces of cloth in the window; at night there was one missing, I saw it dropp'd in the court by a person in green cloaths; the prisoner had green cloaths on; I only saw the back of him after the cry of stop thief. I did not know it was taken away till I heard. I am sure it is my mistres's cloth by the mark on it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence denied the charge, and called several witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

I am sure he made all the discovery he could. I went after the persons, and found every information he gave me true, though I was not successful enough to take the persons. Anderson seemed very affected and sensible of his faults. The justice promised him mercy if he would do all he could to bring his accomplices to justice.</p>

               <p>I live in New-James-Street. I have a country-house near the country-house of Mr. Adams. On the 18th of last month a neighbour informed me that my house was broke open. I had been there on the Sunday before. I left the house fast, and the things mentioned in the indictment were in the house. I went down and found the door and windows broke open. It is all on one floor. All the bottom parts were broke. I lost two mattrasses, two window curtains, two pillows, a cloth waistcoat, and a bag. The waistcoat I used to work in. They were found in the custody of the watch. I went before the justice who ordered me to have my things, and said I need only produce the waistcoat here.</p>
               <p>[The waistcoat was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

Just after, a gentleman came and said he had lost a trunk; I told him a man had, gone by with a trunk; we pursued him and brought him back in about ten minutes. I ran along White Chapel, thinking I had missed the way the man took, I turned back, and a man asked me if I was running after a man with a trunk, I told him I was; he said he saw a man running with one, and directed me up Jewry-lane, and there I took the prisoner with the trunk. I am sure the prisoner is the man that ran past me.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of October, twenty minutes before nine, as another young man and I were standing at the corner of Jewry-street, we saw the prisoner run by with a trunk upon his back, he ran against the young man, and pushed against me; I suspected he had stole it; then I saw the last witness run past me towards White Chapel; I said, I believed they were in pursuit of the man with the trunk. I stood at the end of the Minories; the last witness turned back, I stopp'd him, and asked him if he was pursuing any body; he said, yes, a man with a trunk. I went with him to George-street, in the Minories, there we asked a woman if she had seen a man with a trunk, she said no; I then heard somebody say, oh! upon which, I turned, and saw the prisoner with the trunk; another young man immediately laid hold of him, and Acorn came up.</p>

               <p>You lost sight of the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you never saw him before? - No. He had on a pair of boots, and a sort of a blue frock; he seemed to be in a great hurry, which gave me a suspicion he had stole it; I took it on his back.</p>

               <p>The prosecutrix informed me she had lost some linen, and suspected the prisoner; who lived in Shakespear's Walk, and we went and took him. The prosecutrix charged him with it. At first he denied it. He afterwards said if she would not hurt him he would tell where the property was. She said she would not if she got her goods again. He then said he had pawned some of the things.</p>

               <p>I am the father of the child that was killed: it was eleven months old: it died the 20th of November. I was present three minutes after this wound was received, which was about nine o'clock at night of the 5th of November: the child was all of a gore of blood: the wound was on the right side of the back bone, and was about the size of half a crown: I fetched Mr. Ogle a surgeon to it: I took up these two lads (the prisoners). First I took up Foot; he said he had no concern at all in the matter; that Adams was the person. I then took up Adams, and he owned that he fired the pistol. There was no quarrel subsisting between me or my family and Adams or Foot, or any thing of that sort: said Foot he loaded the pistol, and Adams said he directed him where to fire it: Adams said he saw a woman but did not see a child at who saw the prisoner go by and heard Foot the door: a woman was at the next door say to Adams, not that door - that door.</p>

I believe the wound to be the occasion of its death, for the said child was very hearty before. There were two of them together when the pistol was fired off, but I cannot tell who they were, and they went away directly. I think they could not but see me, because there was a great bonfire opposite my door, and there were I suppose, a dozen little children of about twelve years of age that were round this bonfire.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon; I came in to see the child at about ten o'clock, there was a large contused<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030026"/> wound above the hip, from the right side of the back bone; I examined it particularly, I found every thing so exceedingly tight, that I thought it would be extremely dangerous to attempt an extraction of any thing; I probed it, it was about two inches deep, and ran obliquely upwards towards the back. On the tenth, which was five days from the accident; I took out part of the wadding, which came away very easy.</p>
               <p>What was the wadding? - Paper. And on the thirteenth, Mr. Morris, my assistant, in the evening when he dressed it found some more wadding in the wound and took it out; there were three pieces; I examined the wadding very particularly, I found it to consist of nothing but paper, the discharge was exceeding large; the child sunk every day, and on the twentieth died.</p>
               <p>What do you think was the occasion of its death? - I apprehend, the consequences of the wound; there was not strength of constitution sufficient to counteract the discharge.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt about this wound being the occasion of the child's death? - I have no doubt about the consequence of the wound being his death; there was a very great discharge; the tender age of the infant was insufficient to counteract the consequence of the discharge.</p>

               <p>From what was extracted, was it a larger quantity of paper than is usual? - I cannot particularly say that: the paper is in court.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you look upon the wound to be a mortal wound of itself? - It is not what we term a mortal wound, it was a wound of the muscular flesh.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the wound penetrate through the child's cloaths, or was the body naked? - It had on a blanket and a little light bed gown; the threads of the cloaths were taken out at times, it did not come out in pieces, but the threads of it; it was torn all to pieces.</p>

               <p>Rice lodged with me; I live in Peter-street: I let the first floor of my house to Rice and his wife. On Wednesday morning between seven and eight o'clock, she came crying to my door, and said, her husband had been out all night with Johnson, he came in just after and asked me to drink<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030028"/> part of some purl, I drank part of two pots of purl; he said he was exceeding cold, having been out all night; he then called me into his room and shewed me the bridles and saddles, which are now produced; he told me that he had sold one of them, a new one, for a guinea and an half; I always thought that Rice was an ostler; I suspected immediately that he could not come honestly by such a quantity of saddles and bridles, therefore I asked him how he came by them, he certainly must have stole them; he equivocated, at first he denied it, at last he said he did.</p>
               <p>How came he to shew you these things to produce such evidence against himself? - He might be a little in liquor at the time. I directed the officers to Johnson's house in consequence of what Rice's wife had told me that he had been out over night with Johnson.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Quince, by order of Mr. Quince I went to Johnson's up two pair of stairs, I found him in bed at Saffron-hill. Redgrave took two bridles out of a closet in that room, a white one and a black one; I cannot positively swear to them, but I do believe these to be the bridles that are produced, and which Redgrave took out of the closet; when we asked for Johnson, a woman locked the door and put the key in her pocket, which made me suspect he was there, and accordingly the door was forced open.</p>

               <p>Did you sit up or go to bed? - We did not go to bed. At the corner of Kingsgate-street, while she and I were talking, the patrole was coming by; he came up, and said, Before you part with this woman, I beg you will see that every thing is right. I put my hand down, and missed my watch. I said, She has robbed me of my watch, I desire you to secure her directly; upon that he laid hold of her. She cried, and said that she would have an action for scandal, for taking her up upon such an affair. Another man was going past;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030029"/> he took hold of her other arm, and they led her along the street to St. Giles's watch-house. There she was searched, and I saw the watch found in her right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Was you at this time drunk or sober? - I was in liquor a good deal.</p>
               <p>Was you so sober as to be able to say, upon your oath, whether you might not have given her this watch? - I am pretty positive that I had not given her the watch.</p>
               <p>But you must be very positive; what money had you about you? - A guinea and a half, and some silver; I gave her, I fancy, between four and five shillings, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You did not lose any money? - No, only the watch. I am very certain I did not give it to her.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor asked me where I was going? I said, Home, into King-street, Bloomsbury. He asked me to drink a glass of wine with him, for it was a cold night. We went in and had two pints of wine. He was very much in liquor. He was so much in liquor, that he let his money fall about the room, and the people of the house picked it up. He said he was afraid he should be too late to get in at home, and should like to leave his watch. I said he might leave it in the house, and have a bed there. He said he did not know these people, he would give it me, and come and dine with me next day. We were both in liquor. They asked me if I had the watch. They laid hold of me in a rude manner, and dragged me to the round-house. He was so much in liquor, that he did not recollect that he had given me this watch.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I was clerk to a gentleman in St. Martin's Lane a month or two ago; I am out of employment at present: I know the prisoner. On Saturday the 18th of October, about eight or nine in the morning, I was at a stable in Green-street, Grosvenor-Square, near where the prisoner lived, and where he puts up his horse at bringing home the mail. The hostler told me that the prisoner's wife wanted to speak to me. I saw her about twelve that day; she said she wanted to speak with me; I went home with her. The prisoner came in in a minute or two; he lived at the back of the Three Compasses in Green-street, in a little alley. There were ten notes shewed me before he came in. When he came in, he said he found them. I asked him where he found them; he said, in the necessary at the Post-Office, and that he did not know what they were; he wanted me to tell him what they were, and he asked me to advise him what was best to do with them, for that his wife told him they were lottery tickets. I saw them, and explained to him what they were. He said he found them rolled up like waste paper. He said there was a letter and seal to it, but that the seal was broke, and the bill rolled up in the letter. I asked him what became of the letter; he said he had used part of it at the necessary in the Post-Office; that he went out with his mail; and the next morning, when he returned to the stable, he made use of the other part in the stable. I asked him how long he had had them; he said, on the Tuesday or Wednesday se'nnight before that: this was on Saturday the 18th. He asked me what I could direct him to do with them; I told him he should have carried them to the office: He said he could not do that, for he knew they were so strict and severe at the Office, that they would imagine that he had taken the latter himself, and would not believe that he found it. I said, as he had kept it so long, they certainly would now, and I did not know how to advise him in it. I asked him if I should take them myself for him; he objected to that, because he had had them so long by him, and said, he wished it had happened at first. He said he could neither write nor read, and begged I would look in the Papers, and see if they had been advertised during the time he had had them. I searched the Papers, but found nothing advertised concerning the notes. I returned, and told him they had not been advertised. I asked him if he had constantly attended his duty; he said, Yes, and drove the mail every night, and had paid great attention to see if there was any enquiry concerning such notes at the Post-Office, but had heard of none there. That was the whole of the conversation at that time. This was on the 18th.</p>
               <p>COUNSEL. How came he, if he thought they were lottery tickets, to say he paid great attention to touching these notes; it seems as if he knew as well as you that they were notes? - That I cannot tell; that was what he said, if there was any enquiry touching the letter or the things he had. On the Wednesday or Thursday he came down to me a mile out of town, and said he was very uneasy concerning the notes, and desired to consult with me what was best to be done.</p>

               <p>Where did he come to you? - To Westmore-Green, just beyond Paddington; he said, he was very uneasy while they were in his possession. I told him I would do the best for him when I was at leisure, for I was very busy then, but the day following I told him I would call upon him in a day or two. I saw him again on the Monday; he wanted to have something done with these notes; he said he was uneasy while they were in his possession; and he said, if they did him no good they should do him no hurt, and talked of making away with them. I proposed finding out the parties to whom they belonged, as I thought it not so proper to go then to the office. I thought him a very honest man; I could think of no way of finding out the parties but by advertising them, for which purpose I had drawn out an advertisement; this was Monday the 27th of October. I had drawn it up some days<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030031"/> before; I read it to him, he approved of it, but was not willing to deliver the notes to me on those conditions, without I would take it upon myself.</p>
               <p>Take what upon yourself? - Take the charge upon myself, and say I found them; I said I would immediately go and advertise them, and find out the parties to whom they belonged if I could; he would not agree to that, unless I would say that I found them myself. He said, Could I, if put upon my oath, swear I found them? I said I did not suppose I should be put upon my oath; he then took them from me, and proposed dropping them for me to find them; then he proposed burning them rather than he should receive any hurt; he took them, and went into Hyde-Park, and I followed him, and he dropped them, and I picked them up and went immediately to Portland-Street, and told

I put them into Davis's hand, and desired him not to deliver them to any body unless I was present, and then I went to advertise them in the Daily Advertiser; the advertisement came out on Wednesday the 29th of October; I attended Davis on the 29th, but nobody came to enquire about them; as they were not enquired after I thought it would be proper to apply to the parties named in the bodies of the notes; I had heard of Admiral

On the Wednesday they were advertised, and nobody came after them. On the Wednesday afternoon he called, and said, I find nobody has been after the notes; I told him nobody: he said it was to be inserted again on Friday. On Thursday he told me he had been to Mr. Lamb's, and on Thursday afternoon Mr. Lamb's clerk and he came together, and I delivered to him nine of the notes; a friend of Mr. Nocke's, one Mr. Richardson, had been there and taken one away; I told him I would be answerable for it; I delivered it to him on the next day, and he gave it to Mr. Lamb's clerk.</p>

As I was moving, the prisoner was put there to lot the goods. My wife, in moving, left a box in a closet. I went back, and taxed the prisoner with knowing something of the box; he denied it. I advertised these things; and on the 18th of last month I went to a sale, there I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030039"/> prisoner with one of these pair of stockings upon him; I immediately apprehended him; I searched his lodgings, and found six pair more; the marks were all cut out of these stockings; I believe they are mine, but I swear particularly to one pair of them. I also found a pair of shoes at his lodgings. (They were produced in Court.)</p>

On Saturday morning, about nine o'clock, he told me to get ready, for he should have two puncheons of rum for me soon; at about eleven I loaded the two puncheons; he told me to go up Mark-lane and along Fenchurch-street; and if any body asked me where I was going, to tell them I was ordered into the Borough with them; by him I drove them from there to Mr. Smith's house, in the Borough, by his direction.</p>
               <p>Going up Mark-lane and down Fenchurch-street was very much out of the way? - Yes, but he said, I must go that way, because some of the masters would see them if I went along Thames-street; I went to Mr. Smith's-house, and unloaded one at Blue-maid-court, and the other in New-alley, in Mr. Smith's cellars; after putting them down, I went to Mr. Smith, and he gave me three guineas for Scoles, in part of payment; I gave Scoles a guinea out of the three, and kept two; Leggett was to have one, who was not there, and I the other.</p>
               <p>Did you see Scoles in the evening? - Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030042"/> he met me coming over London-bridge with my cart; he said the two puncheons were missed; so we must go and have them back; he and I went together to Mr. Smith's; Mr. Smith's man said, we could not have them back, for that the puncheon's were emptied, and the casks knocked to pieces; Scoles said; he did not know what to do, the officer was waiting to take them in, and said, he must go directly back to the officer and say, he could not find them; I sent the cart home by a boy; I was so frightened I did not know what to do.</p>
