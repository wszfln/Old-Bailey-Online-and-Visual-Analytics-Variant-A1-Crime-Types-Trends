I am the wife of Charles Sterry—the prisoner was in our service—he left on 2nd January—I missed a key from my davenport on 23rd January—this is the key—I can't tell when I last saw it safe, I have so many keys—I don't know how it went away—I examined my davenport on 30th September last, and suspected that somebody had been at it.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 7th of February, about twenty minutes to one, I was on duty in Queen Street, Seven Dials, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners there with several others standing on the kerb on the left-hand side of the street—I saw Davis walking down the middle of the street—Hunt left the pavement, walked into the middle of the street, and took a deliberate aim at him and struck him a violent blow on the nose—he staggered some six or seven yards back, then he over-recovered himself and fell on to his hands—Hunt walked back on to the pavement—while he was on the ground, Whelan walked off the pavement, took hold of his left arm, and said, "What a d—shame to use an old man like that"—as there was a large mob of thieves there I did not interfere, but I watched them—they took him in the direction of King Street, Long Acre—I crossed and got in front of them—at that moment Hunt came up and took hold of the prosecutor's right arm—Whelan was leading him along—they commenced shouting "Police" then—as they were leading him along, I saw Whelan's hand in the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket—some woman called out, "<hi rend="italic">Mark the copper</hi>," which means that a policeman is coming—Whelan then ran away—I was about to pursue him, and a woman ran right in front of me and prevented me—seeing that he could run too fast, I stopped—a mob immediately gathered round, and Hunt was about shifting out of the crowd when 171 F came up and took him into custody—I afterwards went to the station and found Whelan in custody, and they were both charged—Davis had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—he was sensible—I know the prisoners, and know them to be companions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On the night in question a man named Samson, who the officer knows, asked me if I would go and carry some things for him—he left me at the corner of Johnson's Court—he went up the Court and came back about one o'clock with a coat—he said "Put this on, it will keep you dry;" it was raining at the time—it felt heavy, as there were things in the pocket—I did not touch them—he gave me the aprons—he left me in Holborn, and the constable stopped me—I did not know they were stolen.</p>

I took them in the van to Mint Street Station, and forwarded them to Hitchin—I left all the cheeses there—they were all safe, as far as I know—I did not examine them particularly—I passed down St. Mary-at-Hill on my way to the station, and stopped somewhere about Cross Lane—that was about six o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi> 5). On Saturday, 18th January, I went with a brother constable, named Chamberlain, to 26, Sidmouth Street, Gray's Inn Road—I had received information from my superintendent to apprehend Clancy as a deserter, but not to be charged until further directions—I watched outside 26, Sidmouth Street—about five minutes past seven in the evening, the prisoner came out of the house, and we followed him to Tottenham Court Road, then to the corner of Bedford Street, where he crossed the road and went and looked in a brush shop immediately opposite Bedford Street—I was on his left side, and Chamberlain on his right—I asked him if his name was Clancy—he said, "I don't know you"—I then asked him again if his name was Clancy—he said, "No, my name is Reed"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "In Great College Street, Camden Town"—I asked him if he had just left there—he said, "Yes, and I have come by the way of the Gray's Inn Road"—I said, "I shall take you into custody for being a deserter from the Royal Engineers"—we were both in plain clothes—he immediately tripped up my heels with a stick or umbrella between my legs, and threw me down on the kerb—when I got up, I saw him running along Bedford Street as fast as he could, and Chamberlain following him towards Bedford Square—I cried, "Stop thief," and at the end of Bedford Street, turning round the south side of the square, I cried "Stop thief"—he deliberately turned round; I saw his face plainly, and I heard something whizz by like a bullet close by my hair—I then saw a flash and heard a loud report—I was about fifteen or twenty yards from him—Chamberlain was nearer to the prisoner than me, but more to the left, running across—the prisoner turned to the right, and ran round the railings of the square towards the left—after running a short distance further, he turned to the left—I had gained ground on him by that time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240025"/>
               <p>when he discharged another barrel at Chamberlain—at that time Cham<lb/>berlain fell; he was about twelve yards from him when he fired the shot—when he fired the second shot I saw something shining in his hand like a revolver—I saw his face blaze from the flash of the revolver at that time—I still ran after the prisoner, crying, "Stop thief"—Chamberlain got up again and also ran after him—we pursued him some distance further, and Cham<lb/>berlain got within five or six yards of him—he was stopped by a coachman, named John Hurst—just at that time Chamberlain caught him up, and while doing so, I heard another report of the revolver and saw a flash—when I got up, the prisoner was on the ground—I saw Chamberlain strike him on the head with the butt end of the revolver—Chamberlain's face was blackened from the powder; his whiskers and hair were singed from the flash of the powder—one of the bystanders said to the prisoner, "You rascal, did you intend to shoot me? what did you want to shoot me for?"—he said, "I did not intend to shoot you"—he was asked who he intended to shoot, and he nodded to Chamberlain—he was taken in custody—I kept him on the ground until we got sufficient strength to take him to the station—I was much exhausted—I walked on one side of him to the station, and some<lb/>body else on the other, and Chamberlain behind—on the way to the station the prisoner said, "Are you two police officers?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, I think I fought a very good battle in a very fair duel; I am only sorry I have not got payment for it"—I saw the pistol produced by Cham<lb/>berlain at the station; it was a revolver with six chambers, three of them were loaded and three had been discharged—it appears that the revolver did not revolve properly at the time, it passed out here—this pin projected and caught the last bullet—I know that it is one of the bullets he is supposed to have fired on this occasion, because if the bullet had been there before, the barrel could not have revolved at the two first fires—I searched the prisoner at the station, and took from him three keys—I accompanied my superin<lb/>tendent and inspector with them to the address in Sidmouth Street and made a search—they opened one drawer of a chest of drawers in the room—the inspector found some things; I did not see them all—I found some powder and other things.</p>

               <p>Road, and we followed him—we came up to him at the end of Bedford Street, Tottenham Court Road—Chown asked him if his name was Clancy—he said, "I don't know you"—he asked him again, and he said, "No, my name is Reed, and I live at Great College Street, Camden Town—Chown then said, "We are two officers, and shall take you into custody for being a deserter from the sappers," or "engineers," I do not know which—almost before he said the words, the prisoner put his umbrella between his legs and tripped him up, and ran away—I followed him; but just as I started, two gentlemen came in front of me, just between us two—the gentlemen stopped me a minute or two from running after him, and then I pursued him—he ran into Bedford Square and turned to the right—I saw Chown follow him—he was just behind me, at my right, rather nearer to him than Chown—I was on his left—after he had run about fifteen yards past the corner of the square, he turned to the right and fired at Sergeant Chown, who was about fifteen or twenty yards from him—I heard the report, and saw the flash as well—I was within four or five yards of him when he started—he then turned back and started off again, and gained ground of me—he ran about forty or fifty yards, then turned round to the left and fired at me—just at that time I stepped in a gully-hole and almost fell down, near a railing—I was ten or twelve yards from him—he was in the road, a little in advance of me—I think my falling in the gully-hole was the only thing that saved me—I saw the flash—Chown was following—I got up, and he gained ground of me again for a short distance; then I gained ground on him very fast—it appeared that he could not run very much after that—he was turning round to the left—I was within five or seven yards—he was just in the act of turning again, and I saw Hurst coming up—I called to him, and he caught hold of him and twisted him round to the road, and by that time I bad got hold of him—I tripped him, and just as he was in the act of falling, I saw a revolver in his right hand—I had got hold of him by the right shoulder with my left hand, and saw the revolver straight up, close by my ear—I caught hold of it with my right hand and pressed it, so, and just at that moment, I was slipping at the time, it went off, exploded—seven, eight, or ten persons were present at the time it went off—he had then hold of the handle of it, though I had hold of the barrel, and the coachman was going to take hold of it at the time—I did not feel the shot, but it blackened my face and whiskers, and my coat was scorched by the powder—it looked blue—I took the revolver out of his hand, and struck him on the head with it twice—a gentleman who has a shop in Endell Street came up while he was still on the ground, who said, "You rascal, did you intend to shoot me?"—he said, "No"—just as he was getting up, he said, "I did not intend to shoot you; it was him, calling to me"—he said, "No harm," nodding towards me; I could not exactly catch the words—I went with him to the station, and had hold of him a short distance—some gentlemen came up and assisted—on the way to the station, I heard him say something about having fought a good battle—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the revolver I took from the prisoner.</p>

I did the best I could to sell his brooms, out of which I got a trifle for myself. He absconded, but I did not. I remained there for two years. I saw him sometimes, and he always knew where to find me. I wish the jury to compare the signatures, and if they find that they are in my writing they may find me guilty; but I can see no resemblance. I never forged a name across a bill in my life. The body of a bill is an unfinished document, of no use till the signature is put to it; and it is yet to be proved that I know anything of these bills at all.</p>

I live at 203, Waterloo Road, and am traveller to Yates &amp; Co., of Birmingham, iron merchants and jewellers—on 11th July I went to Cox's shop, in Cambridge Heath Road, and enquired if he could do anything in my line—Smart, who was there, called me back, and said "I can do something in your way if you can sell reasonably; I am a builder and shipping agent, living at Notting Hill, and I require a lot of iron bed<lb/>steads to send out to New Zealand; if you will call on me at Notting Hill I will let you know what I require"—I said, "If we do business it must be for cash"—he said, "I do nothing hut cash transactions;</p>

               <p>no one calls on me twice for their money"—I then gave him patterns, and he wrote an order on the samples—Smart returned the samples directly from Birmingham, marked—I sent the order to Birmingham, and they sent the forty-eight bedsteads from Birmingham, amounting to 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less discount, leaving balance 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that account—on 18th July he came to me and said, "I cannot understand this," and produced a note from the railway company at Camden—I said, "If you are a business man, that is easily understood; the goods have been delivered at your address at Notting Hill, and no one has been there to take them in; if you will write to the railway company they will re-deliver the goods, charging a small amount, which we will arrange and settle"—on showing him out, his attention was drawn to some samples belonging to Thomas Yates &amp; Co., which I had in stock, iron bedsteads, and he wished to become a purchaser of those—I said, "We will settle one transaction first, for, to tell you the truth, I have no faith in you; I seem to be credit<lb/>ing you against my own conscience, and we made an arrangement—he then agreed to a price for these goods and 1 cwt of glue, all to be paid for on 22nd July, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—he bought the goods, and sent a man for them on 22nd July; they were consigned from Birmingham on 11th July; I do not know what day they were delivered—I went there afterwards on 19th July, and received this cheque on 20th July from the hands of Smart—I saw Turpin give it him; he called him out at the door—it is on the London and County Bank, and is signed "Robert Talfrey;" it was afterwards returned; I got no money on it—on the Thursday following, 20th July, I went to the house and found it closed, and no one there—there were no symptoms of bedsteads or furniture—I put myself in communication with the police, and in consequence of something I heard went to Barnes's oil and colour shop, 156, Brick Lane, on the 29th—I saw him in the presence of two persons, and asked him if he was Mr. Barnes—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I see you are engaged, I will call again"—he said, "There is no necessity; you can speak your business here"—I said, "In the presence of these men?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you know Robert Talfrey?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Do you know who Thomas Yates &amp; Co., merchants, of Birmingham, are?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you know you have got some goods in your possession belonging to Thomas Yates &amp; Co.; iron bedsteads?"—he said, "I purchased them from Talfrey"—he after<lb/>wards said, "I have lent 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them"—I said, "You have just said you do not know Talfrey"—he said, "Who are you to cross-question me like this?"—I told him who I was—he said, "What are those men outside my shop?"—I said, "They are police officers"—he said, "Do you expect any violence?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I am an honest tradesman"—I said, "Well, you look like one, and if you are, you will assist in capturing the swindler Talfrey"—he said, "I am willing to give up these goods if you will give me the money I have advanced on them"—I said, "If it is an honest transaction, will you show me your purchases?"—he first objected, and then he said that he would, and produced the original invoice which was first consigned to Talfrey from Birmingham for twenty-four bedsteads—he held it like this, and did not let me see it—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Talfrey to Barnes was not shown to me at all; I never saw it till to-day—(<hi rend="italic">This was an invoice of twenty iron bedsteads, at</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">bought by Barnes of Robert Kitson, July</hi> 17, 1867, <hi rend="italic">discount</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 19<hi rend="italic">l. signed</hi>,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 653). On 20th February, from informa<lb/>tion I received, I went to Tyler's Market, at three o'clock in the afternoon, and into Mr. Andred's counting-house, which joins Messrs. Venables'—they are divided by a wooden partition—I made a hole in the partition, and waited there till ten o'clock at night—I then heard the gate at the entrance to the market unlocked, also the door of the counting-house—I saw, through the hole in the partition, the prisoner with a lighted match—I saw him light several other matches—I saw him open a drawer in the counting-house with a key, and take out some money—I then heard him lock the drawer and the counting-house door—I then passed out of the counting-house into the shop, and I heard the prisoner talking to someone,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240039"/>
               <p>but I did not know who—I had seen two men at the Warwick Lane en<lb/>trance to the market—I allowed him to walk a short distance from the shop, and then I jumped over the gates—they were not firm, and shook about a good deal, and. the prisoner ran out of the market into Warwick Lane—I stopped him just outside the market—I told him I should take him into custody for entering and stealing money from Messrs. Venables' counting-house—he said, "Emery, you have made a mistake, I was in Sketchley's Place"—I took him to the station, and searched him, and found a pound of sausages, threepence in coppers, and three marked sixpences—I had known him as assistant watchman in the market for some time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a gaslight burning opposite Venables' counting-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not notice any—there are a great many gas-lights in the market—I did not see him take any key from the ledge in the counting-house—the place was dark till he lighted the match—I saw him open the till and take money out—he had his hand closed over the money—he only had a light occasionally—he had a light when he opened the drawer—I had been in the place all the afternoon, and had not moved—I did not go round to him when he unlocked the drawer because I should have made a noise, and he would have made some excuse—I should have had to go about fifteen yards—I did not move till I heard the gate locked—I had to jump over a gate—I saw two men outside, and I asked the prisoner to assist me to stop one of them, as they seemed in a great hurry to get away—I did not see anybody but the prisoner in the counting-house—I kept hold of him and we ran a few yards—I believe one of the men was the prisoner's brother, and the other a man named Groves—I took no steps to take the other men—I did not search the place, it wan locked, and I could not get in—I did not go in the morning—I had never been on duty there before—I did not know that it was the watchmen's duty to watch the counting-house, and see if there was anybody about—I was in<lb/>structed that he had no right in the counting-house—I did not cough when I was watching, I am sure of that; I was as quiet as I possibly could be—I did not hear them come up the market; there was sawdust on the floor, and you could not hear anybody walking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the employ of Messrs. Seaward Brothers, 32, Chambers Street, Whitechapel—on the morning of 30th December, between one and two o'clock, I was standing at the gate of No. 32, about a hundred yards from Mulcahy's house—the five prisoners passed me, and after they had gone about three or four yards they sepa<lb/>rated, Joseph, Arneaux, and Jackson going in one direction, and the other two in another—between two and three o'clock, I was standing at the same gate, and Berton and Portansene passed again—I asked them what time it was, and Berton said, in broken English, that it was between two and three—they turned down towards Mulcahy's house, and I followed them—when they got to the bottom gate, they stopped and spoke to some<lb/>one at No. 2; I do not know who—they went down Royal Mint Street, and I went to the steps and saw Jackson kneeling down orer a grating at 2, Swallow's Gardens—I said, "What are you doing there"—he said, "Me sleep"—he got up, and went towards the City—I followed him, but not seeing a policeman, I was obliged to go back to my own premises, and I did not see him again until he was in custody—I returned to the place where I had seen him, and there saw Burke, with whom I had some con<lb/>versation, and during that time Berton and Portansene came back, and I pointed them out to him—we stopped them, and Burke searched Berton and took the crowbar and keys from him—Berton said he belonged to a ship, and the keys belonged to his boxes—I saw a knife—Portansene said he wanted a match to light his pipe.</p>

I am in the employ of the Midland Railway Com<lb/>pany—on the morning of 30th December I was employed as watchman outside the station, and about four o'clock I was in Royal Mint Street—I saw Jackson in Swallow's Gardens; when he saw me he moved away—about a quarter past four I saw him again, standing at the corner of Royal Mint Street—he asked me what time it was, and I told him about ten minutes past four—he thanked me, and moved away—I saw Burke, and spoke to him, and as we were going after Jackson, Joseph and Arneaux came round the corner—we stopped them—Arneaux had a hamper, and Joseph had a walking stick—I saw the hamper opened, and a quantity of articles taken from it, such as tea, sugar, coffee, and bacon, and also a knife, which he gave me—Joseph, as soon as he saw he was going to be taken, said something which sounded like "Hush," and then said, "Stab him"—he then snatched at the knife I had, twice—I dropped it, and then threw him into the road—in the struggle he dropped this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—about four o'clock on 14th January I saw Jackson go into an oil shop in Royal Mint Street—a policeman came up, and he was taken in custody—I am sure he is the man that asked me the time on 30th December.</p>

He says that I was taken by the assistance of Wade and the policeman, he does not say I had hold of his legs. I was thirty-five yards ahead of him when I was taken. I believe he was intoxicated, and did not know he had locked me up the next day. I have had five weeks' imprison<lb/>ment now, and know nothing about' it. I was not in company with anyone, so cannot call any witnesses. The prosecutor said there was nobody else there, there were about thirty persons there when I was taken to the station.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 11). About half-past five on 15th January, I was in Lancaster Road, and saw the prisoners together—I saw them go into the front garden of Lancaster Lodge, Nothing Hill, which is separated by a high wall from the prosecutor's house—I went and stood inside the gate—after waiting a few minutes, I saw the prisoners come up a passage at the side of the house from the back garden—they then had a bag each—these are the bags (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Hart had something under his arm—I took hold of them, and took them into the hall of Lancaster Lodge—there were some gentlemen outside, and I asked if I might take them there, and they said I might—when I stopped them Hart said, "Do not hold me, you are mistaken, I can show you where I got them from"—he afterwards said he found them lying under a fence—I asked him what he had done with the other bag, he said he had not got one—as I went out to go to the station I found this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) close to where I stopped them—the property has been shown to Emma Thomas, and has been in my custody ever since.</p>

I live at 2, Lancaster Road Villas, Nothing Hill, with my mother, next door to Lancaster Lodge—I have seen the things in the bags, and identify them as belonging to my mother and my sisters—on 15th January they were hanging in the back yard, safe, about half-past four, at half-past five they were gone—I saw some mud on the wall, and foot-steps—the walls are rather high at the back.</p>

Q.</hi> How were the things fastened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By pegs; some were tied—There is a mews at the back of Lancaster Lodge, which leads into a back street—there is no glass on the wall—the garden of Lancaster Lodge is very large—you can see the things hanging out from the road—the wall that divides the two gardens is about twelve feet high—there are fruit trees nailed to the wall, it is possible for a man to get from one side to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hart, in his defence, stated that if they had any felonious intention they would not have gone through the gate but would have gone out into the mews; that the two gentlemen had not come to give evidence; that he never saw that bag at all; that the policeman said he was only three minutes at the gate, when they would have to go the length of the garden, forty yards, get over the wall, unpeg the things, and come back the same way; that he was disgusted at the time, and did not say anything; that if they had got over the wall they would have left footmarks; that they saw some things just inside the gate, and Cooper went in, and the policeman followed almost instantly</hi>.</p>

               <p>kicked me, and hurt me very much—she was behind me when she kicked me—after the kick I continued to feel hurt from it; it has hurt me ever since—Mr. Ratcliff was in the room when this occurred, and he sent me downstairs to go home—he said, "You send the girl downstairs"—he sent the eldest boy home with me—I continued in pain when I got home—I told my step-mother, and she examined me—in the evening I was taken to the police-station, and then to the hospital—I remained there eleven days—I often feel the pain now in the place where she kicked me—when I went into the hospital I had a swelling inside my legs and groin—I had nothing to eat on that Sunday but a piece of dry bread, and that I left—on the Friday before I was in the back drawing-room, and Mrs. Ratcliff boxed my ears—Mr. Ratcliff came up and saw her doing it, and sent me downstairs—after I went down, he went out, and Mrs. Ratcliff came into the kitchen—I was cleaning some spoons—she was going to wash up the tea things, and she took some water out of the kettle, put it in a cup, and threw it over my neck—it blistered my neck and bosom—I found the blisters in the evening, when I went to bed—she did nothing else to me that day—on the next day, Saturday, I was at work in the kitchen—she came in and asked me where the soap was—I told her I did not know—I went out to empty a pail of water, and she came out after me, took the iron bowl from the sink, which I was using, and struck me on the head with it—it made my head bleed—later in the evening, I was cleaning the kitchen, when she came in and beat me with a long stick—she had been cross all day because I did not know where the soap was—she struck me on the arms and back—my arm bled—the stick broke in two across my back, and she put it in a clothes'-basket on the copper—the blood from my arm went on the floor I was cleaning, and she said I was a dirty thing to let the blood drop, and made me wash my arm in the pail—she gave me some cold potatoes and onions for dinner on the Saturday—next morning I was cleaning the knives, about eight o'clock, in the back kitchen, and she took a cane from a hamper, and beat me on the back with it—the arm that had bled the day before she made me scrub, with cold water and a scrubbing-hrush—she stood by while I was doing it—it hurt me very much when I scrubbed it—she told me to go out and scrub my arms in the pail—it was outside that I did it—if I cried, she said she would beat me till I left off—she said, if I did not mind what I was about, I should not be able to walk home—that was when she was getting the dinner ready, before she kicked me—she had been going on at me all the morning for not doing my work properly—she said, if I did not mind, she would keep me another week and serve me the same—on the Friday, when I was standing still, she hit me on the side of the head, and knocked my head against the wall—it hurt me very much, and as she struck me she gave me a knock in the eye, which gave me a black eye.</p>

               <p>Ratcliff came round to know why I had not been there before, and my mother asked her to take me back again—I do not remember when she began to ill-treat me, but a good while ago—I met my sister in the street, and told her about it, and told her to tell my mother how I was treated—this was a good while after I had been sent home because my frock was dirty—she treated me well up till last August, when she beat me and kicked me—I know it began in August, because it was about twelve months after I had been there—I did not tell my mother, because from what Mrs. Ratcliff said I was afraid—when I was sent home about the dirty frock my mother asked her to take me back—I did not tell my mother then, because I had not been sent home altogether, only to show my dirty frock, and I did not tell her then because Mrs. Ratcliff's little boy was with me, and I was afraid he would go back and tell his mother—I told my sister about a month or six weeks after the affair about the frock—Mrs. Ratcliff complained about my being dirty—she asked my mother if she would mind my sleeping at home—that was not because I was dirty, but because her little boy was coming home from school—I believe I slept at home for five weeks—I am not in the habit of falling down stairs—I slipped down two or three stairs once, not all the way down—I hurt myself a little, there were no bruises from the fall—it was a long time ago, before I was sent home about the frock—I fell down on the Saturday before the Sunday I went home—I was going upstairs to hang up a hat, and I slipped over a bit of grease from one stair to another—I did not fall down stairs—I hurt myself a little on my thigh, not on the groin—I had not fallen down on the Friday—I only had two falls, one a long time ago, and one on the Saturday—I know James Coutts—on the Saturday before I left he was cleaning the back shop, about seven o'clock, and I was assisting him—I tried to kneel down, but it hurt me very much—in consequence of the state of my legs I was unable to kneel down, and he asked me the reason—I did not say to him "When I fell down on the stairs with the scuttle of coals yesterday I hurt myself just here (pointing to the groin)"—I never fell down with a scuttle of coals, at all since I have been there—I fell on the Saturday, but not on the Friday—it was through Mrs. Ratcliff kicking me that I could not kneel down—the state of my legs on the Saturday was not in consequence on the fall—that had nothing to do with it—I swear I did not fall on the Friday—I do not know whether Coutts knew that I fell on the Saturday—he asked me what was the matter, and I told him that I slipped—I appeared to be in great pain, and was rubbing my thigh—my father came there on the Saturday—I heard him and Mrs. Ratcliff talk<lb/>ing in the kitchen a long time—I did not hear what they said, I was in the back kitchen cleaning—my father is here—on Saturday, 11th, William Ratcliff, the little boy, asked me what made me lame—that was about an hour or two after I had slipped—I did not tell him that I fell down stairs with a scuttle of coals and hurt myself in the groin—I said that I had slipped oa the stairs as I was going up, over some grease—either William or Ernest Ratcliff let my father in when he came on the Saturday—they told me that he had come—I did not say "What will your mother do to keep me out of father's way, he will murder me if he sees me"—I did not say that or any<lb/>thing like it—I was carried into Court to-day, I cannot walk—I did not walk home from the Court last Monday with my mother, we had a cab—I walked to the cab with my mother's assistance—I walked nearly as far as the cab rank, and I walked to the Court in the morning with my father and mother—thev did not carry me, but I was assisted by both of them—I was</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road—on Sunday evening, 12th January, the little girl was brought to the hospital in a most exhausted condition, and apparently suf<lb/>fering very much from pain and weakness—I had her removed to a ward and undressed; I then examined her—her face below her eyes were swollen and bruised, also her nose and her face was very much injured otherwise with small contusions—there was a small incised wound, about an inch in extent, on the right side of the top of her head, which had bled rather pro<lb/>fusely some hours previously, and there were stains of blood about her hair and neck—her neck and shoulders were very red and painful, much swollen, and portions of her shoulders were denuded of skin, apparently from blisters—there was a small open wound on the right side of her chest—her wrists, abdomen, and back were covered with small contused wounds, and as her mother says, you could not put a half-crown anywhere without coming on some contusion—her external genital organs were injured, being discoloured, and immediately above them there was considerable tumefaction or swelling, which extended to the groin on the right side, which was also discoloured—her things, legs, and arms were considerably contused and swollen, more particularly her shins and feet—her arms and legs were so much swollen that she presented the appearance of a dropsical patient—she could scarcely move her legs, arms, or thighs—the skin was off her thighs in some places,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240071"/>
               <p>no doubt from a scald or burn of some kind, it appeared to be denuded of skin between her thighs—she was an in-patient eleven or twelve days, and subsequently for some time an out-patient, and is not discharged yet—the state she is in now is, I fancy, consequent on the injuries she received then—the wound on her head might be produced by the corner of an iron pot, if used with sufficient force; it was not very serious, it was merely through the scalp—I do not think I remarked any outs on her arms, although she maintains it; there may have been small abrasions, such as we should scarcely take any notice of—the swelling of the external genital parts might be produced by a kick with a boot only, but, of course, it would have to be applied directly to the part—if she was on her knees, and received a violent kick with a boot from behind, that would produce what I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might it have been caused by a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but there must have been some projecting substance to have fallen against—I hardly think a fall down stairs could have done it, unless anything was on the stain—I did not examine her as to being of a dropsical tendency; but I should fancy certainly not—her flesh was not more tender than that of other girls of her age—one fall might have caused the injuries on her private parts and groin; but they appeared only to have been done a few hours—I examined her on Sunday night, and I fancy it must have been done only a few hours before—it might have been caused by a fall on Saturday evening, certainly—there is nothing in her constitution which would give her a tendency to fall at times, that I am aware of; but I did not examine her as to that—if I heard it proved on indubitable testimony that she was in the habit of falling, there is nothing in her physical condition to which I could attribute it—I can imagine a state of body in some children of her age which would render them liable to fall, but not in her's; for instance, in epilepsy and with spinal disease and disease of the brain, they very often fall about—what other causes I know, I did not examine her with a view to find whether those causes existed, because I was not told—I should also attribute being given to falling, to having been laid up with any diseases of different kinds that would cause bad legs, hip, or joint diseases; or if she had been ill-treated, improperly fed, badly clothed, and so on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, of 38, King David Street—on 3rd February, about 7 p.m., the prisoners came to my shop—Brown said, "We have come from the Surrey Docks"—Watkins said that he belonged to the ship <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi>, which came from the Mediterranean with oil cake, and was lying in the Surrey Docks, and he had been four months on board as able seaman, that he had had one month's advance and three months' pay to take—he asked me to pay Brown and Much 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would pay me back on Thursday, when he was paid off—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was for bringing their clothes, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for expenses coming across the water—both the other prisoners said that they came from the Surrey Docks—I paid them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and Mrs. Mills paid them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after that Watkins said that he wanted some clothes, and asked me to let him have some—I gave him a guernsey, a pair of boots, and other things, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would pay me on Thursday when he was paid off—he went out and said he would come in half an hour—I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the two men upon the statement that he would pay me back when he was paid off; and I also parted with the clothes on the faith of that statement—he went out, leaving a bag of what one of them said were clothes—when they had gone I found it contained all kinds of rubbish, stones and rags—I afterwards gave Watkins in charge on Wednesday, the 5th—he said he did not know me, and that I had made a mistake in the person.</p>

               <p>being due to me—I asked him to give me a list of the outstanding accounts, to calculate my commission—he said that he could not give it to me then, but if I came on Monday he would have it ready—I applied on the Mon<lb/>day; it was not ready, and he asked me to call in a few days—I called again in a few days; he came to the door in a blustering way—I said I had called for the list—he said, "I shan't give it to you"—I said, "If you will not, I shall have to go round to all the customers and ask them for a copy of their bills, and then I shall apply to you every week until my commission is due"—I did so, and then served him with a written notice, which he has got—he refused payment, and I took out a summons in the County Court—I never had a horse and trap to go about with, but I have fetched it from the stable on the other side of the way—the summons was heard on 15th January; the defendant was sworn, and stated that my arrangement was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and 2 ½ per cent, on all monies that I received, and not on orders, as he had never paid me on orders; that I had never made any application to him for money, and he did not know that he owed me any, and was very much surprised when he received the summons, as he did not know what it was for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell the Jury that your commission was payable on all monies you received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was to receive no money except by special command—when I left, I settled accounts with him up to what money had then been collected in—at the time I left, the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I sued for was not due—I was to be paid when the money was paid—that is not what he swore; he swore that my engagement was nothing on orders—if he had sworn that my commission would be payable when he was paid, that would have been true; but he swore that I was to be paid when he was paid upon what I received myself, although I was to receive nothing—he sometimes made me wait six weeks when I had taken the orders—when he was paid, I was always paid, at the end of the week—I did not cancel all the orders in the book when I left—the Judge did not say that my having cancelled the orders put an end to the matter, or any<lb/>thing about that—he said that as the defendant had sworn it, and was supported by his wife and his father, he must give judgment for him—they were examined on the trial as to the agreement—I do not know George Peter, but he is a clicker to the prisoner—he did not see me canceling the orders in the book—I did not cancel any, and did not tell him that I had—I am certain the prisoner swore that he did not know he owed me any<lb/>thing, and that I never applied for commission on the orders I obtained—he swore that he discharged me because, while using his horse and trap, I took the best orders for myself, and left the bad ones to him—the trap was not supplied to me, I was only out in it when with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Denmark Villas, Woolwich—Halfpenny was brought to me about twenty minutes past nine on Thursday, 13th, bleeding profusely from a punctured wound on his left temple, close to the eye—he was in a fainting state, and it was some time before he could be brought round—the wound was half an inch long, and extended to the bone—it corresponded with a knife of this kind (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—next day I noticed a very extensive bruise round his eye, as if a Wow had also been given.</p>

               <p>not go till half-past one—I did not know McCarthy or Richardson before—they were strangers to me—in the presence of all of them, O'Leary asked me if I would take the Fenian oath—I told him I should like to hear it—we had a little to drink, and I told him I should have to be getting home—he said, "Oh, you must not go home, we will go round to the King William, in Wellington Street"—we went there—there was a little bit of disturbance there, as regards my being a detective—Lyttleton said there was a sneak in the room—he asked me if I would take the Fenian oath—I said, "I did not know what it was, I should like to hear it"—he asked whether we could go into a private room—I told him I did not mind—he said, "You ask the landlord for the key"—I asked the landlord if he would let me have the key of the parlour—he came with the key, and we all went into the room—McCarthy, his brother, Richardson, O'Leary, and myself all went into the room with Lyttleton—we had a conversation about Fenianism, and then he asked me if I would take the oath—I said I should like to hear it—and Lyttleton repeated the oath to O'Leary—before this, they asked me if I was a detective, and I said, "No; I will swear by my God that I am not a detective"—Lyttleton took a book out of his pocket and placed it on the table, and wrote something in it—it was this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) or one like it—he read what he wrote in the book—Lyttleton repeated the oath to O'Leary, and he took a small Testament out of his pocket and kissed it—the oath was "You shall foreswear all allegiance to the Sovereign of Great Britain, and take up arms against the British Government, and overthrow them, to protect the rights of Ireland, So help you God"—after that O'Leary kissed the book—he then told me to take hold of the book, which I did whilst he repeated the words to me—I told him I did not exactly understand what he said—he asked me if I was a d—fool—I refused to kiss the book—McCarthy tapped me on the shoulder and said don't be a d—traitor—I still refused to kiss the book, and he said I was a b—traitor—during the whole of this time Richardson, McCarthy, his brother, Lyttleton, O'Leary, and myself were in the room—I am positive of that—about three o'clock the landlord or pot<lb/>man came to the door and said, "You must be getting out here, it is getting on for three o'clock—at that time the door was locked—I did not lock it—I unlocked it—I don't know who opened it—we all went out one after the other—I don't know who came out last—when I went out I went into the passage—we all went out the back way, and O'Leary turned round and gave me in charge to Richardson and McCarthy—I asked them what the charge was—they said, Fenianism"—I said, "Very well, I will go" and they took me to the police station—McCarthy was on one side of me, and Richardson on the other—O'Leary came besides—Lyttleton did not—when they took me to the station they made a charge of being concerned in Fenianism against me—I told them who I was, as I had made a report previously about Lyttleton to one of the inspectors—I think his name is Hibbs, the inspector at Deptford—I do not think there was anyone present when I reported it to him—they charged me with "Fenianism—I told them I had got a cousin a detective, named Ling, who they knew very well; I was no Fenian—I gave Richardson, McCarthy, and O'Leary, my address—at that time I was staying with my cousin, Ling—he is a detective and an officer at Deptford—I was then discharged—in the course of the evening I went to the same public-house, the King William, about five o'clock, by myself—I was talking to the landlord, and telling him about it, when O'Leary, Richardson, and Lyttleton came</p>

I am landlord of the King William the Fourth, Wellington Street, Deptford—I know the prisoner Lyttleton by his coming to my house several times—on Sunday, 19th January, I saw McCarthy and Richardson at my house—I had not seen them before—they came about a quarter to two o'clock; Lyttleton, O'Leary, and several others were with them—Boutall was there, I believe, when they came in—O'Leary, Richard<lb/>son, and Lytlleton came in together, and McCarthy a few moments afterwards, and some one with him—I do not know whether it was his brother, or who it was—Richardson came in with McCarthy—there was a third party came in, and one man came round deliberately to Boutall, and said, "I heard you pass some remarks about America last night, and I think you are a b—y liar;" and after Boutall had spoken to him, and remarked on what happened in America, which made him believe he had been there, the same man said to Boutall, "I think you are a b—y Fenian"—Lyttleton said to the man, "I think it is very wrong for you to live in our company and come round to a strange man and interfere in his business that you know nothing about"—Lyttleton advised him to leave, and he did so—when he left, Lyttleton came back, and said, "Gentlemen, I believe we have a b—y sneak among us, you must dispense with it"—he got so excited that I was obliged to stop him, and he walked deliberately round to the man—they came round to test Boutall about America, and in the meantime Boutall, O'Leary, and McCarthy went into my back passage, which is a public thoroughfare right through—Boutall came beck to me. and said, "Seal, give me the key of the parlour"—I said, "I have not got it; I will call my postman"—I called him, and he gave it to him—the door was opened, and Boutall, Richardson, McCarthy, and O'Leary, and I think one or two others, I do not know which, came in at the same time with them, I did not take particular notice of them—I said, "Gentlemen, what business you have to transact do it as quickly as you possibly can, for my time is near for closing"—I came back to my bar, and heard the bell ring and a pot of stout ordered, which I served, and received 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from them—my postman took it in—Richardson went in with them—I was in my bar, and O'Leary came out, and said to Lyttleton, "I want you to come in with me," and they went in together—Lyttleton denied going in at first, but he went in by the persuasion of O'Leary, and being a few minutes to three, I said to my postman, "Hunt those men out of the room, I want my place closed"—I shut my front door up at three; in a short time I went to the parlour</p>

               <p>door, and found McCarthy outside the door, and the door locked inside—he was standing listening, it appeared—there is a division between my bar and my room—I knocked at the door moderately, and said, "I want my house cleared; I will have it cleared if I find Boutall, O'Leary, and Lyttleton inside; out you come"—nobody else was inside to my knowledge—I do not know who opened the door, but it was opened from inside—I believe Richardson was one of them, but I did not see him at the time; he was not with McCarthy at the door, and he was not inside the room—Boutall, O'Leary, and Lyttleton came out, and I said, "My front premises are closed, you must go out the back way"—they did so, and the back gate was closed—they were in the room about half an hour from the time the key was fetched till I saw them out—I did not see what became of them—I saw Boutall again at a few minutes after five, when I opened my house again, and O'Leary, McCarthy, and Lyttleton came in about five or ten minutes after him—Boutall said to O'Leary and McCarthy, "Old boy, you were sucked in about not taking me, were you not?"—that was all I heard; a scuffle took place; I was obliged to interfere, and I had a severe hit on the jaw by Lyttleton—O' Leary quietly walked off, but Richardson did not—he took off his coat, and said, "I think you did very wrong in striking the landlord, who has no intimacy in this affair at all"—I did not see anybody strike Boutall—I know McCarthy's brother now by sight—I cannot recognize him as one of the parties who went into the room; I cannot swear one way or other, but I know him now by his coming to my house since—I did not know him before.</p>

On the 19th January, from informa<lb/>tion I received from Inspector Digby and Constable Ling, I organized parties to take the prisoners into custody—I went with one of the parties to 2, Queen Street, Deptford, where Richardson and O'Leary lived—Boutall and a constable went with me at five o'clock in the evening of the 20th—we stayed outside till twenty minutes past six, when the door was opened by a man, who I believe to be O'Leary—he kept his body within the door, put his head out, and looked right and left, and though I drew back to hide myself he evidently saw me, and he withdrew his head into the doorway—I stepped forward, and said, "One moment"—I was going to say, "I wish to speak to you" but the door was closed and bolted—I then sent two constables who were with me down into the cellar, and they came up and opened the front door to me—I went upstairs, and found Richardson in bed—O'Leary was not in the house—I told Richardson I had come to take him into custody on a charge of being concerned in a matter of Fenianism with other men, one being O'Leary—I said that he administered</p>

               <p>an oath on the Sunday to the young man who is now present—Boutall was then in the room—Richardson said he had nothing to do with it; he went there as a special constable—his wife said, "Oh, gentlemen, he has nothing to do with that; he is a Protestant; he is an Englishman, like yourselves"—I first heard what had taken place at the King William on the Monday night—inspector Digby and Ling gave me the information, and I sent for Boutall and heard his statement.</p>

               <p>about 17th January—I saw Boutall outside the station with Ling, and Yardley, but not in the station—I think I saw Ling with Boutall on the Saturday night prior to the Sunday—I have known McCarthy twelve years, at least, as a labourer in Her Majesty's Dockyard—I know where he lives now—I know that he has lodgers, at least I have been given to understand so since his apprehension; I did not know that at the time—McCarthy was not in the room when I found these papers there; he was in custody—his brother and his wife took me into the room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant R</hi> 8). On Sunday, 19th January, I was on duty at the Deptford Station—Boutall was brought there in custody about half-past three in the afternoon by McCarthy and Richardson, and a man named Daniel O'Leary—O'Leary charged him with being a Fenian—he said he had had a conversation with him on the Saturday night, and he believed him to be a Fenian—I asked him why he had not given informa<lb/>tion at the station about it—he said that he did not think it was necessary, as he had a special constable in his house—I took the names and addresses of the whole of them—I had seen Boutall before—I did hot know that he was a relation of Ling's—Boutall stated that if I wished for any reference respecting him, he would refer me to detective Ling—McCarthy stated that he was at the William, in Wellington Street, and was called upon by O'Leary to take Boutall into custody, with Richardson as well, he and Richardson being special constables—I did not take the charge—I gave Boutall's name and address to O'Leary—about ten minutes after that, Boutall returned to the station, and made a further communication to me—it had reference to something that took place at the King William on the Sunday afternoon—I reported the matter to Inspector Digby.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A long statement made by Richardson before the Magistrate was put in and read: in substance it amounted to a denial of the statements made by the witness Boutall, and asserted that he and McCarthy, as special constables, were watching the witness as a suspected Fenian, and that it was not until they had taken him into custody that he made the present accusation</hi>.</p>

I am McCarthy's brother, and am a shipwright—before 19th January this year I had not seen either Richardson or Lyttleton—I first saw them at the King William public-house, Deptford, about two. on that afternoon—I entered the public-house with my brother Florence—I had come straight from his house, 35, Princes Street, and had not been at the King's Head public-house that morning—when we entered the King William there was no one in the compartment we went into, but there was another compartment on the left, and another on the right: altogether there are four compartments at the bar—I saw Boutall on the left, in the midst of seven or eight men, proclaiming himself an American and a citizen, and praising America—a man with a moustache in the right compartment came round to me, and asked me for a book—I asked him what sort of book—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240098"/>
               <p>said, "Any sort"—I afterwards heard that his name was O'Leary—I told him I had been to church that morning, and I had got a prayer book—he said that would do, and I lent it to him—this is it—Boutall then came into the compartment where I was, and we spoke about America—he asked me about different parts of America inland, Ohio, Cleveland, and so on; but I told him I had only been to the seaport towns—directly after that he left the compartment, and went on the right, immediately returning and saying to me, "Come in here; we have got some gin"—I went in, but there was so much confusion that I returned to my compartment—soon afterwards we all went into the parlour, Boutall, the man with the moustache, O'Leary, myself, my brother, Lyttleton, Richardson, and there might be two others—I did not take any particular notice as to the number—I cannot say whether Lyttleton went in with us, but I saw him in the room—we all went in in a straggling sort of way—there were several in the room when I went in—when I got in somebody ordered a pot of stout, which came—I cannot tell who paid for it—Boutall stood in the middle of the room; in fact, he stood all the time, and so did O'Leary—Boutall took his coat off, and laid it on the table, with the inside upwards, and said that he paid thirty dollars, I think, for making it; that he cut it himself, and he seemed to praise it as an American-made coat—he then extended his arm in this manner to O'Leary, and said, "May this arm be paralyzed; may I be struck dead on the spot, if I am a detective; I am with you, boys, willing to take any oath, or anything"—I will not be certain whether he used the word oath, I think he did—McCarthy then left the room, saying that there was something wrong, followed, I think, by Richardson and Lyttleton—they only left Boutall, myself, and O'Leary in the room; O'Leary and Boutall were standing together, and I was taking no particular notice of what they were doing; I was sitting down.</p>

J. W.

Field, Wilsdew House, Thorpe, Surrey"—I have made inquiries, but no person of that name lives there—this order was brought to me at the works on the 30th (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Eggham Hythe Farm, 29th January, 1868. Gentlemen, Please deliver to bearer two tons of best linseed cake, and oblige yours respectfully, C. Saunders. Please send account by the bearer"—I gave the cake to the carman, who gave the name of Thomas Wiggins—I saw them loading the cake, and went away for a short time; when I came back it was gone—I next saw the prisoner at the Kingston police-station on 30th January, and identified him as the man who had been to my place—he was with me altogether about half-an-hour—he</p>

I am a sailor, and live at 33, Ernest Street, Ber<lb/>mondsey—on 28th January, I met the female prisoner in the King's Arms, Old Kent Road, about a quarter to twelve at night—I had some drink with her, and we left to go away together—I had hardly proceeded many yards outside, before I received a violent blow on my head, which rendered me nearly insensible, and a second blow on my ear—I was knocked down, and the female prisoner laid hold of me by the throat, and tried to get my watch out of my waistcoat pocket—she nearly strangled me, but only got the chain, and she did not take that—Bowman had hold of my legs—there were four altogether—twelve or fourteen people came up, and then the police—when I came to my senses, my chain was on the pavement; but I had got my watch, and I kept my arm on it for security—Bowman, pulled my legs very violently.</p>

I am a widow, and live at Richmond—the prisoner Chant was my butler for about two months—he was under warning, and was to have left the week after the robbery—I had a rosewood dressing case, which I kept locked in my bedroom—it had a Bramah lock, and could not well have been broken open—I kept the key in my pocket—I saw it last on Tuesday, 4th February—I left in it three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, the numbers of which I have in my pocket, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, the number of which I cannot tell, because it was one of a series—this paper has the numbers of the notes upon it—it was written by me, not from the notes themselves but from a letter from Coutt's—I received three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from Coutt's, and I can swear number sixty-seven was in my case—I do not know the numbers by heart, I should have to look to tell you—I made this just after the robbery—I knew what I had, but I had not written it down—I know the series, I received them from Coutts's on the 14th January, in the morning, by post, in a registered letter—I also had five or six sovereigns in the case, and a cross and other articles—I did not personally miss the case till the Wedne</p>
