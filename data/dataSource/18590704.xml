I am a policeman—on 24th June I went to the prisoner at Mr. Acocks'—I found him employed there—I asked him to step outside, as I wanted to speak to him—I asked him, "Have you not some silk and worsted cord in your possession?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Step with me into the White Horse, the corner of Friday-street"—I there told him that Knight and I were two police-officers—Knight and Crook were there at the time—I asked the prisoner if he knew anything of the parcel, pointing to one which Knight held—he said, "Yes, I gave it to Crook to sell"—I asked him if he had any more like that—he said no, he had not—I asked him where he got that from—he said from a man who owed him some money—I asked him the man's name, and he said he did not know—I said, "Where does the man live?"—he said, "I believe he is gone to America"—I then told him I should take him in custody, and we should go and search his place—Knight then spoke to him, and he said, "I have the remainder at home"—he went with me and Knight to his residence in Shoemaker-row, and he took us to a box where Knight took out the rest of this cord in five bundles, and another parcel containing this fringe—I took the prisoner to the station, and at the station he said he had had it from Mrs. Maxall of Glasshouse-yard, Aldersgate-street—I made inquiries of Mrs. Maxall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am outfitter and military tailor of 42, Jermyn-street, and also of Leadenhall-street—I was in partnership with my son—he managed the Leadenhall-street business, and I that at Jermyn-street—the prisoner was my clerk at the Leadenhall-street establishment only—on 6th May the partnership between me and my son was dissolved, in consequence of which I determined to make an alteration in the mode of conducting the business, and on Saturday, 7th May, I called the prisoner into my private room at Leadenhall-street about 11 o'clock in the morning, and informed him that I was about making alterations in my establishment, and should require no further services from him after the Monday following, in consequence of my son dissolving partnership with me on that day, and that I should bring my clerk from Jermyn-street, Mr. Scott, on the following Monday to take his place, and would give him a month's salary in lieu of a month's warning—he seemed very much confused and made no reply—I said, "Have you any question to ask me?"—he said, "Have you any fault to find with me?"—I said, "None whatever," and, in a very excited manner, he said, "There is nothing that I would not do to serve you"—I told him that Mr. Scott would come on Monday, and I should require him to go over the ledger with Mr. Scott and myself, and to point out the good, bad, and indifferent debts, and also to inform him what letters had been written in respect of the accounts—the prisoner assented to come on</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040012"/>
               <p>an improved statement could throw no light upon it—I did not say "and my son would not give the accountant the particulars;" nothing of the kind—I said, "I repeatedly urged on my son the necessity of the accountant investigating the books to discover the error"—(this was at the interview on 7th May)—I do not recollect saying "My son objected, saying, he knew the books were correct, and the error must rest with the accountant"—I may have said something like it, but not that the error must rest with the accountant—I could not have said so with the knowledge I had of the accountant; I am sure I did not—I do not adhere to my answer that I might have said something like it—I did not say, "My son has been drawing about three times the amount of his share, and is a defaulter to an enormous amount," or anything with that import—I did say, "My son has overdrawn his account"—I did not say, "To an enormous amount"—I did not use the word "defaulter"—I did not go on to say, "I have been compelled, to save the house, to dissolve partnership;" nothing in the world like it—I did not tell him that as he did not know something of the military business I did not require him—I do not know whether he was paid his salary weekly—he said, "Mr. Nichols, during the time I have been in your employ have I ever given you cause to be dissatisfied with me?"—I did not answer, "Ever since you have been in this house your conduct has been most exemplary; you have been faithful, conscientious, honest, and everything which an employer could wish;" for I felt somewhat differently—I said that no doubt he would get a situation, but I said nothing about his talents—I did not say "I am very sorry to part with you, and had my son acted honestly with me you and he would both have been in the business now"—I never had the slightest reason to asperse my son—I believe I told the prisoner that I intended to discharge Hawkincloss the cutter—I do not think I said Sowerby the porter also—I did not say, "I do not like him; he has been very impertinent to me on several occasions, but you have always very willingly carried out any wish I have expressed"—I believe I did not say that I had determined on this course at Christmas, after the last balance sheet—I mentioned the amount I had expended on my house at Champion-hill, and assigned that as a reason—the conversation must have taken 10 minutes, or a quarter of an hour—it was a mistake when I said 10 minutes—my son and I balanced the accounts once a year—the prisoner and my son gave the items to me—the accountant made out a balance from my son's statement, which was furnished to him by the prisoner—the balance sheet will show the error on the wrong side—I found that out at Christmas, the year before last—there was an error for two years—I found out that my son had overdrawn by his stating it to me in his interview—he told me that since Christmas he had had about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than he was entitled to—I do not recollect the sum—he had not overdrawn his share, but he had overdrawn what he was allowed to draw—he said nothing about drawing more than he ought up to Christ<lb/>mas: the balance sheet shows that no balance sheet has been made since Christmas, none was made at the time of the dissolution—he had drawn very likely about 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, but he was entitled to more than that—there was a sum of money due to him—we balanced, or took stock, at Christmas 1857, and it was on the face of the balance sheet that he had drawn about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than our partnership deed entitled him to draw—I never heard that he gave directions that the debts, good, bad, and indifferent, should be entered as good; it is impossible—the deficiencies are not made up—I found out the errors by the balance sheet, which proved a deficiency somewhere;</p>

               <p>each Christmas, when it was put it into my hands; I, could not tell in what way—I only got it from the balance sheet—I examined none of the books but my private ledger—the others were entirely under the prisoner's control—my son left them to him—my son was master there, and had the control of everything—he had a key to the safe in which the books were kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now managing my father's business in Leadenhall-street—up to 6th May last we were in partnership—I had been principally managing the firm in Leadenhall-street—the prisoner was employed there as clerk and book-keeper—his salary commenced at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, then it was 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and then 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was his duty to keep all the books—he had charge of all the books—he did not make entries in the "bought" ledger—I did not keep it; it was kept with the other books—I made the entries in it—in the ordinary course of his duty he ought not to take any of the books off the premises—there was an iron safe for the purpose of keeping the books; it was kept in a private room—the prisoner had a key of it—I had the other key—there were only two keys—it was the prisoner's duty to put the books away—in the day-time all the persons in the establishment would have access to the books; they had no oppor<lb/>tunity of getting to them when placed in the safe—there are some books which still remain safe and unmutilated; they have no reference to the money accounts—the day-book and order-books have not been touched—the prisoner kept the ledger entirely, and he kept the cash-book on one side; I mean he entered all the monies received, I entered all the monies paid—there were money-lent books for entering the sums of money advanced to young midshipmen and others coming home, and who sign their name under the amounts—the money lent-books were exclusively dedicated to that part of the business, to monies advanced by us—there was also a petty cash-book to enter small payments and disbursements—the prisoner kept that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040014"/>
               <p>book—the last petty cash-book in use was a long, narrow, white book, that had been in use from January last; the book in use before that was a short, thick, red book with a clasp to it—on the receipt side of those books he used to enter all small sums he received in the way of ready money sales; and on the payment side he would enter all little sums of money for petty cash matters, or sums of money which he had charged in the money-lent book—if 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been advanced to a midshipman it would appear as due to the firm in the money-lent book; it would also appear as a credit to him on the payment side of his petty cash-book—no one had access to the two last named books except the prisoner; he kept them entirely—those books were the property of the firm; I am able to speak to that positively; the last petty cash-book was bought by the prisoner, and charged for in his monthly cash, and allowed by us—in the ordinary course of business the money accounts were made up at the end of every month and submitted to me; if I found the entries in the book corresponded with the columns of payments or advances made by the prisoner, I initialled them as correct—if I found in his petty cash-book 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced to A.B. and also entered in the money lent-book, I initialled it as correct—I sometimes made entries in the money-lent book—in the ordinary course of things no one but the prisoner did so—in the great majority of cases it was the prisoner that made the entries—I occasionally made entries when it was a large sum of money—when I posted the advances from the money-lent books I posted the total amount, to the debtor and creditor cash-book, the monthly total—this is the book in which he entered on one side, and I the other (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner posted the accounts included in these different books to the ledger—he kept the ledger altogether—there is also a book called the rough red cash-book—that is only for receipts, money received from credit customers—we should treat a cheque as cash and enter it as such—either the prisoner or I generally kept the rough red cash-book—on Saturday, 7th May, I saw the prisoner engaged with some of the books—I saw him using the ledger the last thing that afternoon, about half-past 4—I was standing by the desk a few minutes—he was going over the ledger, carefully turning over the leaves—I saw no mutilation in the ledger at that time—I had not any occasion to look into the ledger that day, any more than observing him using it when I was at the desk—to the best of my knowledge it was not mutilated; I could not swear it—the prisoner made no complaint, nor did he call my attention to its being mutilated; he did not say a word—as far as I know it was not mutilated then—I made an entry in the cash-book that afternoon, about 1 o'clock—I can say that the cash-book was safe at that time—I made an entry of the wages—On 3rd of 4th May I went through the April account with the prisoner—at that time all the cash-books I have mentioned were safe—I left on Saturday, the 7th, about half-past 4, or quarter to 5—the prisoner was then in the office—I left him with the ledger—I went to the office on Monday morning, about half-past 10—at that time the prisoner was not in the office—Mr. Scott the new clerk had come to go over the books—the missing books were searched for; the others were all out when he came—we could not find them—the first book that we missed was the cash-book, and afterwards the other books were missed one after the other, the red cash-book, the three money-lent books for the years 1856-57-58 and the two petty cash-books—I did not examine the state of the ledger—Mr. Scott found that out in the afternoon when he wanted to make an account out; he called my attention to it—that was about 3 o'clock—the state of the debt-book was found out the same day, it was mutilated,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040015"/>
               <p>and so was the ledger—I think the state of the ledger was found out before the debt-book—the debt book contained a list of the debts taken out of the ledger every 3 months by the prisoner—from the debt-book in the ordinary course letters or bills are sent to the debtors—about 20 folios were cut out of the debt-book; out of the last list made on 1st January—there are about 70 folios cut out of the ledger (<hi rend="italic">books pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—this is the ledger—some leaves are left in loose—the folios are missing from different places—in one place they are missing from 361 to 374—about 73 folios are gone altogether—a folio is one side of a leaf—the 73 folios missing begin with folio 2 up to 372—the folios missing from the debt-book are not consecutive, but cut out in the same manner—the names are not entered alphabetically, but with reference to the folio in the ledger; without the missing folios we could not tell what the reference was—since I saw the petty cash-book last in use the leaves have been cut out to the end of April—I cannot say what proportion of the book has gone—the leaf I that remains is the settlement of the last month on one side—there was an account in that book from January up to that date; that has disappeared—I spoke to the prisoner on the Saturday afternoon as I was leaving, I told him to get the cash accounts ready by Monday morning, and we would take them first before we went through the ledger with the new clerk—that would be the cash account from 30th April down to the date of the prisoner's leaving—he has not paid over or accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received by him after 30th April—he has not accounted to me for any money received after 30th April; that was the account he was to render to me on the Monday morning. I have examined some papers that were found by the witness Richards in the water-dose, those were the "money-lent" books—I saw Richards take them out of the water-closet, I think on the Thursday after the prisoner had left on the Monday—the water-closet was choked, and it was in consequence of that that it was examined—they are portions of the money-lent books of 1856 and 1857 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been speculating on the Stock-exchange? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know whether I am bound to answer any question of that sort; some few months only; I began last autumn, I think in October or September, 1858—I had bought some shares and different things before that, if you call that speculating; I paid for them—I don't recollect the date when I first bought any shares—I don't know the year; I swear that—I can't recollect whether it was 1856 or 1857, it was one or the other—I said I began in autumn last because you asked me when I began specu<lb/>lating; by speculating I understand "time bargains"—I began the time bargains last autumn, that was the first; I swear that positively—I had bought railway shares before that—I don't know whether I did not have some time bargains before last autumn—I have had some small time bar<lb/>gains—I told you I began these small time bargains in 1856 or 1857—I had very little to do at that time—I did speculate in 1856 and 1857—I did not carry it on since then—I have succeeded in some speculations and lost in others—the general balances have been against me, not to a large amount—I have not got any amounts made up and cannot tell—I don't know the amount at the present time—I cannot tell you the amount of my losses; I have not paid all of them; I don't know the amount of my liabilities upon them—I have not had any account from the party I do business with; that is, this last account—I cannot give you any notion of the amount for; 1856 or 1857—I owe nothing for that time—I don't recollect how much I have paid, or what I have lost—I can't tell you whether it was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,</p>

I don't know—I left the onus on the broker to pay the difference—I was called on to pay and did not—the broker is carrying it on now—I have not troubled my head about how much he has had to pay—it is his place to apply to me, and he has not done so—I don't know how much stock I had open altogether, perhaps some 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—it was not 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I will not swear that it was not beyond 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my broker is Mr. Merton, of Bartholomew-lane, he is a broker's clerk—he does it on his own account—I do it through him—brokers' authorized clerks can go on the Stock Exchange—I should say it was not the clerk who was let in for my liabilities—I can't tell you who it was—I don't know their system, or the ins and outs of their business—the broker has not called upon me to pay—I swear that—I have not told him to close my account—I do not know whether the account is open now—according to the present state of the market I am a loser, not a heavy loser—I told my father I was a heavy loser—that was the reason the partner-ship</p>

               <p>was dissolved—I told you that my losses at that time were about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>: more or less—I did not tell my father that—there was not a deficiency on the balance-sheet from the first time of my becoming a partner—the two first years, '54 and '55, the balance was right—it came wrong when we had a change, and different parties in the place—I don't recollect whether that was in '56—there was a small deficiency the first 2 years—there was a deficiency in the '56 or '57—I don't recollect how much without the book—there was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency in the last account, or the account before, I believe—I believe it was in '58—I did not make out the balance-sheet.; an accountant did—he did it from what I or the clerk communicated to him—the clerk gave him most of the amounts—he did not look over the books—the last balance-sheet was made up in December last—Mr. Tyler, of the firm of Goodehap and Tyler, was the accountant—by the clerk, I mean the prisoner—the items were written down for the accountant, and from those he made up the balance-sheet—the accountant wanted to have the books—we did not let him have them—we did not think it necessary—I said I did not think it was usual—I did not think it was necessary for him to keep the books—I did not say that he should never look over them—he has never looked over the cash-books—he has gone through them, not inves<lb/>tigated them—I think it was in '57 that he looked over them—he did not look over the books to make up the balance-sheet of '58—I have no recol<lb/>lection of his asking to do it—I said it was not customary to have accountants to do our books for us, I considered we ought to be able to do our own books—I considered I could keep the books—I believe there was a deficiency of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in '57 or'58—the clerk and I tried to find out how it was, several times; we went through the books—that was not the prisoner; he was not there—we have had two or three clerks—one was named Dickens—that was before the prisoner came into the service—there was not a defi<lb/>ciency of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in '58—it was between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. end 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the books will show—I think the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency was the year before—I have no doubt, in order to find out that deficiency, I went over the books, but I can't recollect now—I did not go over the books with the accountant—the prisoner went over his portion, and I went over mine—I did not find out the cause of the deficiency—the accountant had figures given to him, and he made the balance from that—I told my father I could not see any good from the accountant's going through the books—I did not know of the deficiency before the accountant had made out the balance-sheet—I had no means of telling—I only furnished him with the amounts of cash, he put the different figures together—the prisoner and I were in the habit of settling every month—he was in the habit of paying out petty sums, and sometimes there was a balance against him at the end of the month—he, added up what he had paid and received, and I paid him the balance—I do not know that he was in the habit of making advances of petty cash from his own money—it was very seldom that there was any balance due to him—I never said to him, "If my father asks you what money has been received this month do not tell him"—I kept a petty cash-book in my private drawer—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it belongs to the firm, certainly—all the entries relate to the firm—it has some entries copied into it from the other petty cash-book at the prisoner's dictation—all the disbursements of petty cash relating to the firm are not entered from this book into the other, they are entered into the cash-book—it is only the small items, such, as omnibusses and little articles, that are entered here—this was kept in my drawer, locked—it was the only book I had to keep, and I kept it locked up,</p>

               <p>because there was no occasion for other parties to have it—I did not say to the prisoner, "If my father asks you how much money has been received do not tell him: if he wants to see the cash-books, say they are in my private drawer, and I am out and have got the keys;" nothing of the kind he and I used to take out the amounts from all the books—I gave him the amount of cash at the banker's and in hand; any drawing by the partners during the year, and any other disbursements not charged in the cash-book, such as rents and taxes—the cash-book was balanced every month—I wrote down my own amounts—I kept the banking account, drew the cheques, and had the sole management of the money—I took the account of the money that I wrote down at the time, and gave it to the accountant—I desired the prisoner at the annual balancing to put down all debts, good, bad, and indifferent, not as good, but as debts—there was no dis<lb/>tinction made, so that they would appear on the face of the books to be good—they were not all good—the distinction was not to be made, because some of our customers are out at sea—some debts were actually bad—I desired him to enter them in one sum, to make no distinction, because without the consent of my partner I was not justified in writing off any man's debt as good or bad—my father knew in balancing the accounts what were good and what were bad from my telling him—I told him that a great portion of these were bad; I believed from 2 to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not in one year—I cannot say how much in one year—the object of that was not that I might receive a larger share of the profits;—I should be entitled to a larger share if the thing was wound up or sold off-this is the debt book from which the leaves have been torn out; it is in the prisoner's writing—the debts would be rather more than 5 or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the year, on which amount there would be quite 5 or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bad—there was no object in the prisoner giving more than the total amount of debts here; he gave me the amount on paper—I knew the distinction between good, bad, and indifferent debts; they are all marked in the ledger.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I do not think any division of profits has ever been squared up yet. The accountant computed profits and all that; he made the balance sheet up from the figures which I gave him—I have talked these deficiencies over with my father—he might have asked me as a partner to get the accountant to go over the books to find them out; he did not desire me.</p>

               <p>proposition made to the accountant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came once a month to go through the books; he was paid for it, and that was what I objected to—I did not refuse to allow him to look at the books when he was making up the balance sheet; my father never asked to look at the books, he left all to me—on my solemn oath I have never concealed anything from my father in reference to the firm—this cash-book was kept entirely by me—I paid the wages—it was my book and had reference to the business of the firm—it was for my information and guidance—this "C. B." means "Cash book;" being my book it was kept in my private drawer, and the prisoner had nothing to do with it—I employed Mr. Merton, who is a stockbroker's clerk, but generally without paying him money—I bought some Turkish stock, I don't recollect the amount; it was the new loan 6 percent.; it has fallen and risen twenty times since I bought it; it had fallen just before I dissolved partnership in April—I have owed Mr. Merton money once or twice; I cannot recollect the dates; it was all this year—on finding that the prices of this stock made me a loser in April, I told my father what had happened; I also moved out of my house, and went into lodgings, and reduced my expenditure—all my accounts are settled for 1856 and 1857, and I do not owe a farthing in respect of any transaction then—I am enabling myself to pay Mr. Merton what he has been called upon to pay for me by reducing my expences; it would not make a farthing difference to me, whether the debts were treated as good, bad, or indifferent, only in the case 6f winding up the partnership; then we should take the bad debts off—I think 10 per cent, was allowed by the accountant for bad debts; there were no deficiencies until there was a change of servants—the prisoner was one of the persons who then came into the service, and he had the exclusive care of the books from the time he came—the balance sheets were made up from March, 1854, to March, 1856, and there was a deficiency of a few pounds; we then changed to Christmas—I drew the checks; all the checks for the business appear in the books—I have never drawn money which my father did not afterwards know of; he did not require to know it before—I have given him an account of everything I have taken out of the firm—I have stolen nothing—I had nothing to do with secreting and mutilating the books—I have never had any ill-feelings against or quarrel with the prisoner—I have always been on good terms with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective city office—I took the prisoner, on 10th May about half-past 8 o'clock, in Lorrimer-road, Walworth, about one hundred yards from his own house—a constable was with me—I had received information the night previous—I told him we were police officers; that we arrested him on the charge of stealing a cash book, and some leaves out of a ledger, belonging to his employers, Messrs. Price and Co., of 11, Leadenhall-street—he said he knew nothing about it—I told him it would he necessary to search the house—he said, "Very well; but am I to consider myself in custody"—I said, "Yes"—I then took him and went with Allen to search the prisoner's house—when in the front parlour, I asked him where the books were that he had brought from the firm on Saturday night—he said, "Which do you mean? I brought none away; but two were brought away by the lad belonging to the firm, and I think one is up stairs"—we went up stairs to a room on the second floor—the prisoner took us up, and we looked about, and in a minute or two, not being able to find them, he said that they must be down stairs—he called down stairs to his wife, describing a book, and she afterwards brought up one which has been produced, which the prisoner handed to me in the same state as it is now, with these leaves torn out—I said, "Some leaves have been torn out, what have you done with them?"—he said, "I have torn them up, it is only my own petty cash book"—I asked him for the other book, he said that he burnt that on Sunday morning; this being Tuesday morning—we went down into the kitchen where his wife was—I spoke about the other book, and the prisoner asked his wife with respect to it, describing it as a book with a red cover and a clasp—she replied," You burnt that yesterday evening"—he put it as a question to her, "What did I do with that book, or did I not burn that book?"—I saw some flakes of burnt paper on the hearth.</p>

Mrs. Clarke is a native of Lyme Regis, Dorset; daughter of the late James Baker, and related to John Baker, boot and shoemaker of Coombe-street, and maternally related to John Harding, a butcher, of Bridge-street, in that town; having a knowledge of J. Philpott's, Esq. family for many years, Mrs. Clarke is induced to hope he will add his signature to the memorial, to enable her to procure the boy's admission on to-morrow, that being the day of admission. The Rev. Thomas Ainger has taken more than usual interest in this case, having known the family during their residence in this parish, and hopes the motives which prompt him in thus addressing J. Philpott, Esq. will plead some apology. P.S. Mrs. Clarke begs to mention the names of a few individuals in Lyme, known to her family"—followed by a number of names.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you tell me the letters on the notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—we always enter the dates—I don't know the amount of Mr. Castrique's account at the bank during the last year—it is a considerable account—I should not call some hundreds a considerable account; I should some thousands—after his bankruptcy he paid the bank what he considered was owing by him—I don't know how long he has banked there—I believe he bears a good character as a man of business—I know that the bank discounts for him con<lb/>tinually.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are quite certain of all those words he used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes, because the point turned on when he received the money—Mr. Twynam was called, and the Judge said that as the plaintiff could not prove that the defendant had received any money, there was no case.</p>

               <p>conclusion—I think the account was sent in after the countermand—I have been with Mr. Watson about two years—he has been employed by Mr. Fisse—my impression is that he went away in November—I know that he had absconded and fresh notice of trial was given—I have not my call book with me—Mr. Watson is not professionally a bill discounter; he may do it for a friend.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Widmore, of 12, Robin Hood-court, Long-lane—on 4th June the policeman passed me in the court, and I saw two men and women by the milk-shop, using bad language—I had never seen them before, but one had a white jacket, something similar to that (<hi rend="italic">Dennis's</hi>)—the other one spoke coarsely—the policeman told them to move on—I saw the policeman struck to the ground by a blow from one of them, I cannot say which, and when he was on the ground they kicked him—I said, "Do you intend to do for the man; do you intend to murder him right Out"—they ran away, and said that I knew them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 278). I received information on Sunday morning, in consequence of which I took Bryant in custody—I took Dennis at the bottom of Holborn-hill, Victoria-street—I told him I charged him on suspicion of being one of two men who assaulted a constable the night previous—he said, "What time was it?"—I said, "A little past 12"—he said, "I was in bed at 9, and have not been out since till now"—I took him to the hospital, to the ward where Bennett was lying, and asked him if he knew this man—he said, "That is one of the men who assaulted me, he is the man who struck the first blow"—he said that he knew nothing of it, and I took him to the station—on the following Tuesday, 7th June, I took the other prisoner in Union-court, Holborn-hill, where they both live—I told him he was charged on suspicion of assaulting the constable Bennett, with his brother, on the Saturday night previous—he said, "I was on Holborn-hill about 10 minutes past 12, but saw nothing of the assault"—I took him to the station, and from there to the hospital, and asked Bennett if he knew him—he said, "Yes; that is one of the men who assaulted me"—the prisoner said that he did not know him, but Bennett said that he knew him well—I have known the prisoners for a long time—David has rather a peculiar hoarse voice; he speaks through his nose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why did you say to Dennis, "I charge you on sus<lb/>picion?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was no witness to the assault, and there are other Dennis Bryants besides him—Bennett did not tell me where Dennis Bryant lived—I acted on information entirely, and his description answered that given to me—I had seen a description of David also—I did not go to his house—I knew I should have him soon, and it is dangerous for one man, to go to a costermonger's; we sometimes get pelted out with brickbats—I was instructed to take him when I met him, and I got the assistance of another constable and took him—I do not know another David Bryant, but there are a number of Bryants in the court—I charged him on suspicion—I had seen Bennett; he knew Him by the name of Riggan—I have known the prisoners for 18 months or 2 years—they have been repeatedly under my observation—I have seen David at the police-court—he was not acquitted; he got a month—it was for assaulting the police—I did not go to the house with a staff of police—if I had done so, and had not found him, it would have put them on the alert, and he would not have been seen again for 2 or 3 months.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 276). I have known Dennis eight months—I saw him in Union-court on Saturday night, June 4, about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock, with his other brother, not David, under a gas-lamp—I got to the top of the road, heard a rattle spring, and met Shepherd with a rattle, who gave me information—there was time for Dennis to have got from where I spoke to him to where I heard the rattle springing; it was on the other side of the road—I then went into the court, and saw four men carrying Bennett, who was insensible—I afterwards went to the hos<lb/>pital and Bennett said "Dennis Bryant and Regan <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done this"—when Manning relieved me at 6 next morning, I told him who the men were who</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040039"/>
               <p>had committed the assault—when I saw Dennis and his other brother in Union-court they were coming in a direction towards Holborn-hill, running into the court as I was going out—they live about five yards down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go from Holborn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is always my beat—I did not speak to them as I came down, because I did not know that an assault had been committed—I have seen the other brother since—I saw Dennis at a 1/4 past 10, and met him in the court again at 10 minutes past 12—I saw David before, but not afterwards—it is not more than 100 yards from the court where I saw them conversing to where I met the prisoners—they were walking, but appeared out of breath—I did not see them run at all—it was not a policeman who was springing the rattle, it was Shepherd who had got a rattle out of a policeman's pocket.</p>

I am a sail-maker, and live at 5, Hope and Anchor-alley, St. George's East—I was there upon the night of 23d June—the first that I saw of this was the prosecutor coming out of No. 4—he said to Mr. Duncan, "You had better go into the shop and look after your wife; while you are here she may have some one with her"—the husband then said to the prosecutor, "You are drunk, man," and he said he could excuse him because he was drunk—Bullen then said to the woman, "I can get you any time for half-a-crown; I have known you at Wapping"—she then said to her husband, "What does he mean, George?" and he said, "That he has had connexion with you"—she then took off her own shoe and beat him over the head—her house is opposite to 4 and 5—the husband then inter<lb/>fered and they had a fight, and they fell upon a scraper of the step, and the blood came from Bullen's forehead—they then got fighting again—I did not see Mrs. Duncan go into the house—I should have seen her if she had gone—she did not strike a blow after the second fight—I saw the blood after the first fight—the police came up afterwards—I saw Tremble there when the fight was over—I did not see him come up—I did not see anybody go into Duncan's house—I stayed at my own door—it was about 2 o'clock in the morning—I know that the police went into Duncan's house about twenty minutes afterwards—I heard that they went in for the husband—I saw Mrs. Duncan afterwards at her own house—that was after the police went in—they locked the door.</p>

I have endeavoured to get Fanny Bates here, but cannot—she was not before the grand jury—I was sent to the hospital for her on the night of 28th—she was in the hospital—I saw a wound upon her; it was a cut on the right side of the cheek—I brought her to the police-station, where the prisoner was—in his pretence she said, "That is the man that <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it;" and he said, "Yes, I stabbed her with a shoemaker's knife, and I threw the knife away after I had done it"—I am sure he said that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On Tuesday, 28th, I was working till half-past 8. I used to live in Clerkenwell; but I removed from there to get out of the way of my wife. I got fresh work. On this night I had to go to Clerken-well; I called at my wife's sister's house—I rang the bell—a man came up and said, "If you come to my house again, I will give you in charge". I went there on Sunday again, and asked the landlady if Mrs. Bates lived there—she said, "Yes." The man then came up and asked me what I wanted, and said if I came there again he would give me in charge. My wife, as I was going away, blackguarded me. I felt very exasperated. I have a letter here which I wrote to my cousin about her. I did not strike her with a knife; it was a nail which had been sharpened. My wife has been living with another man from the time I left her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk in the Bank of London, the Strand branch—on 22d November, 1858, the prisoner came to the bank and produced this deposit receipt to me for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she spoke to one of the cashiers and I came forward—she wished the money to be paid to her—I said it was in her husband's name, and on that she went away taking the deposit note with her—in a day or two afterwards she came again and produced this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said she had come for the money as her husband could not come, and she had brought her husband's cheque—I don't recollect the exact words—she said it was her husband's cheque—and she had brought it according to my wish—I said it was rather unusual to pay anyone but the depositor—she said she was Mrs. Bryant, and she produced some letters—we did not perhaps take that precaution which we ought to have done; and we paid her on her producing this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I caused it to be paid, and she signed her name on the back.</p>

I am an attorney at Pimlico—I know George Bryant, and have seen him write many times—I should say that this signature to this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not his writing—there is a similarity, but I should say it is not his—I don't think it is his—the signature to these cheques for the interest are his—this signature in the bank book is his, certainly—decidedly it is—all his signatures which are genuine have the name "George Bryant" written in full, and this signature to the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque has "G.

Captain Capello told me that he was, my master, because Berto had sold ma to him; I don't know how much he paid for me. I was more than a year in Captain Capello's service, but he never gave me any pay, nor did I ever sign or make any agreement as a seaman. Captain Capello brought me against my will in a ship to England, which ship was burnt at Yarmouth, in England; and I was brought to London, put on board another ship, and taken to Genoa, where Captain Capello wanted to sell me, but no one would buy me. I was then taken back to Africa, and brought again to England. When the ship arrived, I told Captain Capello that I would not go again to Genoa, and begged him to put me on board a man-of-war, that I might be free and learn English. He sent me on board the Hospital-ship, where I told one of my countrymen I was a slave. From this I was sent to a house on shore, where I met another of my countrymen, whom I told I would no longer be a slave, but work and get wages. After this, I was taken to another place, where I was made to work; but I told them I would not be a slave any longer; and I was told that if I worked they would give, me clothing and money, but they gave me nothing but food, and wanted me to go to some other place, and so many people were sent after me I thought they wanted to take me to burn me, so I shut myself up, and then got out of the window on to the top of the house. When I was seized I had a knife in my hand; and whatever I did it was in self-defence. I never intended to hurt any man. <hi rend="italic">"The above statement was taken through an interpreter, Miss. M. B. Servano, a native of Yorubah, and educated in England, and was handed by the prisoner as his defence."</hi>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the Post-office—the prisoner has been employed there about seven years—he was a clerk in the same office—he was employed on Sunday evenings in the sorting tender, in the Cambridge Railway—he went on the tender on Sunday evening and returned the next morning—it was his duty to open the mail-bag and sort the letters—in consequence of complaints I made up a letter on Saturday, 25th June, which enclosed 2 half-sovereigns and some postage-stamps—the card was put in the letter and the postage stamps round it—the coins were stuck in a slit in the card, and the whole put in a letter and fastened down with gum—the letter was directed to the Rev. William Smythe, the Rectory, Midhurst—I took the letter and posted it at the Romford Post-office, about 4 o'clock, on 25th June—I also posted another letter addressed to Tunbridge Wells—they would both go the same day—I communicated with Mr. Dixon about these letters—they would leave the Post-office on the Sunday morning—on the arrival of the Cambridge train, on Monday morning, the 27th, I found the letter to Tunbridge Wells, but not the one to Midhurst; that contained the money—it was the prisoner's duty to be, on the Sunday evening, on the tender which goes down from London to Cambridge—he would be on the tender about 1/2 past 8 o'clock, going towards Cambridge—I looked for the letter addressed to the Rev. Mr. Smythe in the Cambridge bag, and could not find it—the bag was sealed in the ordinary way—there was a letter-bill made up by the prisoner—the person who sorts the letters signs the bill, and that bill was signed by the prisoner—the prisoner re<lb/>turned about 5 o'clock, on the Monday morning, and after he had been there about an hour, I took him into a private room, and asked him if he had performed duty, at the Cambridge sorting-tender on the last evening—he said "Yes"—I said that I had been informed that a money-letter, addressed to Midhurst, had been sent in one of his bags, and I asked him if he knew anything about it—he said he did not—I asked him if he had re<lb/>ceived such a letter, what he would have done with it—he said he would have returned it in his bag—I said, "It has not arrived; how would you account for that?"—he said it should have arrived, and he could not account for it—I asked him if he would allow the officer to see whether he had it in his pocket—he said, "Yes," and the officer, Bingham, searched him, and took from his-pocket a sovereign, 4 half-sovereigns, some silver, and 12 postage-stamps—I looked at the 4 half-sovereigns, and found amongst them the two that I had put in the letter, and which I had marked; and I found my marks upon the postage stamps also—these are the 2 half-sovereigns, and these are the postage stamps—I told the prisoner that these 2 half-sovereigns had been enclosed in the letter I had just asked him about, and I asked him where he got them—he said, "In the tender; I found them in the bag"—I asked him where he got the postage-stamps—he said, "The postage-stamps I also found in the same bag"—that money and stamps were the property of the Postmaster-General—I spoke to the prisoner about the bag being sealed—he said the bag was properly tied and sealed.</p>

Mr. Smythe, Midhurst—it contained something, and was securely fastened—I had seen that letter made up at the Post-office in the morning, by Mr. Gardner—I made up a bag for Cambridge, and in consequence of instructions I placed those two letters in the bag for Cambridge in the up journey, on Sunday morning—there were other letters in that bag—I came with that bag up to London, and in due course that bag would be taken to the Post-office about 5 o'clock in the morning—that Cambridge bag was tied and sealed by me before it was sent to the Post-office—it was put in another large bag, and sent by George Buck to the Post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 20, High-street, Hoxton—my mother, Frances Martindale, lives at the Broadway, at Plaistow, in Essex—up to 22nd May, I had a cash-box in a drawer at my mother's house, which contained 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, some silver spoons, and other articles—it was in the middle drawer, in the sitting-room on the ground-floor—my sisters, Ann Martindale, and Susan Martindale, lived there with my mother, who is an invalid, and has been paralysed fourteen years—my sister Susan is here; Ann is not—on Monday, 23rd May, my brother, Edward Martindale, came and made a communication to me about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040058"/>
               <p>the loss of my money—I went to Plaistow, and the cash-box, and money, and the probate of a will, and the spoons were all gone—the prisoner married a niece of mine, and he has been in the habit of doing jobs for me at Hoxton—he came to clean knives and shake carpets—he was in the habit of going to the house at Plaistow; I have seen him there several times—he was familiar with the house, and knew who lived there, and the habits of my sisters—I am not aware that he knew I had any money there—he must have seen the cash-box—I did not see the prisoner as soon as I heard of the robbery, I did not see him till the Sunday afterwards—I sent for him several times, but he was gone to Southampton—on Sunday morning I sent for him, and he came to me—I said to him, "I suspect you of taking my cash-box"—I told him where it was; and I said, "I wish you to go down to Plaistow; there are two persons will swear to your being the young man that took my cash-box"—I said "This is a very pretty job that I have lost my cash-box"—he said, "Well, I know nothing about it"—I said, "I wish you to go down to Plaistow"—he said if I liked he would go down—I wished him to go down because I said I suspected him of taking my cash-box—I saw him again, after sending for him two or three times, about 7 or 8 o'clock the same evening—I said, "You are a very good-for-nothing fellow"—he said I had better strike him—I said I did not wish to strike him; but I sent my servant for an officer and gave him into custody—I have not seen any of my property since.</p>

I am the wife of William Pateneall—he keeps a greengrocer's shop in the Broadway, Plaistow—I know the prisoner—I saw him enter the prosecutor's door on the 23d of May—I never knew him till I saw him enter the door—I saw him about half-past five o'clock—I was inside my shop, and saw him through my window—he was crossing the road—there was no one crossing the Broadway but him—he crossed over the road, and I saw him put his finger to his mouth, and then put it on the ground—he then rubbed it on the mortar between two bricks, and then marked his upper lip—I came to the door, and he turned round—he took off his black hat that he had on, and put on a light Scotch cap, and crossed the road, holding his hat behind him—I saw that the hat was lined with dark blue, having a gold flower in it—he walked into Mrs. Martiudale's house—I could not see his face after that—the hat was like this one (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—Mrs. Martindale's is just opposite my house—I was standing on the step of my</p>

I therefore look upon thee from this day forward as the partner of my days, and as a token there of I give thee my hearth and hand, and this lock of my hair, together with my handwriting, to remain with thee for ever. Whatever shall come to disturb us, this sacred promise is always to keep us faithful to each other; no matter what parents, friends or the world will say or do; and should we be separated for any time, or by any chance, we must always bear in mind this sacred promise of love and affection, never to be broken, which we have made this day, and correspond with each other if time and opportunity should permit; at the same time, I expect from thee that thou wilt make no acquaintance with any other man but me, that love thee; and if we have any cause to be offended in each other, we must at once reveal the mystery and make peace, always loving each other, if possible, as we now do; at the same time, we must not hear each other spoken ill of; that we must put each other on our guard against harm or slander, and keep our secrets from others. I humbly hope that this great vow will be kept unviolated; and any unconscious violation we both can forgive by confessing it to each other, otherwise the guilt shall be on the head of the offending party; riches nor anything under the sun must not cause any of us to violate this vow, which we have unanimously made this day, and ever may God bless our union.

I am a gentleman, residing at Woodland terrace, Green<lb/>wich—on the night of 21st June I retired to rest about 12 o'clock—I was disturbed about 3 o'clock in the morning—I heard a noise in my house, and opened the door to see what it was—I saw 3 persons standing on the landing outside—I had no weapon in my hand, and I rushed to the fire-place for the poker, and when I got back again they were rushing down stairs—from the glimpse I caught of them, the prisoner Thomas is very like the figure of one of them—on examining my house, I found that the back door had been opened, and a quantity of property tied up ready to go away—in my wife's dressing-room there was a box opened, and a quantity of dresses and Shawls moved—there were 3 keys missing belonging to Mrs. Archer—these are the keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were safe the night before—there was a neckerchief lost; I do not identify it—this is the silver ornament (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was taken off the chimney-piece—my servant shut up the house—she knows whether it was properly secured—I found an instrument to open windows, and I found an old handkerchief on the top of the water-closet—if any one wanted to get in there, they would have to open the window—the water-closet door is always closed, it closes with a spring.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Harle, of 23 Trafalgar-row, Walworth-road—the prisoner and his wife lodged in our house—they occupied the first floor, and I occupied the lower floor—there was no one else lodging in the house—on Monday evening, 23d May, I came home between 8 and 9 o'clock—the prisoner was at home; his wife was not—he went out shortly afterwards—she came home to the best of my recollection about 10 o'clock—her mother and father came with her, and a little girl, a younger sister—they came into my room and asked if I would allow them to sit down and rest awhile; and they stopped there until half-past 1 in the morning—the prisoner did not come home again until after they were gone—in the meantime, the prisoner's wife left my room, and went up-stairs to her own room and fetched down a few things, some trinkets and clothes, and asked my permission to let them stay there until the morning, as she was afraid they would be sold to the brokers—(I had been informed when I came home between 8 and 9, that there was a broker in the house)—she had to break open the room door in order to get in—the brokers were not there then, they went away soon after I returned, about 9 o'clock—I heard the prisoner lock the door a few minutes afterwards, and he came down stairs and went out—no other person that I know of, had been in the house after the brokers went, before I heard the door locked—when the prisoner's wife came down with the trinkets, she remained in my room until the prisoner came home; that must have been about a quarter to 2—it was shortly after the mother and father had left—I had no clock in the house—the prisoner had a key; he could not get the key in the door and I went and opened it—he apologised for leaning against the door, and I said "I beg your pardon Mr. Moore, perhaps I have given you the wrong key"—he thanked me and went tip stairs—he came down again, knocked at the door, and asked me to give him a light—I went to do so—he came partly into the room, and my husband said, "Walk in Mr. Moore," and with that he saw his wife sitting on the sofa—he said, "Oh, are you here?"—she did not make any answer but looked round, and she was crying—he said, "Well, this will be the last night you will be here, and to morrow the children are going away where they will be taken care of," or, "well done by"—those were two children by his former wife who were living with the; mthey were then up stairs in bed in the back room; one is about</p>

               <p>twelve, and the other eight or nine—he then rather took me to task about the children, and asked why I had taken the unwarrantable liberty of putting them out of the room, and said, "To morrow I will pay you your paltry rent that I owe you"—there was a fortnight's rent owing at that time—he he asked who broke open the door, his wife answered," I did; who had a better right than your wife?"—he said, "A wife you are in every sense of the word"—he then said to my husband, "As to talking to you, you are a perfect fool; I am a worldly man, and a man such as you I could twist round my little finger and think nothing of"—he then went up stairs and shortly after he returned again, knocked at the door and said, "Mr. and Mrs. Harle, if you harbour my wife in your room this night, I consider you will be both worse than her"—he went up stairs and came down again shortly after, and said, "Mrs. Moore, your place is up stain; there is your room to go to, it is not likely I am going to sleep under the same roof and you sleeping in another person's bed while I am sleeping under the same roof; do you hear Mrs. Moore"—she said, "Yes, I will come"—he said, "If you give the preference to go and sleep at your mother's, I will escort you round there"—he then went up stairs—she made no answer to him—she said to me, "I am afraid to go round to my mother's"—he did not hear that—she followed him up stairs almost directly—I heard nothing more of them during the night; everything was perfectly quiet; we listened to hear—it must have been very near 3 o'clock when she went up stairs, it was break of day—I heard nothing more until I was awoke by Mrs. Moore patting me on the cheek—I think it must have been past 7 o'clock; I was hardly awake at the time—she said, "Good morning, I am so cold"—I was in bed—she was dressed—she staid about two minutes; whether she went up stairs or into the yard I don't know; she went to have a wash—in three or five minutes she came down stairs again and asked my permission to go and get a comb or brush to do her hair—she went into the front-parlour, and hearing the prisoner coming down stairs she popped into the back-parlour again, holding the door in her hand—she was scarcely a second in the front-parlour—he came and knocked at my door, saying, "Mrs. Moore come out of that woman's room, do you hear"—she said, "Yes, I will come"—he said, "Mrs. Harle if you harbour her there, I shall consider you are worse than her; do you hear, Mrs. Moore?"—she said, "Yes, I am coming;" and she went out and went up-stairs again—I suppose hardly three minutes elapsed before I heard her say, "Ah, do if you dare, "attended with an hysterical scream—and she came running down into my room with her hand to her back, saying, "Oh! my back" as well as she could speak—I took hold of her by the shoulder, sat up in bed, and said, "Has he hit you, dear?"—she said, "He has either <hi rend="italic">sticked</hi> or <hi rend="italic">kicked</hi> me"—I could not be sure of the word; her breath was almost gone, as if a heavy blow had taken it away—she had scarcely breath enough to speak—I went to rub her back and felt something very hot against my hand, and I looked and found it was smeared with blood—I immediately got out of bed—I was very much frightened—I advised her to go out and give the alarm, and call police, murder! and sent my children for Mr. Drew—the deceased went out of the room toward the stairs—I said, "Pray don't go that way, go out into the street and give the alarm"—she then went out at the street door, I don't know which way she went, I was putting on my clothes—I heard the little boy up stairs clap his hands together, and say, "Oh father, father, what will become of you" or "us?"—I won't be certain which it was, but I heard the child crying Bitterly—I</p>

               <p>heard nothing said in answer to that—as I was coming from the back-parlour door a man came upon my mat, and said, "Where is Moore?"—I said, "Up stairs"—that was the witness Frost, but I did not know him then—he went up stairs and stopped there five or ten minutes—the prisoner and he then went away together to the Nelson public-house, and I saw nothing more of the prisoner until he was in custody—he did not return to the lodging—I never heard them quarrel, particularly whilst they were in our house.</p>

               <p>when he came home that evening was "Who broke the door open?"—when he said she was a wife in every respect, it was said in a friendly sort of way, as if he meant of course she was his wife; that was how I took it—I did not think it meant that though she was his wife, she did not act like one towards him.</p>

               <p>prisoner's house—I found him in his room, standing in front of the fire-place—I said to him, "Bill, whatever have you been doing?"—he said, "Don't ask me no questions, Bill; I am parched with thirst; come and have some beer"—I said, "I am in my shirt and trousers"—he said, "Put on my coat and cap."—I did so, and we crossed the road into the Nelson public-house—when we got there neither of us had got any money, and we went right through the public-house into East-lane; Moore said, "I will go and get some money"—I said, "Very good, Bill; I will see you again presently;" I then left him and went home—he said nothing about himself and his wife as we went towards the public-house—as we were going to East-lane he said, they had had a row, and those were the only words that were used; I think we walked about 100 yards without any word being spoken; he said, "We have had a row"—he did not say who "we" were—I had said nothing to bring those words out—there may have been a word or two more said, but I do not recollect it, not thinking that the man had committed such an act—the word "wife" was not mentioned—all I had said to him previously was, "What have you been doing, Bill?" and when we came out of the public-house into East-lane, he said, "We have had a row"—I did not know at that time that the woman had been stabbed—I have seen a great deal of the prisoner's writing—the signature to this letter, attached to the depositions, is a very good resemblance of his—I should not like to swear to it—I believe it to be his.</p>

Q.</hi> Was it not immediately after you said, "What have you been doing?" that he said, "We have had a row? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, immediately after we passed through the public-house—when I said, "What have you been doing?" his answer was, "Bill, ask me no questions;" it was when we got through the public-house into East-lane that he said, "We have had a row;" that conveyed to my mind that he meant with his wife—seeing her bleeding at the mouth, I naturally thought it was like most men and wives" quarrels, and that he had been hitting her—I have known him twenty years—during the whole of that time he has borne the character of a well-conducted, peaceable man, and as good, affectionate, and kind a man, as ever walked England's ground, both to his two wives and his children—he was married to the deceased last November—I knew him in all his career, in his courting affairs with his first wife and also the last one—there was no better husband I am satisfied—he has on many occasions complained to me of his wife's habits—I have heard him speak to her as regards cautioning her against doing little acts with friends, as regards drinking and such as that—I have heard him say, "Sophy, I should like to see you abandon this society altogether; here is Mr. Frost I am sure will advise you for your good in every shape and form"—I have heard him speak to her to that effect five, six, or, I might say, a dozen times—at those times his language towards her was that of a gentleman, I considered, rather more kind in manner than I am—I believe him to be a truly affectionate husband—I never heard him say an unkind word to her, or ever address her in a harsh way—I have heard him speak to her about a young man named Yorke—he told me that he had caused him a deal of uneasiness in his mind—I heard him speak to her about him on one occasion—that was in the Rising Sun public-house in East-lane, four or five days before this occurrence; he said, "Sophy, this man causes a deal of trouble on my mind, I want to know candidly and honestly from you the truth of the matter?"—she replied, "Don't bother me about anything of the kind, Bill; don't talk to me about anything of the kind"—he said, "Well, my dear, we will have no more about that subject"—we had a</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I remember Mrs. Moore being brought there on Tuesday morning, about 9 o'clock—I examined her as soon as she was brought in—I observed an incised wound a little external to the inferior angle of the left blade-bone, about half or three-quarters of an inch in length—she had a great difficulty in breathing—she lived about seventy hours after she was brought to the hospital—she was in danger from the very first—she died on Friday, 27th May—I made a post-mortem examination—the wound had penetrated through the walls of the chest, and about half-an-inch into the lungs—the wound was undoubtedly the cause of death—about an inch or an inch and a half of the knife had penetrated—such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would cause the wound that I discovered.</p>

               <p>result of a mixture of ordinary sugar of lead and sulphate of zinc; in fact, when the two things are mixed together there is decomposition; not without the urine: with urine and some water—this "Embrocation to be rubbed on the back of the neck" is made of oil, ammonia, and urine: this third liquid, "The drops to apply to the ear affected," is potass, oil, and green oil—I received some bottles in a box enclosed in a newspaper with the seals unbroken—(<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Rousseau here identified a bottle which she had received from Edwards, and given to Inspector Young</hi>)—this is not the same ear injection; it is water, and there is no urine in it; I examined this one—(<hi rend="italic">Another bottle was here identified by Mrs. Rousseau, which was marked "To be-placed behind the ear with a piece of linen rag"</hi>)—this consists of the same materials, coloured with compound spirit of lavender and a little urine in it—this "Oil to be dropped in the ear" consists of potass, rape oil, and green oil, (<hi rend="italic">This was also identified by Mrs. Rousseau</hi>)—I also examined this bottle without a label; it was in the same package as the others; I don't know who it belonged to—I also examined some powder which consists of oxyde of iron—(<hi rend="italic">Produced and identified by Francis Thomas as his medicine, which was to be taken internally</hi>)—this is merely coloured water—those medicines containing urine would unques<lb/>tionably be most prejudicial to the ear, and this containing potass would be in all probability injurious; this containing acetate of lead would be injurious in a great many cases; they would cause irritation—the effect of the powder would be rather beneficial than otherwise.</p>

There are certain consti<lb/>tuents of urine; salts formed during decomposition which are easily recognised under a microscope; then the smell of putrid urine is easily recognised; it is a most objectionable ammoniacal smell; and again when you burn it, there is a peculiar smell, so that there is no difficulty in detecting it, and the acetate of lead and zinc makes no difference; that mixture tends to check the putrefaction a little, but still it goes on—urine is water which contains salts, and some acids; the salts are phosphate of soda, and chlorida of sodium, which is common salt, and there is sulphite, uric acid, and urea—the am<lb/>monia is only developed after decomposition—if some of these salts, the am<lb/>monia for instance, had been mixed with it, they would not produce the sour smell, they would not produce the phosphorous—in analysing I took some of the residue, evaporated it to dryness, and examined it under the microscope; but each of these things require a different mode of analysis—in analyzing the urine I evaporated it to dryness, and burnt it, and then I had the smell of burning urine developed; that test was completed when I burnt the residium, and after that I put some of the precipitate under the microscope, and found a sediment; I took a portion of that sediment, placed it under a microscope, and found phosphate of ammonia and magnesia; they are not to be found in any combination except in human urine; unless you go to a shop, and purchase it—if you liked you might go and buy the salts, and have them in combination, but those materials would not give you the smell; you would not get the smell without adding urine; ammonia would not do—I do not take snuff; some snuff is flavoured with ammonia, and some has been actually flavoured with putrid urine; I could tell if you would give it to me—I did not find uric acid, and lithic acid; those are not always constituents of urine in a deposit—I simply examined the sediment in which there was no uric acid, I might have fifty samples without finding it—I do not mean to tell you that urine is to be found without urea, but without</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040093"/>
               <p>uric acid—I saw in one a slight trace of ammonia and sulphurated hydrogen, that would produce hydro-sulphate of ammonia—I did not find that, but there is a specimen in the hands of another chemist—the sediments are pre<lb/>cipitates of sulphate of lead; sometimes that, coming in contact with hydro<lb/>sulphate of soda, would produce a black precipitate, but not always; it is a peculiarity rather; there is no law; it would be the ordinary result—I did not find that in what I examined; but the presence of the salts would inter<lb/>fere with that—that would be the effect added to the lead; the same added to the zinc would produce a white sediment—I did not find that—hydro<lb/>sulphate of ammonia throws down a black precipitate from all the solutions of salts of lead—from such mixtures as I have described, a clear liquid could he had without filtering, by just pouring off the super natant liquid without the sediment—you may get it clear by filtering, or by allowing a subsidence, and pouring it off—a bottle of this kind would be filtered in about three minutes—you get a smell in urine undergoing decomposition, without the sulphurated hydrogen and ammonia—I say that these solutions in which there is urine would be probably injurious—I have a large practice as a medical practitioner, but not as an aorist—I have never heard of urine being used—I do not know that persons use empirical remedies—I have heard of St. John Long and counter irritation—I have not a higher opinion of those who profess to cure special diseases than of the general surgeon—if a surgeon uses his head and judgment in the same way as the speciality doctors, he will treat diseases as well—speciality doctors are not called quacks, if they are qualified; we apply that term to the unqualified—St. John Long had a system of counter irritation—I believe he applied it to all diseases—I am acquainted with hydropathy and homoeopathy—I do not believe in either of them—there are many highly qualified men who practice both; not men of recognised skill and ability—I am not at liberty to mention names; but I have seen men do it merely as a way by which they can make money; not men of high reputation, men who have been educated; but not one of high qualification; not among those who recommend hydropathy and homoeo<lb/>pathy—under certain conditions, I think that a person professing either one or the other ought to be brought to that bar—I have known cases requiring active treatment where a verdict of manslaughter has been returned—I have heard of a medical practitioner being the victim of a verdict of manslaughter—in my opinion, the bottles containing urine would probably be injurious; the crystals would stick in the glands, and produce dreadful eruptions even in the bladder, much more in the ear, where it is sore; if they accumulate in the bladder, they form stones, and produce grevious diseases; but in certain states of the urine, you will have these little crystals floating about suspended, and they will remain attached to the inner coating of the bladder, and the person is forced to take medical advice to have that peculiar kind of gravel treated—it produces the same pain as any foreign substance in the bladder would—the inner lining of the bladder is not so sensitive as the sore surface of the ear—deafness is not produced by a sore surface of the ear; a thickening and accumulation of wax are one or two forms of it—I should not use a stimulated caustic, or irritant, for the ear, to give a more healthy action—I would not give an opinion upon that.</p>
