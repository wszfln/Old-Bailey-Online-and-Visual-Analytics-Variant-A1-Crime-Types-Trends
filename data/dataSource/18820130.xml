Patterson in Staining Lane—I saw Meek leave the warehouse on the 31st—I followed him to the cloak-room of the Ludgate Hill Station—I saw him give a ticket and obtain this parcel—he then took the train by the District Railway; I did the same; I followed him to St. James's Park Station, and to the Albert public-house in Victoria Street, Westminster, facing the Army and Navy Stores—he went into a private bar—I followed him in after a minute or two, and saw him sitting down, and Aldrich and Mackintosh, and another person whom I do not identify—Meek had this parcel open, and Mackintosh appeared to be examining its contents—when I entered Meek doubled up the parcel—there was some conversation going on between him and Mackintosh, which I did not hear—I heard Meek say," I will bring</p>

               <p>them up on Monday in my dinner-hour about 1 o'clock"—Aldrich said, "What is the use of saying 1 o'clock? it is generally a quarter to 2 before you get here"—Meek said," Well, say 2 o'clock"—there was a little more conversation, which I did not hear—I saw Mackintosh take some money from his trousers pocket, count it, and give it to Meek—Mackintosh then took up the parcel, put it under his arm, shook hands with Meek and Aldrich, and walked out of the house—I went out shortly afterwards, and saw Mackintosh and Allen in conversation together in Victoria Street—Allen was carrying another parcel, which was ultimately found to contain a coat; it had on it the address of Mackintosh, Army and Navy Stores—"I followed them about 300 yards, having in the mean<lb/>time got the assistance of another officer—I then said to Mackintosh, "I am a police<lb/>officer; what have you got in that parcel?"—he said," Handkerchiefs"—I said," What handkerchiefs?"—he said, "Silk handkerchiefs"—I said," Where did you get them from?"—he said, "I bought them of a friend of mine in the Albert public-house"—I said," What did you give for them?"—he said," I decline to tell you, "or" I won't tell you"—I said," Do you know the lad you bought them of?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "What is his name?"—he said, "Meek"—I said," Doyou know where he works?"—he said," Somewhere in the City"—I said, "Do you know where he lives?"—he said, "It" is at Richmond somewhere, I don't know where; I frequently buy them in this public-house"—I then said to Allen, "What have you got in that parcel?" alluding to this one—he said, "It belongs to him," pointing to Mackintosh—Mackintosh said, "It is a coat of mine, I have been measured for it"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "It was sent to the stores where I am employed, and I brought it out with me when I left at 2 o'clock"—I said to Allen "Where did you get it?"—Allen said "I met him, and he asked me to hold it for him"—I said to Mackintosh "You did not have it in the public-house"—he said "No, he was holding it for me outside"—I then said I should take them both into custody on the charge of having possession of this property supposed to be stolen—Mackintosh said "I received them, but I did not know they were stolen"—Allen said "I know nothing about them at all"—I ultimately examined the parcel; it contained five boxes, containing 83 handkerchiefs, some of which I produce—I took them to Rochester Row Station—I had allowed Meek and Aldrich to go away—at the station Barrell, a constable, spoke to me, and took some handkerchiefs from Allen, and a muffler, which he gave me in Allen's presence—I searched Mackintosh, and found on him a muffler which he was wearing similar to that found on Allen, and five other handkerchiefs in his pocket, one new one, the others had been used—some others were afterwards given up by Mackintosh—on Monday, 2nd January, I went to the Army and Navy Stores in Victoria Street; I there saw Addrich—I said to him "I am a police officer, I have a lad named Meek in custody charged with stealing a large number of silk handkerchiefs in the City, and two other men named Allen and Mackintosh charged with receiving them at the Albert public-house on Saturday afternoon, about 3 o'clock; Meek has made a statement that concerns you; what do you know about the hand<lb/>kerchiefs?"—Aldrich said" I will tell you the whole truth, sir; I have bought a large number of his handkerchiefs; I have bought from two to three dozen at a time; I have met him at the railway station in his</p>

Patteson's price mark on it—I went back and showed these things to Aldrich, and he said "I bought them from Meek from time to time"—on a subsequent Wednesday in January I went with a man named Cross to Peckham, and he pointed out a house to me, 21, Anstey Road—before that, at the station, the inspector asked Mackintosh about the price he had given for the handkerchiefs, and he said "I have given 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen; I have paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and then he said "I have paid him 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—I produce a parcel containing 27 handkerchiefs and mufflers and three boxes which I received from Henry Warwick; they are all new, and folded up in squares.</p>

               <p>—on 23rd December, about 10.20 a. m., the prisoner came in for a glass of port wine, and placed this good sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the counter—I put a Half<lb/>sovereign and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in front of him—there was no other money on the counter—I then turned my back to get some cruets, and he said "Governor, look here"—I turned round and found a Hano<lb/>verian medal on the counter, substituted for the half<lb/>sovereign—I am positive I had put down a good one—he said "It is abad half-sovereign"—he did not hold it in his hand—I said" I did not give you that"—he said "You gave me that in change with the silver"—I said "No, I did not; certainly not"—he said" Call in a policeman, then"—I called a plain<lb/>clothes constable who was in the other compartment, who said that it was a trick, and asked him how many more he had about him, and he produced three or four similar medals wrapped in tissue paper, saying" Well, I own I did try to pass it; do forgive me; it is my first offence."</p>

I saw the prisoner drive up to the warehouse in Upper Thames Street in a cart drawn by a pony; a lad was with him—Rowley got out of the cart, looked down the wharf cautiously, when he got to the warehouse he partially covered his face with his pocket handkerchief—the warehouse door was open—he sud<lb/>denly went in—he came out with Buckmaster; they went to the Fortune of War public-house in Upper Thames Street—the cart was about 20 yards from the door—Buckmaster motioned to the boy, who took the pony and cart to the warehouse door, where the cart was loaded—I saw a range, stove, and iron fencing put in—the boy covered the goods with some sacks—Buckmaster went to the public-house again, and the boy took the cart towards Queen Victoria Street—some time after I saw Rowley drive away to Queen Victoria Street, and stop at Bennet's Hill—he then went to the warehouse, and I saw him returning with a clerk—they went to where the solicitor's, offices are—Buckmaster was taken into</p>

McKinlay;" he said "I am very sorry, I know nothing whatever of it"—he was taken to the City, charged, and locked up till Monday morning at the Mansion House—he afterwards said" I do not deny having the goods, I paid money to Buckmaster for them; I suppose he got drunk with the money"—since the committal I found the boy—he is a witness.</p>

I am a licensed victualler at Hounslow—about 8.30 on the evening of the 1 st December I was at the White Bear; my son came to me, and from what he said I went to my house, 30, High Street, that is next door to 32; I found No. 32 on fire; I did not go in; there were three fires from what I could see, two at the back and one at the front; the two at the back were one on the ground floor under the staircase, that I saw as I was getting over the wall at think; I came through the washhouse and could see under the stairs from the door; the fire had not then burnt through the stairs—the second fire was in the room above at the back—I saw that from the window at the back—I noticed the fire under the stairs first—I could not see whether there was much fire in the second place—the third fire was in the front of the house on the third floor; I went round and saw that from the street—there was a great deal of fire—that was all the appearance of fire I saw—I know Andrews; he was the manager of the house; it was a common lodging-house, rented by West—he keeps the lodging-house—he and Mrs. West do not live there; Andrews does, and manages the business—Mr. and Mrs. West live in King's Arms Lane, about 200 yards from No. 32—it was about 20 minutes to 9 when I first observed the signs of fire—I did not remain there, I went back to my business—I cannot say I had seen any of the prisoners that day, either before or after the fire.</p>

I am a tinman, and live at 54, High Street, Hounslow—about 8.30 on the night of 1 st December I was standing at my door; I heard a noise and ran down to No. 32—I saw flames in the corner facing the front door, which was open—it was not an ordinary flame as from wood, but a blue flame; I thought there was something to help it burn—I looked through the door; then I went and fetched a ladder to get up to the windows in case there might be anybody in the house; I gave the ladder to a policeman; I did not go into the house at all—I saw someone take a mattress or bolster out of the house; I did not see who it was—the shutter was up in front of the house when I got there—the ground floor is a kind of little shop front.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188201300030"/>
               <p>the house full of fire, more especially the middle part of it; the Isleworth men were there with a stand<lb/>pipe, which they got to work after we passed the house, and their branch men played on to the fire through the front door; I placed my branch men at the window, the shutters were down, the back room seemed to be full of fire; and they played on that through the front room—I noticed the ceilingof the first floor back room and the party wall, they were hardly discoloured, not discoloured at all by fire; it was discoloured up near the stairs where the Isleworth men were playing on to it—the fire was raging there—the fire seemed to be in a cupboard under the stairs; it could not have communicated with the fire in the front room—I went through the next house to the back, and saw through the window a large fire raging in the first floor back and in the washhouse—the fire in the first floor back might have had connection with the fire under the stairs, from the quantity of fire in the house at the time; it was a larger fire than the one under the stairs—the washhouse is adjoining at the back within a yard or so of the stairs; I should say it caught fire from the fire under the stairs—after I had ordered the firemen to attach a branch to play on the room behind, I came to the front of the house<lb/>in the corner of the front room near the street I saw a fire, which I took to be the gas<lb/>meter on fire; I leaned in at the front window and examined it there and then, and saw a tremendous lot of blue flame; I went with a fireman and got two buckets of water from the tank of the engine; I took one bucket myself and went and threw it over those flames, and I found that it put it out, leaving a kind of blue peculiar smoke arising, which convinced me it was not gas—I could not see what the burning matter was; there was no connection between that and the fire under the stairs—I went three days afterwards and examined it; I found nothing but a few charred remains of a cupboard and chest of drawers that had burnt through the floor right to the ground; there was no basement to the house—I found that the flooring in the room was not burnt from the staircase in the passage to that corner; the flooring in the corner where I had seen the blue flame was entirely burnt out to the earth—on the night of the fire I noticed a flame in the top story through the top window, which I ordered my branch men to play on to; that was through the top semicircular window as shown on this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went up into that floor three days after, the same day that I examined the flooring, and I found the head of the wooden bedstead burnt nearly through; likewise part of a mattress burnt very much; two other bed<lb/>steads in the room were simply scorched from smoke—the burnt bedstead was farthest from the door and nearest the wall and window, while the bedsteads which were scorched were between the burnt one and the door—the fire which burnt the bedstead against the wall must have been a separate fire in my opinion; it could not have been communicated through the window in any way—I could not see that the floor of the upper room was injured at all.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Hounslow, 29th December, 1881. Statement made at 9 p. m., by Mr. James Stone, shoemaker, 37, High Street, Hounslow, at the Police<lb/>station, Hounslow.'West called on me last night at my shop and said" I want to make a statement who set fire to your house;" he said "It was old Prince. "West said Prince asked him to lend him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to buy some stuff to set fire to your house, Stone's house, stating that he had done it for Mitchell, and" I can do it for you for a few pounds. "West then said" Dick and my wife are innocent, it was me and <hi rend="italic">Prinny; Prinny</hi> set it on fire, so help me God," and in reply to a question put to him by Stone, West said" There was only one fire under the stairs. "I cautioned West before hearing what he had to say, that I should inform the police of what he did say. He replied" You can go to<lb/>night or to<lb/>morrow morning. "Signed James Stone, corroborated by William Harrison.'") I read that out to him—he said" It is true, I would not tell a He. for God or man; he, "pointing to Prince, who had come in with another constable while I was reading the statement," instructed me how to do it; I went upstairs and took 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of a cash<lb/>box in the presence of my wife; he did it, so help me God"—I turned to Prince and said" You have heard what West has said, do you wish to say anything? if you make a statement I shall have to take it down in writing"—he said "I do, "and I took his statement down and read it over to him, and he put his mark to it—this is it:" I left home, 32, High Street, at 10.20; I went to Kingston Market. I left the market at 3 p. m. and came to Twickenham. I left Twickenham at 8.30 p. m. and walked home. I reached Hounslow at about 9.30 or 9.35. I saw George Conquest in the Railway Hotel, Twickenham, about 8 o'clock, shortly before I left. I went into a public-house at Whitton on my way home. I there heard the men speaking about the fire. I did not go into any public-house in Hounslow about 8 p. m. on the night of the fire. The statement made by West, as far as concerns me, is untrue. "After the first remand West told me, at the Town Hall, Brentford, that "<hi rend="italic">Prinny</hi> did it with about a quart of brown horse powder; he carried it in a linen bag about a week"—he said he believed he bought it in Kingston about a week before the fire, and that mixed with some gun<lb/>powder</p>

S.—I then went to Bowden's office and saw one of his sons, and then to the Dock Company's office and stopped the goods, and afterwards to our solicitors—I then went to the prisoner's and found him in bed—I told him the cheque had been returned—he said that it must be a mistake at the bank; he had provided for it—I said "Then you had better send your son up with an open cheque and take it up"—he said "I cannot do that; I have no cheque<lb/>book," and offered to meet me at any time on Monday and put it right—I arranged to meet him at the City Bank, Aldgate, on Monday morning at 10 o'clock, when he promised to prove to me that it was all right—I went there at 10 o'clock on Monday; he was not there, but his son was—I then went to the Corn Exchange, where his son produced this paper:" F.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is the cheque for 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it bears the stamp of the prisoner's bank, and the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque is crossed the same—it is the custom of the trade to deposit corn temporarily for advances, and there is no difference whether the quantity is small or large—we advance a sum which will be quite sure to cover us—we retain it, and if the market rises we may get a considerable profit; if the market goes down there is a loss—there was an appearance of a rise in the maize market about the end of the year, but it did not come—there was a fall in January—the 150 quarters realised exactly what he gave for it, less the usual charges—our charges were about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if maize had gone up even 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter that would have paid the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and left a profit, but there was no rise, and it is not sold yet—there is no rule when it is to be sold; it depends upon the caprice of the owner, he watches the ebbs and falls of the market, but a time may come when it must be sold—our business is very large.</p>

There were 25 creditors besides Golding—Winchester was not one, Bevis was one, and Greenham, and Miller—I don't think a receiver was appointed—Mr. Weatherfield, a solicitor, appeared for Gover, and the Court would not appoint a receiver, having no control, as the creditors did not attend—the failure was the fault of the petitioning creditor, not of the creditors.</p>

                  </hi>. I was originally in the service of the Great Western Railway at Paddington—on 2nd November I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle,</hi> which I answered, and received this letter: "99, Com<lb/>mercial Road, E. Sir,—Call here at 9.30 to-morrow respecting situation. A. G. Gover for Gover and Golding. "I called next morning, and saw Golding—I said that I called in reference to the advertisement—he said "Are you Mr. Miller?"—I said "Yes"—he introduced me to Gover, saying, "My partner, Mr. Gover"—Gover said that he wanted an honest man to manage his shop, as he had got six shops in various parts of London—I asked if references would do instead of security—he said "No," he did not doubt my honesty, but he had been robbed so much he was determined to put a stop to it—he said that he was an inventor, and Golding brought in a pattern of one of his inventions, plates to put on boots—he raid he was a self-made man, and was worth at that time 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked where the shop was which I was to manage—he said "Just here in a good neighbourhood; a good open street doing a good trade," and that he had a large place in Church Street, Shore<lb/>ditch, and had been security for some one named Stanny for between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which had sold him up and ruined him, and he had taken him into partnership—I wrote to him the same night, and accepted his offer—I went there again on 30th November, and again saw Golding, who said that his partner was out; Gover afterwards came in—I said that I should like to see the shop that I should have to manage, and Golding took me down to No. 65, which was also a leatherseller's—we went over the house—I pointed out that several repairs ought to be done, which he said should bedone before I came in—he said that his partner was rather a rough<lb/>looking man, but he had stuck to him when everybody else had rounded on him—I went back, and saw Gover, handed him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and received this document: "Received of Mr. Miller 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as security, such security to be returned on leaving our employment, provided the stock is honestly accounted for; salary 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. weekly" (<hi rend="italic">Signed by both parties</hi>). I went in on the Saturday—Gover gave me a key of the shop, and told me if a man named Bevis came I was not to let him in, or to give him in custody—on the Monday morning the prisoners came, and Gover wanted me to go with his son to Cable Street to fetch some leather and nails—I went to Figg's, and brought a bundle of leather, which had been bought, to 75, Cannon Street Road, and Golding took it away—Gover took some hemp away on the Sunday—I told Gover on the Monday that I wanted some more stock in the shop to cover the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "What there is there put in as small compass as you can; before the week is out you will not be able to move," and Golding said "Before the day is out"—I reckoned the stock at about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I parted with my 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>figures and it was very easy to find out, but he wanted a trustworthy man, as he had been so much robbed, and he would stand it no longer—he spoke to Mr. Bevis, who was in the shop, and said he was doing so remarkably well the little time he had been there that in a short time he would be able to show him how to cut up hides of leather—he wanted 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me as security; that was the amount mentioned in the adver<lb/>tisement—I asked him if he could not take less; he said "No"—he arranged to meet me at the shop, 6, Mundella Terrace, Battersea—I met both prisoners there that evening—Gover said that it was No. 8 shop that I was to have charge of, and he took me there—he introduced us to his son Tom—this was the 19th—he said he wanted me to go in about the 22nd or 25th October; I said I would let him know which day—I paid him the money in bank-notes on Thursday, the 26th October—he handed the money to Golding, and asked him to see that it was all right—I received this receipt.

I give you this notice that you may look out for something you are more fitted for"—in the latter part of that day Golding came down and said, "What is the matter between you and Gover?"—I said," I do not know"—he said," He sent me to ask if you know that another man is coming in your place?"—I said "No"—he said, "I believe that is what he means; he is going to pay you out; am I to tell Gover you are ready to go?"—I said, "Yes, if he pays me my money in full, not part or parcel of it"—he then went in to No. 6—I afterwards got this letter.

In taking the money out of his pocket a sovereign dropped on the floor, Callaghan picked it up, I put it on the bar. I can assure you there was no ale called for whatever, only one pot of beer and one quartern of rum. Nothing was put into the glass. The prosecutor himself poured out the liquor and drank it. The man who says the stuff was put into the glass is a false and wicked man, no such thing was done. The prosecutor was only in one house," <hi rend="italic">Callaghan says:</hi> "The man owed me a few shillings, and told me last Friday night to meet him in Albany Street. I met him there, and he took me into a public-house and called for a pot of beer and a quartern of rum, and paid me the money he owed me. I tried to persuade him to go and buy some clothes for himself, as he had the money." <hi rend="italic">Bartlett says:</hi> "I was in Albany Street and saw a crowd. I went to see what was the matter, and the policeman gave me a shove and took me by the collar, and said 'I see you want to go with them.'"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Rose's Defence.</hi> We were not there, and the landlord knows it. The prosecutor asked me to take his money out of his pocket and take care of it. The powder was never in the glass. I ran away because the man who got away picked up a two-shilling piece and I ran after him to get it back. We were innocent of any drugging or of the robbery, and we only took the money off him for his own safety.</p>

I am as innocent as a child; the house was safe when I left it at a quarter to 6. I left only a lamp burning, and I went to the Plough and Harrow, and had a glass of ale there with Mr. Britton"—I had seen him on the evening that the fire occurred, and I asked him whether he knew any<lb/>thing about the fire, and he said" No, I know nothing at all about it"—he was taken to the station and charged—I saw a lamp when I was in the house—on the Monday night it was on the kitchen table, not alight; I lit it myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was first introduced to him about May, 1881, but he had been a customer of ours for leather before that—he was carrying on business in London as a leather merchant, and I was told with a very large connection—he was to carry on business for us in England—we had no counting-house or office in London before that, but we had an agent here—after the agreement was entered into the business was carried on at Turnbull's head office—these acceptances were given before the partnership, for a transaction between us when he was carrying on business for himself—I lived in apartments in Geneva Road, Brixton—I was not a shipping merchant; before the agreement I was cashier in a foreign bank, but only for a short time—I had dabbled in hops in Bavaria—Fanny Rosenthal, who is mentioned in this agreement, is my mother, and Otto is my brother—the business was to be carried on from 1st July, and books to be kept, but we did not do any remarkable business till September; we did some, and entries were made by his clerk of all transactions, but the prisoner prevented me from keeping proper books</p>

               <p>before September—he did not give me exact information as to the parties he sold to—I kept no books before September, but Mobbs, the clerk, did—he is here—I did not tell the prisoner after the agreement was entered into that I did not intend to carry it out after the three years, nor did he say that he would sue if I did not, nor did I say that I was not a house<lb/>holder, and he would have to follow me into Germany and sue me there, or anything to that effect—he never said so in Mobb's presence—he did not threaten to retain money which he had in hand as I was going, and put an end to the agreement; Mobbs said so at the police-court, but it is not true—he was called there as a witness for the prosecution, and I heard him swear that, but it is not so—the prisoner did not say that he should retain the money till it was fought out—I did not see the tele<lb/>gram to the Rev. M. Loriner before it was sent, nor did I know that it was going—I know Mr. Newsom—I did not see the prisoner send his telegram, or see it before it was sent, nor did I know that it was going; I was at Worcester that day—I did not say to him, "If you send the telegram to him at that address we shall get some money"—I was not here—the letter enclosing the account was received one day before I gave the prisoner in custody—I then got a warrant—I went down and saw Mr. Newsom, his next door neighbour, just previous to giving him in custody—I did not tell Mr. Newsom that I knew that the prisoner had overdrawn his account, and that I intended to put an end to the agree<lb/>ment, or that Turnbull had threatened to stick to all he had received in consequence of my threatening not to carry out my agreement; nothing of the kind—I was aware before I gave the prisoner in custody of this clause, "The said A. R. Turnbull shall have full and absolute authority to make and enter into and execute contracts and agreements, and to sign the name of the said Rosenthal to all such documents as shall be necessary or convenient for enabling the said A. R. T. to carry on the said business, but the said A. R. T. shall not accept bills of exchange"—I know that I have indicted him for forging the name on these cheques, but that does not refer to the financial part—there is also a clause in the agreement by which accounts shall be settled every June and December—I gave him in custody before 31st December, so that no account was taken between us—I have no property in England.</p>

He entered the shops, but what he did I do not know, nor did I receive anything. On the second occasion I met him about 6.40, and told him I was very hard up. He said "Come and have a cup of tea, and he gave me some eggs, butter, and sugar. He was a long while buying them, and I looked through the window, but I did not know he was uttering counterfeit coin. We went into a public-house, and a constable laid hold of me. I handed nothing to Varney; it is a mistake or a lie. I wish to call Varney as a witness.</p>
