And when they were taken their Swords were Bloody; F - said that he had killed a Dog, and after said that he had never cleaned his Sword since he was at a Fight beyond Sea near Fleury, but that was a double Story; and it was proved that he was in company with the Deceased at Chelsey the same day that the Murther was done, and the Deceased's Shirt, and one of the Swords of the Prisoners, was produced in Court as a further Testimony against them, though the matter appeared very Strenuous and Pregnant before, even in all the Circumstances of it. The Prisoner, Rantzau, said, That F - was Innocent, and did not deny the Fact at his Tryal, but said that there were three more Out landish Men that assisted him: F - denyed the Fact; and that he was never at Chelsey. The Box was proved to be the Deceased, as was well known by the Maker, as also by Collonel Willet, his endeared and most Affectionate Friend.

Pearse assalted him in a Tavern, the Prisoner coming into the Room where Pleadwell and his Wife were sitting, and violently pulled her Ear Rings out of her Ears, and drew a Byonet swearing he would cut his hand off, if he would not give him the Ring off his Finger, and drew a Pistol, threatning to shoot him. This was Evidence for the Ring. The Prisoner denyed that he offered any Violence, and he said Pleadwell had Robed him; he called one Mr. Trymmer to prove what he asserted, who said, That the Prisoner had not the Ring, and the Hatband sell off in the Scuffle: So the matter appeared to be more like a Trespass than a Robbery, in the end he was <rs id="t16910115-21-verdict94" type="verdictDescription">

               Treasonable Design carrying on to Depose the King and Queen, and to Subvert and Alter the Government of the Kingdom of England, and to raise War and Rebellion in the same; which said Traiterous and Wicked Designs and Purposes to bring to pass, they did, on the 29th of December last, Meet and Conspire together, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16910115004"/>several other Traitors not yet discovered, and did Compose several Treasonable Letters, Notes and Memorandums in writing, which set forth the most effectual way and means how they might Dethrone and Depose our Most Gracious Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queen, and further describing therein how the Affairs of this Kingdom stood, and of what Strength and Force our Shipping was; as also the Fortifications of several Sea-Port-Towns within this Kingdom. The Second Part was their adhering to the Kings's Enemies: And to that end, that they might Acquaint Lewis the French King of the same, they did hire a Boat and Embarque themselves in order to Transport themselves and Pacquet of Treasonable Letters into France
            </rs>, agreeing to pay for their said Passages the Sum of One hundred Pound; and, in order to their Treasonable Voyage, they had made their Passage as far as below Gravesend, but were then Taken by Captain Billop, who Cruised abroad to search for them.</p>
               <p>After this the Evidence for the King being called, gave an Account particularly from Step to Step, how cunningly and subtilly they managed this horrid Conspiracy, by hiring the Smack called the Thomas and Elizabeth, to convey them secretly into France; in order to which they took Water in a Skuller at Surrey-Stairs, and went on Board the aforesaid Vessel, which lay in the River of Thames over against the Tower: From thence they set Sail down the River, till coming within the View of the George Frigate, lying in Long-reach, they desired the Master of the Smack to hide them under the Quarter-Hatches; which was done, they having some Fear of being discovered: There they remained till past that Danger, and then came up; but when they were within Sight of Gravesend they hid again, and a little below it Captain Billop came aboard them, under Pretence of Pressing the Masters two Men, who were assistants to him; but indeed his Design and real Intention was to find out those Traytors, which, upon Search, he found lying along under the Hatches; and after their being haled up he search'd them, and found a Pacquet of Treasonable Papers in Mr. Ashton's Bosom: which he with the Prisoners carried before my Lord Nottingham; who examined the Papers, and after being examined by the Cabinet Council they were committed to the Tower. The Evidence was very full and plain against them both, much to the same effect and purport: The Letters being also Read against them in Court, were adjudged to be of no less Import than High-Treason. Upon the whole they had nothing material to offer in their Defence; so after a very long hearing, they were both found <rs id="t16910115-29-verdict129" type="verdictDescription">
