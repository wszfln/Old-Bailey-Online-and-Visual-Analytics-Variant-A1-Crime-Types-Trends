               <p>Q. Do you know who they were?</p>
               <p>Davis. Monro held the hat for the money. I was leaning out of the window when I delivered the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Monro dressed as he is now?</p>
               <p>Davis. I could not discern the colour of his clothes; I said to the gentlemen that were in the coach, that it was either dark brown or black.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure to his face?</p>
               <p>Davis. I am not positive; he answers much to the person; it was only star light; I delivered three shillings to them.</p>

            . I was in a public house with Mr. Heath; we both ran out on the cry of murder; there were five or six together; when we came up to them the prisoner said here we go, and began running; we laid hold of him; I was present when the cloak was found; we pursued him almost to Tower-hill.</p>

               <p>I did not knock her down. A parcel of men at Iron-gate asked me to go and take a drink with them; we went to Salt-Petre-Bank and drank very hard; coming back there were three men walking with me, and seven or eight behind me; a man came to me and gave me a cardinal and run down an alley; there were people running; I asked what was the matter; I did not hear what these gentlemen said.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old: I know the consequence of an oath; I am apprentice to the prosecutor. On the 23d of November Archer and Reading came in to buy a pair of shoes; we had none that would fit them; they were very difficult; while they were trying them on, I observed Archer nodding his head to Savage, who was on the outside of the door: he came in; I observed that while I was fitting the shoes on, this man, Savage, clapped his hands behind him, took these pair of women's callimanco pumps from the place where they lay; then he went out and said he would stay at the Black Lion ten minutes for the other man; upon his going out, I got down and considered if I had taken notice of it at that time, that as there were three men, and I was only a boy, they would run away; I bolted the door and locked it, and so kept the two prisoners in; I said as they were difficult to fit I would call my master; I went to him; he came; then I charged them with having taken the shoes; my master sent me for a constable, who took them before a justice; when they were taken, Reading asked my master if he should go and fetch Savage, as he was charged with taking them; he agreed, and Reading went to fetch Savage, who came with him.</p>
               <p>Savage Defence.</p>
               <p>We had agreed to go together to the Black Lion; I staid out some time; he might nod his head at us to tell us he would come presently; when I went in I said I could not stay long. I know nothing of these pumps; I was surprised at being charged with them: whether it is not a proof of my innocence that when I was charged with this fact, instead of running away, I went back in order to justify myself.</p>
               <p>He called several witnesses that were drinking with him when Reading came and said he was charged with stealing the shoes, to prove that he went of his own accord to clear himself.</p>

            . On Sunday the 6th of June last I saw Mr. Johnston, the prisoner, in the forenoon, at the Grecian coffee-house in Devereux-court; he told me he had been disappointed in a bill he expected to have received money for, drawn by some banker, and accepted I think by Lord Townshend; that he had given this bill to some person in the city to get discounted, and the person would not return it him, to remedy which, he said he had applied to his mother in Ireland, who had sent him a bill for 22 l. 10 s. which bill he said he had given to a Mr. Hunt, his taylor, in order to pay him for a suit of clothes he had of him, and to receive the balance in cash; he asked me if I would walk with him to the taylor's, who lived in a court in Holborn; I went with him; I waited at the door till he came out; he said the taylor had not got the remainder of the cash, but that he would call at the Grecian in half an hour with the balance, after deducting five guineas for the clothes; we went to the Grecian coffee-house and called for something; the taylor did not come till about an hour after, which was I believe between one and two o'clock; Mr. Johnston immediately quitted me, and went with the taylor to another box; when the taylor went out, Johnston came to me and said the taylor was gone to try another friend to get cash for the bill, and would be back in ten minutes; Mr. Johnston and I went out of the coffee-house; he said he would go to the taylor and get the bill back, and requested I would get cash for it; he went to the taylor and I went to a steak house; he returned between a quarter and half an hour after to me at the chop house Wych-street, with a bill; I had not the cash, and as it was a Sunday I thought he could not get the cash of the merchant on whom it was drawn; I went to Mr. Cappock; he gave me cash for it; he remained in the chop house; I received of Mr. Cappock twenty one guineas, a six-and-nine-pence, two shillings, and threepence in copper, and I left the bill with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Johnston with you at that time?</p>
               <p>Howly. No. I went back to the steak house and gave Mr. Johnston the cash. On the Thursday following I was in the city; I called at No. 4, in New Broad-street, where the bill is specified to be payable, and enquired after Mr. Knox; I could find no such person; I went to Old Broad-street; I could find no such person there; I went to a coffee house, and looked over the merchants list; I found there was a Knox and Mercer in Crosby-square; I went there; Mr. Mercer was within; I asked him if he had any correspondence with Mr. Bevan's house at Dublin; he answered, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Mercer here?</p>
               <p>Howly. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then that is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Howly. I went back and enquired at Mr. Johnston's lodgings; I found he had given orders that he should be denied to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Johnston lodge?</p>
               <p>Howly. In Devereux court; he was not at home I believe. I went to the Grecian coffee-house about two o'clock; there I saw Mr. Cappock; he told me it was a forgery. (The bill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080010"/> produced by Mr. Cappock.) This is the bill I had of Johnston; it is just the same except No. 4; I told Mr. Cappock, agreeable to Mr. Johnston's information, that the parties lived there upon whom it was drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner write the name 
               <persName id="t17731208-13-person194">

             on the back of the bill?</p>
               <p>Howly. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write?</p>
               <p>Howly. No; he delivered the bill to me with his name upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has mentioned Lord Townshend's name; I never said that; it was Lord Townshend's agent; he only heard that insinuated at my lodgings; he breakfasted and supped with me that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you from Ireland?</p>
               <p>Howly. Yes.</p>

               <p>Howly. No, I am not acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Howly. About a month before this transaction, by seeing him at the Grecian coffee-house, and lodging in a house I had lodged in for some months.</p>

Mr. Howly came to my house on Tuesday; I told him I thought it a bad bill, and I chose to detain him till I could find Johnston.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Pruant. Not very sober; a little time after I had been in bed they took three guineas and a half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had that money?</p>
               <p>Pruant. I gave a shilling for the bed, and then I saw the money; it was in a purse; I staid there all night, but they went away and left me by myself; I went to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this woman in the house at the same time? she was not in bed I hope?</p>

               <p>Q. Which is Fagan?</p>
               <p>Pruant. That young woman; the other two were at the fire; the woman (Fagan) took me from the Swan just by there; the other two women I found in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. She had been drinking there?</p>
               <p>Pruant. I went to have a mug of beer there and saw her; I missed it about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they gone then?</p>
               <p>Pruant. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lie there then?</p>
               <p>Pruant. My breeches were gone; the old woman brought them; she got a light and got them from the bedside.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she bring the breeches?</p>
               <p>Pruant. About twelve at night I believe.</p>

            . I met Rooker and Harding about seven o'clock; they asked me to fetch these tools, which they asked me to carry home; before I did fetch them, they agreed to go to some shop to break it open; I stood and covered them; I did not enter the shop: they wrenched the staple off the door and then got into the shop; Rooker gave the things to me; this young woman stood by. I was afraid to have any thing to do with them; I took hold of the corner of her apron and chucked them into it; she was going to throw them into the kennel; I bid her go with them. They bid me fetch a candle; going to Temple Bar, I heard that Harding was taken. In the passage by the church I saw Rooker and this young woman talking together; he asked me to get the things to go out again; I said I was afraid. I drank a pint of beer with him, and left him, and went home.</p>

               <p>Kennedy. Yes, since my master and mistress took the shop I have lodged in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that do you know whether the shopman or porter used to lodge in it?</p>

               <p>The night this unfortunate affair happened I had been at the Black Lion in Wych-street; Chivers was sitting at the same time there; he went out and staid for the space of some minutes; he came in again, and asked me if I was going home, but in the mean time made me as much in liquor as possible; I answered in the affirmative, and said as he was going part of my way I would accompany him; I knew him, but did not know what course of life he followed; when we came by St. Dunstan 's church he went without hesitation to a shop; if it had been broke open it was before he went in at the door; he gave me some things and desired me to put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080019"/> them in my pocket; as he was going to carry them down to Fleet-market, and he had more than he could conveniently take himself, I accordingly took them and put them in my pocket, and he went to get a candle, and then this person, I take to be Kennedy, came and went in, and finding the door open, two people rushed out, and struck him down, and I being terrified, as I had the property about me, and dreading the consequences seeing them run, I ran as fast I could; a number of people pursued me, and I went down Temple-lane, where I was stopped, and the property taken from me that is now produced. I am really innocent of the robbery, and of any intent to commit it.</p>

On Friday the 29th of October, the prisoner and another man went to work for Mr. Petit, master bricklayer at the East India coffee-house, which is next door to the India House; on the 29th, Friday, it rained into the India House; I sent to our master on Saturday; I went up and discovered a great quantity of lead taken away; I was looking over the parapet wall, and there I saw the prisoner wrenching this pipe away from the Company's premises; this pipe came down into Leadenhall-market; it was against the side of the wall of the house; he reached the lead from the inside of the trough.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not carried any off?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, because he saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loosened from the house?</p>
               <p>Smith. I saw him pull it down; he removed it four feet from the Company's premises upon another person's; he left off when he saw me; then he drew his ladder up and went off the premises; I asked him who he was at work for; he said Mr. Petit.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any business there?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; he was at work on the India House coffee-house; this was some distance from that place; he had got there by letting down a ladder; the pipe was twenty or more feet from where he was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or no any thing he was doing there might require this pipe to be moved though he had no right to move it?</p>
               <p>Smith. It lay a great way off, and it could be of no use in his work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pipe higher or lower?</p>
               <p>Smith. The pipe was much lower than he was at work.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you make these entries?</p>
               <p>Cleland.

I saw the prisoner about three o'clock on the Monday following, in the parlour at the Bank; Mr. Payne, a director of the Bank, asked me if I knew that person, meaning the prisoner; I said yes, he had received the money of me for that bill of Fludyer's. It was at this time proposed that he should go to his lodgings; Mr. Gines asked him, where is my money? or what have you done with my money? he answered he hoped he would have mercy and pity on him; he was an unfortunate man, and that his money was at his lodgings in Threadneedle-street, where he would go with the constable, and deliver it up; I went with him and the constable to his lodgings, the corner of Finch-lane; one of the constables asked him for the key of his box; he gave it him freely, and immediately upon the box being opened, he said the money was in the left hand corner, which it appeared to be; Mr. Atkinson took out a large canvas bag, and Spriggs, the constable, took out a handkerchief, which contained more of it; there was I think in all between six hundred and forty and six hundred and fifty pound; it was told over by one or two of the cashiers of the bank that were present; I went to the Mansion-house with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing being said about five guineas?</p>

               <p>Q. Who usually wrote Mess. Gines and Co. pay when due?</p>
               <p>King. I did generally.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080026"/>Q. Who wrote F M H?</p>
               <p>King. Either Mr. Marsh or Mr. Hudson.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any correspondent of the name of Elliot?</p>
               <p>King. None that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any advice of such a bill as this?</p>
               <p>King. None that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this bill accepted at your house?</p>
               <p>King. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the words pay when due wrote by you?</p>
               <p>King. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is F M H either Mr. Marsh or Mr. Hudson's hand writing?</p>
               <p>King. The F M H is like Mr. Hudson's, but I look upon it not to be his hand writing; he very seldom accepts a bill after I have wrote upon it pay when due, especially of such a sum as this, without asking whether there is regular advice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that pay when due an imitation of your hand writing?</p>
               <p>King. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear such a bill had been paid at Mess. Gines and Atkinson's?</p>
               <p>King. On Monday morning the 29th of November.</p>
               <p>(The bill was read in Court, which was exactly the same as set forth in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. How did you discover the bill had been paid?</p>
               <p>King. We always send for the bankers book on Monday morning, and I enter the bills that have been paid by them the preceeding week in our cash book; when I came to sort out these bills in their regular dates, I found among them this bill; it struck me immediately; I looked at the drawer; it appeared to be

I was sent for at three o'clock in the afternoon, and desired to go to the box-maker's, the corner of Finch-lane; I was informed they had a man in custody; I went there; neither Mr. Gines nor Mr. Atkinson were there. I saw the prisoner first of all, just come out of the Bank, in custody of the constables; we went to his lodgings; when we got up into his room, Spriggs, the constable, asked him for the key of his trunk; he gave it him, and said the money was in the left hand corner, and he said the money was the property of Mess. Gines and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was the money found in the lodgings?</p>

Then I went to his lodgings, and there in a white handkerchief was found two hundred and thirty-five guineas, and in a canvas bag three hundred and eighty-three guineas and a half, and a five-and-three-pence, which made six hundred and forty-nine pound thirteen shillings and nine-pence.</p>

Two people, one dressed in a silver laced hat, a brown coat and boots, and pretended he was a stranger in town, pulled out several bills drawn on copper plate check; he had to the amount of two or three thousand pounds; he presented this bill to me, and asked if I knew where Gines and Atkinson lived; I told them their office was in Lombard-street; one asked me to shew him the place; I will not be positive that I did not go in, I was very much in liquor; I was at the Half Moon tavern in Gracechurch-street all the forenoon, and was very much intoxicated; I went with one of them; they gave me the Bank note; they said it was very good, it is proved by the clerks I was very much in liquor; the gentleman says I was so drunk I could not count it; on the morrow morning I was sober; I must have been either out of my mind, or some sad fatality must have attended me to have gone and received this money after the forgery. I had the greatest opportunity of absconding: I could have got off by water; I have not been above seven or eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080029"/> weeks in town from America; I know nothing of the parties of the drawer or indorser; as soon as they said there was a mistake in the Bank, I was all of a tremble; I had suspected nothing of it before, for I was to have seen one of these persons; I was to have gone on the Saturday morning to see him; after I had been with that gentleman in the Red Lion, Sweeting's-alley, I parted with this Mr. - who has given evidence; I did not know what I had done with the bill I was so intoxicated; I got it from him on Sunday; on Monday I was quite sober; when I went there, there were several clerks of the Bank knew me, and shook hands with me; I met a clerk of the Bank, whose name I do not recollect, that asked me if I had received the money at the Bank; I said I had not, but intended at the time. The twenty pound note was filled up in my own name; whatsoever name I might put upon it when intoxicated with liquor I know not; a person said his name is Leigh, he is an honest worthy man, I know him very well, and so they gave me this draught, and on the Monday morning I received this money. My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I have very little more to say; I leave it to my counsel, who I dare say will explain the matter in such a manner that I doubt not will convince you that I had no intention to defraud any body: there are several gentlemen here that know me, that will speak to my character, that I never was brought to a bar before, and this is owing entirely to intoxication.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about six years.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has he in general?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He bore an exceeding good character; I remember seeing him on Saturday was fortnight in Exchange-alley; that was the first time I saw him since I went to the East Indies; then he went I believe to America, in the employ of some merchants in Crutched Friars; I saw him talking to two gentlemen; he asked me to go and drink a glass of wine; I refused; he was so intoxicated with liquor that I thought it not prudent.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Between twelve and two o'clock; I advised him to go home; I asked where he lodged; he said in Threadneedle-street; I observed a man stood at a distance as if he waited for him, dressed in brown clothes and boots, and had a silver laced hat slapped before, and he had his own brown hair clubbed behind; Mr. Leigh went into the King's Arms passage; I waited till he came out; they wanted him to go with them towards Lombard-street; I went to the 'Change, and returned again; I was afraid he was fell into the hands of sharpers that wanted to take him in; I saw him go along with them towards Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I collect debts for trades men and make out bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Lewis. In Old Bethlem.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Leigh?</p>
               <p>Lewis. About six years.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you had been acquainted with him at sea?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He went to North America and I to the East Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. You have used the sea?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes, sometime ago.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have been settled in Old Bethlem about six years?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, my wife has; I have been there about four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular reason to recollect the hour you saw him?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It was between twelve and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it might not be after two?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I am sure it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the hour?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think that these gentlemen were sharpers? it was not by being in 'Change alley you thought them so I suppose?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Not by that, but their dress, and they seemed to be inclined to have him into their company when he was in liquor; I thought they wanted to take the advantage of him.</p>
               <p>Q Did you hear any conversation?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No particular conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they dressed that they looked like sharpers?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Brown clothes, a silver laced hat and boots.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope you do not look upon every body<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080030"/> dressed in brown clothes, a laced hat and boots, to be sharpers?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I looked upon it they were going to take an advantage of him; it is generally the case with people that have the appearance of gentlemen to take the advantage of a man of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Now if you apprehended he had got into the hands of two sharpers, how came you not to stay with him?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I went upon the Change and came about again, and one of them was along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you apprehending this man to be in company with sharpers that wanted to make a property of him, would it not have been kind in you to have staid with him?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I thought it would have been impertinent.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all, when you saw him in the hand of sharpers.</p>
               <p>Lewis. I judged them to be such, and believe they were so.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no conversation with them?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No.</p>
               <p>Q Nor did not hear them say any thing?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think they wanted to go to Lombard-street?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Mr. Leigh told me after I came back the second time, they wanted him to go to Lombard-street with them.</p>

            , in Crutched Friars. The prisoner came to us under the best recommendation, in the year 1768; he continued till 1770: he behaved with the strictest honesty, and I had the most perfect confidence in him. About that time he began to relax in his attendance; upon enquiring into the reason of it, I found that he had been drunk; I complained to him, and he said it was very true; that when he had fallen into some company he had lately connected himself with, they were too prevalent with him. He was sensible that his situation with us would not allow his continuance, but, as he was perfectly honest, I told him the wisest step he could take was to go abroad. I hope your lordship will forgive me this detail; I am really anxious for the prisoner, and his father, who is a very worthy man. As soon as he came into the proposition of going abroad, I engaged Mr. Neeve, a merchant of considerable eminence in the North American trade, to take him under his patronage.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he in America?</p>
               <p>Ryland. He is in London, but has a son in America. The prisoner's friends supplied him with one or two hundred pounds; that, with what little matter he had saved, furnished him a cargo, and he went thither under the patronage, and with the friendship of Mr. Neeve; from that time till now I heard he was going on well; I believe there are some gentlemen in Court that will vouch for his good behaviour in North America; I hope so: I never had the least suspicion that he wanted principle or honesty during the years 1768, 1769, and 1770, that he remained with us; when he went from us I believe he was a perfectly honest man. With regard to the forgery now before the Court, from any thing I know of his hand, I think him as incapable of forgery as a plowman, or an infant, and for this plain reason, it was his interest, and I am sure his inclination, to write a better character than he did, a more flowing agreeable mercantile character; he took pains, as my partner was dissatisfied with the aukward hand he wrote, and endeavoured to mend it, but to no purpose. I believe any gentleman who is acquainted with hand writing, would, from an inspection of his hand, be of opinion that he is not the man that is able to perform a forgery; he appears to me, who sat at the desk with him many months, incapable of what I should call an imitative power in writing, so that I am afraid, if he is justly chargeable with this crime, it is in connection with other persons, and when he is drunk, I am told, he is liable to be imposed on by any body. While I have the honour to stand before the magistracy of this great city, allow me to add, my lord, that I have much reason to believe this poor wretch, now trembling before you, owes the origin of his misery to vile disputing alehouse clubs, where the rights of magistracy, and the first principles of morality and religion have been controverted; young fellows sit there and get a habit of hearing, without horror or shame, vice palliated, human government decried, and the attributes of God himself blasphemed.</p>

            . I became acquainted with the prisoner in New York; I went from Boston to New York in the month of April 1771, and I fancy it might be two or three months before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080031"/> I was acquainted with Mr. Leigh; it was at a public house where our acquaintance first began; he was universally known in the first place as a very good natured generous man, hospitable to every body that came from his country. I found he was a merchant of eminence; his general character, as I have learned by being in company with people of his acquaintance, was such, that they were so far convinced of his honour and honesty, that when they meant to speak of a man's character, they would say, I with he was as honest as

            ; he was universally esteemed, and if New York was as near London as York is in this kingdom, I dare say he would have two-thirds of the inhabitants to speak to his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him capable of such a crime as this?</p>
               <p>Lamb. No, I do not think so; I was told of it at New York coffee house; I said it is impossible, for he is one of the most honest creatures that ever broke bread; I went to his lodgings to convince them of the contrary; I was sorry to find there, that what they told me was true. Mr. Leigh's house was in the firm of Leigh and Price; Mr. Leigh was the first partner; he took a man into partnership with him, through his good nature, that he was unconnected with, that he never saw but by accident at New York; he had brought over a little cargo of cloth, and offered them to Mr. Leigh: Price appeared a feasible man; the consequence was, a partnership was struck up; in the course of business, and just before I left New York, this Price proved himself a contrary man to the honest Mr. Leigh; one night when Leigh did not lie at home, he packed up a vast quantity of goods and absconded; the next morning Mr. Leigh pursued him. There was a Dr. Edgar, a man of eminence in the physical way, and one or two more with him; they caught him in the Jerseys and brought him back to New York, and the law took its proper course; Mr. Price was arrested, and put into prison; Mr. Leigh unsollicited went to Mr. Haake, who I believe they owed eight hundred pounds to; said he, this affair is shocking and horrid, I will not have the least imputation of being privy in the least to it, take all my effects and all the money I have; he gave every thing up unsollicited and generously: the whole town was pleased at his conduct, and he had assistance from every body; this I look upon as a very great proof of his honesty; I can say farther, that he has often been taken in for trifles by his good nature, and especially if he got a little intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. He gave up every thing?</p>
               <p>Lamb. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had no property of his own?</p>
               <p>Lamb. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These were partnership debts I suppose?</p>
               <p>Lamb. Yes; as Mr. Price was an utter stranger and taken in against all his friends at New York, nobody would give Price credit.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not agreeable to the practice of the Court to enter into particular stories, but I am very unwilling in a case of this sort to stop a witness.</p>
               <p>Lamb. I did not mean to say that he came from New York without any property.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he came away?</p>
               <p>Lamb. About five months; but I understand always after that he had remittances from home.</p>

On the 5th of November between three and four o'clock in the morning, I missed this cow; it had but just calved; it was marked C L on the horn. I advertised it on Tuesday, and on Wednesday I received intelligence that it was killed in White-horse-street, Stepney; I went there and acquainted the man's wife of it; he was not at home, and the same night the prisoners were taken. As we were taking them to the Justice, Martin called me by my name and desired I would be as favourable to him as I could; when they were before the Justice they were in several stories.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in White-horse-street, Stepney; I saw the prisoners as I was coming from Whitechapel market, at the door of Mr. Davis, who keeps the Green Dragon at Stepney; one of them, I believe Ridley, had a cloth under his arm; I asked what they were doing; they said they were staying to receive some money; this was about eleven in the morning; the bell was going for church; I went home, and they both came to my house and asked me to let them kill a poor cow there; I told them I had never a beef tree nor rope, and they said they would bring them along with them, and said they should bring the cow in the evening; about seven in the evening they brought her; it was a dark brown and white spotted cow; she was very lame; I did not examine her, so I did not observe any mark on the horns. The cow was at my house all day on Sunday; on Monday morning about nine o'clock they came to kill her; they asked me to lend them a hand, and they would satisfy me any thing I desired.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the skin and entrails?</p>
               <p>New. After it was dressed they took the hide in a bag, and the feet in a cloth, and left the body till Tuesday morning, and then about five, or between five and six o'clock, came with a horse and cart, and quartered it, and put it in the cart; I bought the paunch and entrails, and gave them five shillings and seven-pence for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that as much as they were worth?</p>
               <p>New. More.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy them then?</p>
               <p>New. I thought I was to have the tongue, but they took it away. Laycock came in the afternoon to enquire about it; I was not at home; one of Justice Camper's men and I went to the house where Martin lodged, and told the landlord of it; he bid us stay a little and Martin would come in: we staid till he came in, and then we took him to the watch-house for that night.</p>

             M'Donald. I am a constable: about half after ten o'clock, on the 22d of November, as I was on my watch, I met one of the prisoners, who had a great boiler upon his head; the other had a sack, and had some likewise in his hand; the man with the copper threw it down and ran away upon my seizing the other; the copper was picked up within two minutes after; Kirby was the man that had the sack; the other had the copper. I had seen them often before; I knew their persons. I brought Kirby to the watch; I met Lyons; he said he believed he could find out where the other man was gone that had thrown the copper down; we went to a place in Coal-yard, St. Giles's parish, that leads into Drury-lane and Holborn; there I found this Robinson in a house, and the things that are produced in that house where Robinson lodged.</p>
               <p>- Lyons, the constable, confirmed this account.</p>
               <p>A woman, that cleaned the house, deposed, that when she left the house, about three weeks ago, the things mentioned in the indictment were safe in the house.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the matter; I had not the copper upon my head.</p>
               <p>Kirby's Defence.</p>
               <p>A man threw down the copper and things and asked me to help him to carry them home; as it was near my house I said I would; he was about fifty yards before me.</p>
               <p>He called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the Saturday before the 20th of September, he called on me and said he had done the sophy chairs, only he wanted some nails for the front; he came again on the Monday; I told him I had not the nails then; on the day following, the maid servant came and told me the person I had sent to repair these things had broke open almost all the locks in the house, and had stole a great deal of property. I went with her, and in the back parlour I found the drawers broke open; and in the dining room the lady's cabinet broke open; a large hair trunk and another box was broke open; but the prosecutrix's box was not broke open.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing done to Mrs. Birchall's box?</p>
               <p>Potter. No; I sent for her knowing she had her clothes in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was she sent for?</p>
               <p>Potter. On the Wednesday; when she came I went up stairs with her; one of the boxes was locked; when she got it undone, we found the things were very much tumbled about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box full?</p>

               <p>Potter. No; not half full; the other box was broke open and fastened down again in some manner; when Mr. Draper came, we examined the house; a great many places were broke, but what was lost I do not know.</p>

               <p>Moxam. The other end of Pennington-street, Old Gravel-lane; he was taken up for another robbery, and our people going up the lane, saw him; this is the cap that was produced on the trial of Lewis.</p>

            . Mrs. Moxam desired me to go to the pawnbrokers, to enquire if they were pledged any where; I saw a mob in Pennington-street; they said a black man was there for stealing women's apparel; by the description I had had, I thought it was the black that had stole our things; I asked him what he had in his waistcoat pocke t; he said nothing but his handkerchief; he pulled it out, and this nightcap dropped out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see the black taken up?</p>
               <p>Goging. A little after seven; he said his master gave him the cap then: but before Justice Sherwood he said he bought it in Rag Fair.</p>

               <p>I saw him buy it. It is very hard for me to suffer two months imprisonment after he has been transported for seven years.</p>
