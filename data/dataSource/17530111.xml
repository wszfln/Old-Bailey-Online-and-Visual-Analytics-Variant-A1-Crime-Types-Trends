About the middle of December last, betwixt 11 and 12 at night; three men were in the star in Star street; they deluded me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110004"/> out of the house; the landlord said I should not go out that night; I went out with them, they push'd me into an alley before me, they strove to get my handkerchief from me, I went to prevent them, and in the bustle I lost my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the prisoners there?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I think I remember something of Robertson's face, being one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ask you for your money?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they show you any weapon of any kind?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. No, they did not; I was so surpriz'd, I don't know how they parted with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out for help?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I can't say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober ?</p>

               <p>M' Daniel. I believe I was the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been drinking in the house?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I had been drinking two full pots of bear with them; they told me they belong'd to a man of war at Chatham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take notice of them, so as to know them?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I did not, nor had not seen them before</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Briant.</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I can't say any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Barber the evidence ?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I can't say I do.</p>

            . The two prisoners and I were in company about the middle of December, about eight or ten days before Christmas; we were near an hour drinking with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of liquor did you drink?</p>
               <p>Barber. Three full pots of beer; we told him we belonged to a man of war at Chatham, and that if he would come along with us we would treat him; so he went out with us. Welch swore he would have what he had; I said, he is a seafaring man, and desired not to take any thing from him; he took the man away, and gave him a blow or two; he got hold of his handkerchief, and the man resisted; in the mean time I took the hat off his head, but the watch coming by we all three ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man cry out?</p>
               <p>Barber. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any weapons?</p>
               <p>Barber. No; but we brought him out in order to take what we could from him. After this, Briant and I went to the night-house near Billingsgate, where we quarrelled; Welch wanted to have the hat to himself, but we said he had got his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the hat?</p>
               <p>Barber. We sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor in liquor?</p>
               <p>Barber. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. from Welch. How did the quarrel begin ?</p>
               <p>Barber. He wanted the hat from us.</p>
               <p>Welch. He told me he had a hat, and I asked him where he got it. I have been at the prosecutor's lodgings oftentimes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was he ever at your lodgings after ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Welch's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never drank with Barber, only I met him in East-Smithfield, and he asked me to drink; he gave me some gin and beer, and I have been sick ever since. He told me he belonged to an India man.</p>
               <p>Briant's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of Barber; I hear he has been guilty of a robbery in Drury Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. from Welch. Ask Barber whether he did not meet me in Wapping and ask me to drink with him, and I would not.</p>
               <p>Barber. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Welch. Did not I ask him to fight him there ?</p>
               <p>Barber. He did ask me that one day.</p>

On the 23d of December the prisoner came to my mother's shop, and asked for a striped camblet gown; I asked her whether she would have a new one or an old one; she said, a second-hand one; I told her we had never a one; but my mother called out and said, we have a second-hand cotton one. Another woman came and asked me if I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110005"/> buy a petticoat. After I had done talking to the other woman, I turned to go into the shop, and saw a cloak under the prisoner's apron; after she was gone out of the shop, I asked my mother where she put such a cloak, and she told me; I then missed it, but the prisoner was gone quite away. After this, my sister came and told me she had taken the prisoner with the cloak on, so I went and found her in her kitchen with it on, and my brother took it off; I know it to be my mother's property.</p>

About ten o'clock the prisoner came into my shop and asked to see a camblet gown; before I could come to her, she went to the end of the shop and took a pair of stays; I seeing them, pushed her into the kitchen, and, thinking her to be the person that stole my mother's cloak, sent for my sister, who came and said the cloak she had on was my mother's property, so she was thereupon secured.</p>

I dropt a mettal stay hook, set with Bristol stones, on the floor, in my mother's bedchamber; I bid the prisoner take it up; the next day I asked her for it; she said she had put it by, and it was safe, but could not tell where; I desired her to look for it, but she did not produce it; she having behaved extremely ill, I accused her with secreting it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it up?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. No, I did not; but I heard it fall, and saw it lying on the ground. After my taxing her she owned she had converted it to her own use; at first she said she had sold it for two-pence to a woman; after that she said the woman was to give her a ring for it; and at last she said she had given it to her mother, and that her mother told her she was a very good girl, and bid her see if she could get some plate; then I asked her if she had taken any thing else; she then asked me if I missed any money out of my drawer, and owned she had taken fifteen guineas out of it; I desired her to take a great deal of care left she should accuse herself with more than she had taken; then she said she took six half guineas, and told it into her apron, and after that twelve guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this confession made?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. This was in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your drawer stand?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. It was in a buroe in my closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the buroe locked?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. It was not; and the key being left by mistake in the closet door, she said she took the opportunity of going up and taking them when we were at breakfast; I desired her to go into the closet and shew me the drawer; she stamp'd, and said she should die at the sight of the drawer ; I shewed the footman the drawer beforehand ; he said to her, if you will not touch the drawer, touch it with a pen, which he gave her in her hand; she took it, and touched the right drawer directly, and said, she had seen me go to that drawer before. There was no stirring but she was always after me of my sister, for which I talked to her before.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you miss?</p>

               <p>S. Hailing. I only charge her with three or four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the money last?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. I had not seen it for about a fortnight or three weeks before, but can't say how much there was; there were fourteen guineas and a 27 s. piece, when she confessed what she had taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there in the drawer before you missed any ?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. I can't justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there twenty pounds ?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. There were about 30 l. but I chuse to say under rather than over what I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how much can you say you missed?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. I can say three or four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the stay-hook or money since?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. No, I have found neither.</p>

               <p>Flude.

One Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110007"/> Seale, the prisoner's landlord, came to my house on Sunday about two o'clock, and asked me if I had been robbed by the prisoner; I went with him to the house of

(The back screw, a pair of clams, and a brass core, produced in court and deposed to ) I took the prisoner about eleven o'clock on the 24th day, and then asked him what he had done with the burnisher ; he told me he had thrown it away under the gateway belonging to a handkerchief printer in Chiswell Street; I went there and found it; at the same time he told me he had pawned the two vices to Mr. Pain at the Three Golden Balls in Golden Lane for half a crown; so I went there the next day to inquire for them, but he denied having them.</p>

The prisoner was there, who asked me the weight, and he said it was very surprising to him, for he thought one person could not steal it, and likewise that the man who informed him of it was most likely to be the thief, and that we had better keep him in custody, adding, he deserved to have his brains beat out for giving information at such an uncertainty, and that if ever he came on the river again he'd have his deserts.

            . My husband was a founder and brazier, but he is dead, and I carry on the business. There came a well-dressed well-spoken woman to my shop on the 7th of December, and brought an old brass pot-lid for me to make her a new one of the same size; she said she knew a master of a ship that had brought some copper and brass from abroad who wanted to sell it. There was a man, very much like the prisoner, (I can't be certain it was him ), stood at the door with a piece of an old brass kettle in his hand, and he asked me what it was worth per pound. After this there came four men, the prisoner was one of them, and brought this parcel of brass to me to sell, which is here produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner bring it?</p>
               <p>S. White. He did not. One of the men said he had a little money on board, so he bought it, and he brought away from the ship because he would not have it seized. I bought it, and paid them 4 12 s. 6 d. for it.</p>

This was on Thursday about two o'clock, and on the Saturday morning following the prisoner came to me and said he was come to tell me, if any body should come to ask whether I bought such copper and brass, I was to say, no; upon which I was very much surprized, and said, pray, how was it come by? he said he could give a good account of himself, but he not giving me a satisfactory answer, I stepped to the next door for Mr. Hermitage, a constable, who came and secured him, so we took him before Sir

They had in all 4 l. 12 s. 6 d. I saw five of them take up each a parcel, and one was lying on the table when I went out to make water, but that was taken up when I came in.</p>

About eleven o'clock that Sunday night there came ten of these Irishmen, they wanted the man of the house and those that lodged in it, saying, they'd have them or their hearts blood, and that they would fight them; I looked out at my window, but was afraid of coming down to them, so bid them be good boys and go about their business that there might not come any trouble upon it; they said they would not; the lodger (Ginn) came out with a scythe-blade in his hand; they knocked him down; after which he cut one of them; I saw him lying on the ground cut; afterwards Rumbolt and I came out together, and

               <p>Friday afternoon 4 o'clock, 1752.</p>
               <p>I tied the cloaths all up together in a wrapper, and took my servant along with me ; I took a coach in Holborn, and took Tom Jettea in the coach with my servant and me; I came to the Crown tavern at Cripplegate, as Tom directed; there he shew'd me into a room ; where instead of meeting with the pretended captain there sat the prisoner at the bar ready to received me, he asked me whether I had brought all the cloaths, I said yes: He asked me a I came to stay so long, for that the captain had staid as long as he could, and was gone back to his own house in Charter-house-Square; and that the best way I had to do, was to go along with him to his house, and there I might receive my money; the cloaths were laid down by my servant, by my orders, and in his possession, on two chairs in the room, I delivered no bill to him, neither did I tell him what they came to, or any price of them; when I went out of the room with the prisoner, to be shew'd the way to his pretended uncle, I said to my servant ; John, do you be sure to stay here with these things till I come back, he answered, yes, sir; the prisoner lead me to Charter-house-Square, when I came there, said he, I suppose you know the affair, that this is a marriage; and my aunt will be surprized if she sees me come to the house now, because she does not know but that I am on board the ship; you have nothing to do, you know you have no occasion to stay but just to receive your money, and that is the house. (pointing to that house that he seemingly came out of before;) saying I'll wait for you here ; I did not much like the affair, so made all the haste I could, and ran up to the house; I don't believe I was a quarter of a minute in coming to the door; I knocked at it, and a servant happened to be in the entry and opened the door instantly, I asked if it was captain Morris's house, he said no, he knew no such person; I did not stay to make any further inquiry, I ran as fast as I could to the place where I left the prisoner ; which was about forty yards, he was gone ; I ran all the way to the Crown tavern, I believe the time from first setting out and back again, could not be above ten minutes; I went up to the room where I had left the servant and Tom; they and the cloaths where gone, there was only a decanter, in which we had had half a pint of wine, and a candle standing on the table ; I rang the bell and call'd for the master of the house, and told him the suspicions I had, that I had been robbed of some cloaths that I left in the care of a servant; the man said there had been no body in the room but Tom and my man, as he saw, I said I'd stay a little time, and if my servant had not received any injury he'd come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110014"/> back soon ; in about five or six minutes he came; I was a little in a passion with him, and asked him where he had been, and what made him go away after I had given him orders to stay ; he said I had not been gone out of the tavern above five minutes before the captain came in and swore at him, nd was very angry at my being gone to Charter-House-Square, and insisted upon his going after me there to fetch me back, which he did, and I asked him if he gave the cloaths into the custody of Tom or the captain ; he said, no. I advertised the cloaths, and received a letter from a pawnbroker, informing me that he had taken in a waistcoat which he thought to be part of the goods; I went and looked at it, and found it was the blue waistcoat that was made for the pretended captain. The pawnbroker told me that the people who were advertised had been offering cloaths about. I went to another pawnbroker (one Mrs. White in Hounsditch ) and there found my wrapper and a pair of breeches that were made for the prisoner at the bar; I said as he had only pawned them, very likely he'd bring others to change them, and if he did, begg'd he'd stop him; this was on the Tuesday night, and on the Wednesday night the prisoner went there and was stopped, and sent to the Poultry-Compter, and all these cloaths, (part of the goods found in the indictment) were found upon his back; the surtout coat, shag breeches, and laced waistcoat.</p>

            , I asked him how he could serve me so, and desired he'd tell me what he did after he dropped me in Charter-House-Square, he laughed and told me, that after he left me he went to a house in Smithfield, a place appointed to meet; that he had not been there above a quarter of an hour before the captain and brother came in with the cloaths, and he received his share of them. About two days before this prosecution commenced, I had two people came, as they said, from this Jettea, and they desired I'd make it up by giving me a sum of money, but I did not agree to it; after that I received this threatening letter, to be shot thro' the head, &amp;c. if your lordship pleases to compare it with the other letter I received from the captain, they exactly agree.</p>

            . On Friday the first of December my master left the cloaths mentioned in my possession in a room in the Crown tavern near Cripplegate ; I laid them down upon two chairs and sat by them; when the pretended nephew and my master were gone, then I moved to another chair, and looked at a news-paper four or five minutes, in which time came in the pretended captain; he came up the passage, went to the bar, and inquired whether any body had been to inquire for him; he came into the room and asked if the things were come; I replied, they are all ready; he said it was very well, he was going out a little way, but should return very soon; he came in again in about four or five minutes, and said he was going to some place where he had appointed to meet some gentlemen, and was afraid Mr. Bearnfather would stay at his house waiting for him; he desired me to step as far as his house and desire he would return with all the expedition he could; I told him I did not know where his house was ; he said, what, has not your master told you? I replied, no, sir; he then desired I would go to the turning that went out of Long Lane into Charter-House-Square, and inquire for captain Morris's house; I said, sir, your man knows the way better than I do, you had better send him; then he said; d - n your body, do you refuse to go about your master's business? upon that, I took his directions and went as near the place as possible where I thought he lived, and enquired at a publick house at the turning, and was told by the man of the house there was no such person lived thereabouts; a gentleman in the house said he lived about three or four doors on the right hand in the Square, so I went and knocked at the door, and enquired, and was told there was a captain lived there, but it was another name, not Morris; I have forgot the name ; I enquired at two or three other places, but found no such person, so returned back immediately, having no suspicion at all then, and about a hundred yards before I came to the Crown again I met my master, who told me we were robbed of all my cloaths, so I went into the room and all were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Who did you leave the cloaths in custody of?</p>
               <p>Smith. I left them in custody of no person, but in the place where they lay, they were not touch'd by the servant then.</p>

               <p>In first coming acquainted with this said captain Morris, I failed with him from Boulogne in France with one captain Ogleby, a Scotch gentleman, that came from Leith, and had failed with him twice; I accidentally met with him about four or five months ago in London, my brother being along with me; he said he was very glad to see us, and that he wanted some cloaths to take abroad with him; he asked my brother who was Mr. Eagle's taylor ; that Mr. Eagle was his former master on the other side the water near the king's old barge-house ; the lad replied, Mr. Bearnfather, in Monmouth street, and he is a very honest man, and said he had fetched a waistcoat from his house for his master Eagle; upon which this said captain said, I wish you could go and get a bill or two of him, for I want some cloaths made, and had as lief employ him as another, and if he deals honestly I'll deal with him again ; he went and got a bill, and gave it to this said captain Morris, the captain sent for him to meet him at such a place, but he sent word he could not possibly come; then he sent for him to Charter-House-Square; I had been drinking a pint of beer, and was just come out of the house as the said captain's servant and the prosecutor came; I said, is this the taylor that you said served your master on the other side the water? he replied, I used to serve Mr. Eagle; I said, my brother had given the captain a good character of him, that the captain was gone out to a tavern near Cripplegate; we went together to the tavern, and when he came into the room the captain said, your servant, sir, are you the honest man that worked for Mr. Eagle ? I am just come from abroad and want some cloaths to be made me, saying, my lad gives you an extreme good character; then he ordered him to measure him for these cloaths, and me for mine, and Mr. Bearnfather seemed very willing to accept of him as his pay-master ; I never saw him after till he brought the cloaths to the Crown tavern, being just come from Deptford; Mr. Bearnfather said. where is the captain? the landlord told him he had been there, but was gone home; I asked Mr. Bearnfather if he had a bill, and he said he had; I carried him to the house the captain said he lived at, but was never at the house, only have heard him say he lived there; Mr. Bearnfather said to his servant, do you stay here, and I will go there; the witness says the said captain did come in, but I never went back to the tavern, so can say nothing to that; the captain desired me to meet him at a house in Smithfield, so I went there when I left Mr. Bearnfather, and staid till the captain and his servant came.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you desire him to quash the indictment, and offer the prosecutor his money again upon so doing?</p>
               <p>Robertson. No; I did not that I know of: I know nothing of it. I had no money.</p>

               <p>Robertson. I believe not; it was going on of three years, but he came to me afterwards, and work'd for me handsomely.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This evidence, with a woman who said she was the prisoner's sister, came to me, and said, if I would make up the affair, and not prosecute Mr. Jettea, I should be paid all my expences.</p>

               <p>Robertson. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his father living or dead?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I have not seen him these five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner an uncle?</p>
               <p>Robertson. He had, but he has been dead some years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner's father live?</p>
               <p>Robertson. He lived by Christ Church, Surry, about Bull-stairs or Bennet-street.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. As soon as I had lost my goods, Tom having liv'd with mr. Eagle a founder, now dead, on the other side of the water, I went there the 2d of December to enquire: the first I enquired of described the three persons; all the watermen I talked with, told me, they were father and two sons, and described them exactly. I found the father answered the description of this pretended captain : I make no doubt but it was the father.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Captain Morris is not my father ; I believe my father is a little an, and so is the captain, which makes people say it was him.</p>

            . I went to bed about 11 o'clock the 3d of November ; the window shutters of the shop were secured ; but I can't tell whether the windows above were fastened or not. As I was going to bed my mistress called me down; I found her in a fright, she told me there were thieves in the house, for she had found the tongs put into the buroe, in order to wrench it open. Upon that we went to searching the house, and sent to mr. Price, at the next door, who came and informed us, that he saw a man, naming the prisoner at the bar, about the door. I immediately suspected him, went in search of him, and found him in Chick-lane, in a court; there was a young woman in bed with him. In searching, the constable found my watch, a pair of silver shoe buckles, and a silver seal, produced in court and depos'd to. We took him that night to Wood street compter, where he delivered another pair of shoe buckles, a pair of knee buckles, and a stock buckle of mine, produced in court and depos'd to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, he did not; but he acknowledged them to be mine: There was a pair of breeches, one shil ling, and one halfpenny found in one of the pockets.</p>

            . I was constable, and on duty that night ; about half an hour after eleven the evidence and others came to me, and told me in what manner they had been robbed, and their suspicion of the prisoner: and that they had got intelligence he was at a house in Black-and-White-Court in the Old Bailey. They would not let me in for a good while, and when I was, the man of the house told me, the prisoner had been there about nine o'clock, but was gone to Chick-lane: he went along with us, and we found him there, at the house of mrs. Dale, a lodging-house. She conducted me to the room door, and call'd his wife by name, who got out of bed, and opened the door. I staid till we could get in again, and then went in, where lay a new-hat on the table, on the left hand. Mr. North, who was with us, said, this is mine: I bid the prisoner get out of bed, which he did, and sat on the bed-side; he took up his breeches, and took out the case of a gold watch, produced in court, which mr. North said was his. The next thing we found was the silver watch, produced in court; after which he pulled out a pair of silver buckles. There was a bundle of things in the room, consisting of several shirts and stocks ; which mr. Price's footman said were his. Then we searched the room, and between the bed and sacking of a bed we found a silver snuff-box, the property of mr. North. I took him to the compter, and the next day before my lord-mayor, when he owned he took the things there produced.</p>

            . About three or four days before Christmas day, N S. mrs. Appleford came to town in order to recover 200 l that was due to her; she came and ask'd my advice. I told her I would write a letter to her husband, who was then at the Tower to desire he'd do it in an amicable manner, and I would assist him; I told him, if he would give me a letter of attorney, I would endeavour to recover the money, which he agreed to. This money was left by will of her father in the hs of her uncle, to be paid at the age of 28 years I sent for an attorney to act in behalf of them; he then said he could not do it, and begg'd some time to consider of it. Then I desired he would meet me at a house near Charing-cross, which he did ; he began to cry, and begg'd to be in private, and told me he had another wife and a son about fourteen or fifteen years of age, who was register'd in Newbury parish, and that his wife was living in that parish: I went for Newbury on the Friday morning, and got there the next morning: I went to the register, and had this certificate from it, it is wrote on the back of the book, The book of the registers at Newbury. The sexton and I examined it by the book.</p>
               <p>I saw the first wife, she was at Easton, at the house of farmer Harsel, about five miles from Newbury.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the prisoners when you missed them ?</p>
               <p>Dillingham. They were then in the shop: I stepped round the counter, and took Ellice by the collar, who began to swear when I asked for them, and said he had non. I opened his coat, but saw them not. Then Simpson pull'd them from under his cloaths; I could not see from where, but it was from about him, and flung them on the compter; on which I sent for a constable, and they were secured and taken before justice Fielding; there Ellice behaved very saucily; the other said little.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body else in the shop besides them?</p>
               <p>Dillingham. No, there was not, they flung down 3 s. 6 d. several times, and would fain have had one of the handkerchiefs, and gone off.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Jones at the Red-Lion. About a fortnight ago I saw the prisoner and prosecutor come in about twelve o'clock, the prosecutor had a bag, they called for a pint of beer, which I drew, and when they had drank about half out, as the prosecutor was asleep, the prisoner said he would pay for this pint of beer, so gave me a shilling and I gave him his change accordingly; then he took the bag the prisoner had put down in the corner, and went out directly, I saw him carry it cross his shoulder over the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I met this man near Piccadilly, and he asked me to break him into a chair with him; I said I would if we could agree ; we went into a house and drew articles for 18 shillings. he gave me a shilling in hand and a shilling afterwards. I went from thence to Rosemary Lane, and going through the Minories met a baker's man riding on a horse with a pair of hampers: I saw some bags and said, baker, will you sell me one of them bags? so I bought one and went to Tower-Hill and bought three shirts, two pair of breeches, two pair of second-hand stockings, one pair of shoes, and put them in this bag; he was with me, he carried them one part of the way and I the other, till we came to Leicester Fields, where I met two brother chairmen ; there I gave him the bag, and he carried it into a publick house in the Hay Market; when we came out, I said, if you'll carry it farther I'll give you a pint of beer, so he carried it to King-street, St James's, and then to the Red-Lion in York street, where he set it down in the corner and fell asleep; it being my property I took it away with me; we were both drunk; I suppose he thought himself not able to be a chairman, so he took the advantage of me to get money out of me.</p>

I lost my handkerchief; but, I believe, some of the women, his companions, that came me took that.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose house was this?</p>
               <p>Mott. It was the dwelling-house of one Rose Sykes: when I got out into the court and called Thieves! a woman standing by asked me what I had been robb'd of: I said my watch and money, and that I had a friend at the Reaking, in Broad Court, and desired her to fetch her to my assistance. My friend was not there, but there came a serjeant of the foot guards. He bid me stand where I was, and said, there is no thorough-fare, and whoever comes out of the house lay hold of them. Presently a little ragged girl came out, there were people with links, one of whom said, lay hold of that girl, she has got some money in her mouth; I did, and she spit three shillings into my hand, and another fell to the ground; I was afraid to stoop for that, fearing I should be knock'd down. Then out came the prisoner's wife, I took hold of her, and kept her, 'till a fellow rescued her from me. The serjeant was then gone for a party of guards. I took the girl, who is here to give evidence ; she declared the 4 s. was part of my money, which the prisoner had given her to fetch a gown out of pawn.</p>

               <p>Mott. No, my lord, I have not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he could not swear to me, at first, but that my voice was something like the man's; but when he came to see me in Newgate. he then said, now I can swear to your person and voice.</p>
               <p>Mott. When I came before justice Fielding to see the prisoner, who was taken up for another offence, the justice asked me if I knew him, I said then I could positively swear to his person and voice.</p>

               <p>My husband was killed in a battle abroad where this gentleman was, I knew him there, he was an officer's servant, I met him about six o'clock in the park, and he called me to him, saying, come and oblige me, my dear, and I'll do you a favour; he said he knew me very well; I told him I lived at the Green Canister in St. Martin's-lane, and that I was not a common person in that way, but was reduced very much, and a little money would be of service to me, but I would not take any body home; he said, I'll give you a crown to morrow if you'll be agreeable, as we know each other, but I would not, so went away; then he called to me again, and said he would leave his watch with me, and be back again in about eight days time, so I obliged him, and after that he wanted his watch again; he came to me after that and said, what, are you going to pawn my watch? I said, you are dishonourable to make use of my body, and then to want it again without the money, this other woman heard him, I gave it her to secure it, so he took hold on me like a little bundle, and jumped me over the rail, and confined me. I sent a letter, to Mrs. Thompson to bring me the watch again, for the gentleman; after this he promised to give me half a guines, but instead of that he put me into a dark hole.</p>

I said, I had educated him better than to do so. My son was opening the door; and said, how can you say I robb'd you of ten shillings, when you borrowed one shilling to give earnest for some earthen ware to day. He and his wife both struck my son, and she struck me also in the face; then my son and the deceased had a struggle together for about a minute, and then it was all over. After that he came up again in a riotous manner, and I stood before him, and shov'd my boy in doors; then we both went to bed, and left them raving. After that I got out of bed to the window, and said, if they did not cease their noise, and go away, I'd charge the watch with them.</p>

               <p>F. Jennings. It was shut, but it is a glass door, through which I saw her, so went into the shop directly, and missed a whole cheese and almost half another, which just before were standing one upon another.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your husband's name?</p>
               <p>M. Grubb. His name was William, he died since the affair happened; I went to the work-house on the first of December about seven o'clock in the evening, and left my three children in bed in my house; I latched my door (it has a particular latch, which people, who don't know can't open) I put my knee against it and found it was fast. When I returned I found it latched, but the latch was bent, and the candle, which I had left in my bed-chamber, was blown out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been gone?</p>
               <p>M. Grubb. I returned in about half an hour, and found the laths broke through on the cieling, and in the morning I saw on the outside that the tiles were taken off, and two bricks were taken out of the wall; I missed four gowns, a coat, waistcoat, and breeches, a child's set of cloaths, that is, a stay and coat, two petticoats and a perriwig; some of them were taken from out of a trunk, some from pins where they hung, and some from off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the trunk locked?</p>
               <p>M. Grubb. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure all these things were in your house when you went out?</p>
               <p>M. Grubb. I am sure they were, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them last?</p>
               <p>M. Grubb. I saw some of them when I went out, because I could not help going by them.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner, and carried him to New Prison, and then to justice Fielding; after that we took Sickamore and the woman, and by her directions we found some of the things. The prisoner desired to be admitted an evidence. After the things were found I went to the prison for him; there were he and Wale together. Hall told me first, they gave the woman a shilling and some child-bed linnen for her trouble; he desired me to do what I could for him towards getting him admitted an evidence, but the justice would not admit him. He there confessed that he, Sickamore, and another man (I don't know his name) went out together to a house by Pancrass work-house. Sickamore, being a pan-tile maker, was, by the other two, lifted up on the tiles, then he pulled some off from a place on the house, but the rasters were so close he could not get in, then he got down, and they put their backsides to the door and burst it open, they went in, there was a candle burning; then they took out these things, some from out of a trunk, and at coming out of the room they blew the candle out. I took a wig from Sickamore's head that the prosecutrix owned and said it was her husband's.</p>

On Monday the 8th of December, the prisoner came into our shop about twelve or one o'clock, as she usually did about that time, she wanted to buy some sewing silk, or to change some, I had suspected her the day before; she had bespoke a capuchin at our shop and bought the lace to trim it; we sent her backwards that we might have an opportunity of counting the bundles of silk thread, which we did, and there were six of them, I left her to look for what she liked; some of these bundles contained a quarter of a pound, some half a pound, and some three quarters ; they were several kanes tied up together. When I was on the other side the shop, I thought I saw her putting something into her pocket; as she was sambling about with her cloak she chose her silk and paid for it ; I let her go out of the shop and pass three or four doors; after I had told the bundles I fetched her back, and taxed her with taking a bundle, but she denied it very much, and said I was mistaken ; I took her about three or four yards into the shop, I thought I saw her fuoibling under her petticoats, so pufled her a little on one side and found the silk lying on the floor under her; then I called the other people which were in the shop to see it as it lay, there were seven or eight customers, and all at that time; then she was carried backwards,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110031"/> but nothing more found; then she said it was the first fact, and desired to be let go on her knees.</p>

There were deducted back about 40 shillings for paying the whole; they had not money to pay Mr. Crepany's Clerk, so he sent it to me to take the money of me; I believe they gave me about a guinea for my trouble and expences in writing of letters, and paying postage. Murphy at that time desired Daunt would give him something for his trouble in shewing him the way to Doctors Commons, so Daunt gave him half a guinea, Murphy grumbled and said it was too little ; then they went away.

After I found it was a forgery, I made enquiry after was person called Daunt, and Murphy, and at last got of Murphy, so I got a warrant and constable, and took him at Newington in Surrey After which he made his escape from the constable but we soon retook him When I told him what he was for he said he threw himself as any feer and hop'd I would not take away his line; he had but little to say for himself. He was committed upon this, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110034"/> last sessions he preferred a bill of indictment against me for this very crime he now stands charg'd with, and got it found by the grand-jury.</p>

               <p>Levi. I can swear to the box, and the buckles are like them which I sent, they are mine to the best of my knowledge, but I don't swear to them, because one buckle may be like another.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my shop the 30th of November, and brought a pair of buckles, which he offered to sell to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Twaling. I live under Gray's-Inn-gate, aad keep a cutler's shop. I happened not to be at home at the time; he was to come again, then I was at home, he brought two pair of silver shoe buckles and one of knee buckles ; I was sensible he could not come honestly by them by the price he offered them at, so stopped him and them. I asked him how he came by them, and he told me his father was a labourer at Exeter, and that he had given him about eight or nine pair of such in order to defray his charges up to town; he said also that his father dealt in such things. When I got him to the publick house he confessed how he came by them; he said he lived with Mr. Merryweather, who keeps the Saracen's-Head in Friday street, that he found the box in the yard; them I sent for Mr. Merryweather in order for him to enquire of the book-keeper if there was such a box there directed to go to Exeter; in the mean time he had given me the key of his box, and I went to the place where he had taken lodgings by his directions at a gunsmith's, and searched his box, and found this box with buckles in it, which is here produced; he told me likewise he had sold seven pair of the silver shoe buckles and one of knees to Mr. Baskervile in Fleet-Street; he told me also there were some stopped in the Strand, and that he had sold one pair of shoe and one of knee buckles in Holborn; and when his master came he confessed the same to him, but to the last he said he found the box in the yard, so I detained them there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair of buckles did you find in his box?</p>
               <p>Twaling. I found thirteen pair of shoes and four of knees.</p>

               <p>Belchamber. I don't know that.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the parcel booked?</p>
               <p>Belchamber. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Belchamber. It never was a rule to book these things; we never book half what comes for the coach.</p>

               <p>These buckles lay under the dung in the yard broke all to pieces, and I took it up as I was moving of the litter on the Monday morning.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner from about the middle of last October in Wood-street compter. One Matthews, who said he was an acquaintance of his, came and told me one Smithson in Wood Street compter wanted earnestly to speak with me; I heard of his character, and declined going ; after that he sent me a line, and desired me to come to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it brought by?</p>
               <p>Milton. It was brought by a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go?</p>
               <p>Milton. I did, and went down into a cellar there with him, he wanted to be very secret ; he told me about these actions to be brought against these gentlemen, and said his business, with me was to make out a writ against the four defendants, Sharp, Smith, Ward, and Weymore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you their christian names ?</p>
               <p>Milton. He did, and I took them down in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the action brought for?</p>
               <p>Milton. Three of them were for detaining deeds and writings; and Sharp for detaining wearing apparel, deeds, and writings ; this he said was to hold them to bail upon an affidavit. When he had said this, I represented the displeasure he might get from a court, to hold four men for just two thousand pounds each; that he said was to make up eight thousand pounds. I thought that looked monstrovs odd, that there should be just two thousand pounds<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110038"/> each in the hands of different men. I told him it would look very odd in the lace of a court; said he, it must be that sum. Soon after he said, let it be separated, one, two thousand five hundred; another, one thousand six hundred; another, nineteen hundred; and another, two thousand; so to make up the sum eight thousand pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he stile himself Barrister ?</p>
               <p>Milton. He did, and said it was to serve a man who was under misfortunes ; he said farther, that it was to save a man's life, to keep them out of the way that they should not give evidence; then I declined it, and told him it was dirty work, and said, I'll not trouble myself, nor come near you any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing for your trouble?</p>
               <p>Milton. He did, and I never saw him afterwards till this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the man's name whom it was to serve ?</p>
               <p>Milton. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say it was ?</p>
               <p>Milton. He said it was Montgomery; Montgomery was with him at the time, he had the money of Montgomery to pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in company at the time ?</p>
               <p>Milton. The prisoner and I conversed together, but there were other people in the cellar at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you?</p>
               <p>Milton. He gave me 7 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Where did you first see me that time ?</p>
               <p>Milton. The prisoner met me in the court-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Who went down with us?</p>
               <p>Milton. There were none went down with us but one Matthews, though there were others in the cellar at the time.</p>

            . I remember Smithson, (the prisoner) being in the Compter in October last, and we had Montgomery there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they used to converse together?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. The used to converse together as the other prisoners did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was Montgomery put in there by?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. It was at the instance of Mr. Ward, Mr. Weymore, Mr. Sharp, and Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he committed upon their oatas ?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Smithson a copy of his commitment ?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. I believe he had, he came from thence to Newgate a week before the sessions began.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Davenport coming ?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. I do, it was on a Saturday, there was a talk of Smithson's entering an action against Mr. Sharp, and I was surprised at it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of it?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. I went in, and the people were talking that Smithson had swore an affidavit of a hundred pounds against him ; when I went, I saw Mr. Davenport and Mr. Smithson come out of a little room together, I heard Smithson ask him, what he was; and he answered, he was a deputy filazer to my lord chief justice Ayre's son; he asked him how much was his due, and I think he said 11 s 11 d. Smithson said 11 s. was due, and turned about to Montgomery and said he must have 11 d. more, upon which Montgomery said, you have had 11 s. of me already, and Smithson told him he must have it. I remember Smithson said to the gentleman, be very cautious how you take more than is your due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what use the affidavit was to be made of?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. No, I did not</p>
