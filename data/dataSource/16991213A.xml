The Evidence for the King said, that she did find some Symptoms on the Childs Shirt, three several times, upon which she was much frightned, and sent for her Nurse, and desired her to search, the Childs Body, and Examine her about it, which she did, and said that she found the Childs Body in great Disorder, and did suppose, that the Child had been abused by some Man, with that she strictly examined her, who it was that did it: The Child at the first seemed unwilling to tell who it was, but pressing her hard, she confest, that it was a Gentleman that came to the Dancing-School. Then the Child was called, and being set up, was ask'd if she knew the Danger of taking a false Oath, and she replied Yes, that if she did not swear true she must go to Hell, upon which she was sworn: Being ask'd if she knew the Man that did it, she replied Yes; then she was bad to point to him, upon which she pointed to the Prisoner two several times, he being set in two several places, and said that he was the Man, and that she saw him in the House of Office, and he called to her, and she came to him, and he bolted the Door upon her, and gave her a Penny to let him do what he would to her; and said he set her upon the Seat, and put something hard into her Belly; which made her cry out, and he stopped her Mouth with his Hand: When he had done, he made her promise not to tell any Body of it: She said, that the second time he beckoned her out, and she came down, and did as he had done before, promising her a Silver Box, and some Silver Pennies, but gave her none; and said, that at the third time he gave her Sugar Candy and Oranges; they called a Midwife, and an Anatomical Doctor were called, who all deposed, that the Child had been very much abused, and had lost her Virginity, and instanced divers reasons for it. The Prisoner denied the Fact, saying, that he knew nothing of what was objected against him, and called divers Witnesses, to make the contrary appear; who had taken Dimensions of the House of Office, who all declared that it was so little that it was impossible that any such Act could be committed there. He likewise called divers worthy Gentlemen to his Reputation, who all declared that he was always known to be a very civil young Gentleman. My Modesty causes me to forbear nominating all the filthy and obscene Discourse which was used upon the Tryal, which lasted very long, from between Nine and Ten in the Forenoon, till Five in the Evening; all which time the Court was crowded by a Multitude of People, among whom was a great many Women; who, though ordered to depart, would not stir till the Tryal was over, which being done, the Jury went out, and after some time they brought him in <rs id="t16991213a-1-verdict4" type="verdictDescription">

However to encourage him, she desired him to let her have the Six-pence, and she would bring it him again within an Hour, and she would put him in a good way of living, and tell him more; with much Perswasions of her Canting Dialect, he let her have it; then she told him, he must get all his Monies together, against she came, which he did. At the time appointed she came again, and delivering the Six pence, she observed into what Pocket he put it, and immediately conjectured the Money to be there; Then she asked him if he had any Gold, he showed her some; she took it in her hand, and gave it a fill-up, and 'twas gone, but at length she gave it him again; he put it into his Pocket as before, She showed him some Juggling Tricks, till she had Juggled away his Money; Then she wanted to be gone; and told him, that some People that lived there formerly had hid some Treasure in such a place under the Earth, and if he would go, he should immediately find it; upon which he went to search for his supposed Treasure; in the mean while the Prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p>
               <p>Whereas of late some Persons, particularly the last Execution, have published an Account of the Confessions of the Condemn'd Criminals. The Reverend Mr. Allen, now Ordinary, thinks fit to acquaint the World, to prevent their being imposed upon for the future, that they are utterly false, and that no true Account of the Condemned Prisoners Behaviour, Confessions, and last Dying Speeches can be given, till next day Eleven of the Clock, which is Attested under his Hand; and constantly printed for E. Mallet, next Door to the Kings-Arms Tavern near Fleet-bridg.</p>
