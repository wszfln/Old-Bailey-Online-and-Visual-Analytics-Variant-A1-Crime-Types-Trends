            : I went with the officer, whose name I believe is Farrell, to execute the warrant; I found the things produced in a box where the prisoner lodged; he was there when I found them; I believe the box was locked and his brother opened it; they were both in the room; I believe it was his brother's room; the prisoner said the glasses belonged to his aunt; I asked where she was; he said below; I desired his brother to call her, and she came up; she said she had some glass ware but could not recollect any of these were her's; I desired her to recollect two or three times ever if any part of them were her's, or she had any like them; she said she could not recollect they were her's; I told the officer I suspected they were stole, and one piece I was certain was; it is the cup; it was made five years ago for one Mrs. Balkay; she objected to it on account of the shape, and it has remained in the warehouse ever since; the cup has a peculiarity in it; I saw it in the warehouse about two or three months before the house was broke open. The things have been in my custody ever since.</p>

On the Tuesday about six in the afternoon I was at Mr. Bailey's house, and a person came up and told Mr. Bailey he thought the man I had described was at the corner of Gee's-court, Oxford-street; that is one turning from Mr. Bailey's; Mr. Bailey called me up to go to look at Ashby; I went and saw him; he answered the description I had given of him; I said to him there is a person at Mr. Bailey's would be glad to speak to you; he blasted his eyes, his limbs, and mine' and the house, and said no one wanted to speak with him there; I said he must come; he said he would not; I took hold of him by the collar, and said I apprehended him for robbing Mr. Bailey's house, for I saw him on the one pair of stairs landing place; I took him to Mr. Bailey's house; he said he was innocent, and that he was at the Nag's-head in the Ambury at the time the robbery was committed; when I came back again I took him to the watch-house; when I took him into the watch-house he said d - n me, you took me up for the sake of the forty quid; the meaning of that word I did not know; then he turned round and looked at me with a venemous look, and said are you a man; I told him I was; then he said that in case any thing happened to him I should be in danger of my life as I went about my business; then I was ordered to go before Justice Welch.

            . I am beadle of the parish of St. Mary-le-bone: I and Hartley, a constable, were applied to, to search for the persons that had robbed Mr. Bailey; we went down to Westminster; when we came back we found Ashby was in custody at our watch-house; the next day from the information we had from Ashby we went in pursuit of M'Donald, and found him at a public house in the Ambury, Westminster; we took him out and hand-cuffed him; he said he was sorry he was taken by such a country booby as me, that he should not have minded it if Sir John's m en had taken him and got the forty pounds, and that he wished he had his pistols about him for to shoot such a country flat as me; when we came to the watch-house I searched him, and found nothing but a knife upon him; I laid it down while I went to pay the coachman; when I returned to the room I found the candle out, and the knife was gone; I searched him again, and found it in his pocket; this is the knife (producing it). There are several marks upon the box and the drawers of the instrument with which they were broke open; I asked him how he came by the knife when I found it upon him; he said he had bought it that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the watch-house when the girl challenged him?</p>
               <p>King. I was: the girl came into the watch-house, and Mrs. Denman her aunt was there, who said, should you know the man that came down stairs with his coat buttoned, and a bundle sticking out upon each side under his coat? she said yes, she should; she shewed her two people, and asked her if either of these were the men; she shewed Ashby and another man; the girl seemed to hesitate a little; I think at last she said she knew that was not the person; M'Donald was then locked down below; he was brought up; the watch-house was full of people of all sorts; she directly pointed to him and said that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought up in a pointed way?</p>
               <p>King. He was brought up quite unexpectedly, behind the people's backs; when he was brought up and introduced into the room they bid her look round again; she said that is the man.</p>

            . I am a constable: I went down to the watch-house and saw Ashby; I took M'Donald in Tothil-street; when I took him he said, d - n your eyes what is your authority? I took out a pistol, clapped it to him, and said if he offered to resist I would shoot him through the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with King every moment of the time after that man was taken till he was carried to the coach?</p>

            . I took Latimer in the Ambury: he said his name was Darts; he said he had no hand in this, but said he had been guilty of picking pockets.</p>
               <p>- Parrot. I went to take Latimer; I know no more than the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. from Ashby to Lucas. Why, if he saw me, did he not lay hold of me?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I told Mr. Bailey to lock his doors immediately, and the people were so thick about me I could not get up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could you distinguish me?</p>
               <p>Lucas. By the light of the candle.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is the bar from the landing place?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Opposite; the bar is at the foot of the landing place; it may be about two yards, or two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bailey. Is that so?</p>
               <p>Bailey. It must be more than three yards I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it four yards?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I cannot justly say it is, I believe rather more than three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Do you think it was light enough to discern him?</p>
               <p>Bailey. There were two lights in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Is there any drinking room up stairs?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080006"/>Bailey. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Why did not the people lay hold of me? if there were so many round him how could he see me?</p>
               <p>Lucas. There is a shelf by the end of the bar where the pots stand; upon that shelf there were two candles, which commanded a prospect above the people's heads; I saw him over the people.</p>
               <p>Q. The landing place is higher than where you was?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Yes; and he was the highest upon the stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. He says he bid the prosecutor fasten the door, which way then could I get out?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I look upon it before Mr. Bailey could get to lock his door that he made his escape out of the back door; the back door goes with a spring lock.</p>

               <p>Q. Might he have done so?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Yes; he might.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bailey. Which door did you lock first?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I was so confused that I do not know that I fastened one of them.</p>

            . The prisoner and her husband were at my house on Thursday the fifth of August, they were there an hour or two before it happened; they were in my house about one; she had been there about twelve o'clock, and had eat a bit of salmon.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell what you saw?</p>
               <p>Darling. I did not hear even of any blows between them; they had a few words I believe;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080008"/> I saw her stab him with the knife, as I was just come into the bar from carrying some beer; I did not know she had a knife in her hand till I saw her do the rash action; I saw her stab him with the knife thus (describing it to be a straight thrust) on the side of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if she did it on purpose?</p>
               <p>Darling. She had said she would spill his blood, and be hanged for him an hour or more before she did it: he did not live five minutes; I never heard him speak, sigh, or groan; there was a great deal of blood, but the person that supported him pinched his wound up, and stopt the bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the husband do any thing to her?</p>
               <p>Darling. What passed between them when I was out of the way; I do not know, but I saw nothing after she had committed the fact; she threw the knife down, clasped her hands together, and ran out of the house, and cried out, she had done it! she had done it!</p>

            . I am a bricklayer's labourer; I was backwards and forwards in the house; we were tileing the back part of the house; the prisoner and her husband sat in the next box to the bar; there is but a little passage between the bar and the box where they sat; his back was towards me, and she sat opposite to him; she had a bone of mutton; I never heard what they said; I heard them jawing together; she was jawing him; I turned back upon my heel, and saw the knife drop under the table, and the blood spurted over the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the box?</p>
               <p>Duncan. There was only herself and her husband; I did not see her strike him; she came out of the box and said murder, murder, he is killed; she ran out of the door; he turned out of the box, and put his hand up to the wound on the side of his neck; he took hold of the wound and said you have killed me; I asked if any man would help me, I took hold of him, and stopt the blood as well as I could, and said he should not bleed till a surgeon came; I endeavoured to get him to the door; he staggered up, but could not go farther; he dropt upon his knees before I could bring him to the air; at last I got him into the yard, he was just alive then; when I saw him dying, I closed his eyes and his mouth, and tied a handkerchief round his neck, he was not alive a minute when the surgeon came: I believe from the time he was struck with the knife till he died was about twenty five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see the husband strike her, or do any thing to her?</p>
               <p>Duncan. I did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the morning before the accident happened, my husband was bad from his work; he came home; they say he is my husband, but he is not; I lived with him eleven years, but never was his wife; he came home and called me a great many bitches and whores, and used me very ill, and broke every little thing belonging to the apartment that I had; he ran a fork into my arm, I have shewn it to a great many people; he struck me and knocked me down, and used me very ill in every shape in the world; I went to Mrs. Darling's who has had a spite against me six months, I called for a pennyworth of beer; he called me every thing that was ill; I had no person to take my part; I sat a great way from him; when the meat was made ready he eat his belly full; then he called me to come to him; he said you b - h come and eat a bit; I was overjoyed that he should ask me to come to eat with him after we had quarrelled; I went to him with as much joy as I should go into the kingdom of heaven this moment; when I came to him he took up a pipe and threw it in my face; after that I went to another box, then he threw a pint of beer in my face; I had a pennyworth of beer in one hand and the knife in the other; I threw the knife at him, which proved fatal. I beg your Lordship will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080009"/> ask Mrs. Darling whether she has not had a spite against me a good while.</p>
               <p>Darling. Never in my life; I never had a word with her.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Jury. Was there any quarrel between her and her husband prior to this stroke?</p>
               <p>Darling. I heard none nor saw none; I was backwards and forwards in my business constantly; my husband was laid down to take a nap; they were upon the jangling order, but I did not think they would have come to blows, much less to this unhappy thing.</p>
               <p>Q. From the jury. How long had they been in your house before this?</p>
               <p>Darling. Two or three hours; she did threaten to cut his nose with a pint pot; I took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. From the jury. Do you know of any beer being thrown over her?</p>

On the 14th of July last, in the afternoon between three and six o'clock, the prisoner called at my shop; he had a pair of paste ear-rings he wanted to exchange for some other things; I shewed him a number of things; nothing gave him satisfaicton; I shewed him these diamond ear-rings; soon after he was gone I missed a 5 s. 3 d. and then the ear-rings; but before the prisoner went away he said he had given me a good deal of trouble, and would give me satisfaction; he desired me to bring him one of Mr. Cox's tickets next day, and he bespoke at the same time a mahogany case with green handle knives and forks, which he desired me to bring to Mr. Johnson, No. 16, Mead's-court; he seemed by his dress and manner the gentleman; I went there, but I could find no such house, nor no such person; then I naturally concluded he was the person that had stole the 5 s. 3 d. and the ear-rings; I made every attempt to find him out but did not meet with him till about three weeks afterwards, when a young man to whom I had described him, whose shop he had been at met him by accident about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080010"/> three weeks after, and had him secured; I was sent for; I was clear to the person of the prisoner as soon as I saw him; he denied it very strongly that night; the next morning he sent for me to the watch-house, and confessed it; he said he was the person; that he was in unhappy circumstances, and that he did steal them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him it would be better for him, or persuade him to confess?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. I made him no particular promise, but that I would be as indulgent as the law would allow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I should not be hurted if I would confess.</p>
               <p>Farquharson. He told me if I would say before Justice Welch that I was not sure he was the person that he would go and take the things out of pawn at his own expence, and give them me; I said I would not do that; at last he confessed he had pawned them in Prince's-street; in consequence of which the ear-rings were produced.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you swear you shewed these ear-rings to him?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. I believe some hours after.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they shewn to any person else after the prisoner had been at your house?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. I am very certain from the time I shewed them to him till I missed them, nobody else had seen them.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to miss them?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. In a multiplicity of things one does not so soon miss things.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. Yes, very certain of it; he said he had pawned them at the pawnbroker's in Prince's-street; he named the name but I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not know the name, so I could not mention it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker in Prince's-street: the prisoner came to me on the 14th of July in the afternoon, about five o'clock, and asked to have a locket that I had lent him a guinea and a half upon a few days before; he produced these ear-rings, and desired to have six guineas in money and the locket, which made seven guineas and a half; I asked him if the ear-rings belonged to him; he said no, they belonged to a lady; he was dressed very genteelly; I had not the least suspicion of their being stole, and was very much surprised when the gentleman came to enquire after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been at your house any other time but the time he pledged the locket?</p>
               <p>Parker. Yes, he had; he always appeared very genteel when he came to our house. (The ear-rings produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. What name did the prisoner go by at your shop?</p>
               <p>Parker. Williamson.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether the prosecutor did not say at the watch-house if I delivered up his pocket book I should not be hurted?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not say so; I said I would go no farther than the law obliged me.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. He said I should not be indicted capitally, only for transportation.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never said such a thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Court. What clothes had he on when he came to buy the things of you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A lightish sky blue, and one of your showy waistcoats embroidered.</p>
               <p>Q. to the other witness. How was he dressed when you saw him?</p>

               <p>Parker. Much as Mr. Farquharson has described.</p>

As soon as I had done this both the women seized hold of it directly, took it, and went away; I did not care to make a noise at the house, so I went away home; the next day when I came to recollect I had lost this money, I was determined to see whether I could enquire after these people; I went away to the same place, where I had been over night talking with the man of the house; they recommended me to one Simmons to take these people; before Simmons went to take them,

               <p>Q. How long might the robbery take up?</p>
               <p>Carter. Only the time he was asking me those two questions; he was in a hurry; the moon shone; it wanted but three days of being at the full; and I am told it was a fine night; I did not take particular notice, I could be almost positive to the prisoner; except it was its being by moon light, that is the only reason why I can't be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason in your own mind to doubt of it; or does seeing the prisoner correspond with the idea you have in your own mind?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080016"/>Carter. Every time I see him, I think him more and more to be the man; he was taken up about the first week in August.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot yourself recollect whether it was a fine night or not; was you not in a hurry of spirits?</p>
               <p>Carter. I saw him stop the horses before he came to me; respecting the night it was not a rainy night, neither was it particularly dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Your recollection does not serve you to say whether it was a fine night or not?</p>
               <p>Carter. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The robbery was a very short time about?</p>
               <p>Carter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the man to the chaise?</p>
               <p>Carter. At the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you?</p>
               <p>Carter. It could not be above three or four minutes; I had an apprehension of his coming, when I saw him stop the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you take a view of the horse?</p>
               <p>Carter. I did take particular notice of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. If you cannot tell whether it was a fine night or not, can you say what the colour of the horse was?</p>
               <p>Carter. I cannot be positive to that; I have another reason to suspect it to be the same; at the time he robbed me, the horse was particularly shy and spirited; when I saw the horse I desired them to ride him up and down the ride, which they did: and he appears to me to be a shy, spirited horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>
               <p>Carter. The first of June; I went that very night to Sir

I took the prisoner at Hendon on the 3d of August; he was in bed with his wife, or the person he lives with; I found in the pockets of his clothes on the bed a brace of loaded pistols; and by the side of the bed I found another loaded pistol in a box; the box was not locked; in his waistcoat pocket I found two purses, one had eight or nine guineas; I think in the other four and a watch chain; the horse was in a stable at the back part of the house; Mr. Bond took him out; when it was brought to the door, the prisoner said it was his horse, and he has asked for it several times since; it is a sorrel horse with a bald face; it is pretty spirited, and jumps about, but it is not a very good one; the horse was put at the sign of the George in Long Acre.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carter. I saw the horse at the stable near Long Acre.</p>

               <p>I bought this horse of one Hawkes who lived in Paddington at the same time I did; since the time of the robbery Hawkes's father took him to a fair to sell; and he could not sell him, so I bought him.</p>

               <p>Dawson. It was before this I delivered it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you deliver up the note?</p>
               <p>Dawson. The 25th of June to Mr. Jacobs, to get it discounted; I went about three days after to see for him, he promised to come to a certain time, which he did, then he went away and sent me a letter with an engagement that if he did not come, I was to enter his house and take the goods again.</p>
               <p>It is read, in which he engages to return the note in a week or pay the 40 l. or in case of default, then that it should be lawful for him to enter his house in Great Russel Street and take his goods again.</p>

               <p>Q. You gave him the note before he sent you this engagement without any undertaking at all?</p>
               <p>Dawson. Yes; in order to get it discounted, and he not being able to get it discounted sent that engagement.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he deliver the note to you?</p>
               <p>Dawson. On the Wednesday following: I went down to Westminster-hall to see him, I saw him there; he pulled out his pocket book and gave me the note again.</p>

               <p>Dawson. The day following that he returned me the note.</p>

            . About last May, the prisoner told me he had arrested Mr. Grey for Mrs. Jackson, and that he had recovered a 40 l. note, he said it was a very good security.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this note for?</p>
               <p>Allen. I understood it was for Mrs. Jackson; Mrs. Jackson owed me some money upon bond, I had it in my hand; I understood she would give me part if she could, not all; my bond is for 31 l. 10 s. I desired him to write out his bill, and I would pay it; that I would take the note, pay myself, and let Mrs. Jackson have the remainder; he promised to do it; I desired Mrs. Jackson to call upon him to push him on with the bill; Mrs Jackson told me she had called; he wrote me a letter; he had seen Mrs. Jackson, I understood the night before; she desired when we were all three together, that I might have the note. He sent me this letter in a few days. ( 't is read).</p>
               <p>Sir, I have been so extremely busy, that I could not get Mrs. Jackson's account ready; I will however do it this afternoon and you may rely upon seeing me with the account; I have no objection, should you chuse it, to let the poor woman have a few guineas upon the credit of the security till it is paid.</p>
               <p>I am, &amp;c. R. Jacobs.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the note at this time?</p>
               <p>Allen. He told me so; I had this letter a week or ten days after the conversation I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in May?</p>
               <p>Allen. I think it was some time in May; he prosessed a great deal of love to her, and said he might have had a good deal of money and a gold watch from the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you see him in May?</p>
               <p>Allen. Only once at a public house; Mrs. Jackson was then present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand from what Jacobs said then, when he had seen her before?</p>
               <p>Allen. I understood he was very glad to see her; I am not very sure, I do not know but that he saw her the night before; think he did say he had not seen her a good while before, I think he said he was sorry he could not hear from her to have given her some support.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he say it was?</p>
               <p>Allen. He had not heard from her for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Did he shew you the note?</p>
               <p>Allen. No.</p>

             twice when I was at Mr. Priddle's, in Chancery-lane she came in when I was at Mr. Priddle's, sometime last July, I believe about the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about this note?</p>
               <p>Fleural. She said she could neither write nor read, but she had made her mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the note at this time?</p>
               <p>Fleural. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mention about her name having been wrote by Mr. Jacobs?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I think I heard her say something that she gave him leave, but she made the mark herself; I think Mrs. Priddle mentioned it was common to write people's names that made their marks; she said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it that she said she had given him leave to do?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I think it was.</p>

               <p>Fleural. Married.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you follow any business?</p>
               <p>Fleural. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In July last this happened?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Yes, about the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mr. Priddle's house?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Yes, about some business of my own, and this person came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I cannot say I took notice of that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Fleural. About tea time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Mr. Priddle's before Jacobs came in?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Yes; I was up in the dining room; there were Mrs. Jacobs and Mrs. Jacobs's mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Jackson ushered up into the dining room?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Yes; Mrs. Jacobs's mother, and Mrs. Jacobs came with her.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you that Mrs. Jacobs, and her mother were in the dining room with you, before she came?</p>
               <p>Fleural. No, they all came into the dining room together.</p>

             any questions about it?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I suppose she began telling the story herself, I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body ask her any questions at all about it?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Mr. Priddle asked her if she could write; she said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Priddle examine her to any other particulars?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I was about my own business, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jacobs at that time in custody?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Certain he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave Mrs. Jackson in the dining room, or did she go away?</p>
               <p>Fleural. She went away long before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with her?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I believe they went away all three together.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing said about it?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I did not take any particular notice about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not recollection of any thing, but those particular words?</p>
               <p>Fleural. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect how the conversation began, or any thing about it?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I suppose it began by Mr. Priddle's asking her if she could write.</p>
               <p>Q. And then she told the story immediately?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Yes, that she could not write, but made her mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she made her mark to?</p>
               <p>Fleural. To the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What note?</p>
               <p>Fleural The note in question.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she say she made her mark to it?</p>
               <p>Fleural. When she paid it away I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a very treacherous memory?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I will not say any thing but what is true.</p>
               <p>Q. Jacobs was then in gaol for forgery?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Craven-street in the Strand? is it in the hundred of Ossulston?</p>
               <p>Frith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Is it the constant course when you receive a writ not to recite it in the warrant?</p>
               <p>Frith. We never do in special capias's.</p>
               <p>The counsel for the prisoner objected to the warrant on account of informality, for that it set forth the writ to be a plea of trespass on the case, instead of a plea of trespass on the case upon promises, and upon stating their objection to the court, Mr. Justice Nares declined determining the point, but said if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080023"/> in the event the prosecutor should make out his charge, the General should have a special verdict, in order to have that point solemnly determined.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been sealed before it was wrote?</p>
               <p>Frith. They are always ready sealed.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. When you grant a warrant don't you clap the seal upon it?</p>
               <p>Frith. No, they are already sealed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not clap the seal formally upon it before you deliver it out?</p>
               <p>Frith. No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. There is no occasion for sealing it at all.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Lord Hale's words are express, if it is wrote after it is sealed it is a void process.</p>
               <p>Frith. It was not resealed although we have the seal in the office.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. We have the affidavit of the debt sworn to by Mr. Lee if there is any occasion for it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. It is not necessary; the sheriff's authority is from the writ delivered to him; if it is necessary I have the record of the conviction of the plaintiff, Mr. Lee, for perjury.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. I think the judgment was arrested.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. No, it was not.</p>

            ; the day we went to Craven-street Mr. Lee said he believed he was out a walking, and proposed to take him in the street; Mr. Lee and I went to Mrs. Mayo's; the prisoner lodged there; the street door was fastened back; it stood wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you first see in the house?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Mrs. Mayo: we went into the parlour to Mrs. Mayo. Mr. Lee asked Mrs. Mayo if the General was come in; she said he was just that minute come in; I said to Mr. Lee let us go up stairs by ourselves, as he is a gentleman we will treat him as such. I went up stairs; Mrs. Mayo told us the back room was Mr. Mayo's work shop; I went alone up the two pair of stairs; I knocked at the door of the fore room; when I found they would not open it I went down stairs again to Mr. Lee. I knocked with my knuckles at the door; a voice from within said, who is there? I asked if Mr. Mayo was there; the voice said that it was not his room, he was not there; then I went down stairs to Mr. Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know by the voice who it was that answered? was it the General's voice?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I rather think it was one of the servants. I found Mr. Lee in the parlour below with Mrs. Mayo; I went to the door and gave a beckon to my men, thinking we should wait till he came down again; when I beckoned my men I heard the two-pair-of-stairs door open; I turned round and met two boys on the stairs; I was on the ground floor when I saw the boys coming down the one-pair-of-stairs; they were upon the landing place of the first flight of steps, half up the first pair of stairs; I offered to go up by them; one of the boys stood with this knife in his hand (producing a common case knife) and said if I offered to go past him he would stab it in my breast; the other was just behind him; by this time my men were come in; Mr. Lee said to me, what! are all of you afraid of a boy? he took my cane out of my hand and beat the knife out of the boy's hand, which I took up and threw out of the window; then I turned them down and bid my men take care of them below; then I proceeded up stairs; the General I imagine hearing a noise came out to the landing place of the second pair of stairs;

             on the side of his hair and grazed the wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. When this pistol was fired did you say any thing?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I had him by the shoulder, and said for God's sake do not fire upon naked men that are only executing their office.</p>
               <p>Q. Which shoulder?</p>
               <p>Hyde. His right: his back was towards me; he said he had half a dozen more, and that he would not be taken, and then I saw him point another pistol at my face, with his left hand over his right shoulder; I gave a bob and it went through the hat of my man Henry Feltus as it was upon his head, and then it went into the door post.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the second pistol was fired was you in the room?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes, and Feltus was coming close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room when the second pistol was fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Feltus's head completely in?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes; he had stepped one foot in or more.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. The door was wide open then I suppose?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes: he reached for a third pistol and got it in his right hand; the men came to my assistance; I catched hold of the pistol and wreached it out of his hand, and then put it into my side pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine at that time in what situation the pistol was?</p>

               <p>Hyde. No, I did not at that time; this is it (producing a horse pistol); it is loaded now. (The charge is drawn and it appears to be loaded with a brace of balls). I put him in a coach and conveyed him to Mr. Armstrong's house; I had the pistol in my inside coat pocket when in the coach; I rid backwards fronting the General; the pistol pointed towards him; he said for God's sake take care of the pistol, it is loaded! I took it out and found it was cocked; I looked into the pan and saw it was primed; I threw out the prime; it has been in my custody ever since; it was in the same situation as when produced before the charge was drawn.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that as soon as Mr. Lee had beat the knife out of the hand of the boy you turned the boys down stairs, and bid the men take care of them below; did they return to the stair-case again before you got into the room?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No; I never saw them any more till I came down stairs with the General.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the General's room before you saw him?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. My Lord, the General begs your lordship will indulge him with a chair.</p>

               <p>Court. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. My Lord, the General has got his wound still; Mr. Lee has not cured him though he has arrested him for the cure.</p>
               <p>Q. Then having turned the boys down you proceeded to go up the second pair of stairs, followed by Foltus and Hyde?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the General the outside of the door?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you then?</p>
               <p>Hyde. My right foot was upon the last step, my left foot upon the upper landing place where the room is; I saw him come out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You could see the door I presume when you got to the landing place before that last slight of stairs?</p>
               <p>Hyde. There are about five or six steps; the turnings are very short upon the stair case.</p>
               <p>Q How many steps are there in the last flight of steps between the landing place next below the floor where this room was?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I cannot say, but I could from that landing place see the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go hastily up these stairs or slowly?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080025"/>Hyde. I went swift, as quick as I could, imagining the boys had left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the General came on the outside?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his entire body on the outside of the door?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes; he was quite outside of the door when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first take the warrant out of your pocket into your hand?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I had my hand in my pocket with the warrant in my hand; I told him I had a warrant against him at the suit of Mr. Lee; I took it out and opened it, and was going to give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you standing still or running on when you did the act?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I made a short stop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the upper step of the stairs to the door itself?</p>
               <p>Hyde. About five feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You was got up to the top of the stairs when you first saw him, with one of your feet at the very top of the stairs, and you say that landing place there was about five feet, then you made a short stop?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to make a short stop when his whole body was outside of the door, you apprehended there would be a difficulty in arresting him and yet made a stop?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I did not think then there would be any difficulty in arresting him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say after you had told him you had a warrant (holding it open in your right hand) at the suit of Mr. Lee for 134 l. then and not till then he drew back?</p>
               <p>Hyde. It was all in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. You made a short stop, you need not describe the motion of standing still; you made a stop - made this speech to him - took the warrant out - opened it to him - and then and not till then he drew back; then you don't know how long he had been on the outside of the door, nor how long it might be opened?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I imagined the boy left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. You imagined I suppose that the General stood at the head of the stairs to listen to what passed below; there was a struggle below?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke I suppose not soft when you turned the boys down, and bid the people take care of them below, you did not say that in a whisper I presume?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So then of course, if all these things were said, they must have been heard at that stair case where you saw the General at first?</p>
               <p>Hyde. It was a good way up.</p>
               <p>Q. It is like other rooms; there is nothing magnificent in this house; I suppose it is like other lodging rooms?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the men left below to take care of the boys?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Sleigh and Reeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Feltus and Hyde were close at your heels?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I dare say they were.</p>
               <p>Q. The General being all this while the outside of the room, in going into the room, he turned short round and attempted to shut the door; was his face towards the door, or his back?</p>
               <p>Hyde. His back; his face was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was on the landing place, as you describe it, facing you, his back must be to the door; did he, when he had got to the inside of the room, put his back to the door or his face?</p>
               <p>Hyde. His back; he had his left hand against the door; he turned in and clapped his back against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You pushed the door and found resistance?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lay hold of his right shoulder, before or after the first pistol was fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I am sure the moment the pistol was off, I had him by the right shoulder, not before.</p>
               <p>Q. If his back was at the door, how was the first pistol fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. With his right hand over his left shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. He hit that side of the door where the hinges are, when the first pistol was fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body assist you in pushing the door besides yourself before the first pistol was fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. The pistol went off directly, the moment he put his back to the door, for he reached at something and put his back against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he pistols in his hand when you saw him outside the door?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the door held hard against you from the first?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080026"/>Q. Was Feltus close by you when the first pistol was fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>

             was rather before him?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I believe so, they came up together.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the door to be quite open before the second pistol was fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Feltus came to my assistance after he fired the first pistol; the door gave a little way, I got further in; Feltus came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room when you said do not fire at naked men?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I had hold of him by the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door quite open then or no?</p>
               <p>Hyde. It was not quite open.</p>
               <p>Q. He instantly fired the second pistol?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the door was wide open then?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes; the door flew open then.</p>
               <p>Q. It was wide open then?</p>
               <p>Hyde. It was wide enough for me to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. But was it wide open or not?</p>
               <p>Hyde. It was wide enough for me to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room when the second pistol was fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else inside the room besides the General and you, when the pistol was fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. My man was close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Inside the door?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes; that was Feltus, he was as close behind me as he could be.</p>


               <p>Q. How far was the General from you when he fired the second pistol?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I look upon it he was three feet from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing to barricade the door?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Nothing but his own person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the General upon his legs or not?</p>
               <p>Hyde. He was upon his legs.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he down?</p>
               <p>Hyde. When I wrenched the third pistol out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to fall down?</p>
               <p>Hyde. By my wrenching the pistol from his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the pushing open the door then that threw him down?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he reached it?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes, from a chair on the right hand going in.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side are the hinges of the door upon?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Upon the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the General handled after this business, he was down upon the ground when you wrenched this pistol from him?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he met with several blows?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I know of none, I never saw one given him.</p>
               <p>Q. No wounds?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No; he took hold of the bannisters of the stairs, they broke, and he fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he no blow with the butt end of a pistol?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no pistol?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had none of your companions?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. But below stairs before you went, had none of them a pistol?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No, I saw none.</p>
               <p>Q. You put him into a coach and conveyed him to Armstrong's?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have kept the pistol ever since?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It has never been discharged?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that you had leave of Mrs. Mayo to break open any door in the house?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. And nobody with you said so?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask leave of Mrs. Mayo to break open the doors?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it the General's body was near the lock part of the door, and not the hinge, when you had your hand upon his shoulder?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. When you go up to the two pair of stairs is there any door that fronts you?</p>
               <p>Hyde. The General's room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you get on the landing place does the door front, or is it on one side?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Fronting.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any cutlass in the company, or were either of you armed?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No, none of us were armed, only I had a stick.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had taken the General into custody was he willing to go or not?</p>
               <p>Hyde. He would not go, he lay down and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080027"/> took hold of the bannisters of the stairs, and they broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you either of the balls in your hand after the pistols had been fired?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I saw one of the balls in one of the mens hands.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you knew the General very well; do you think he knew you?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I cannot positively say that; I was not an officer when I saw him before, I was only an assistant.</p>
               <p>Court. The General must have seen you coming up two or three steps at least?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many steps does this door command?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Five or six.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he must have seen you; did you see him?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I did not look, not expecting him.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Which way did the door open into the General's room, to the right or left?</p>
               <p>Hyde. The hinges are upon the left.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. How long was your knee in that position between the door and the door post?</p>
               <p>Hyde. A very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Where do you think the General got the pistols from?</p>
               <p>Hyde. From a chair I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Could you possibly see the General catch up a pistol you having only your knee in?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I saw him catch something up; the ball came through the pannel next the hinges.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went in, did any other go in with you?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes, Feltus, Sleigh and Reeves were just behind me; one of the boys swore the first that came up he would stick the knife in him; one said but little, the other had the knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Which spoke?</p>
               <p>Hyde. The young lad with black hair; one of our assistants knocked the knife out of his hand, we put them out of the door into the yard and bolted them both out; Mr. Hyde pushed up stairs; I heard him speak to some body, I could not distinguish what they said; Feltus and I left two men, Reeves and Sleigh, to guard the boys; Feltus got the advantage upon the stairs of me; Mr. Hyde got the door partly open and got his knee into the door; just as I came up to the door I turned myself round.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side was you on, the lock or hinge side?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Nearest the hinge; I heard them talking, but could not tell what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body upon the stairs?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No; Mr. Hyde had got up at the door before we came near him; I kept myself up to the door, and turned round; the pistol went off, and gave me a little brush by my face; I saw the ball; Feltus took it up in his hand and followed Mr. Hyde to the door; the ball brushed my hair.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the door at that time?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Not above five or six inches.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the hinge did the ball go?</p>
               <p>Hyde. The upper part of the pannel; it went through the double pannel. Feltus pushed in after he took up the ball to assist Mr. Hyde; Hyde catched the General by the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Which shoulder?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I thought he catched him by the right shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the General at this time?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I saw nothing but the colour of his morning gown. Mr. Hyde said, pray, sir, don't fire at naked men: he made answer he had half a dozen ready for us and he would not be taken; he would shoot every one of us.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the door open at this time?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Six or seven inches; I suppose wide enough for a man's hip to be in; Hyde got in; Feltus pushed in after him; he shot again, and shot him through the hat; the ball went in at the door post.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Feltus stand?</p>
               <p>Hyde. He got in at the door; I heard the pistol go off and saw the smoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any part of the General at that time?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I saw his morning gown.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080028"/>Q. Did you see the second pistol fired, or only heard it.</p>
               <p>Hyde. Only heard it; the ball lodged in the post I believe; there is a hole in the post now. I went directly into the room upon the second pistol's firing; Hyde had hold of the General; the General tumbled down with the pistol in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tumble down?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Whether he ran back and got his heel in the carpet, or what, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a pistol was it?</p>
               <p>Hyde. A horse pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing then?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I do not know that he did; we took a pistol out of his hand; I held his arm while Hyde (I believe it was he) took it out of his hand; Mr. Hyde took the pistol and put it into his pocket: he hung much by the bannisters coming down stairs; they broke; we got him in a coach, and took him to Mr. Armstrong's; in the coach Mr. Hyde's pistol hung out of his pocket; he put in his hand and pulled it out; the General said, pray take care, it is loaded. Mr. Hyde knocked out the prime, and let down the cock; it was cocked and primed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons in all were concerned in apprehending General Gansel? there were Lee the plaintiff, the two Hydes, Feltus, Sleigh and Reeves, in all six?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did curiosity excite nobody to join you? did not somebody else go into the house beside you and your company?</p>


               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion to expect any resistance that so many of you went?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Not that I know; but it was talked he was a desperate man.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you expect resistance?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to go six of you when you expect no resistance?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to go so many of you when you expect no resistance?</p>
               <p>Hyde. We did not expect any such things as happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever in your life, when you expected no resistance, carry such a posse of people?</p>
               <p>Hyde. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The first thing you say there was a struggle with a boy on the stairs?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What the boy said to the officers was it spoke in a whisper or loud?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Loud; in a great rage.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the knife was struck out of the boy's hand?</p>
               <p>Hyde. I suppose a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. How much more?</p>
               <p>Hyde. It might be near two minutes; I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was half way up stairs then you saw

               <p>Q. His back was towards you, can you swear any part of his knee was then in the room?</p>
               <p>Hyde. When I got up to him it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more than his knee in the door at that time?</p>

               <p>Hyde. I never saw any pistol but the General's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation with Mr. or Mrs. Mayo about what liberty they should give you?</p>

               <p>Hyde. About half way.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got up stairs before you saw Hyde? did you hear Hyde's voice?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body talking to him?</p>
               <p>Hyde. Yes; I heard somebody's voice but could not tell whose.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. How long was it that the second pistol went off after the words you mentioned that he had half a dozen more?</p>
               <p>Hyde. It was but a trifle of time, the pistol went off directly upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it the General made use of those words he had half dozen more?</p>
               <p>Hyde. After he had fired the first pistol.</p>

I was the first that entered the house; there was Mr. Hyde standing upon the stairs; there were two servants, one with a knife, the other I believe had not; he swore the first person that came up he would stab him with the knife; that was the young man with black hair; the plaintiff said what will nobody go up? Mr. Hyde and he went up; the first thing was one young man was handed down the stairs by the plaintiff or Mr. Hyde, then the other; I delivered them to two men below, Sleigh and Reeves; I made the best of my way up stairs; I saw Mr. Hyde and the General upon the landing place -</p>

               <p>Feltus. I did not count them, there may be five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had him all the way in your sight?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what part of the stair case did you see the General?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Just as he came out of his own door, before he came down any steps or stairs; there he stood; I was upon the landing place in the middle of it; I could see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the General standing upon the stairs when you first saw him, or coming out of his room?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Standing upon the stairs speaking to Mr. Hyde.</p>

               <p>Feltus. None to my knowledge; I was near enough to hear.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear words spoke between them?</p>
               <p>Feltus. After the firing of the first pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see the General at the time you heard those words?</p>
               <p>Feltus. No; he was in the room, and Mr. Hyde's leg and foot in the door way.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no part of the General's body at this time?</p>

               <p>Feltus. Yes, I saw Mr. Hyde's hand upon him; I heard Mr. Hyde say for God's sake don't fire at naked men.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first you heard?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes: the gentleman swore he had half a dozen more, and would blow all their brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was still in the same situation?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes; he had then about half his body in.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the general at that time?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I saw three parts of him then.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might the General be from the door?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes, very plain towards me; the pistol went off when part of my body was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Which shoulder was his hand upon?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the General's face towards him then?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes, towards me at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his body was towards you?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room was the General in when you went in?</p>
               <p>Feltus. He was upon the ground; he had fired a second pistol then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when he fired the second pistol?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes, I saw him as well as I see you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he with his face towards you then?</p>
               <p>Feltus. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. With which hand did he hold the pistol?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I think with his left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be upon the ground?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I do not know whether the sheriff's officer threw him down or no, but the next thing I saw him do was to put the third pistol towards my head.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell where he got that third pistol from?</p>
               <p>Feltus. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room was he lying down upon?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Just by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was the door when he fired the second pistol?</p>
               <p>Feltus. About half open or there away.</p>
               <p>Q. And his face was then towards you?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no pistol?</p>
               <p>Feltus. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the man that had a pistol below stairs?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you or somebody present a pistol to the lad, and hear nobody say blow the lad's brains out?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Mr. or Mrs. Mayo gave leave to break open any doors in the house?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I never heard any thing about leave to break open a door, I heard the boys when they stood upon the landing place say my master is out of town; Mrs. Mayo said he is in the two pair of stairs fore room; that is all that ever I heard; I never heard a word about breaking open a door.</p>
               <p>Court. You could see the General stand at his door when you was about six or seven steps below?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080031"/>Feltus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was then upon the landing place?</p>

               <p>Feltus. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the General at this flight of stairs?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hyde then near him or close to him?</p>
               <p>Feltus. As close to him as possible unless he had laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say when the General saw you he turned in directly?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Hyde put his knee between the door and the wall?</p>
               <p>Feltus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all this time you did not hear a word spoke?</p>
               <p>Feltus. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Should not you have heard it if there had been a word spoke? if he had spoke low you must have heard him?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. You told us just now Hyde said for God's sake do not fire upon naked men, and he said directly he had half a dozen more which were not unloaded, and that he would blow all your brains out; which hand did he hold the pistol in?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I think the left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. He held it in his left hand as Hyde had hold of him, if he fired with his left hand over Hyde's shoulder, then it was pointed at you?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I believe it was; it went through my hat.</p>

               <p>Feltus. I cannot say whether on the top of the stairs or gone down.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him in the room?</p>
               <p>Feltus. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. You say when you went up stairs you saw the General on the landing place, that on seeing the officer he withdrew into his own room, and the door was not shut?</p>
               <p>Feltus. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What position was the General in?</p>
               <p>Feltus. I believe he leaned his body against the door, and that his face was to the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body else?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. The plaintiff and Mr. Hyde went into the house first, we were waiting in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go into the house?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. Mr. Hyde came and called me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which Hyde?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. John.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he come to you?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. To the door of the house; he desired us to come in.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you at that time from the house?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. Twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when he spoke to you?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. In the street, he beckoned and said come in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean he spoke it, or did you understand by the motion?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. He made a motion; I heard him say something; I could not hear him distinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the manner of his beckoning you, what did he say when he came near you?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. When we came into the house one of the prisoner's boys came down with a naked knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he come down?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. Half way down the stairs; he asked what we wanted, Hyde asked him if the General was at home, he said he was in the Country; then the gentlewoman of the house said he was up two pair of stairs forwards; the boy said the first that attempted to go up stairs, he would run the knife in him, they got the boy down and got the knife out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there one boy or two?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. Two; we stopped them.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they go up the stairs?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. Not to the first landing-place; they were attempting to go up, and we kept them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prevent them from going up?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep them then?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. At the bottom of the stairs. When I got into the room, Mr. Gansel was down upon his knee I believe; I did not go up till the second pistol had been fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any words?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080032"/>Sleigh. No, nothing but the pistols going off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of you arms, or any pistol?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. I saw no pistol.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the second boy come, not him with the knife, the other boy?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. He made his appearance as soon almost as the boy with the knife, he might be a minute or two afterwards, he came afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went in first of you that were called out of the street?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. Feltus, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How many went into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. I cannot say, I went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else was with you there?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. I cannot remember any one but me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the parlour when you went in?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. The gentlewoman of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not John Hyde in there; had Hyde passed the boy with the knife before the other boy met him?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the second boy meet Hyde after he had passed the boy with the knife?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. He was upon the landing place.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. The second boy came down, just as Hyde passed the first landing place?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of Lee the plaintiff?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. He was upon the stairs with the boy, I do not know what became of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How could the boys return to the bottom of the stairs, if they were bolted in the yard?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. They came through the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Which of the two boys had the knife?</p>
               <p>Sleigh. The black haired boy.</p>

            . I am one of the men that went with Hyde to Mrs. Mayo's in Craven-street; Mr. Hyde was in the house before we came in; going up stairs there were two lads, one with a knife in his hand, who said he would rip us up, if we attempted to go up stairs, for his master was not at home; Mr. Sleigh and I had the care of the lads; they were put in the yard; they came up again a back way to the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pass you up the stairs?</p>
               <p>Reeves. No, I prevented them; I heard the report of a pistol, in about a second of time I heard another.</p>
               <p>Q. Before these pistols were fired had the lads passed you up stairs?</p>

               <p>Reeves. I suppose that was something: we heard that he was a terrible man; I judged so; I heard he used one Mr. Vere ill; I have belonged to Mr. Armstrong some years.</p>

               <p>Reeves. He went down stairs with the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Jury. When was the knife taken from the boy?</p>
               <p>Reeves. I don't know; I believe the Plaintiff did it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayo sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge at your house in August last?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your husband's name?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Joseph.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the officers coming to your house?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes; there was one came in first, I do not know the name of the person; the street door was open, and had been for two months tied back with a string; they came into the parlour, the parlour door was a-jarr, one came in first, two or three came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with them?</p>
               <p>Mayo. None at all; they asked me if the General was up stairs, I told them yes; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them what apartment he had?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes; up two pair of stairs, the fore-room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you go up stairs, does the door face you?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it face the stairs as you go up, or the third pair of stairs?</p>
               <p>Mayo. The stairs as you go up: I just peeped my head out of the door, and at the time there came in a gentleman that served his time with my husband. I pulled him in, and locked him in with me in the parlour. I heard two pistols go off, that is all I can say. I did not go up till next morning; the door was locked, and they had the key; there is the marks of two balls, one in the post of the door, the other through the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at any time spoke to the General concerning your apprehensions of his being arrested?</p>

               <p>Mayo. We had words several times; I told him if he did not take care of himself, he might be arrested before he was aware.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make you?</p>
               <p>Mayo. I cannot say; he never used me with great civility.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Mayo. I really cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. The General I believe has other rooms besides these two where he was at this time in your house?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Three rooms in all and a garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hire these lodgings by the month, or the year?</p>
               <p>Mayo. By the year.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years has he had them?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said to, or by these boys?</p>
               <p>Mayo. I was not up stairs; I do not know what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear them say the General was in the country?</p>
               <p>

             after he went up stairs?</p>

               <p>Mayo. He came back for a knife, which was thrown out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body that the General was in the house, just come in?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes; they asked me and I said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the officer, or any of of them had any pistols?</p>
               <p>Mayo. There was a pistol on our dumb waiter in the parlour; he trembled when he came in; he ran to the middle shelf of the waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your pistol?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes; I desired them not to take it out; but they took it. I had the pistol again next day.</p>
               <p>Q. They took the pistol out of the parlour?</p>
               <p>Mayo. There was one pistol, and they had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you the pistol of next day?</p>
               <p>Mayo. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a pistol was it?</p>
               <p>Mayo. A double barrel pistol left by a gentleman to be repaired.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Was it a loaded pistol?</p>
               <p>Mayo. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Jury. Do you recollect when this pistol was taken; was it before the General's pistols were fired, or after?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Before; there were three of them in the room as the time the pistol was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, though not quite unused to speak in publick, yet my Lord, upon an occasion like this, which is so very tender, not only to myself, but to the whole of his Majesty's subjects be they where they will; I must beg leave therefore, my Lord, to read to you what I have reduced to writing.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>
               <p>Distressed and harassed as I have been for three weeks past, I am now at a loss how to address you, upon this, to me, most melancholy occasion.</p>
               <p>It has been my misfortune to have an action commenced against me, by a person who had no just ground for such a proceeding: But this is not a time for a discussion of that point; and therefore, I shall not trouble you on that head. It is also my misfortune, that the Plaintiff in that action would not content himself with the ordinary methods of making an arrest. Had he been willing, in the usual course of such a business, to watch his opportunity, he, and his associates, might have arrested me in the open street. I went out on Thursday the 26th day of August, as I had done for several days before. It will be proved to you, that I had been with Mr. Merrick, the agent, who lives in Parliament street, for several mornings successively. On the day when I was so unfortunately beser, at the suit, as I am informed, of Mr. Lee, the Surgeon, I walked out; and at some distance from my lodgings in Craven-street, went into an hackney coach, and drove to Oxford Road; and from thence walked to Kensington gardens. I returned from thence between one and two in the afternoon. If it had been the intention of the parties concerned, to effect their purpose in a quiet manner, they might then, and on several days preceeding, have executed their process; but their design was to assault me in my lodgings, and for that purpose, they came with a numerous and armed force.</p>
               <p>It was also my misfortune, that when their designs were carried into execution, they were not content to reserve their story for a Court of Justice. The news papers were filled with long accounts, all intended to inflame prejudices against me, and in the detail, invention was stretched, to dress up the narrative with the most aggravating circumstances.</p>
               <p>But I am now before a Court, and before a Jury, that will not suffer impressions of that sort to have any influence.</p>
               <p>The case which the witnesses have attempted to make out against me, is in most of the circumstances wholly new to me. My counsel, from their practice and experience, will be better able than myself, to make the proper observations on the evidence that has been brought against me. All that I can do, is, to relate a plain account of what really did happen, and in the very order and manner in which it happened.</p>
               <p>On Thursday, August 26th, I had been in the morning in Kensington gardens. I met there Mr. Vickers, a wine merchant, who lives in the Hay-Market. About one o'clock, or soon after, I arrived at my lodgings in Craven-street. I have lodged in that house above eight and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080035"/> thirty years, and for about sixteen years of that time, Mr. Mayo has been the landlord. Being much fatigued after my walk, I went up to my bed room, which is up two pair of stairs, to the front of the house; I put on my night-gown, and lay down on the bed: my two servants, who are brothers, by name Harry and James, were in the room with me.</p>
               <p>It was my custom to keep the door of whatever room I was in locked. My affairs, I was in hopes, would be soon settled; and till that could be done, I do not mean to dissemble, that I meant by keeping my door locked, to provide for the security of my person. I know it has been propagated, in order to prejudice me, that I did not intend to satisfy my creditors: but if it were now in a trial, I could prove, that I was taking every step to settle my affairs, which, I must own, from various incidents have continued embarrassed. Till matters could be put on a proper footing, it was natural to take care for the liberty of my person.</p>
               <p>From Mr. Lee, the surgeon, I had no apprehensions, because he must know, that he has been generously paid, and that he has no cause of complaint.</p>
               <p>In this situation I was on my bed; very little expecting that my dwelling would be surrounded in the manner it was. My servants, Harry and James, were both in the room: Harry was preparing some bread and milk for me; the infirmities of my constitution make a milk diet necessary. The room door as usual was locked; on a sudden I heard a gentle tapping, as if with a knuckle. Harry asked, without opening the door, who was there, and what he wanted: somebody answered,</p>
               <p>"I want Mr. Mayo." Harry told him, that Mr. Mayo lived on the ground floor and kitchen. The man, who ever he was, went down stairs, and Harry saw him through the key hole; thereupon I ordered Harry to go down, and see who he was, and what was his business. Harry went down; from him the Court and Jury will be informed of what passed below stairs.</p>
               <p>He saw, and you will hear it from him, Mr. Lee and several men with him. At the approach of my servant, they all ran out of the house; but they soon returned, and Lee, at the head of them, went into the front parlour to speak with Mayo.</p>
               <p>In a short time I heard a violent uproar at the bottom of the stairs; Harry will tell the Court, that when they came out of Mayo's parlour, he stood on the first landing place, and asked them what they wanted. They said, they must go up stairs; and one Hyde, who was there, having armed himself with a double barrel pistol belonging to Mayo, swore he would blow out the servant's brains, if he interrupted them; Hyde presented the pistol, but Harry bid him fire if he dare. A general tumult ensued; I ordered my servant James to go down and see what they were doing to his brother; but before he went down, I locked myself up in my bed-chamber. My servant James will tell you, that he heard me turn the key in the lock, apprehending from all I heard, that I was to be assaulted in my own apartments, which I paid for by the year, and where nobody had a right to enter, not even Mayo himself, as I had a distinct property in the habitation, which I hired and paid for. I placed an elbow chair against the door, and resolved to defend myself in the just possession of my own, if any attack should be made.</p>
               <p>The noise in the mean time increased below stairs; you will hear from my two servants, that they were both seized by force, and carried by the men, who were in the combination, into the back yard, and there locked out of the house, with intent, no doubt, to perpetrate their purpose, and leave me without a witness to tell the story.</p>
               <p>But my servant Harry, as he will inform you, got down into the area, and so into the kitchen: from thence he came up stairs and opened the back door to let his brother James into the house.</p>
               <p>They both attempted to go up stairs, but were opposed by a man stationed on some part of the stairs with a club in his hand. James was not able to pass him, but Harry got up as far as the second landing place, near my bed-chamber door.</p>
               <p>By this time a body of people were committing every violence at my bed room door; all cursing and swearing in the most outrageous manner; threatening to break in, if the door was not opened; and declaring that they had fire arms, and would shoot if I resisted; I answered, and I conceive I was warranted in so doing, that I had a right to defend myself in my own house; that I had pistols, and would protect my person and my habitation.</p>
               <p>Their menaces growing still more violent, and a push being made at the door, in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080036"/> hurry, the confusion, and the agitation of my spirits, I discharged the pistol in my right-hand; the ball went through the further pannel from the lock, and in such a direction that it ascended above their heads.</p>
               <p>I was in hopes this would have dispersed them; but they were too desperate, and too fatally bent on further violence.</p>
               <p>They pressed with all their strength against my room-door; and I, on the inside, continued to push an elbow chair against it, with what force I had. But their violence was such, that they burst the door; and I fell to the ground, the chair tumbling with me; and a pistol which was in my left hand at the previous instant went off by accident.</p>
               <p>If to do bodily harm to any man had been my intention, it will easily occur to every one that hears me, that I could have taken my station at a distance from the door, and waited there till the first man entered.</p>
               <p>To hinder them from breaking in was all I intended; and in doing what I did, I submit it to a Jury of my country, whether I had not a right to defend myself in my own house? I always understood, and I understand now from the authority of Mr. Justice * Blackstone, that the house of an Englishman is his castle; and that a room which a man hires for a certain time is his house.</p>
               <p>* Commentaries, Vol. IV. p. 225.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble you with a narrative of the treatment I met with, when overpowered in the manner I have related; beat, bruised, wounded; without a coat or hat, in my night-gown, and covered with blood, I was dragged through Craven street to the Strand, there put into an hackney coach, and carried to the house of one Armstrong, a sheriff's officer; and from thence on Thursday last, to my great surprize, I was hurried to Newgate; I suppose that my prosecutors might make their charge here, to prevent my complaint against them in another place.</p>
               <p>Ever since this misfortune happened, my time has been passed in such distress of health and mind, that I am little qualified to make out my own justification. I leave the rest to my Counsel; I rely upon the wisdom of the Judges, before whom I am tried; and I rest my cause, with entire confidence, in the equity and uprightness of the gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Mayo. I think you say this gentleman had the lodgings by the year?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And has had them many years?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Before I was married; I have been married to Mr. Mayo ten years.</p>
               <p>Court. I believe as soon as you go into your house, you g o along a passage; you turn on the right-hand to your door that goes into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That door is opposite to the stair-case that goes into the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Mayo. You go strait to the stairs from the street-door?</p>
               <p>Court. So then the passage leads directly up stairs, without any communication with any room whatsoever?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Jury. Was the room door broke where the General lodged?</p>
               <p>Mayo. I don't know really.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Ashfield. I am a servant of General Gansel&gt;, and so is my brother; I have lived with the General about four years; James about three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the twenty-sixth of August when the General was arrested?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the General been out that morning?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you attend him out?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he go?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. To Kensington Gardens; I went to Northumberland-street, got a coach for him, and he walked through a passage; and from there we went to Kensington Gardens, and there we met one Mr. Vickers, a wine merchant; we walked round the gardens, and then I attended him home; he got into the coach about one o'clock, we came home a little before two.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you alight from the coach?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. In Northumberland street; from thence the General walked to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. His bed-room, I understand, is two pair of stairs forward, did he go to that room?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes; he said he was very fatigued, tired, and faint; he pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and put on a night gown and his cap, and lay on the bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080037"/>Q. Was he in a bad state of health before that?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. was you in the room when he laid down</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes; I was cutting some bread and butter for his dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. It is usual for him to eat bread and butter for dinner?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes, and garden stuff, that is his general dinner when he is not well.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this is the knife you was cutting the bread and butter with.</p>
               <p>Ashfield. The knife I had in my hand when upon the stairs, it was the same knife with which I had been cutting bread and butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was James in the room with you while you was cutting the bread and butter?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the circumstance about the tap at the door?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes; the General asked, who is that? I asked, who is that? through the door: somebody answered, is Mr. Mayo here; I said no, this was not Mr. Mayo's appartment, that he lived in the parlour below stairs: then the man went down stairs, I heard his foot; my master told me to go and look who that was when he had got down the first flight of stairs. I went to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master satisfied he was got down stairs before he bid you look?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes: then I went down stairs, and saw a man knocking at the parlour door, one

               <p>Q. Upon seeing you?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes, upon seeing me; they stayed about two minutes, then they returned again and knocked at the parlour door; Mr. Lee said, Mrs. Mayo let me in: Mr. Lee went in, and all the fellows that were with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were there?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. A great number, I believe about ten or eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. They all went in?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes, all went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs to inform your master what was the matter below?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. I told him there was Mr. Lee with a parcel of russians with cudgels and sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected they were bailiffs?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. No; I did not know what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your master's door locked or unlocked, when you came up stairs?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Then it was locked; James asked who was there; I said it was me; he knew my voice, opened the door, and let me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any orders from your master then to do any thing more?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. No; I went down stairs again, I had no orders, I heard the bolt of the lock turn when he let me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take a knife in your hand at that time when you went down?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes; I had it in my hand all the while: I went down to the last landing place before the ground floor, stayed about a minute, and then the whole party came out of the parlour. Lee went towards the street door in the passage and stood there;

               <p>Ashfield. I am sure I did not make use of any kind of threat.</p>

               <p>Ashfield. No. Hyde presented a pistol to me, and swore he would shoot me if I did not let him go up stairs, but that he would not hurt me if I would let him go up; he told me he did not want me he wanted the General. I told him he might shoot if he would, I would not let him go up.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080038"/>Ashfield. Yes; just at that period, while Hyde and I was scuffling.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that scuffle made some noise?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother come down before or after Lee struck you?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. After Lee struck me: the knife dropped upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by a blow?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. They carried you and your brother James to the back yard?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes; and put us out in the yard. I got over the rails and got into the house again, unbolted the door, and then let James in. I ran up stairs; there was a man upon the first landing with a stick, he swore he would knock me down if I offered to go up stairs: he did knock me down; the man was dressed in black; my brother James came at the same time; while he struck at him, I got past. I went to the third landing place, that is the first that is upon the second pair of stairs, a slight of stairs below my master's bed chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there what did you observe?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. A parcel of men putting their shoulders to the door; at the same time I heard a voice from below, from the parlour, why do not you begin to break? Hyde was up stairs along with all the rest of the men; he comes down stairs, and knocks me down. I heard my master say keep off, for I will defend myself; I am armed, you had better keep off, for I will defend myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was your master's chamber door quite shut at that time or not?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. It was quite shut.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that positively?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Then could you, where you was, see whether the door was upon the jar, open or not?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. It was not at all open.</p>
               <p>Q. By the voice of your master you could be able also to know whether the door was open?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes; and it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they talk about breaking open the door?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. They swore that they were armed as well as him, and they would have him; upon that instant, I heard a pistol fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them say any thing about breaking doors?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When that pistol was fired, where was you?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Upon the landing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door within view of you at that time?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the door when you heard the pistol fired?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door quite fast then or open?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Quite fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for that man to have his knee in, and you not see him where you stood?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. No, it was impossible; Hyde ducked down his head, and said, d - n him, never mind his pistols, and immediately they run up and pushed at the door: about two minutes afterwards, I heard a great scuffling and hollowing, and then before the door was opened another pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the door open immediately upon him?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. About a minute; they pushed the box of the lock off, they wrenched it so that the lock could have no power.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear by the box of the lock, that it must have been forced open?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it after when you saw the lock?</p>

               <p>Ashfield. My brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body else?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Mayo, I believe, saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Mayo see it?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Mayo. When did you see the lock?</p>
               <p>Mayo. I did not go up that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Merrick and Mr. Vickers see it?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. About two days after, Mr. Vickers came for some things; Mr. Vickers prevailed upon her to let me go up stairs; we went up two pair of stairs, where looking about the things as we were coming away, we saw Mrs. Mayo with a double barrel pistol in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the house from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080039"/> time they took your master away, till Mr. Vickers came?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Once.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a bolt to the door?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. None.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw it so wrenched, was the bolt of the lock, which the key turns, shot as if it had been locked with the key?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. It was on the outside of the lock as if it was locked.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master and you had been walking in Kensington Gardens.</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes; he leaned upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your master's custom to go to Northumberland-street?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes; he never has a hackney-coach come to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to bring that knife down in your hand?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. I was cutting bread and butter with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw ten or eleven people, describe them?</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Where you stood at the time, if the door had been but a little open, that a man's foot or knee might be in, would there not have been light enough from the top of the door to discern it?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes.</p>

               <p>Vickers. I was there the same day; I went up stairs.</p>

               <p>Vickers. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Any time after that did you go into the General's bed room?</p>
               <p>Vickers. The next day but one I did; I saw a hole in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about the lock?</p>
               <p>Vickers. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the part where the ball had passed through the hole of the door, could you observe what position it was in when the ball went through?</p>
               <p>Vickers. It must be shut I suppose; if it had been open it was impossible it could have gone in that direction; it went in a direction to the right, and mounted; as I looked through the hole with the door shut, it answered to the opposite mark in the wall; but opening it ever so little an inch or two, it put it in a different direction that I could not see the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other mark in the door?</p>
               <p>Vickers. I saw the hole in the post, the side of the door.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You think the door must be fastened because the ball took a direction to the right?</p>
               <p>Vickers. Because the ball went to the right and mounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the door had been five or six inches open, why might it not have gone in the same direction?</p>
               <p>Vickers. It did not appear that it could to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When the door is shut you can see the bullet hole in the wall?</p>
               <p>Vickers. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant was the hole in the door from the hinges?</p>
               <p>Vickers. To the best of my recollection, it might be half a yard.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Suppose the door to be twelve inches, how far might the hole be from the hinges?</p>
               <p>Vickers. About one third of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Divide it in half where must it be?</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen the door, the door case, and the box of the lock?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was the box of the lock when you saw it?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. When the door is locked and bolted, the box is so wrenched, that the least force would push it open; the screws are drawn out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the pannel, where is that hole made?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. It is rather more than half-way to the hinge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the hole in the passage?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form a judgement whether the door was open or shut when the ball went through?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. I tried it in two or three positions.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the door open so much as a man might put his foot or knee between the door and the post, could the ball possibly have taken that direction?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. I do not think it possible; I tried it at one and two inches, but could not then see the opposite mark; the other ball went into the post of the door at the height of four feet nine inches; the pistol must be near the door, and the door shut, when the second pistol went off; because the reflection of the gun-powder made a circle round, part on the door, and part on the case, where the ball went in.</p>
               <p>Q. If the pistol was levelled at the head of a man, would it have gone through that part of the door, could it have gone so low?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. It was impossible; it could not have hit him, it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you by business?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. An upholsterer and auctioneer.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080043"/>Q. How did you learn the direction of guns and pistols?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. From my ideas.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw it last Thursday, did you measure how far this hole on the post of the door was from the ground?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. Yes, it is four foot nine inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether a ball, when it is fired from a gun or pistol, carries the gun-powder to the place where the hall is lodged?</p>
               <p>Court. That depends upon the distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the gun-powder will be on the place nearest the pistol?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How does the gun-powder being on the door prove the door was shut?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. According to my imagination, it is impossible the ball should leave that circle on the door and post, if the door was open; I was employed to remove the General's pictures.</p>
               <p>Q. from the counsel for the prisoner. Pray, sir, supposing a ball is discharged out of a pistol or gun, does it not always go in a straight direction, suppose it was held the least pointing down, then the ball would have gone all the way downwards?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Mayo. When Mr. Sanderson came, did he ask whether the lock was in the same position before the accident?</p>
               <p>Mayo. Yes; I said I could not tell; nothing has been done to the lock since; I always went up with the men.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the situation of the lock?</p>
               <p>Jones. It is very clear the door has been forced open, the box or receiver of the bolt most clearly has been forced open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the direction of the pistol ball?</p>
               <p>Jones. The direction was towards the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. In what proportion did it rise in its direction from the hole at the door, suppose a level from the hole of the door is it much higher?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, a great deal higher.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to form a judgment of that hole, whether it could have formed that direction, supposing the door to be partly open?</p>
               <p>Jones. From my observation, I should think the door was shut when the pistol was fired; the hole is right through the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hole in the door case that was made by the pistol?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that go in plump, if I may so say, in a straight line, or does it go slanting from the door?</p>
               <p>Jones. I did not take much notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the ball form a right line or slant?</p>
               <p>Jones. It seems to be gone clear into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the mark of any gunpowder upon the door itself?</p>
               <p>Jones. No; I did not make an observation.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see it?</p>
               <p>Brown. On Saturday last: the first observation that I made was, upon the ball going through the pannel of the door, I put my eye to it; it carried it straight upon a line; then I opened the door; it would not go to the same direction; then I shut it close, and it carried it to the same direction; I tried it three times, I was so particular.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to the other hole?</p>
               <p>Brown. I observed the shot, I saw the door burnt with the powder, I went to put my finger to it, said Mrs. Mayo, I beg you will not touch it, but let every thing stand as it is.</p>

               <p>Read. I live in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at General Gansel's house?</p>
               <p>Read. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the door of the two pair of stairs chamber?</p>
               <p>Read. The lock staple was tore off, the screws were tore loose from the wainscot, the box was on but loose, in such a manner as that the lock could be sprung when locked; I tried it, it opened easily with the knee on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you do that?</p>
               <p>Read. Last Saturday; the hole went through, as you are the inside of the room, the right-hand pannel; the direction went up the wainscot of the stair case, and the mark where it lodged is in the landing place.</p>
               <p>Q. In what position must the door be when the bail went through?</p>
               <p>Read. I think it could not be open, at least a very little way.</p>
               <p>Q. How much could it be open?</p>
               <p>Read. A very few inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Three inches?</p>
               <p>Read. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. When the door was shut, your eye carried you to that place?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080044"/>Read. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If the door had been open ten inches, do you think if the ball had gone through in the same direction, it could have gone where it did?</p>
               <p>Read. No, I think it impossible; I apprehend the General knew better how to kill a man than fire at him through a door post; it has gone through two cases, and shivered the wood.</p>
               <p>Q. If the General had been behind the door, and the door open, could he have done it?</p>
               <p>Read. No.</p>

               <p>Read. A broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a ball is shot through a door will it take the same direction as if it had met with no obstruction after the shooting?</p>
               <p>Read. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a ball when shot off, meeting with no interruption, would take a strait direction, would not that ball by meeting with any piece of wood it was to pass through, vary the direction of the ball?</p>
               <p>Read. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not the varying of the ball he merely accidental, would not a great deal depend upon the situation of the party?</p>
               <p>Read. That is according to the piece.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Suppose two holes made by any instrument through two pieces of wood; if I can see looking through one hole, as I could through a telescope, the opposite hole to it, I must be sure what is the direction.</p>
               <p>Ashfield sworn.</p>
               <p>Ashfield. The box appeared to me to be strained; the screws were quite loose, and seemed to have been drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be done by force?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look through the door to see the direction the ball had taken?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. Yes; I think the door must certainly be shut.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the hole of the door case, did you observe that?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. I observed the post where the ball was in was burnt, and the door was marked the same as the post.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that ball could have been fired when the door was open, with that mark upon the door?</p>
               <p>Ashfield. It must have been when the door was shut.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any stones?</p>

               <p>Coleby. No; they carried them to Votiere's, and I went the next day to meet Votiere, at the Bull's Head in Beadle-street to receive the money for them.</p>

I gave intelligence to the last witness of the mare; I received it of the prisoner on Friday morning; I was going to a place called Hayes, and met the prisoner with the mare; I suspected he had stole it; I met with an acquaintance about half a mile off; he had offered it to him to sell; he asked 18 guineas and would have taken nine; he had offered it to me; we consulted together about it; we went after him and took him, and put him into the custody of the constable at Acton, and from his confession I went and informed Howes of it.</p>

            . I am a broker: the prisoner came to my house on the 11th of August, about a quarter before eight in the morning, at Kings-land, which is about a mile from Mr. Woodcock's; he asked whether I bought any plate; I was just come down stairs; I had been very ill; my wife said I sometimes did, and bid him come in; he pulled out the spoons; I asked what he would have for them; I am not sure whether he asked 12 s. or 15 s. for the four; I said I believed he had stole them; I examined the spoons to see if there was any mark on them; there was only a cypher; I heard that Mr. Woodcock had been robbed; I went to him, and asked if he had any spoons of the same pattern as them he lost; the footman brought a spoon; I could swear to the bowl as soon as I saw it; it is marked exactly the same; I saw other things in the prisoner's pocket, but asked him no farther questions. I never saw the man before, but am sure he is the person. I got up and looked after him; he said he would go to the Jews in Duke's Place; I watched him till he got through the turnpike.</p>

               <p>Q. How long would you be in taking it to pieces?</p>
               <p>Stoddard. Ten minutes in a convenient place. (He takes the watch home and returns with it in a short time).</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined the watch?</p>
               <p>Stoddard. Yes; I have taken it to pieces; I can swear positively that it is my work, though the name is erased.</p>

               <p>The evidence said at the Justice's I did not steal the watch, but the stole it himself.</p>

               <p>Q. She did not take away that silk cloak she had bought?</p>

               <p>Hunt. No; as soon as I found the cloak she fell a crying, and went down on her knees, and begged pardon for God's sake. I sent her to the Compter and the next morning she was had before a magistrate; this is the cloak (producing it); it is marked with my own hand writing,</p>

To try the truth of the story I went to Mr. Hewet's, a mercer, and enquired of him whether he had sold any silk to the prisoner; he said he had sold the prisoner some straw coloured silk, and it was sent to Nicholas-lane, to my house. I was satisfied with the account of the mercer, but as she said she had pawned some silk, I went with her to the pawnbroker's and the prisoner asked for my silk, pawned in the name of Ludlow; it is part of my silk.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Flude the pawnbroker. On the 12th of June the prisoner brought eighteen yards and a quarter of silk, and pawned in the name of Ludlow; the prisoner and her mistress came for the silk, and the prisoner said it was the lady's silk and she might have it.</p>

               <p>Ward. Yes. I bid my child give me the ring off the table and it was gone; the prisoner bid me, if I suspected her, search her; I did not suspect her then.</p>

(Looks at the will produced by the last witness) This is the will; he left it with me; I asked him if his name was Sterling, the executor named in the will; he said it was; I told him the nature of the oath, and took him before the surrogate, where he was sworn; he desired me to obtain the probate of it.</p>

On the 22d of February he brought me a probat; I took it to the South-Sea-House, and delivered it to Mr. Goodall the proper officer; on the 25th Mr. Sterling went to transfer this stock; he came to me at the Bank; he went with me to the proper offices, and the probat was delivered by Mr. Goodall. I transacted the business for him; he enquired the price; he approved of it, and made the bargain for 200 l. to Crofts at 84 7/9; to Jones 150 l. at 85.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any dividends were received?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, when your Lordship and the Jury consider the important slate of my life, I hope you will excuse me the trouble I have given you: the crime seems to be so fully proved upon me that it is in vain for me to make any defence. For the extenuation of it I can safely say at the time I committed the crime I did not mean a fraud either upon the Company or Mr. Crofts. I hope that in consideration of my youth, it being the first offence I ever committed; that the gentlemen of the jury will be pleased to recommend me to the mercy of the Court, and I would humbly hope that the Royal Clemency will be extended to me, though unusual upon these occasions.</p>

On the 1st of September as I was coming from Vauxhall, between two and three in the morning, I met with the prisoners, about the Mews stables; Davis ran after me and asked me to go home with her; I offered her a shilling to see her bubbies: then we had a long conversation. I agreed to go home with her, and did. I and Davis went to bed, and the maid came and laid her head on the pillow; I put all my things under my pillow, thinking they could not take them away, during the time I lay there. I pretended to be asleep, though I was not; Davis, as she lay, reached her hand round to the things under the bolster, and took the things out of my pocket; I was angry at the maid's laying her head there, and bid her go about her business, but she said she was to stay there; then Davis got up, and went towards the door; I thought she would return; she came back and then the maid got up and took my things, I could not tell what they were; I thought they were things of their own; Davis put them in the maid's apron, and she carried them out: Davis came to bed again, but in three minutes, thinking I was asleep, she crept gently out of the bed, and went out of the room, and never came again; then I got up and missed my things; I went to the public house, and said I had been robbed, and sent for a constable; as the constable was coming, Davis's sister went into the room, and threw the case of the watch on the tester of the bed; they had pulled off the seals; it is a particular repeating watch, there are marks, enough on it to know it; I went with the constable and found Davis at breakfast at her sister's; I told the constable that was the woman; he seized her, upon which she dropped the tooth-pick case out of her hand, and the constable took it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there a passage to go to your room without going through the shop?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. Yes; it was often left on the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Which room was the bureau in?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. The fore-room: there were three notes of 100 l. and about 130 guineas and the silver watch. When I came to London I was just come from France; I desired one Mr. Collier to take a draught to Mr. Child's, the banker, for 200 l. it was paid in two hundred pound back notes; he gave them to Mrs. Atkinson, his mistress, and she gave them to me; I had these notes several times in my hands: I am no great scholar, I can write my name, and know a little about figures. I did observe upon the back of one of the notes, close almost to the edge, there were some figures and writing, that in the midst of those figures and writing there was a figure of 3; I think I should know it again if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss those things?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. The last time I saw them was Wednesday July the 21st: on Thursday and Friday, not wanting money, I did not go to my bureau; on Saturday I wanted some money; when I put the key into the bureau I found it unlocked; it startled me; I looked for my money; it was gone; I went to Collier, about eleven in the forenoon; I told Mr. Collier I had been robbed of a sum of money, particularly those two notes I took of Child the banker; Mr. Collier and I went to Mr. Child's; they gave me the number of the notes; I went to the Bank, to the Secretary's Office; I told him I had lost two notes of that number, and begged he would search the books to see if they were paid; he searched the books and said they were not; I begged if any such notes came that he would stop them; he said he would: I went to the Bank again in six or seven days, and asked Mr. Martin if they had either of these notes; I went and examined the books again, and there was one of the notes come in letter C 125; and he told me it was brought in by one Mr. Latimer. I told Mr.

             I thought it was not good usage to pay it; I went and enquired for Mr. Latimer, who I found to be a man of reputation; I went down to Hammersmith to him; at last I found him; I asked him if he did not take a note a few days ago to the Bank and get it changed; he said he did; I asked him if he knew the number; he pulled out his pocket book and shewed me the number; I asked him how he came by it; he said he took it in part of payment for a draught at Lee and Ayton's, in Lombard-street; this was on Thursday. On Friday I went with a friend to Lee and Ayton's; I had their book examined; they took it of one Mr. Roebuck, a wholesale grocer; I went there; he took it of one Mr. Knapp, of Reading, in Berkshire; I took a post-chaise to Reading; I found Mr. Knapp; he took it of one Mr. White a neighbour of his; Mr. White took it of one Mr. Guy, a dealer in horses, at Reading;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080070"/> Mr. Guy took it of a man that bought two horses of him, that he never saw in his life time before; I asked if he was a horse-dealer; he said he was sure he knew nothing about horses for one of the two horses he sold him had broken knees, but he could not tell any thing of the man; he said there was one

               <p>Q. You are a considerable dealer in horses I believe?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. I buy a great number; I furnish the court of France.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure that the two notes you received of Mr. Atkinson, as the produce of the draught of 200 l. were in your bureau?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this room, where this bureau was, had a communication with the street, without going into the shop?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. There is a passage without going through the shop to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to lock this door when you went out?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any violence committed to that lock?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. No. I gave the key to the person that keeps the house to make the bed; I am sure I locked it on Wednesday, and had not been to it from Wednesday to Saturday.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atkinson. I live at the house of Mr. Delestrac, in Oxford-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you in the month of July last receive any particular notes?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. Yes; two of Mr. Kendrick's, two or three days after he came from France; I saw the draught given to Mr. Collier; Mr. Kendrick gave me two single 100 l. notes; I put them into my bureau and delivered them to Mr. Kendrick.</p>
               <p>William Gardner, one of the cashiers of the bank, produced a bank note.</p>

            . I am a clerk at Mr. Child's, the banker: this draught ( producing it) was paid at our shop; it appears from the indorsement to be paid to one Collier.</p>

               <p>Smith I paid it in two single 100 l. notes; I have made the entry upon the draught which was made at the time I paid it: one of the notes is No. C 125, the other B 19, for 100 l. each; I paid it the 18th of June; this is the Bank note, and here is Mr. Devon's hand writing upon the back of it.</p>

               <p>Court. I must have these books produced to see the original entries, though entered by this man it does not make a difference; as it is from the books that they take all sort of knowledge of these notes, therefore they are the best evidence.</p>

            . I was at Reading the 24th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Claxton?</p>
               <p>Jones. I have known him two or three and twenty years; he came to me at Reading, in the horse fair, and said he wanted to buy a horse or two to carry himself. I went down with him to the George, and saw Cox with him there; I said one is but a little one; Cox said will he carry me; I said yes; Cox bid Claxton go along with me and try to buy him; Claxton bought him; I saw him pay for that and the grey mare; Guy and Claxton went into the parlour; Claxton gave him the 100 l. note; Guy went into the kitchen, and brought change for it into the parlour again; he gave him a 50 l. Bank note, and 29 l. in cash; Claxton shewed me the note, it was for 100 l. before he saw the horses. I rode the horse all the way to London by the order of Claxton; I took the horse to the King's Arms on the 25th; I fetched him away the 28th, about twelve o'clock, Claxton took a stable; I took the horse there; he had it advertised; on Thursday the 29th it was sold. I never saw Cox but one morning at Claxton's house, either on the Monday or Tuesday after I came back from Reading.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any talk about buying another horse?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080073"/>Jones. After we had dined, Claxton said he had another 100 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cox there?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes; after we had diped Claxton laughed and said we have got another 100 l. note to change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dine there?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the expression Claxton made use of to you about another 100 l. note?</p>
               <p>Jones. He said he had another 100 l. to change.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say we or I?</p>
               <p>Jones. Claxton said we have another 100 l. to change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation to them about having the change of the first?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Three horses were bought?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Cox was not by at the purchasing of either of them?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, he was not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Claxton talked he had more money to lay out, did he say I, or we?</p>
               <p>Jones. He said we have got.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now his expression was I have got another 100 l. note?</p>
               <p>Jones. He said we.</p>

I have known Cox between two and three years; I think it was yesterday was seven weeks, I am no scholar, I was at the three Tuns in New-street Shoe-lane, by where I work; I saw Cox going by; he had been there before with me; I spoke to him; he asked me if I would go to Bristol along with him; he had asked me to do that before; I said it would be very expensive to go there, and I could not very well afford it; he said if you will go, I will pay your expences; I said it would be very dear; he said he would have a post-chaise; I agreed to go with him; he said he had got a 100 l. bank note; he took it out and gave it me into my hands; I agreed to go, I think as the next day; I kept the note in my custody; we set out next day, and went from the White Horse, in or near Grey's-inn-lane; it was about six in the afternoon that he came, on a Friday; we went from the White Horse in a post-chaise to Hounslow; we set out about three o'clock in the afternoon; from there we went to Maiden-head; we got to Reading the next morning between ten and eleven o'clock; we intended to stop there; seeing a fair there we proposed to buy horses; Cox said he was going to Bristol to see his uncle. We put up at the George at Reading; sitting in the parlour, I said to Cox, here is a horse fair I believe; I asked the man belonging to the inn whether there was not a fair; he said there would be on Monday; I went out and saw one

               <p>Q. Was the 100 l. note you gave to Guy, the same you received of Cox?</p>
               <p>Claxton. Yes, I had no other; I gave the change to Cox; I left Jones to bring the horses; I sold one of the horses for Cox.</p>

               <p>Q. You bought the grey horse; did you buy it upon your own risque?</p>
               <p>Claxton. No; I bought a black one about an hour or two after that, upon my own risque.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of the same money?</p>
               <p>Claxton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you money besides this 100 l. sufficient to pay for this horse?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I had seven or eight guineas; I would hardly set out on a journey without some money.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you could not go; you could not afford it?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I could not afford to lay out all my money.</p>


               <p>Q. Had you money enough to pay for it?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I think it cost 9 l. or nine guineas; I paid it out of my own money, all but about two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Cox for that two guineas?</p>
               <p>Claxton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the money in your pocket, or had you returned it to Cox?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I had returned it; but had two or three guineas of Cox's in my pocket, notwithstanding that; besides the 100 l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the other two or three guineas?</p>
               <p>Claxton. When we set out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Cox deliver to you the two or three guineas?</p>
               <p>Claxton. When we set out at first of all; sometimes I paid the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy the grey horse for Cox?</p>
               <p>Claxton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the stable for him?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I took the stable, I took it for myself; I bought it to put my horse in; the grey horse was put there to be sold according to an advertisements.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the grey horse there?</p>
               <p>Claxton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the black horse?</p>
               <p>Claxton. No; it was at the Bull at Hatton Wall, I put it there while Cox had sold this horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take a stable in your own name to put Cox's horse in?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I thought it was better to be sold there, than in a livery stable.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Did not you see Claxton take a stable for the horses himself?</p>
               <p>Jones. He said he had taken a stable that was in Hat and Tun Yard; the grey horse went there; it was a little stable would hold but one horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cox afterwards in London?</p>
               <p>Jones. I saw him at breakfast in Claxton's house once.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he been a diligent man in his business?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Very diligent as far as I have heard of.</p>

               <p>Taylor. I have seen him three or four times with Claxton at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when Cox was taken up?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I saw it in the newspaper?</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at your house any time before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes; I have seen him four or five times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in July?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe I did, but did not take any particular notice; he has been there and sent for Claxton from the Printing Office. I remember his being in company with him for an hour or two before Cox was taken up; they were in very private conversation in a box in the tap room by themselves.</p>

            . I am a constable: when Cox was taken up I was sent for to the Blue Boat Inn, in Holborn; the man put this warrant in my hand, and desired me to search his lodging; I knew where he lodged, at his uncle's, just in the neighbourhood with his uncle, a room up one-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Between them both?</p>
               <p>Morgan. It was the old man's room, but he used to make it his home. I found these six notes upon his uncle, one West; two of them are in the name of Claxton. (The last witness looks at them.)</p>
               <p>Warren. These are my filling up; here is one 20 l. and one 10 l. No. 8 the 20 l. No. 9 the 10 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, on the 23d of July last I came to Mr. Claxton's house; he asked me to sit down and have some breakfast; he said he was going to a sale to buy some trunks; I was to have one for 13 s. he had bought some; I sat down a little while; at last he asked me whether I would go down with him as far as Reading; I said yes; I said I did not know how to go because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080076"/> I wanted to be at home; he said he wanted to go down to buy a couple of horses; I said if he saw ever a one that would suit me to buy one, and I would pay him when he came up to town, for I had but five guineas about me; he bought a little poney; I rode up to town upon it; I carried it to one Gidding's at Hatton Wall; when I came up to town I gave him eight guineas for a little grey mare. I had not the 100 l. note, I never saw it; he did not shew it to me.</p>
               <p>Morgan. The uncle (West) before the Justice said he had some of them by him three years.</p>

               <p>Delestrac. Yes; the gentleman always gave me the key, and I never let any one have it but an old faithful servant whom I could trust with it.</p>

            . I live at No. 10. in Golden-Lane, Cripplegate Parish; there is a Jew lives at my house, they call his name Solomon; who is the man that received this plate. I think it was the second of April in the morning, a man came into the street and called Clarke, and this Jew that lodged backwards jump'd out of bed, as my wife did likewise; and the Jew said it is no body to you, I will go down; my wife went to the window and saw the prisoner at the bar; it was quite day light; my wife is here; I did not see the prisoner then: Solomon and his wife went out and they went away together; between five and six o'clock as I was getting up, somebody knocked very hard at the door; I went down half dressed, I opened the door and

             the Jew and his wife came in; Solomon put his hand in his breeches pocket and gave his wife about forty or fifty enamelled gold rings, and two gold watch cases; she went up stairs into the chamber with them; Solomon stopped in the shop, and presently after a man came in with a deal box and went up into Solomon's room with it; I went up into the shop to get some sticks and shavings to make a fire with, and Solomon called me down (the man was then gone) and he asked me to fetch him a bushel of charcoal; when I came with the charcoal I saw the box opened, and it was full of plate mixed with horse dung; I told him I did not like it; he said it was nothing to me, he dealt in plate: there were six or seven waiters large and small, several pair of silver candlesticks of different patterns, one was a sort of a common brass pattern.</p>
               <p>Matthews. There was one pair different from the other, and three pair alike; one pair the corners were rather sharp, the three pair were round; they had loose nossels and a little engraving on the foot and in the cup of the nossel.</p>
               <p>Clarke. They bid me take hold of one of the candlesticks and see if it would make a good shew in a beaufet; there was a silver cross for a table, an old fashion'd two handled cup, and an old fashion'd coffee-pot: the Jew sent his wife out and she return'd in an hour with an iron mould for an in got and an old man they called Boucher a Jew; they made a charcoal fire and melted all day in Solomon's room; and in the evening of the same day the prisoner came and had ten or eleven guineas, I cannot say which; and he came daily for the money for it; the reason I know it, Solomon sent for some gin, and asked me and my wife to drink, and so I saw it; Solomon told me in the whole he paid 130 guineas for it; I saw him take money at different times, a great many guineas; they came continually; the prisoner's hand was wounded, he said it was in attempting to break open the chest, but he found the way at last.</p>
               <p>Matthews. There was a good deal of blood in the closet and on the plate box.</p>
               <p>Clarke. The prisoner said they tried a large iron skewer, but it would not open the box; but at last they found the key, carried the plate out, and hid it in the horse dung behind the house, till they could get a coach to take it away; the Jew shewed me a 20 l. bank note payable to Mr. Ewer or bearer, and said he bought it with the plate; he wanted me to go with him to a tradesman to buy some chairs; I told him I would not be seen in such dirty work. I made a discovery of it to Sir

               <p>Q. From the prisoner. Why he did not discover it when I went into his house?</p>
               <p>Clarke. There were two or three cutlasses at a time lay in the Jew's room; and I was afraid he would murder us all, if we ever made a discovery; they were never without cutlasses and pistols about them.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about three years. On the 1st or 2d of April, I cannot say which, Lyon, Peal, the prisoner, and myself, set out from a house in Gravel-lane, and went up the back way to Mr. Ewer's; there was a cart stood at the back door: the front of the house is in Lincoln's-inn-fields; the back part in Western's Park, at the back of the Bull and Gate. We got upon the cart and got over the wall into the yard; on the other side there was a cistern, or dust hole, that we got upon; Lyons went in first; I went in afterwards; Lyons got over the area, put up the sash, and then put his hand on the rails, and pushed open the shutters and got in. Talbot was on the outside of the house, the corner of the park, I believe, to watch if any body was coming; there was no house we could get over to but this; Lyons proposed to get over; Peal bid Talbot go to the corner of the Park, and see the watchman did not come round upon us unawares; we got over first and came back again; we could not get the back door open; Peal took an iron and wrenched the lock off; Lyons shoved the shutters of the back window into the middle of the room; Lyons handed me out a Bank note out of the house; we took several pieces; there was a watch, a cross stand for a dish, several waiters, a small saucepan, candlesticks, and other things; there was a crest upon the plate; I believe a serpent winding round something; there were several spoons. Lyons cut his finger with taking the things out; the prisoner was never in the house; he had lost the use of his limbs, and said he would not go into the house; somebody brought me an apron and we put the things in it. The plate was put in some dung till they went and fetched the coach. When we came out Talbot was at the upper end of Wheston Park; he was waiting there till we came out; Peal and Talbot fetched the coach and put the plate in it; Peal and Talbot went into the coach; Lyon and I went home directly to bed; the next morning I was taken up, and when I was cleared before Sir John, three days after I saw the prisoner in Gravel-lane. The money the plate was sold for was divided among us at different times; I believe I had about thirty guineas of it; I was not at Solomon's with them. Talbot and I were at variance after I came out of gaol because he did not come to see me in gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Lyons like Talbot?</p>
               <p>Colby. No, very different; he is a shorter person. I think I saw the prisoner after we came out of the house, helping Peal with the things into the coach; I was so overjoyed there was so much of it I did not take much notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the bank note?</p>
               <p>Colby. No; it was sold to Solomon for 7 l.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was at Solomon's yourself?</p>
               <p>Colby. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know who the man was that carried it to Solomon's?</p>
               <p>Colby. Peal told me he carried it to his own house first, and put it in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of your own knowledge which of the three carried it to Solomon's?</p>
               <p>Colby. No; Lyons and I went home as soon as it was put into the coach.</p>

               <p>I do not know more of it than a new born baby; I have been had down three times to be tried.</p>

               <p>
