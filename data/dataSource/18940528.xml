I live at 37, Holborn Viaduct—I have made handwriting a study—I have compared the two signatures, "Golding and Co.," on these two cheques for £2 and £40—I believe the signature to the cheque for £40 has been produced by tracing from the cheque for £2—there are some smears on the £2 cheque of the same colour as the ink with which it is written, and I imagine the thin paper was wetted, which caused the ink to run—the signatures are almost identical.</p>

Tissue paper would be put over the genuine signature while somewhat moist, and gone over with a pen, and the wet on the tissue paper has caused the ink to run a little—I say it is partial tracing because it has moved; if the two signatures are put one over the other the lines at the beginning and the end exactly correspond, but they do not exactly correspond in the middle—nobody ever signs their name exactly in the same way.</p>

I was informed of the forgery of this cheque for £40, and made inquiries about it, in the course of which I saw the commissionaire—on 26th April I went with him to Barking Road, Canning Town, and he pointed out Brown without any assistance or indication—when I noticed Brown coming up the road as a member of the public I went away from the commissionaire—I did not arrest Brown then for reasons of my own connected with the other prisoner—on 4th May I saw Trist at the Old Jewry—I told him I was a police officer, and that he would be charged with being concerned with another man not in custody in forging and uttering a cheque for £40 on the City Bank—I said, "I believe your name is William John Gentle Barrett," and then repeated the charge to him—he said, "I shall not say anything"—when we got to Bishopsgate Station I said to the inspector that five blank cheques were stolen from a cheque-book at the office of Mr. Golding, and that the prisoner on that day asked for a cheque of Mr. Whitford for £2, for the purpose of sending into the country; that he got the cheque, and then invited Mr. Whitford out to have a drink, and that it was believed during that time the cheques were stolen—Trist said, "It was not on that day that we had the drink; it was the day after. That was a drink that had been owing two or three days, and we had it then. I did not steal the cheques. Let them pay me the £7 or £8 they owe me"—the charge was entered and read to him—he made no further statement—I asked his name and address; he refused them—about seven p.m. on 8th May I saw Brown at his father's house, Effingham, Surrey—I said, "I am a police officer from London, and you will be charged, with a man in custody who has given the name of George Trist, otherwise Barrett or Fitzgerald, with forging and uttering a cheque for £40 on the City Bank on 3rd April"—he said, "I know nothing about it; at least I do. Mr. Elam told me about it, and said I should very likely get into trouble as my name was upon the cheque. Beyond that I know nothing. Who says I did this?"—I said, "A commissionaire has pointed you out to me"—he said, "But he could point out anyone. Has he given you a description of me?"—I said, "Yes; he says at the time he believes you were wearing a beard, and I know at that time you had a dark beard"—I had seen him with it—he said, "That is quite right, I took it off because my friends said it made me look old, but I know nothing about it, and I shall be able to prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi"</hi>—at this time he was clean shaved about the chin—I brought him to London, and he was charged—he said in answer, "I am entirely innocent"—among Brown's effects I found an envelope containing four pawntickets relating to articles of clothing and jewellery; one was for a coat and pair of trousers—I have seen the coat; it is an overcoat—I have sent the duplicate for it to the</p>

I was house surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital on 21st April—about eleven the deceased was brought there—she was quite dead—I looked over the body as carefully as I could—I could not then find any marks—on the following Monday I made a post-mortem with Dr. Hartley—I found signs of old disease—the top of the right lung and right side of the liver contained a large cist—one of the large blood vessels had a little patch of disease, slightly advanced—the veins of the neck were rather fuller than ordinarily—none of the things we found were sufficient to account for death, and we were forced to the conclusion that it was due to heart disease, the cause of which we could not be certain of; any sudden shock might produce it—a violent blow in the chest would be likely to bring on heart disease—I should think such a blow given within half-an-hour of death would account for the death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw no sign of any blow, only a bruise on the right elbow—that was not an old bruise—if it could be shown that the woman was constantly fainting, it would show that her heart was more likely to fail under any shock—I should not have judged from the look of her that she was a woman of weak heart—there was nothing to make us think that she was liable to fainting—her condition showed that she had got to her monthly periods—that would make her more susceptible—I was asked before the Coroner if a blow in the pit of the stomach would cause this death—I said I could not say—if a person was taken in this way, without any blow, I should expect to find signs of it in the heart</p>

I found her not very well, and I asked her if she still made up her mind to go; we did go. She had not been there about an hour and a half when she became faint; we started to go home. Going across the park, I asked if she would not rather ride; she said she thought the park would do her good. Going along Spring Gardens she staggered; I put my arm round her to save her, and that is what Mrs. Brooks might have taken for a blow. I never gave her a blow in my life."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chainboy to a coalman, at 38, Montagu Road, Hackney Wick—on 21st May, about 6.30 in the evening, as I was standing at the corner of Gainsboro' Road, I saw the prisoner with a child in her arms—she walked deliberately into the River Lea, and fell down on her face, with the child underneath—I went to the boathouse opposite, and got a scull, but I could not reach her with it—I then went for a boat, and I saw the witness McKevitt get a boat and shove it to her side, and he and two men pulled her out—a constable came up—it took full five minutes to get her to—she was unconscious—they got the baby away from her first—she had hold of it the whole time—I noticed her before she jumped in, for about a hundred yards—she did not seem as if she was drunk—she was not staggering at all—I did not notice any<lb/>thing about her manner.</p>

In consequence of instructions I went to 48, Milton Street, Spurgeon and Stevenson's warehouse, on 26th April, and kept observation outside for some time—about half-past five I saw the prisoner with a boy and a truck—the truck was left in a court adjoining the premises, and the prisoner went into the warehouse—I saw him come out several times carrying goods, which he placed in the track—he went away, the boy pulling the truck—I followed and stopped him in Moor Lane—I told him I was a police officer, and that anything he said might</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280019"/>
               <p>be used in evidence—I asked him for the invoice for the goods he had on the truck—he handed me this invoice for £5 7s.—I said, "There are twice as many goods on this truck as are on this invoice"—Mr. Stevenson came up and spoke to him, and the prisoner said, "There is a slight mis<lb/>take; I will take them back and have them entered up"—I stopped the truck and found on it, beyond the things on the invoice, three packets of colour, fifteen pieces of muslin, three reams of tissue paper, and two boxes of wire—Spurgeon and Stevenson are artificial florists; they issue unmanufactured goods to makers, who bring them back manufactured—I took the prisoner to the station, and afterwards I went back to the warehouse and arrested Vyeria, and he was charged with the prisoner at the station—the prisoner said he would do anything to settle the matter; he appealed to Mr. Stevenson not to press the case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not say he was innocent, and that he could explain matters satisfactorily—the goods on the truck were done up in packets—I knew that only half of the goods on the barrow were in the invoice, because of the bulk which had been carried out—I knew what the boxes of tray wire were, and there were two on the invoice, and four on the truck—Mr. Stevenson was close to me the whole of the time—he said to him that the goods were from Spurgeon and Stevenson—I did not hear the prisoner say at the station to Mr. Stevenson, "It is a pure mistake, and if you will be good enough to go into it we shall be able to settle it. I will swear to you there was no dishonest intention"—I did not hear the whole of the conversation, and that might have been said—the prisoner was not there when I charged Vyeria—Vyeria said, "I know there was a slight mistake. I intended to enter them up to-morrow"—I am certain the prisoner did not say he had not looked at the invoice—the prisoner said at once when I stopped him, "If there is a slight mistake, I will go back to the warehouse and have them entered up"—at the station he did not say in my presence that he was innocent—as far as I know he wished to settle it, but he did not assert his inno<lb/>cence—I was present when the inspector took the charge—I never heard the prisoner say he was innocent—he only said there was a slight mistake, and appealed to Mr. Stevenson to settle the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artificial flower and feather warehouseman at Milton Street, trading as Spurgeon and Stevenson—we sell the raw material to makers to make up—up to 26th April Vyeria had been in my service for about nine years—he is about twenty one—he sold the flowers to the makers and dealers—up to that time he had borne a good charac<lb/>ter—I had every confidence in him—Nardie had been a customer for some years—on Wednesday, 17th or 18th April, Hughes said some<lb/>thing to me, in consequence of which I communicated with the police—during the morning, up to twelve o'clock, which is our busiest time in the material department, Vyeria would call out goods to a lad at the desk for him to take down; but during the afternoon it was not unusual for him or anyone who served material to take this day-book and enter it up himself—on 26th April, about 5.30 p.m., I saw the prisoner go into the warehouse—there would be perhaps two or three people there at the time; Vyeria would be one and Galbraith, and perhaps one or two lads at the desk, entering up flowers to go into the country—the usual number of hands would not be there then be<lb/>cause</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280020"/>
               <p>it was tea time—I was with Wise when he stopped the prisoner—I asked him if the goods he had in the barrow all came from our place, or where they came from—he said, "Your place"—I said, "All of them?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you an invoice for them?"—he said, "Yes"—Wise handed me this invoice, and asked me to check them—I asked him if there was anything in the truck which was not on the invoice—he said, "No; if there is it is a mistake"—I checked the goods and found there were goods to the value of £6 15s. not charged on the invoice—I afterwards looked at the day-book, and found there goods to the amount of £5 7s. entered against Nardie in Vyeria's writing, the same as the in<lb/>voice—Vyeria afterwards pleaded guilty at the Guildhall Police-court—I examined my stock on 18th, and missed a packet of lawn—the prisoner has been coming to my warehouse two or three times a week perhaps—he has come between one and two, dinner time, and about tea time, the quietest times of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are two or three people about between one and two as a rule—Nardie would not pay for goods; there would be a contra account; he would bring back manufactured flowers—he generally owed us money—that is not the usual condition of our trade—people pay for the material they have with manufactured flowers, and if there is any balance to their credit they draw it—I believed Vyeria was thoroughly honest—I have no proof that he had not been honest except in the case of Nardie; I believe he was honest with that exception—he pleaded not guilty at the Police-court—when I saw him I did not tell him that if he pleaded guilty I would do my best to get him let out on his own recog<lb/>nisances—I said it would be best for him to speak the truth—I do not know if there is a custom of accommodation in our trade—a man bringing a portion of some goods would not be allowed to have the whole of them entered, and then bring the balance the next day—since this case started I have heard it has been done in the case of Quicksley, not in several cases—I did not cease making investiga<lb/>tions into our books when Vyeria consented to plead guilty—I have not gone through his transactions in our books—I do not think I should have done that if his case had been tried out, to see if he was guilty in other transactions—the whole of the prisoner's business was his father's, and is so still—we trusted the father—I know R. Dunton—I cannot say if he is a perfectly honest man—I have not seen him for a long time—I have my book with entries of goods ordered through Vyeria—I have not got the delivery book of goods sent out—Hughes would not have it—sometimes customers sign for goods when they are sent out—that book could be got—I don't know if Vyeria has been going in for a long course of dishonesty with other people—if an account were against the manufacturer of arti<lb/>ficial flowers, the seller would have no business to let him have goods and not enter them up in the book until he had brought sufficient flowers to cover the cost of the goods—in the only case I know of where it was done, previous to the goods leaving the house a list was made up and handed to the boy at the desk to enter on the Friday, and they were entered on Monday night and Tuesday morning—I have the entries here—I have not heard that before Christmas the same thing was done in the case of the prisoner—I only heard of this agreement between the prisoner and Vyeria</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280021"/>
               <p>on the 18th of last month—from what I have been told I should think it had been going on from Christmas—I don't remember the prisoner saying at the Police-court that he was innocent, that he had no dishonest intention—when he was charged he said that the goods were to be entered up the next day, and he also sent word by the inspector that he wished to speak to me—that was before the case came on—I saw him—he said he wished to speak to me privately, and the inspector told him that anything he wished to say he would have to say in front of him—I said, "Do you wish to say anything?"—he said, "I find I am in a very serious position. Cannot this matter be settled? I will pay you any amount you like to name"—I did not say that at the Police-court, because I was not asked—I don't remember his saying he had no dishonest intention, and that under the circumstances I ought not to prosecute; I will not say he did not say it—if I had known that Vyeria had been dishonest with other people, I should not have adopted the lenient course I did with him—I don't think there was anything dishonest in Quicksley's case; the list was made out before the goods left the warehouse—Vyeria did not understand that if he pleaded guilty to this charge he would not hear anything more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Nardie, senior, is in Court—no entry was made in the day-book of the Quicksley transaction on the day on which the goods went out, but the list was handed in to be entered afterwards; and when it was entered it was a correct entry—we do a fair business—we must trust our salesmen—we could not accurately check our stock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was never under Vyeria, he was in a different de<lb/>partment—buyers do not always check goods when they buy, unless it is a small parcel—this which the prisoner bought was a large parcel—I produce our firm's delivery signature book—I know that Mr. Dunton used to be served by Vyeria—it is the practice of our firm for a purchaser to sign this book when goods are sent out—I brought this book with me; it is a book that has been done with, and I have had it in my possession about a month—it belongs to the firm; our packer, Rutland, gave it to me—no one told me to bring it here; I have not done it for any particular reason—I have the pages marked as to which I was going to give evidence; no one told me to do that; I did it with my own free will—the goods entered here to Dunton are not entered in the day-book—another young man knew I had got this book—it is the packer's book; he has to get signatures for goods he has taken out—I find in it on 29th November the signature of Mr. Dunton, "Received one box"—that box does not appear in the day-book—I do not keep the books—I have been through them purposely to find this out—I saw them on the entry desk; we are permitted to enter goods—I told the clerk Blades, who had charge of that book, that I wanted to trace out Dunton's entry—Blades is not here—I did not tell Mr. Stevenson—I really only did it to find out</p>

               <p>what had been taken; I did not see any harm in it—Vyeria said in a letter that he had been led away by the prisoner, and after that I made investigation—on 2nd January, 1893, I find in this signature book a box signed for by Mr. Dunton; that is not entered in the day-book—I have seen Nardie two or three times since he was at the Police-court—I have not got hold of this book at his instigation—I fur<lb/>nished him with the information about Dunton, and gave him the dates—that was behind my employer's back—on 9th March, 1893, I found a box signed for by Dunton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I made no entries in the signature book myself—the book does not show which of the salesmen sold the goods to Dunton—the prisoner did not ask me to look the book up—I have seen the prisoner's solicitor; the prisoner told me to see him—I showed him the book—I knew he was against my master—I told Mr. Stevenson that I had set a young man to watch the prisoner on the 17th, and he was under the impression that he had seen these goods go out—I told the young man to watch, because I knew there had been something going wrong in the firm—I reckon that Mr. Sinclair had goods—I told the young man to watch the prisoner, because I saw that he and Vyeria were very friendly—I had seen them go together into a public-house in Moor Lane, and my suspicions were aroused—there was nothing else to arouse my suspicions about the prisoner—I spoke to Sergeant Wise about this; I don't know now what I told him—I did not tell him I had seen him taking out more goods than had been booked to him; nothing of the sort—I told Wise I had sent Black to watch, and I had said, "If you see Nardie come in let me know; if you see more goods go out than are entered you let me know"—when they came from tea on 17th, Black said Nardie had been in, and he was under the impression that goods had gone out—I spoke to my master the following day—I showed this book to the prisoner's solicitor, because I thought Vyeria had acted under a cloak—he said in his letter he had only been doing this for about six months, or something to that effect, and that he had been robbing my master in other cases than the prisoner's—I told my master about Sinclair; I told him the same day as I told him about the prisoner—I did not men<lb/>tion anything else—that was before I had seen the prisoner's solicitor, and taken him the book—I went to the prisoner's solicitor, rather than to my master and his solicitor, because I thought that the prisoner was being very hardly dealt with, because of Vyeria saying in his letter that the prisoner had led him away, and so on—I did not think it hard that the prisoner should be caught, and the other men get off—I thought it hard that the prisoner should get caught on this, and then have Vyeria's evidence as well to say that he was the man that led him away, and that Vyeria had only been doing it for six months—I thought it hard that Vyeria should get off cheap, and that the prisoner should not—I have not been very friendly with the prisoner—I have not been out with him or his friends—I have seen him about three times since he has been out on bail—I saw him on Saturday afternoon in Pitfield Street, and went with him towards his house—Black told me he thought he saw the prisoner take the goods; I thought from that that something was wrong—I went to his house after I had been to the Police-court, and after Wise and Mr. Stevenson had given evidence—I thought Vyeria had been doing it with others—</p>

               <p>no one has paid me for this amateur detective work—I only went to the solicitor's office once, and that was last Saturday week—I took this book with me, and I said Vyeria had robbed the firm before this particular time, and I gave them the dates of Dunton's.</p>

Spurgeon and Steven<lb/>son's employ for nine years; for about four years as salesman—I have known the prisoner for some time—I was charged with stealing these goods, value £6 15s. 10d., from my master—I pleaded guilty before the Alderman, and was bound over to come up for judgment—on 26th April the prisoner came to the office—I was in my department—two boys were at the desk making out invoices, and someone else was there, and I think the others were at tea, or gone—the prisoner delivered some goods, and said he wanted some preparations—I served him with some—I made out this invoice—I served him with other goods besides those on the invoice: two boxes of tray wire, three packets of colour, pieces of muslin, and three reams of tissue paper—I made this entry in the day-book—I let him have those goods in pursuance of an arrangement made between him and me about six or seven months ago, when he came and said his father was going away and had left him in debt, and he wanted to clear it off if possible, and if I could do anything for him he would see what he could do for me—I did see what I could do for him, and I did what I did on April 26th, and at various times before then—he came to the warehouse sometimes only once a week, very seldom oftener; he had been away for a month or more—he did not every time he came have goods which were not invoiced; he had them about every other time—the money he made was supposed to be shared equally between us—I have had about £15 or £16 from him—I should say he has had between £40 and £50 worth of stuff from me which was not invoiced, under the arrangement, and which my master has lost—I gave Quicksley goods without invoicing the, but they were entered correctly two or three days afterwards—before I pleaded guilty I wrote this long letter to my master, by the advice of my people at home—I wrote this letter in consequence of the prisoner coming to my house on Sunday and saying: "I want you to come back with me; I want you to write out a statement"—he had got this written down in black lead, and he asked me to copy it, and I took it down at his dicta<lb/>tion—he took it away, saying, "I will copy this and give it to the solicitor"—that was on the Sunday after I was charged, the 29th—I afterwards spoke to my people, and then wrote this letter to Mr. Steven<lb/>son</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This statement was read. It concluded</hi>: "I had no idea of doing anything wrong. It was merely a matter of obliging Nardie, whom I had known for years as a customer")—the prisoner did not suggest the whole of the statement—the part about the place being watched by detectives is my own; I told that to the prisoner, and he had it written in—all the state<lb/>ment</p>

I am a surgeon, of 2, Kingsland Road—on May 22nd, about 6.30, I examined Mrs. Mack at the police-station—she was suffering from burns on her face and neck and a bruise under her right eye by some<lb/>thing having struck her—the burns were caused by chloride of lime, and there was chloride of lime scattered about her hair—if it had gone into her eyes it would probably have blinded her—she is disfigured a little, but it will pass away, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bruise on the right side of her face would not be from a rebound, but from a direct blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the magistrate</hi>: "I went downstairs to the closet. On my own way down I opened the staircase window. As I came back, the prosecutrix faced me; she was furious, and said she would not have the window opened; she closed it suddenly, and the lime struck the window sash. There was not sufficient lime to cover her as she was covered an hour an a half afterwards, when the doctor saw her".</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's defence.</hi> Mrs. Mack is most violent women. I thought it was necessary to have the place ventilated, and opened the window. I was going to throw the lime out at the window, she closed it again, and the bowl struck the window frame and splashed in her face. She stood there screaming three or four minutes, but never complained about being struck by the bowl or by the lime, and I had no idea she was hurt by it.</p>

Watney Dutton and Co., for the thirty Alhambra shares—William Heath Bailey is the transferee—he brought or sent this memorandum; it is in his writing—the transfer was ready on the 15th; this is it—it was duly executed and delivered to the prisoner, and the shares were transferred accordingly—the transfer is dated September 27, when I gave it to the prisoner—in all probability that is when the transferee executed it—between September 15th and 26th I had various conversations with the prisoner—I wanted my money—he said he could not give me the money at present, because he could not get it from Mr. Bailey—the transfer was sent for on the 26th, and handed to the prisoner's clerk by my permission; and the prisoner called that afternoon and brought me his own cheque for £663 10s., which was paid into my bank and returned, marked "Not sufficient"—I parted with the transfer believing he was in a position to get the money from Mr. Bailey and pay me—I produce the prisoner's day-book, and find, on 11th July, this memorandum: "W. H. Bailey, Esq. By sale to you of 50 Alhambra shares at £22. 10s. per share, £1,125," and on the same folio, on the credit side, I find, "James Debenham, July 11th. To purchase from you of eight Alhambra shares at 22 1/2, £178"—on August 16th here is another entry showing that he bought four more Alhambra shares from me at 22—on September 8th here is, "To purchase from you of thirty Alhambra shares at 22 3/4 "—on July 11th here is a credit to Mr. Bailey in the ledger of £200, on August 19th of £498 8s., and on August 31st of £404. 78. 6d.—I produce the different receipts and counterfoils showing that he received these sums.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Craven Hill Lodge, Hyde Park, and am of no occupation—I first saw Benje in March, 1892, and this conveyance was executed.

(<hi rend="italic">This was between the same parties, and stated that notwithstanding the absolute sale, in case of recovery the proceeds are to be divided into three parts, that each party might receive a third.</hi>)</p>

I met Benje at Mr. Clifford's office, not by appointment—I did not know he was coming—Mr. Clifford is a house agent—he did not mention Benje's name, but he came into the office while I was there—Benje explained to me that Mobbs' estate be<lb/>longed to him—I said, "How can you prove it?"—he said, "I have deeds and documents to prove it, and, if I can find somebody to finance me, I will take it up"—he said, "I will call again to-morrow about 10.30 or eleven, and will you be there?"—I said I would finance him if it turned out right—I think I went to Somerset House with him at eleven or twelve o'clock; at any rate, he was there—he gave me the date of John Mobbs' will, and I searched and was satisfied—I did not see Carter's will, but he said he had it and could produce a copy—we met again next morning—he asked for some money as he was hard up, and I gave him 10s.—he produced a copy of John Carter's will, and a copy of a convey<lb/>ance—I did not see the original, but he said he had it in his box, and said he had all the pedigree of Mobbs—I was quite satisfied with what he told me—I did not take any security for the 10s.—we made a verbal arrange<lb/>ment that I should finance him as he required money; there were several deeds which he said we should find, but we did not—I asked for a certifi<lb/>cate; he said we were certificate mad—I spent, I should say, some £100 before the deed was signed, to supply him with cash for all the expenses—I have no cheque to show; it was cash; it was for all the searches in the county of Northampton—I paid to him £50 or £60 in small sums before the deed was signed—the £60 was paid between Mr. Clifford and I—I drew up this deed, and on April 14 Benje came of his own accord to Mr. Clifford's office to sign it—we had some refreshment in the office, and I paid him £5 in gold—I did not put it in an envelope—he did not say, "This is not all!"—he has issued a writ—Mr. Moody issued it for him, but the action was not con<lb/>tinued—Mr. Moody went over to New York—I read this deed to him in the presence of Mr. Clifford and Mr. Danlio, a witness—I was quite satisfied with the bargain at the time—it was arranged that we should divide it into three; no other agreement was formed.</p>

I am a bricklayer, of 57, Sixth Avenue, Queen's Park, Harrow Road—Benje lodged in one room in my house from December 20th, 1891, to December 10th, 1892, when he left £32 5s. in my debt—he paid a little—I detained a box, and he had me locked up for it—I did not give it up, the police kept it—he showed me a will he had made; he was always making wills—he borrowed money of me—these are two of the wills he showed me; this one relates to the Hoxton estate, in which he left £10,000 to me and £5,000 to my boy, and in the other he leaves me an ostrich farm in South Africa of sixty acres.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 2, Gresham Buildings—in October last Russell was introduced to me by a friend of mine, and came to my office to know whether I would act for him about some property, value £1,200—I went and saw a firm of solicitors two or three times, but nothing came of it—I saw him continually to the end of October, and about November 12th or 13th he came to see me, and said he would introduce me to Mr. Benje, a friend of his, who had a lot of property in Hoxton, so that I might sell the leases and act for him gene<lb/>rally—he said that Benje was an old workman who wanted to settle up his property and go to Wales, and he had 250 acres in Hoxton—on November 17th he brought Benje, and explained to me that, as money was scarce with him, they had prepared the lease themselves, and asked me to witness their signatures, which I did—Russell did not say any<lb/>thing about 49, Whitmore Road; he mentioned that Benje was to grant a lease to him of some property, and he produced a draft lease of 49, Whitmore Road, and asked me if I could get somebody to lend him some money on it—I took the draft deed to a client of mine, who</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280037"/>
               <p>went to see the property, and next day Russell came in a great hurry, and wanted the draft deed back again—that was before November 17th, and on November 17th Benje and Russell and a third man came, and Russell asked me if there was a receipt on the back—I said, "No, there is in the body of the deed"—I attested both the lease and the counterpart—it purports to be a lease from Benje to Russell, in con<lb/>sideration of £250, for a term of eighty years, at a ground-rent of £4 a year—I filled up two or three blanks, and they took it away—Benje executed the counterpart merely—Russell said nothing that day about Benje owing him money, but afterwards he said that Benje owed him a great deal more than that—on the Wednesday in the next week Russell came to my office, and said he had been trying to raise money on the mortgage of the lease, and had got somebody to entertain it: he had been to see a firm of auctioneers in Oxford Street, and got £25, and on the following Saturday morning the transaction would be completed—after going to Mr. Phillips' office two or three times, I went upstairs and left him—Russell came with Benje the next day, but nothing par<lb/>ticular happened—the next time I saw him he told me he had taken the lease to Mr. Read, of Foster Lane, who would make him an advance to take up the lease from Mr. Phillips, and would I do it, as it would be a great convenience to him—I refused—he said Mr. Read was going to lend him £150 on it—he explained that he could not get the original lease from Mr. Phillips, and would I run downstairs and ask Mr. Benje to let him have the counterpart—he said that Benje was in a public house, but we met him, and ho said, "I will go and fetch it"—he did so, and brought it in three-quarters of an hour—Benje retained me as the solicitor to recover for him a large estate in Hoxton, and gave me the will of John Parker—I said I would act for him if he gave me the money—he never brought any money, and I never did it—I wrote several letters to Benje—this is one.

               <p>or twenty-one years, with the usual covenants to repair and insure—I understood that the lease was in Mr. Phillips' hands for an advance of £25, and was told that I could see the counterpart—I instructed Mr. Brown to examine it with the counterpart—the consideration was £250, and the ground-rent £4—I prepared the mortgage and the under lease to Mr. Shuttleworth, who signed them both in my presence on December 4th, 1893, and I completed the mortgage on December 5th—Russell claimed the mortgage—I paid off Mr. Phillips £25, with an additional guinea; I also paid Mr. Wallace, a solicitor, £17 10s., on Russells authority; it was the claim of Mr. Andrews which Mr. Russell sanctioned by his letter—I handed the balance, £81, to Russell after deducting commission and my charges for stamps—I registered the mortgage and the lease from Benje to Russell, and insured the property for £400 pursuant to the covenant—Shuttleworth is described as a refreshment-house keeper, and it was ar<lb/>ranged that he was to put it in repair, and open it as a restaurant—I wrote to Benje because I found it had not been done—this is the letter—he came two or three days afterwards, and said he would see that what was necessary was done, and he would hold me harmless.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the D division—I have had experience in the making of plans—on Sunday, 18th March, I went to 51, Graf ton Street, Fitzroy Square, and examined the front and back rooms, first floor—I took careful measurements, from which I prepared the plans which I now produce; they are accurate—there is a landing outside the entrance to those two rooms, and they communicate internally—the back room looks on to a small back yard—as you enter the door of the front room there is a fireplace on the right, with a marble mantel-piece, the jambs of which are of marble and wood; the side has a sharp edge—this card model shows a section of it—on each side of the fire-place there is a cupboard, which projects into the room further than the chimney-piece—the front room is 16 feet by 5 feet, and the back room 13 feet by 10 feet—there was no furniture in the rooms when I was there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280042"/>
               <p>on the Sunday; they were quite empty, and the floors were very dirty—there had been a fire in the front room recently; there were ashes in the grate—the back room did not appear to have had any fire in it—there was a quantity of paraffin on the floor of the front room, facing the window; the stain extended almost up to the cupboard door; a quantity of washing blue was amongst the paraffin, which was joined by a stain of blood facing the left-hand cupboard—it went under the door into the cupboard about an inch and a half, where I found some congealed blood—there was a smear of blood on the left-hand corner of the cup<lb/>board door—there was also blood on the left-hand side of the jamb of the chimney-piece, on the moulding—the first stain was one foot from the ground, and was six inches long and about an inch and a half wide—then there was a space of three inches, and again another stain eight inches long, in which I found some pieces of hair, which I gave to Dr. Lloyd—one stain extended towards the ironwork of the grate—there was a splashing of blood almost in a line with the bottom stain—on this plan I have marked the position of the blood-stains—on the side of the door leading into the back room I found blood-stains—in the yard there is a sink, a grating; I there found a large quantity of congealed blood, as marked on the plan—I showed that to Dr. Lloyd; there is also a tap for water at the side of the w.c.—at the station I saw a wicker arm-chair, the seat of which is about thirteen inches from the ground; also a piece of iron, which appeared to have been used as a poker; it weighs two pounds six ounces, and is nineteen and a half inches long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to 51, Graf ton Street, with Mr. Taylorson, managing clerk to Mr. Newton, solicitor for the prisoner—I saw a great quantity of small splashes of blood on the left-hand cupboard, but they were so minute that they would be invisible on the plan—the mark at the bottom of the cupboard has sunk in very much; it had been washed; the blood seemed to have trickled down; it was thicker at the bottom—I was present when this model was taken—the blood-mark at the bottom of the cupboard is a smear that might have been caused by any<lb/>body with blood on the hand trying to open or shut the door; it had evidently been wiped by a cloth—the stain on the moulding is a large one—the marks on the communicating door are close to the bottom of the door—the mark on the handle might have been by someone taking hold of it with blood on the hand—the space between the fireplace and the wall is about three feet—the blood in the yard was close against the sink; when I saw it a pail was standing over it, so as to preserve the mark—the sink is simply a drain; the tap is about two feet from the sink—the staircase is about two feet broad, and the landing about four feet ten inches—it is a very old house, with ordinary wooden flooring—I took this photograph of the trunk and the fender.</p>

I am a horse trainer—on 15th March I lived at 17, Albany Street, Regent's Park—the deceased, Charles Anthony Stephens, was my father—he was a retired cabdriver—he used to drive his own cab—he was seventy-one years old—his height was about 5 feet 10 3/4 inches, and his weight about fifteen stone; he was a stoutish man—he was in good health, and active for his age—I was living at 17, Albany Street, at the beginning of the year; my mother died on 16th January—she had an account at the London and South-Western Bank, Park Street—after</p>

               <p>her death the account was transferred to my father—he was in the habit of carrying money about with him; he always had gold and silver about him—since the death of my mother he has taken to drinking to some extent—when in drink he was always very jolly, not quarrelsome—on Thursday afternoon, 15th March, I saw him at 17, Albany Street, about half-past five; he then appeared to be in his usual health—about half-past seven or eight I heard him leave the house—he did not return that night, or the next—on Saturday, the 17th, I went to Albany Street Police-station, and after making inquiry there I went to Tottenham Court Road station, and there saw the dead body of my father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was a big man, and very strong and active for his age when not in drink—he was frequently in drink since my mother's death—he always had money—the banking account was in my mother's name—when she died there was £50 in the bank—I know he drew it all out within nineteen days of her death—I would not swear that I have seen him with £5 notes; they appeared to be notes—I have seen him with a £5 note on several occasions; I swear that—I was examined before the Magistrate—I most likely swore then, "I don't remember having ever seen my father with any notes in his possession"—a long time ago is different from the present time—I would not swear to any date; but he always had money in his possession, gold and silver, that I swear—when I have asked him for money he had gold and silver mixed together—I could not swear to any dates—it is not the fact that directly he got this money from the bank he took to drink; he always drank, but not so much as since her death—he was a retired cab proprietor—I do not suggest that he had a large number of cabs—he always had one, two at least, a four-wheeler and a hansom—that was when he was living at 9, Regent Square—I don't know of his license being refused on January 26th, 1885—I don't know why he gave up cab driving—9, Regent Square, was a lodging-house, I believe—I don't remember who lived there; there were women and men living there—it was not a brothel, to my knowledge; I would not swear that it was or was not—they did not move from there to 17, Albany Street; they moved to 24, Trevor Square, Chelsea—I can't remember how long they stayed there—I don't remember their moving to 17, Albany Street—I was in America when they moved there; I was in America two or three years—17, Albany Street, is not a brothel, to my knowledge—I did not live there with one of the unfortunate women—Amy Chase lived in the house, not with me—I did not live upon her—am I bound to answer whether I am living with her now?—she is living with me—she is not keeping me—what I do for my living has nothing to do with this case—I have not been for the last three years living on her prostitution, and acting as a bully—she has not been on the streets since she has been living with me; she was before—my mother managed the house, 17, Albany Street, as well as she was able—Amy Chase was not living on the streets, to my knowledge—I have slept with her, but I never lived with her—she has given me money for her rent, to take care of for my mother—I did not know that com<lb/>plaints were made about the house—I do not know that my father threw one of the women downstairs; I can't say he did or did not; I never saw it or heard it—I have been convicted two or three times—I have a bad memory; it may be as many as seven times, I don't emember—I remem<lb/>ber</p>

Carburton Street, and a week afterwards for violence to a woman—that was the same case, not two cases—I went there for rent due to my father—the woman was Constance Holton; she had lived in my mother's house and left it; she was supposed to be married or kept—she left her boxes till she paid her rent; it was something like £7—after my mother died I offered to take £2, and give back the boxes—I don't know that my father went, and offered to take 30s.—it was for pushing my way into the house that I was fined—I did not assault the landlady—this paper is not my writ<lb/>ing—I did not write to Holton, threatening to kill her—I did not describe myself as the champion heavy-weight of Somers Town; I must have been drunk if I did—I am not a bully—my father was not a man of the most violent temper, and the common talk of the people at 17, Albany Street—I will not pledge my oath that house was not a brothel—my father never had rows with the women in the house, to my knowledge—Emma Chase has never told me so—I do not know Ada Melbourn or Mrs. Coe—I think I know a woman by the name of" The Squeaker"—she lived there, but not while I was there—I don't know her business—it may have been that 17, Albany Street, was a brothel kept by my mother, and it may not—I don't believe that 9, Regent Square, was—it is about twelve months since I did regular work—since the death of my mother I have kept Miss Chase—I have not had a violent quarrel with her this morning.</p>

I will fetch you brandy, and soon make you better"—the sloshing of water was still going on, and I heard the mumbling sound of a man's voice; it was too indistinct to understand; it was a different voice to the woman's, and it had a moaning sound—I then heard someone approaching the door opening on to the landing, and I went upstairs towards my own room; as I went up I stumbled—I saw the prisoner come out of the room; I believe she saw me—she locked the door and took the key out—she was carrying a pail with a handle to it; I can't say what it contained—I heard her go downstairs to the back door leading into the yard, and there I heard the sound as of the empty<lb/>ing of water, and some water drawn; she returned to the house, and stood the pail in the passage on the ground floor, and then left the house by the front street door—I went up, and from my front window I saw her go into the Grafton Arms, immediately opposite; she came back to the house, and I heard her take up the pail and bring it up to her room, unlock the door, and relock it—I then went down again and stood outside her door, and I heard her say, "Speak! speak! speak!" three times, and the third time she gave a very passionate thrill, that was the loudest voice right through the night—up to that time both voices had been very low indeed—a few minutes afterwards I heard a mumbling sound, like a man's voice, but it was too indistinct to hear anything—I heard the sloshing of water; she had two pails of water previous to that, one at two and one at three—I should say that hearing the her say "Speak!" would be beyond</p>

               <p>One o'clock; it was after half-past twelve, after she had fetched the brandy—I then went back to my room, and I was to and fro the front and back rooms for and hour or so after; I left the door of the back room open, the front room door was shut—about two o'clock I heard the prisoner leave her room for another pail of water, going as before to the back door, emptying, drawing, and returning—there was then an interval of about another hour, during which I heard nothing—about three I was sitting by my fire in the front room when I heard another terrible crash; just before there I heard her leave the room a second time, going again to the sink, emptying the pail, drawing water, and returning—after hearing the crash at three I went down again and listened at her door, but did not hear a sound—about four I heard the sound of cracking tissue paper, and as of wood breaking; that was all—the sloshing of water still continued—the cracking of the wood was about three—then I went upstairs again, and remained till my daughter came home, about four—I kept my door open, but I heard no more—about that time my second daughter returned—I went down to let her in—she had also been to the dance—I listened at the prisoner's door as I went down, but I heard nothing—after my second daughter had gone to bed I went down-stairs, and about four steps from the prisoner's door I sat down—I heard nothing, only the cracking sound of tissue paper—that was the first time I heard the sound of crushing paper—I heard no voice—there was a light coming from under the prisoner's door at the time—under the door I could see the shadow of someone moving about the room—it was a woman, by the trail of the dress—I remained there form ten minutes to a quarter of and hour—I heard nothing but the paper—I then went upstairs, and sat at my window till a quarter to eight to watch if anyone went out—I did not see anyone—I did not go to bed at all that night—my sister, Mrs. Holloway, was with me in the room the whole of the night—about a quarter to eight I went downstairs and knocked at Mrs. Bricknell's door; she slept on the ground floor—I had some conversation with her, and went with her into the back yard, and in the sink there I saw a quantity of blood—on returning I saw on the floor of the passage, near the foot of the stairs, a ring of blood, as if a pail had stood there—whilst I was in the yard I looked up at the prisoner's back room window—it was open very wide—on seeing that I spoke to Mr. Simmonds, my landlord, who lived next door, at 54, and he came in and we went up, and he knocked at the prisoner's front room door—there was no answer—he then got a ladder, put it up against the back room window, and went up and looked in; he came down and made a communication to me—that was between eight and nine—I went back to my room—about half-past nine, as I came down form my room, I saw the prisoner coming out of her back room, carrying a red blind—she seemed very drunk—she locked the door after her—about that time she went out three times, always unlocking and locking the door—on the third occasion on her return she went into the front room, and, the door being open, I saw a large trunk near the door; it was shut, not corded. (<hi rend="italic">The trunk was produced</hi>)—it was this kind of trunk—it was standing close to the opening of the door—she had to get to the back of the door before she could close it; there was not sufficient room—this was about twelve o'clock on the Friday morning, the 16th—she was</p>

               <p>constantly in and out the whole of the Friday afternoon, always locking the door after her—about five in the early morning of Saturday, the 17th, I heard her moving about her room—she was in and out on that day very much, as she had been on the Friday—she went into the back yard to the dustbin—I met her several times—she had things in her hand, useless things, throwing them on the dustheap—she spoke to me that morning; she placed her hands together, and said, "Oh, forgive me, madam; I am going to leave to-day"—I said, "Oh, don't get away from me"—she was still in drink, and so remained the whole day until I last saw her, getting no better—about twelve a man came to move her things—they were taken away on three separate journeys, the last being about five in the afternoon—the prisoner followed the last load, walking—I followed the first and second loads, and saw they were taken to 56, Marylebone Street—I returned to Grafton Street, and was there when the prisoner left—Mr. Simmonds was in the house after the prisoner had gone; I spoke to him, and went with him into the two rooms which the prisoner had occupied—I saw a number of blood-stains in the front room, and on the door leading to the back room—about six that evening I went to Tottenham Court Road Police-station, and made a communication to the police; Sergeant Kane was present at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The three crashes I heard seemed to be so very much alike I can hardly say which was the loudest—it is an old house; any weight of 15 or 16 stone would go through—it was the first crash that called my attention—it was a fall of something; I could not tell what—I did not know that the prisoner kept her coals in an orange box—the sound I heard was like placing coal on the hearth and breaking it with a hammer—I heard a good deal of talking—I say I heard a man's voice saying "Give me back my five pounds"—I can pledge my oath those were the exact words I heard—I know the prisoner's voice well—I never heard her sober voice since I have been in the house; it always seemed the same; I have never seen her sober—it was not her voice that said, "Give me back my five pounds"—I understood him to say, "Take me to Albert Road"—I admit that was a mistake—it sounded like a drunken man's voice—I did not hear anything said about a pound by the woman—the crash was before the conversation—I was listening close up to the door—the words were not, "What about my pound?"; it was, "Give me my five pounds"—that was quite distinct enough for me to hear—I am positive—I am telling you the truth—I am quite right about the "five pounds"—when the woman said "I will give you an account of that," I thought he was the woman's husband, and that it was a row between man and wife over money matters—I first heard the sloshing of water after the first fall; about the same time as about the five pounds—the sloshing of water continued all night—it was not the noise of wringing out a cloth in a pail of water—it seemed to me as if there was a pail of water washing something down—the second crash was two or three minutes after getting the brandy, at half-past twelve—one had not a clock under one's eye all the time—it was practically all instantaneously after the fall—she was only absent a few minutes in getting the brandy; about five minutes—she was very quick on her feet—I did not notice the pail—it was such a pail as anyone would use for cleaning purposes—it was not an ordinary slop pail; it was a cleaning pail—the locking the</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to a pawnbroker of 26, Mortimer Street, Regent Street—the prisoner came to the shop on the morning of the 15th March, and pawned a cloak for 5s.; I gave her a duplicate—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is it, it is dated the 15th; the one I retained is dated the 14th.</p>

I was a furniture dealer, at 111, Cleveland Street, in February and March—I saw the prisoner on several occasions—she came in February to buy some things—the next time I saw her was Friday, 16th March, about five p.m., at my shop—she looked at some things, and finally selected and paid for a settee, two gipsy-tables, and a chair, which came together to 27s. 6d.—my wife came in—the prisoner tendered her a sovereign and a half sovereign, which she took from a purse—I saw inside the purse several pieces of gold money, and a package of paper that she drew my attention to, saying it was a £5 note—she mentioned that the contents of her purse were her quarter's salary, and that she was a daily governess—I was to be told later on where to send</p>

               <p>the goods; she gave as the reason that she was removing, and had not decided then on the place she was going to—my truck was standing there—she asked if I should deliver the goods with that, and I said, "Yes," and she asked if I would allow my man to take a box to Charing Cross Station for her that afternoon—I told her it would be cheaper for her to go by cab; and then I asked her if the box was a large one—she said, "No; just an ordinary travelling trunk"—I told her I was too busy for my man to go, and suggested that a cab would be much cheaper—she left, and came back about seven o'clock, and gave an address in Great Tichfield Street—the goods were sent there—I afterwards got another message, and in consequence brought them back the same evening—next morning, Saturday, about 8.30, I saw her, and told her I had got the things back—she said she would let me know a little later on where they were to go—about an hour afterwards she came back, and gave me an address on an envelope, and told me to go to it, and ask for the key, and deliver the goods at the house next to it, 57, Upper Marylebone Street, I believe—she asked me if I would allow my man that took those things to move some things for her from Grafton Street to Upper Marylebone Street—I accordingly sent Leach and my son, Herbert Gibbons, to 51, Grafton Street, and I went later on to see why they had been so long, as they were some time—I saw a trunk in the forecourt of 51, Grafton Street—I assisted Leach and my son to put it on the truck they had brought with them—they were unable to do it by themselves, owing to its weight—I remarked that it was very heavy, and the prisoner said, "Yes, it is books, and that sort of thing, that I use in my business"—I stayed at Grafton Street till the last load of furniture had gone away; I sent for another truck—I accompanied the prisoner to Upper Marylebone Street—she there spoke about and bargained for some other furniture which she had previously seen at my shop; she agreed to pay 26s., I think, for it; she did not pay it—it was in addition to the settee and other things—she mentioned that her husband would be home at nine o'clock, and then they would come round and pay for it—she did not pay for the second lot of things—I only assisted in getting the things into 57, Upper Mary<lb/>lebone Street, from the truck; but she asked my son to stop and help her—I saw the trunk in the front room in front of the door; I put it behind the door—she said she should like my man to take it for her to Charing Cross Station on Monday—I said if we were not too busy he could do it—on one of the occasions when she spoke of the trunk she men<lb/>tioned the Continent as its destination, and on the other she mentioned Berlin—I left her about seven o'clock that evening, and she paid me 5s. in silver for moving the furniture, taking the money from her purse—at that time she drew out of her purse a bank note, saying that was the only one she had, she had lost the other; she had been lying on the couch in front of the door—I saw some pawntickets in the purse—she paid me 32s. 6d. altogether—she gave the boy and man a gratuity of 1s. each, and left 6d. as a gratuity to the persons who took the goods home.</p>

               <p>furniture—I do not remember her saying she had seen a settee in Penton<lb/>ville Road for which she was in treaty—she did not say she had seen other furniture at a certain price, and try to beat me down in consequence—I had no particular reason to notice how much money was in her purse after she had paid me, except that she called our attention to it—there were several gold pieces left after she had taken out the 30s.—this is the sort of purse she had, with openings in it—I am shortsighted—I am sure there were several pieces of gold in the purse after she had paid us—I was not a foot from the purse—I made a statement to Inspector Towner—I did not tell him about the prisoner tapping the purse and speaking of a quarter's salary, or about the prisoner being asleep on the couch and losing the £5 note, or of seeing gold in the purse, or anything about what money I had seen—I said nothing at the inquest about the losing of the £5 note—my wife agrees that there was money in the purse—the note I saw on the Friday night may, or may not, have been a £5 note, but what I saw on Saturday most certainly was a £5 note—I saw it opened by her, and it was a £5 note, to the best of my belief—she did not pay the 26s. for the other furniture then, because at that time she had not bought it—she had agreed to give 26s., and her husband was to pay for it in the evening, but she had not bought it; she had only bought it subject to her husband's approval—he was coming round at nine o'clock to pay for it—I do not suggest that she could not pay for it because she had not got the money—on Friday she selected goods she bought, and she selected some others—a £5 note was in her possession on Friday morning—I know that no £5 note was found on her or in her possession—a medallion was shown to me at the Police-court; that was not one of the gold pieces—I did not see any gold in the purse after Friday night—she had not been drinking on the Saturday to any great excess—she was not very drunk, but she had been drinking—she was peculiar when sober, and the extent of her drunken<lb/>ness was not apparent—I identify this purse—I thought it was the one when Mr. Newton asked me about it at the Police-court—I think so now—I said at the Police-court I would not swear positively to it—the note was exhibited to me to look at—I think the coins I saw were both sovereigns and half-sovereigns—I did not take particular notice, and I had not my glasses on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On the Friday the note remained in the purse, folded, the whole time—it looked like a £5 note—on the Saturday the prisoner took a note out of her purse, and opened it, and showed it to me—that was at Grafton Street—I walked with her from Grafton Road to Upper Marylebone Street—she had no opportunity, that I know of, of getting rid of it then, or until I left her—she did not leave me—I left her about seven, some time before she was arrested—the note I saw at Grafton Street on the Saturday was a genuine £5 note, so far as I could see—the words "Five" and the figures" £5" were on it—with regard to it she said she had only that one; she had lost the other—I was directly behind her, looking over her shoulder, when I saw it—it was a fairly clean note—when she opened it she said she had lost the other one—I did not know what she referred to.</p>

               <p>with the exception of a very slight stain, there were no marks of blood in the trunk—it came from the head, from the wounds; it was a large quantity, considering the wounds—I should say there might be half a tea-cup full; it made a large stain on the boards—the trunk is thirty-four inches long and twenty-six inches deep on the outside; without the lid it is seventeen inches; there is a beading in front, a little broken.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police-Sergeant D</hi>). On the evening of 17th March, about six, in consequence of what Mrs. Hutchins said, I went to 51, Graf ton Street, and, after looking at the first floor rooms there, I went to 56, Upper Marylebone Street—I saw Herbert Gibbons at the door, and then went into the back room and saw the prisoner—she said, "Hallo, Sergeant Kane, what do you want?"—I said, "I have just been to the rooms you have vacated in Grafton Street, and in consequence of what I have seen there I am going to search your place"—she said, "All right, Mr. Kane"—I then sent Gibbons for Inspector Reed, and on his coming I said, "This is Madame Herman," and the conversation occurred which he has given—I then said to the prisoner, "Is this the only room you occupy here?"—she said, "Yes"—I went into the passage, and seeing the door of the front room open, I entered, and said to the prisoner, "I find you occupy the front room as well as the back"—she said, "Yes"—then the inspector, the prisoner and I went into the front room, and the large trunk was standing immediately behind the door—it was tied round several times with cord, and locked—I asked her what was in the trunk—she made no reply—I repeated the question twice; still no reply—I then said, "Is there anything in the trunk to account for what I have seen at Graf ton Street?"—she said, "Yes, I should think so"—I said, "Where are the keys?"—eventually Inspector Reed forced open the trunk, and found the body inside—I lifted the lid and saw the body, sitting on the left side—I then said to the prisoner, "Madame Herman, you will be charged with killing the man whose body you now see in that trunk; you are not obliged to say anything unless you desire to do so; but whatever you do say I shall take down in writing, and it may be used in evidence against you here-after"—she said nothing for a moment; the inspector left to procure assistance, and shortly after he had gone, she said, "The man did try to strangle me; I had to defend myself, you can see the marks on my neck; I hit him hard with the poker on Thursday night, but he was alive at nine in the morning; you will find the poker in the black box in the next room; I fetched some brandy from the Horseshoe. I know it is all over with me now, and I may as well tell the truth. I picked him up in</p>

               <p>Euston Road; he had, not a penny on him, that was the beginning of the quarrel. I was going to send the box to Berlin either to-morrow or Monday. I know you, Mr. Kane, and I will not tell you lies. Why should I do that? You know it is all over with me now. Madame Bricknell brought me up two pails of water. We had five or six drinks; I gave her a sovereign before he died. The old man told me he lived in Albany Street. The boy you saw here knows nothing about it; he only helped me to tie the trunk"—When I gave that statement before the Magistrate I did it from memory, without looking at my notes—the note was made at the time she was speaking—after making that state<lb/>ment she pulled down the top of her dress at the left hand side; I looked, and could see nothing, but it is only fair to say the room was very dark at the time; it was past seven, and a bad light—Inspector Reed came back, and placed the prisoner in a cab, and conveyed her and the box containing the dead body to Tottenham Court Road Police-station—she was there charged with killing a man unknown—afterwards the body was identified, and she was then charged with killing Charles Anthony Stevens—Mrs. Bricknell was present when she was charged, sitting close to her—after the charge was read over to her the second time the prisoner said, pointing to Mrs. Bricknell, "This woman did help me. This woman did bring me up the water, and I gave her a sovereign for it. She had five or six drinks, and you will find the bottle from the Grafton in her room now"—I think it was at about half-past eight when she made that statement—there was very little interval between the first and second charge being read over, only a few minutes, for while the first charge was being entered the son had come and identified the body—the prisoner had been at the station about an hour before the first charge was read over—I believe part of that time she had been in the inspector's office alone, except somebody at the door—I believe she was searched after the first charge was read to her—I was not there all the time—when she said this about Mrs. Brick<lb/>nell Mrs. Bricknell said, "You are a liar"—after the second charge was read the prisoner was put in the cell—Mrs. Rescorla, the searcher, would be in charge of her then—Dr. Lloyd came and examined the body—it was sent to the mortuary—I noticed the man's trousers; they were buttoned up me front, with the exception of the top button—he had on an ordinary overcoat, but no undercoat—I found a pair of man's boots in the trunk—he was shabbily dressed, with the exception of the overcoat; that was in good condition—all the other articles were very shabby—no hat has been found—his shirt appeared to have been broken away at the neck, and was smothered in blood—he had on some sort of a loose cotton or silk scarf; I believe it was silk, a very small one; there was blood on that—his hands appeared clean, as if they had been washed—I found no blood-stains on them—before leaving Upper Marylebone Street the first evening I went to a black box in the back room, and in it found this iron bar that has been produced; the point was bent—there appeared some stains on it; I can't say what they were—I showed it to the prisoner the same evening, and said, "Is this the poker you mean?"—she said, "Yes"—on Sunday, the 18th, I went again to Upper Marylebone Street with Reed, and made a search among the things there—under a chair in the front room I found this bunch of keys—I saw Reed take them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280060"/>
               <p>from under the lining or cushion of the chair; they were pushed under the lining of the seat—one of those keys fitted the lock of the trunk—I found several other things, but I removed nothing—the prisoner was taken before the Magistrate on the 19th, and remanded to the 26th—on that day I had charge of her at the Police-court, in the waiting-room, and while there she said, "I went to the night chemist's in Oxford Street on Friday morning, about six o'clock. I bought two rolls of surgical bandages and some sticking-plaister. I had a conversation with the man in the shop, and he told me to be careful there was no glass in the wound. I said there was no bleeding now. There was a man cleaning the window when I drove up in the cab. I left the cab outside waiting for me. I went into the Horseshoe, and bought half-a-pint of gin. I then went home. The man was sitting in the basket-chair. I gave him the bottle; he put it to his lips, and drank the whole of the gin. He died in the basket-chair, and Madame Bricknell did help me to put him in the box; I could not do it myself, as the man was too heavy. The man nearly killed me, lying on the top of me. Madame Bricknell helped me to tie the box on Friday morning. I sent her out twice for drinks after she did it. I went out after we put the man in the box. Saturday morning I noticed the cord of the box cut, and the key of the bath-room missing. I believe the men who tied the box on Saturday morning must have noticed the cut rope when they tied the box round with the good rope. I could not put the man in the box myself, as I have no power in my right wrist. You will see the rollers in the drawers in the room"—The same evening I went to 56, Upper Marylebone Street, and there found two surgical bandages in a chest of drawers in the back room, and in the front room on a chair I found some sticking-plaister—they have been produced—on the 23rd I found the pail without a handle in the back-yard of 56, Grafton Street, underneath Mrs. Bricknell's window.</p>

               <p>was only just a little round patch of blood in the box—I saw the fender; I did not examine it accurately, not so as to say whether it had been recently black-leaded—the shirt the man had on was very old——the boots were lying on his breast; they had evidently been put in after the body was placed there—the clothes are here—it has been stated by the prisoner that a man was in the habit of visiting her regularly for some period—it is a fact that on the very day she was arrested a man did call at Grafton Street—I believe' that man has been to the Treasury and made a statement—he has been seen by an officer in the case—it is a fact that for the last eleven years she has had this man visiting her regularly, and giving her money—he is a man in a very respectable position—she has no occupation.</p>

On 30th March after the second hearing, I went to 56, Upper Marylebone Street, with Mr. Taylorson, managing clerk to the solicitor for the prisoner; I saw him find this lady's card-case in a box there, and in it was this piece of crisp paper, which looks like a flash note—he handed it to me; it is really a sort of advertisement of a confectioner; it was with a lot of loose articles of various descriptions—yesterday I went to 51, Grafton Street, and com<lb/>pared this plaster cast with the blood stains—the upper spot is eighteen inches from the ground; that is the spot in which I found the hair that I handed to Dr. Lloyd—the lower spot is six inches long, and one foot from the bottom; then there is a space of three inches clear, and then comes the other spot—the spot on the left cupboard is seven inches from the ground—from the bottom of the cupboard to the top of the big stain is twenty inches—the blood marks on the cupboard were very small and</p>

               <p>wound, more of the nature of a puncture, about three-quarters of an inch long, and not very deep; it did not go to the bone—Nos. 3 and 4 were the most serious; No. 4 was at the open end of a small artery, or branch of the temporal artery—all those wounds must have bled considerably—No. 4 was the most serious; there is a little ring in the sketch repre<lb/>senting the divided artery—there must have been some concussion of the brain—No. 8 is an abrasion of the right temple, very extensive, but superficial—No. 9 is a superficial bruise on the bridge of the nose—No. 9 is not shown on the sketch; it is a cut about two inches long, straight across the top of the head, contused, and nearly down to the bone—No. 11 is an abrasion on the right side of the lower jaw—in my judgment the injuries 1 to 7 and No. 10 were caused by separate acts of violence; and Nos. 1 to 6 could all have been caused by this iron instrument used as a poker—I am not certain how No. 7 was produced; it could have been done with the blunt edge of the same instrument—I think the wounds must have been given in rapid succession—assuming that they were given while the man was erect or sitting, he would rapidly fall, and the nearness of the wounds to each other looks as if they were done rapidly—No. 10 might also have been caused by the poker—the bruises 8, 9, and 11, were probably caused by a fall—I think it likely that the assailant was behind, but it is mere opinion; there was nothing about the wounds to guide me; they are all on the right side, and if the assailant was not behind they must have been given back-handed—I think the head was probably above the assailant when wounds 4, 5, and 6 were given—any of the straight wounds, 1, 2, 5 and 6, might have been caused by a fall on this fender, but I think not 3 and 7, unless 7 was caused by falling on one of these projections; the two corners (<hi rend="italic">Knobs</hi>)—No. 10 is unlikely to have been caused by a fall on the fender; if so, I should expect to find blood on the fender—bleeding would com<lb/>mence immediately on the infliction of the wounds—I have carefully examined the fender; there was a minute speck of blood on the right projection when it was in the fireplace, almost microscopical—I saw some more on the plate—I saw nothing to show whether the fender had been cleaned—I examined it on March 21st—there would have to be successive falls to cause the injuries I found—no two wounds would be caused by the same full on the fender, and I only saw these microscopical spots of blood—I do not think any of the wounds were caused by the fender—I examined the deceased's clothing; the overcoat is much stained with blood on the right shoulder. (<hi rend="italic">The, coat being produced showed stains in other parts</hi>)—the waistcoat is much stained with blood, which has run down into the right pocket, where the knife was found stained with blood—the trousers are stained with blood on the right side, it does not go far below—the shirt is very much stained, and there is a slight stain on the drawers—the socks are free from blood—I made a post-mortem examination the following Wednesday, and found that a branch of the temporal artery was severed, causing profuse haemorrhage—the brain was bloodless and hypertrofied, which is enlargement and thickening—the heart was en<lb/>larged and fatty, and weighed twenty ounces; the left side of it was contracted and empty of blood—the lungs showed signs of old pleurisy—the stomach was perfectly empty; there was not the slightest trace of the recent consumption of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280071"/>
               <p>spirits—the liver was enlarged and bloodless, indicating that the man had been an excessive drinker—he had lost a considerable quantity of blood from the appearance of the body—the cause of death was haemorrhage from the wounds, with some degree of concussion of the brain, and shock resulting from the violence—he may have survived the wounds some hours—death would follow almost immediately on the ceasing of the flow of blood from the artery, the artery not being plugged—I was shown an old leather arm-chair; there were a few splashes of blood on the outer right side of it; the piece is cut away now—I took it home to examine the blood—I also examined a wicker chair and found stains of blood on it; also a carpet said to have been taken from the front room at Grafton Street, on which were extensive stains—I have since been to 51, Grafton Street, and found some blood-stains on the floor at the left hand cupboard as you face the fireplace—I do not know how the carpet was placed, but if it was lying with the stains near the left hand cupboard, the two stains would correspond—I was handed a hair by the police, and I examined the hairs taken from the mantelpiece and from the cupboard—those from the mantelpiece were human hairs, brown, but not a very dark brown—two other hairs were given me; the one was a human hair, the other was not—the human hair was brown, but not very dark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The man might have been placed in the box by the prisoner unaided, but it would have taken some little time—I said at the Police-court, "When the deceased was taken from the box and laid down, a large pool of blood flowed from his head; having regard to that fact I am of opinion that the deceased must have been lifted bodily into the box," and I adhere to that—I do not think the prisoner unaided could have lifted him bodily into the box; I think she must have had assistance to have lifted him from the ground—I think he was bodily lifted into the box; it would have been impossible to put the body in piecemeal, and keep the trunk erect—I do not think the woman could have done it bodily; not lift him bodily—I am in favour of the theory that there must have been assistance—there is nothing in the position of the wounds to indicate that the assailant was probably behind—I heard Dr. Pepper say at the Police-court, "I found the left part of the sleeve of the overcoat covered with blood," and I admit that the left arm was probably used to ward off a blow aimed at the right side of the head—I have never expressed an opinion upon the point till to-day—if I was attacked from behind I think I should probably use my right hand—seeing that the right hand was not used in this case to ward off an attack does not, I think, weaken my opinion that the attack was from behind—the Magistrate scraped off some blacklead from the fender—what I meant was that it had not been washed since the blacklead was put on, or it would have washed off the specks of blood which I saw—the plate of the fender is not blackleaded—there is nothing inconsistent with it having been washed, but not so carefully as to obliterate all traces of blood—looking at the plan, I think it possible that when the upper stain on the beading of the mantel was made, there must have been several spots of blood spurting on to the fender—if a person fell against the beading of the mantel, it would depend on how long the head remained there whether the fender would receive spots of blood, and if it did and no blood was found the fender must have been washed—it</p>

               <p>was the bleeding of wound No. 4 which caused death, with the bleed<lb/>ing from the other wounds—that was the most serious wound; the artery was severed, but they all bled—if the artery in No. 4 had been plugged, I think it possible he might have been alive at this time—the artery was small, and the bleeding would be slow from it a—tow compress and spirits would assist in stopping it; but spirit alone would not do it; nothing could stop it but pressure or tieing, or caustic; I don't think much of spirit, though it would considerably lessen the bleeding from then one arterial wounds—assuming it to have been clotted in some way by compression, a sudden fall an hour afterwards would be likely to re-open the artery—the bleeding itself would depend upon the strength of the heart; in the case of a weak heart the bleeding would be slow—as to the blood spots, it is not possible to distinguish between arterial and venous blood after a time—I do not think wound No. 4 could have been caused by a sharp instrument, or by the sharp end of the poker, it is unlikely; it was jagged—a jagged wound would be produced by the sharp end of the poker—in my opinion all the wounds were inflicted in rapid succession—assuming wound No. 7 not to be capable of being inflicted by the sharp end, the end of the poker must have been changed very rapidly—a jagged wound would probably be produced by something in the nature of a sharp instrument being drawn along the flesh—I have already said that No. 7 might have been inflicted by a fall on the left end of the fender—as I found portions of hair on the mantel, it is likely that wound No. 10 was caused by the man falling against the beading of the over-mantel—I saw no vessel of magnitude in the wound; but all the wounds would bleed considerably—I saw the hair attached—I said at the Police-court, "I think the hairs on the mantelpiece may have been smeared there with the cloth to which they were adhering"—I never saw them adhering to the cloth—it struck Mr. Pepper and myself that the blood at that part was somewhat pale—any blood becomes pale after considerable exposure to the atmosphere—when I examined the stains in the lobby I noticed that the stains were perfect by the fireplace—it was apparent, from the position of the spurts, that no cloth had been used at that spot; and it was on a portion of that spot that the hair was seen—the marks were so far obliterated as to enable me to say that they were blood, and it was in one of those marks that I found part of the human hair—I do not think I had been to the Treasury when I went to the Police-court—if the artery had been tied or clotted the man would not have died from haemorrhage, but he might have died from erysipelas, or shock, or concussion—assum<lb/>ing the injuries to have been received as late us three o'clock, he might very well have lived till seven, and be able to talk feebly—it is very difficult to say what difference it would make in the duration of life, assuming the wound to have been re-opened by a fall at 12.30; blood was flowing from the whole of the body, and the dangerous part was never plugged at all—hypertomy of the heart does not cause weakness—it was very strong; it is a compensating thing, which we put on one side, not affecting the flow of blood—I found no trace of any spirit taken shortly before death—I think I should have detected anything like gin,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280073"/>
               <p>but it would depend upon how long he had lived after taking spirits—there was every sign that he was a confirmed drinker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The left arm might have been raised to ward off a blow—the injury on the left arm was a small incised wound about half an inch long—that might have been caused by a similar instrument to that which inflicted the wounds on the head; any blunt contusing force might cut the skin against the bone, just as it does on the scalp—I have not much to guide me as to whether the wounds were inflicted from behind—I think it unlikely that wound No. 10 could be inflicted by holding the weapon in the left hand, and hitting to the right; it is possible that it may have been inflicted by the head hitting the inner moulding of the chimney-piece—if he had fallen against the moulding I think he would have gone backwards, towards the left-hand cupboard; I assume that the back of his head was towards the window—taking a person lying on the ground with the person injured ever her, I think there would not be sufficient power to cause wound No. 4; you could not on that theory account for the two different directions of the wounds; 1, 2 and 3 differ from 4, 5, and 6—I see a difficulty in wounds 4, 5, and 6 being caused by a person using a poker, and striking while lying on the ground—considerable violence must have been used—I should certainly have thought that a person lying on her back, holding a poker, could not have sufficient power to inflict the wounds I saw and I have seen many hundred wounds—very considerable force would be required for the blunt instrument to sever the tissues down to the bone, and I do not think it possible that a person lying on the ground could inflict the injuries with a blunt instrument—I noticed the stain on the right side of the marble chimney-piece; the colour of the blood was rather pale—I do not think it would sink deeper into wood because it was varnished.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Master of Surgery, B. M. of London, and F.R.C.S.—I am one of the surgeons of St. Mary's Hospital, and examiner of medical jurisprudence at the University of London—on April 24th I visited 51, Grafton Street, and examined the first floor and saw the blood, the indications of which have been spoken to to-day—it was quite plain that the blood came from splashing; there was no indi<lb/>cation of spurting blood from an artery in any part of the room; the characteristics are very distinct—many of the stains indicated that they were done by splashing, and others were obviously smears; and they were of two kinds, some obviously formed by pure blood, and others, the smears, by blood diluted with water—there was abundant evidence in the room that a very coarse and ineffectual attempt had been made to clear the blood away by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280074"/>
               <p>means of a cloth—the lower stain on the mantelpiece appeared like a smear, and was lighter than the other—this representation gives a fairly good idea, hut there is too great conformity of colour; it does not suggest a smear, I heard his Lordship remark that the outline is too definite and the surface too uniform—it is equally consistent with a cloth being dabbed against it, or the head coming against it—it certainly has a smeared appearance, but it might be done with the hair—the blood-stains on the corner of the left-hand cupboard, at the top, did not seem to me like pure blood; it was very pale at the upper part, and darker below—it might be done by the hair; it was a daub, or kind of smear, it was not produced by a simple flat surface; the blood has trickled down, and has been smeared—then on the ground on the other side there are numerous spots of blood, possessing neither the shape nor the arrangement spots of blood would do which spurted from an artery—I cannot say for certain whether I see indications of pure blood on this polished wood, but it is darker at the lower part because it is more concentrated: there is one fact against it being pure blood, the stain being so light, the blood would have congealed before it trickled down so far; I think if it had been pure blood it would probably have congealed before—there had been a large effusion of blood on the floor under the left-hand cupboard, but it had been attempted to be wiped up, yet still it could be scraped up in powder—the condition of the clothes and of the room, represent sufficient blood having been shed to account for death—I do not think the head laid there more than a few minutes; it might have been much longer, but a minute or two would be enough—the bleeding was very profuse and very rapid—there are stains imme<lb/>diately under the window which looks into the street, and there is a large spot on the skirting at the side, which I have no doubt is pure blood, much darker than it is anywhere else, indicating splashes: it might be produced by a blow on the head, or by the head coming in contact with the ground—I think that from the size of the stain and the blood there, there is very little doubt that the head has been there; there is no doubt that the head laid in that position sufficiently near to splash to the skirting-board; either a blow on the head might cause the blood to splash on the skirting, or the head coming in contact with the floor might cause the blood to splash up—as to the indications on the return of the cupboard, the trickling blood the head may have come in contact with it, with the body in a sitting position; it was about that height; the body could be put in such a position that the head would reach that spot, which would be a natural position; but it could not have remained long in that position, because the blood reaches to the bottom of the woodwork—I examined the deceased's sleeve; the lower stain on the mantelshelf was such as the brushing of the sleeve across it would easily produce—the one above that is the one in which the human hair was discovered, as reported to me; the presence of that hair is to be accounted for by the smearing of the spot with a cloth containing the hair; the wound on the scalp must have taken away a considerable quantity of hair; in fact, I found two hairs on the fender—I found two minute spots of blood on the fender, one on the broad beading at the bottom, just by the middle—they have been removed—the fender had been blackleaded at some time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280075"/>
               <p>but not recently—it had no indications of being washed subsequently to being blackleaded—that was on April 19th—assuming a fall on the fender, I should expect much greater evidence of blood-stains; there was no evidence that it had been recently cleaned, either by washing or blackleading, and had any large amount of blood been on the fenestrated portion, it would have been very difficult to get it away; two drops of blood would have accounted for all the stains I found—of course I take into account the indifferent way in which the room had been cleaned, and I think if there had been blood on the fender it would not have been cleared away—very considerable violence must have been used to inflict the wounds—I believe this poker could have inflicted them all, including No. 7, which, in my opinion, was done with this part of the poker—it would be very easy to do it with that, especially if it was obliquely directed—Nos. 1 to 6 could have been produced by the narrow end of the poker, or rather the tapering segment—I think No. 3 is very definite; one portion tails off" at right angles to the other, that could not be produced by a straight instru<lb/>ment—1, 2, and 3 run in a different direction to 4, 5, and 6—No. 10 was about an inch long on the vertex; a very slight de<lb/>viation of the instrument would account for a difference in the wound—all the wounds could be caused by the poker, and I am certain not one of them was caused by a fall on the fender—excluding No. 3 and No. 7, I think all the wounds could be easily produced by the straight part of the poker, including No. 10, and, they were the result of separate blows—from the number of wounds, and their general similarity, and their direction being similar, that is to say, in groups, and all being on the right side of the head, and the top, renders it probable that they were all caused by the same means—a fall would in all probability only give rise to one wound; it would be of a different character—if the head fell on the fender or the knob it might produce such a wound as No. 7; you would not expect to get a number of such similar wounds, three of them being in almost parallel directions—supposing No. 7 to have been caused by a fall on the fender, a good deal of blood would have re<lb/>mained in the crevices—I do not think any of the wounds could have been caused by a fall against the sharp edge of the mantelpiece; it would have left a clearer wound, not so jagged as is described—I cannot swear that it was not so caused, but my opinion is against it from the facts before me—a large quantity of blood must have been lost from the wounds; the bloodlessness of the heart leads me to that conclusion, and the amount of blood we found—I do not ascribe the profuse haemorrhage to the bleeding of an individual wound—I think the wounds were received in close succession, and it would not be fair to speak of any one wound when you have six or seven bleeding at the same time, so that a very large quantity of blood was lost—it was not the severance of the artery only; you get a very serious bleeding apart from that, from a vast number of blood-vessels which are divided, and with so many wounds there would be profuse haemorrhage—had he been a strong young man I do not think he would have died—a severed artery might bleed for an indefinite time; you cannot fix the time; the more feeble the heart becomes the bleeding will sooner stop, and the patient might die from faintness, the actual bleeding having ceased before—there was clearly</p>

               <p>a bruise on the forearm, which is described as a linear wound—I think the sharp part of the poker might have scratched it across, not a cutting instru<lb/>ment necessarily, like a knife, but the injury might have been inflicted, I think, by the left arm being raised from the situation of the cut on the, wrist, it is quite clear that the left hand was raised to protect the head—I think, in all probability, the assailant was on a higher level when delivering the blows and at the side; wound No. 10 could hardly have been delivered unless the person was lying on the floor, or sitting down—I am speaking of the stature of the two individuals—I cannot tell how long a person would survive such injuries; there are so many circumstances—the concussion of the brain caused by the blows themselves is important—a person would be able to speak, in the way of conversing, for a very little time; it would be measured probably by minutes only—after the receipt of all those in<lb/>juries the person so injured would be unable to speak, but it was a measure of his strength, and of the concussion of the brain and subse<lb/>quent bleeding—I certainly think it possible for a woman of the size and strength of the prisoner to lift the body into this trunk—there is one fact I might mention, and that is the comparative absence of blood-marks on the outer portion of the trunk—as to the physical possibility, I have no doubt she could do it—there was only a very slight stain at one end—it would take a powerful effort, a supreme effort, but it would not take time, because a person could not endure it for long—I examined the prisoner's wrists; there was a scar on the skin, but the tendons were not divided—I examined the bump on her head, and agree that it is a congenital bump.</p>

               <p>by the woman lying on the ground, using her left hand, and strik<lb/>ing the man who was over her, holding her throat; I say it is improb<lb/>able—I account for the different angle of wound 3 by the poker striking at some distance from it—I do not think it was the imperfect power of the left hand, dragging the poker over and getting it away—the knob of the fender could have caused it—if the diagram is correct, a fall on the elbow could not have caused that bruise—I heard Dr. Lloyd suggest that the head of the assailed person was probably on a higher level than the arm of the assailant—I agree with that as to the lower wounds on the head—it was a question of minutes how long he could articulate; if he had been a young man I do not believe he would have died at all—there is nothing to show that wound was not produced by the fender—it was not until the 19th April that I examined the fender—it was a fender that had blacklead on it, but it had had no recent application—I think it was not washed on 16th March and blackleaded afterwards—I think there had been no blacklead put on within a month—I have a very con<lb/>fident opinion about it; I do not state it as a fact; it is an old, greasy, dirty fender—if it were blackleaded afterwards it must have been done very imperfectly, from the state I saw it in, and the amount of washing and blackleading is important, as hiding blood-stains—thirty-three or thirty-four days had elapsed before I saw it—I suggest that this blood-mark (<hi rend="italic">on the cupboard</hi>) was caused by the man sitting on the floor and resting his head on that spot, or by the man falling, and his head coming in contact with it—there was plenty of room for the man to sit outside the fireplace and have his head in that position—I know the place—there was plenty of room for him to be outside the fireplace—the fender was the boundary of the fireplace—I do not say that the man was necessarily sitting; I said either he was in a semi-sitting position, or he fell, and struck his head in that position—it was possible for him to be sitting on the ground, and his head in contact with that board—I suggest the blood-mark was caused by the right side of his head—I suggest that the right side of the head, or the back of the head, came in contact with the floor on the left-hand side of the cupboard, and the blood trickled on to the floor, and splashed on to the wainscot—the stain on the ground might have been caused by blood and water if the fender had been washed—the mark on the edge of the cupboard could have been caused by a blood-stained hand closing the door—I am afraid the transverse wound on the top of the head could scarcely have been produced by his sitting in the chair and falling forwards against the edge of the mantelpiece in a helpless state—if his head rested against this woodwork, and produced this stain, it is clear it was not there long, otherwise there would have been a lot of blood on the floor—this blood-stain is as if a man had rested his head there for a second—the blood-stain on the floor is some distance round from the corner; there are no blood smears round this side of the cupboard, or along the front of it—blood must have saturated the back of the head, being conducted from the wounds by the hair—it is possible that after his head had been in contact with the cupboard he fell down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 16, Eastcheap—before September, 1893, I had had transactions with the prisoner, and he was in my debt—about September I met him outside the Bankruptcy Court, and asked him how long it would be before I had some of the money he owed me, or something to that effect—he said, "Oh, I have several pieces of business I think you might help me in, and recoup yourself in that way"—he had been a solicitor—I asked him to call and see me in the City—he called,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189405280079"/>
               <p>and brought me several pieces of business—I am not sure that I transacted any of them; but I tried, unsuccessfully, to carry several things out—in October he brought me a bill for £1,000 accepted by Colonel Griffin and asked me to get it discounted—I tried to do so, unsuccessfully—the bill was split up into four separate acceptances of different values, to make it more easy to discount; I had one for £297—Colonel Griffin became bankrupt almost immediately after, and nothing more was done; I returned ray bill to the prisoner—H. A. Cooke purported to be the drawer—from the very first I had constantly been lending the prisoner small sums of money as I knew he was hard up, and on 7th December, 1893, I told him I could not give him any more unless he gave me some sort of security—he told me he wanted that day a cheque for £20 for his sister's funeral expenses, which I gave him, and took this letter from him as security. (<hi rend="italic">This agreed to repay the amount of his debt</hi>)—our interview took place at the Grand Hotel—he promised to give me some security, and on the 22nd December he brought me this bill of exchange for £400, at three months, dated 22nd December, 1893—I asked him how he got it—he said, "My brother gave it to me, to assist me; it is not convenient for him to give me cash at present, but he has given me this"—I said, "It is an accommodation acceptance; I must have a letter from your brother authorising you to deal with it "; and I dictated such a letter to him, which he took down in shorthand, and next day he brought me back a letter, purporting to be signed by his brother—I know the prisoner's writing; the body of the letter and of the hill is in the prisoner's undisguised writing. (<hi rend="italic">" Read</hi> 23rd December. The promissory note for £400 is mine; given to you for your accommodation, and payable to your enter, and which I will meet on your account at maturity. Yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">H. A.

               <p>money from them, and I brought an action—Mr. Ashley Derby, of 32, Gracechurch Street, was my solicitor in that action—I was present at his office on 21st March, when the prisoner was there, and I saw the prisoner sign this statement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My bankers are Messrs. Coutts—there was a bill which Captain Staples accepted and the prisoner drew—I gave the prisoner a cheque for £200 for it—I have not got the cheque; I have a voucher from Coutts—they do not return cheques, and they have mislaid the cheque—I have my bank-book—I have no other securities of the prisoner—I never had in my possession an acceptance by a director of the Bank of England which the prisoner gave me, or any West African shares—I saw an acceptance of Sir Seymour Blane; if the prisoner gave it to me he got it back—I don't know if I ever had it—he asked me to see about it, and I wrote to some people, and there was an end of it—I did not sign the charge-sheet—I am not the prosecutor—I do not think I knew that the prisoner was negotiating for the repurchase of the Rose Hill Estate, Sutton, when he gave me this £400 bill—I knew at one time that Mr. Charlesly was willing to sell to the prisoner—it was after the time of the bill—years ago they had sold to him, and he had resold at a profit—it would be useless to sue the Discount Bank, assuming the prisoner is guilty—I do not assume he is guilty—I made inquiries—Mr. Troup proved under the prisoner's bankruptcy for this £214; I paid Mr. Troup back—I acted for Mr. Troup; it was his money, and when the bill was protested I lost the money; the prisoner knew it—the £400 bill was not given to me, with a number of other documents, to hold and not to discount; it was given to me as security for my past debt and future advances (altogether over £300), in pursuance of the letter I have read to you—there were other advances after December—I never heard of a similar bill three or four years before, signed "H. A. Cooke," at the time the prisoner purchased the Sutton Estate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think my solicitors communicated with the Public Prosecutor when I heard from the Discount Bank—I did not believe it was a forgery—I have communicated with the Public Prosecutor; he communicated with the City Solicitor—I have a letter, dated 18th February, from the prisoner, making an appointment for me to see his brother, H. A. Cooke, at St. James's Palace, at 11.30 on Tuesday—I kept the appointment, and saw his brother at St. James's Palace—he repudi<lb/>ated the bill—this is the letter making the appointment—the prisoner met me outside St. James's Palace, he did not go inside—I saw someone who said his name was H. A. Cooke—I said who I was, and that I came to see if the signature to the promissory note was genuine; I had not got it with me—I asked if he signed a promissory note for £400, dated 22nd December—he said he had never signed a promissory note in his life—he said he had been asked about it by somebody from a bank—this was after I had given the note to Mr. Capes; that was why I could not show it to him—I said it was a very serious matter; "I received a note from your brother, George Cooke, and if it is not your signature it is tantamount to charging your brother with forgery"—he repeated over and over again that it was not his signature, and that either he had no brother, or that "That man is no brother of mine"—I cannot say exactly what he said; he was very excited—I think he referred to the prisoner</p>

               <p>as "That man"—I afterwards saw the prisoner outside, and told him his brother had repudiated the transaction—I have no doubt I told him exactly what had occurred; I was very angry—I told him it was a very serious matter to him, and that his brother said he was no brother of his, and he knew nothing about it—he still protested that he was his brother, and that he had signed the bill—I cannot remember now what he said; when I told him what had taken place he denied it, and said it was not true.</p>

Who will bring them; this boy?" pointing to Last, who was in the shop</p>

               <p>—I said, "Yes; he will bring some of them"—she said, "I wish these goods delivered on the 28th, between the hours of three and seven, at 17, Talbot Road, Bayswater"—she said she was the Mrs. Frost—she asked me to cash her a £5 note, which I did—Last called a cab for her; she gave him some coppers, and left in the cab—I put the six pictures in hand to be framed, and the other two were cleaned at my London Wall factory—I made out this invoice, stamped and receipted as it is now, and gave it to Last, sealed up in an envelope, on the 28th, and directed him to go and get the pictures at the factory, and to deliver them to Mrs. Frost, but not to part with them without the money, and I told him that the receipted bill was in the envelope—I saw him the same evening; he brought back the envelope unopened, just as I gave it to him—he brought back no money, except 1s. 2d. for his fare; he said, "The fare has been paid"—I had not altered my orders to him at all—I told him not to part with the goods on any account without the money—I gave him no right to use his own mind about it—next morning I learnt that only six pictures had been given to Last to take on the 28th; the other two were sent on 1st March by my manager at London Wall, before I knew of it—I had not been to the factory, and did not know but what the whole of the pictures had been delivered on 28th—I don't know what time the remaining two were sent on 1st March; I learnt after the delivery that they had been sent on—I had given no instructions on the matter—I went to Talbot Road on 1st March, about 7.30 or 8 p.m.—I rang the bell half-a-dozen times, but could not get in; the house was apparently empty—I communicated with the police on March 6th, I think—about 10.30 a.m. on the 8th I applied for a warrant—Detective Sergeant Fuller was with me, and the warrant was entrusted to him—this letter was written on 5th March by my brother, who acts as my clerk, by my direction, to Mrs. Frost—next time I saw it was produced by the solicitor to Mrs. Frost at the Police-court, and handed in by her. (<hi rend="italic">This letter was read as follows</hi>: "Madam,—I have placed myself in communication with Messrs.

I am on the cabman's track that took them away, and expect to see him to-morrow. I hope you will send me a cheque, or payment for the goods to save bother")—at that time I had some information with regard to a cabman removing the goods—I wanted my money, if I could get it—I received no communication, and the warrant was taken out—on 12th March, four days after the Magis<lb/>trate granted the warrant, I received this letter in this envelope with a crest. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mrs. Frost has been away, and has consequently only just received your letter. She is utterly at a loss to understand your letter; but, as you say you want your pictures back, they will be at once returned")—on 21st March a young man brought the pictures back—I had previously seen him—I would have nothing to do with them, but referred the matter to the police, and the pictures were taken to the Police-station, and the young man was taken into custody for receiving stolen goods—the police still have the pictures—I think the prisoner was taken on the same night, 21st—she and the young man were brought before the Magistrate next day, and the case was adjourned till</p>

Mr. Joyner knows me very well.

He said, 'Is it a large house?' I said, 'Yes, sir.' Mr. Joyner said, 'Oh, but Mrs. Frost promised to pay me on delivery, and she has not done it.' I said, 'Mr's. Frost says she will come up to-morrow or next day, and pay the money certain.' Mr. Joyner said, 'All right' "—that was true—I don't remember if that was the statement to which my attention was directed when I was at the solicitor's office—I forgot for the moment when I said Mr. Joyner did not say "All right"—he said, "All right; I will go down there and see for myself"—I don't remember if that was the statement to which my attention was called—I did not tell the Magistrate anything but what was taken down on the deposi<lb/>tions and read to me—I do not know why I did not tell the Magistrate that my master was cross with me for having left the pictures without getting the money—I saw him the next morning before I went with the other two pic<lb/>tures—all he said to me was, "Take the bill and get the money, or bring all the pictures back"—I left the pictures without the money, and brought back the receipted bill—on my return I told him what I had done; he was not cross then, he remonstrated with me—I did not tell him then that I had left the two pictures that day—I told him I had not got the money—I did not take all the eight on the 28th February, because we could not carry them—I said before the Magistrate that the prisoner said, "Mr. Joyner knows me very well, and knows all about it "—I don't remember telling the Magistrate that she said, "Mr. Joyner knows me very well"—I did not say before the Magistrate that when I said, "All right, you will come up and pay, won't you?" that the prisoner said, "Yes."</p>

My brother ran after me to hit me, calling me a dirty little cow. He lifted his hand to strike me, and my mother received the blow instead of me. He continued his blows, and hit me and my sister, and his wife came from Storey Street and hit my mother and knocked her under a horse's head. I pulled her off the ground, when his wife struck her husband three or four times. He took the knife from her hand and drew it across my mother's wrist. I twisted his wrist and got the knife out of his hand and threw it away in the road, and then went indoors. The above is a voluntary statement made by me at North Woolwich Station")—the knife has not been found.</p>

I am a medical man, of 478, New Cross Road—on May 3rd, about 3.30 a.m., the prisoner came to me, and asked me to come and see his wife, who had fainted away, and they could not bring her to—I asked him if she had been liable to attacks of the same sort before—he said, "Yes," and that he had always succeeded in bringing her to before this—I went with him, and found his wife lying on a bed in the front room at 39, Abbey Street—she was dead; she had been dead probably more than an hour—I examined her heart; there was no pulse—the extremities were cold—there was no <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>—next morning I made a post-mortem examination at the mortuary—the body was that of a fairly nourished woman, aged about 30—there were bruises; the most prominent and largest bruise was in front of the right temple, about an inch and a half long, and about an inch wide—there was a cruciform mark about the middle of the wound I have described—I think that indicated that that portion of the bruise had been more recently inflicted than the other portion—there was also a bruise of probably older standing across the bridge of the nose, and a black eye, the left eye—I think the bruises were probably caused by a lit, probably a few hours before death—I think those were the only recent bruises—there were old bruises on the left cheek and lower jaw, and one on the back of the head; there was also one on the left knee of no importance—the cause of death, I should say, was failure of the heart's action, syncope—there was an affection of two valves of the heart—I should say that death was probably accelerated by violence—there was no fracture of the skull, and no laceration or effusion inside it—but for those injuries, the woman would probably have lived for a considerable time—it is possible that she might have died without any violence—I think she had been a hard drinker—from the condition of the heart I think she would be extremely liable to fainting fits—I cannot pledge my oath that the bruises might not have been caused months before—it is possible she might have died from syncope, from excitement.</p>

I am divisional police surgeon, and live at 224, Lewisham High Road—I saw the deceased on the morning of May 3rd—<hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> had just begun—I saw a bruise on her right temple, and effu<lb/>sion in and round the left eye—in my opinion that was a recent bruise, I should say inflicted within a few hours of, or at the time of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say for certain that the most recent of the bruises had not been caused before twelve o'clock—she was suffering from a form of heart disease, as I gather from what Dr. Therman has said—any excitement or violence might lead to a sudden death in the case of a person so suffering.</p>
