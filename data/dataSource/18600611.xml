                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Hunt and Roskill—about the commencement of November, the female prisoner came there with another person, not Pearce, and I showed them some jewellery; among other articles I particularly recollect an emerald bracelet, a stock one, value about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the emerald was worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they moved to the other side of the shop and saw some more bracelets—after stopping there about half an hour looking at various things, they put two bracelets on one side and said that they would call next day and decide which they would take—we never saw them afterwards—on, I think, the following day or very closely after they had been there, I saw the case in which this bracelet ought to have been, and it was not there.</p>

               <p>empty box on the following day or the day after; I thought it possible that it might have been mislaid or given out as a pattern—I had shown that bracelet to a great many other people, but this was the last time I showed it—I cannot say whether I showed it to anybody the same day or some days previously—when we show articles of that description some little time must elapse before they are placed in their places again, according to the pressure of business—things sometimes lay there for an hour or so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Harry Emanuel—I recollect two persons coming in to our shop—I recollect the male prisoner perfectly well, and the female to the best of my belief—it was at the com<lb/>mencement of January, I believe the 3d, near about 4 o'clock—there was a great deal of jewellery on the counter; amongst the jewellery there was a diamond locket—it was towards the end of the counter or table—the female prisoner moved about from one end to the other; at last she stopped at the left end of the counter—when they came in they asked to see some lockets—they were shown a great many; they were not expensive enough, and they were shown some more expensive—after a long time they ordered two diamond and turquoise lockets and earrings to match—they would amount to from 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they wished it to be done by a certain time as they were leaving for America—I mentioned the names of one or two Americans, and the male prisoner said he knew them perfectly well, in fact, he said, he had brought a watch of ours over from an American gentleman, a customer of ours—we asked him if we should send for it—he said, "Oh no, I will bring it the next time I come"—he gave his address as Portland-place—he wrote the name and address down in a book; I have not got the book here, I do not recollect the name—I think it was Pearce, he wrote it himself in the book—I can fetch the book—while he was writing, his hand trembled very much, he said, "You see my hand shakes very much, I was at the opera last night and a diamond was stolen out of my pin"—I noticed that he wearing a pin without a stone or anything in it—the female prisoner had a muff with her which she placed on the counter, she opened some cases and said, "Oh, these are empty"—she then moved her muff to another part of the counter, and finally placed it at one part opposite to where the locket was—no other customer came in after they left, except a relation of Mr. Emanuers—after the prisoners left, the boxes were closed and in due time taken down into the strong room and locked up for the night—the loss of the locket was discovered next morning—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a silk dress produced by the officer</hi>) this is the same material and the same pattern as the dress the female came in this pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is similar to that which the male prisoner had in his scarf without any stone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 47, Seabright street, Bethnal-green—on the 12th April, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to me and asked where <hi rend="italic">Lizzie</hi> was—we call Miss Green <hi rend="italic">"Lizzie"</hi>—he had this large Spanish knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with a spring behind in his hand—it was bran new—he had it open up his sleeve—I saw the blade of it shine—my mother was sitting there—I said, "Mother, he has got a knife"—I caught hold of his hand and held it open, and my mother took the knife from him—I then went with him to the place where <hi rend="italic">Lizzie</hi> was—I went in—she came out with me—I told her about the knife—she and the prisoner walked on together—I saw the prisoner raise his hand two or three times and she fell to the ground; and then I saw the blood—he dropped the knife—I think he raised his hand before he struck—then I saw him strike and she fell directly—this (<hi rend="italic">a smaller one</hi>) is the knife—I saw it in his hand at the time—he did not fall—he picked up the knife again—I dragged her along and we both ran together into the baker's shop, and he ran after us with the knife in his hand—he appeared to threaten again but did nothing; only ran after us—I cannot exactly swear as to how he was holding the knife—the prosecutrix went into the baker's shop—the other witness caught hold of the prisoner before he got up to the door—I did not look at her head when I picked her up—I was so frightened—I found a good deal of blood.</p>

I live at 75, Hare street, Bethnal-green, and am a butcher—on the afternoon of 12th April, about half-past 5 o'clock, I heard a screaming outside the shop—I went out and saw the last witnesses running and the prisoner after them—they ran into a baker's shop—he was stopped against the door—he had a small knife with him, something similar to this—he was following them, he was some yards off of them—I did not notice how he was holding the knife—I took it away from him—he was not running after them to take care of them—he was not very violent—the police constable then came up.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 12th April, near the baker's shop—he said, "Here I am, you can take me if you like; I have been and stabbed a young woman"—I said, "Nonsense, you don't mean to say that?"—Morley gave me the knife—the prisoner then said, "You don't mean to lock me up?"—I said, "Most decidedly I do"—he then flung himself on the ground and commenced kicking—he was tipsy—I took him to the surgeon's—I was then told that a young female had been stabbed—on the way to the station he said, "Is she dead?"—I said, "I don't know"—he said, "I hope she is, for I intended to kill her, and will some day"—I cautioned him against what he was saying as it might be brought against him—he said, "You may say what you like and be b----d, I have made up my mind to be hung for her some day"—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Winchester-street, Waterloo-town, Bethnal-green—I was called to attend the prosecutrix, and found a wound on the top of her head nearly three niches long, cut through the scalp and penetrating to the bone—there was a good deal of bleeding, and she was in a very low state—such a knife as this would inflict such a wound if used with great violence—it appeared to me to be done with violence—she was in danger.</p>

On Saturday evening, 14th April, I was on duty in Cumberlaud-street, Bryanston-square, about a quarter past 8—I saw the dining-room window of No. 43, Cumberland-street open—I knocked at the door, the female witness came to the door and answered me, and while we were talking, a man who is not now in custody, came from a room, he said that he was engaged by the gentleman of the house—not feeling satisfied, I was about to push him backwards in the hall to secure him, when he sprang past me; I caught hold of his coat and we struggled together in the road for a minute or two—the two prisoners came up close alongside of me, and I saw them take from their coat sleeves a life-preserver each—they first hit me on the lower part of my back, then twice on my head—before that, when the man was on the ground, be called out, "Give it to the b----" it was after that that they took out their life-preservers—Green struck me first and Thomas afterwards—I turned round and said, "You are striking, the wrong one"—I thought they had come to assist me—they all three then made their escape—my head was cut open—I was unable to attend to my duty till 27th April—I am quite sure the prisoners are the two men that struck me—we were close by a lamp.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a groom in the service of a gentleman of 37, Great Cumberland-street—On the evening of 14th April I was outside the area gate three doors off from 43, the numbers run odd there—it was about a quarter past 8; I saw two men walking up and down on the same side as 43—after I had seen them walking up and down I saw a struggle going on in the street between a policeman and some man—I saw the two men go up to them, and all of a sudden I saw the fall of a stick or some instrument, and then I looked round and saw three men running away and the other lying on the ground—I am able to speak to Thomas with certainty, he was the last to run away; as he was running he made a stumble in the road and his hat fell off, he came rolling against me and said to me, "I will catch the b----s"—I said, "Yes, do"—I thought he was a <hi rend="italic">swell</hi> running after them, they were running on in front—he was close to me when he picked his hat up—he ran after the other two as fast as he could go, when he had picked his hat up—I then went to assist the man who was on the</p>

On Tuesday morning, 17th April, I went to 41, Nightingale-street, about half-past 10—I found the two prisoners there in the front parlour playing cards with two females—I apprehended them on another charge—I told Thomas I wanted him for being concerned with others not in custody, for stealing plate in the Bermondsey-road on Sunday night, and advised them to go with me quietly—Thomas prepared to go—I walked to the door before him, and told him I should lead him, and he knocked and kicked me about—Green came out with a poker and struck all three of us, there were two other constables with me—Thomas put on his stockings and his boots before he left, and his Inverness cape—he took up the poker and said he would take our b----lives if we attempted to lead him.</p>

Murray and Langham—I am not certain—there were fifty hogsheads, which came to somewhere about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have received money for freights on that vessel since the supply of these goods—as brokers we always collect the freight for the ship—we have received from 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. freight under this charter, which we shall keep until the case is over; but we have paid the charter party 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we have put it to the debit of the freight—I do not know anything of a bill of exchange for the 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we judge from our correspondence that we have not received one—we have letters from fche owner stating that he has never received any security for the hire of the vessel, but we never put the question to him.</p>

I saw the prisoner take it away—it was not one of the pieces he was to take—it was not put amongst the property that he had a right to take—it was put very near the pieces that he was to take—they were on the floor, and this piece was about three feet from them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks at the General Post-Office—in consequence of complaints from the North Eastern district office, Bethnal-green-road, I directed a test letter to be made up on 28th May, addressed to Mr. J. Easton, 35, Forest-place, Leyton, Essex—it was directed in my presence by Mr. Clare—I enclosed in that letter a half-sovereigu aud an American two and a half dollar piece—I secured the envelope with adhesive matter, and then gave it to Mr. Clare, one of the inspectors of letter carriers, with instructions to post it the following morning—I had also given previous instructions to Mr. Reeves, the inspector of the North Eastern district office—if the letter was posted according to my directions to Mr. Clare, it would reach the North Eastern office at about twenty minutes past 5 in the morning—in consequence of some information, I went to the post<lb/>office receiving house of the North Eastern district in Bethnal-green-road at about twenty minutes past 8 in the morning—the prisoner was brought to me there in a private room, I asked him if he was on duty at the North Eastern district office this morning, he said he was; I asked him what time he arrived there, he said, "About twenty minutes past 5"—I asked him if he knew anythiug of a money letter addressed to Leyton—he said he did not—I then directed the police officer Bingham, who was present, to search the prisoner, and from his left hand coat pocket inside, Bingham took the letter addressed to Mr. J. Easton—I said to the prisoner, "Why here is the letter I have been inquiring about, the officer has just taken it out of your pocket," and, I asked him how he accounted for its being there—he replied, "I do not know how it got there"—I then said, "You can't very</p>

               <p>well have a letter in your pocket without knowing how it got there"—he said, "I put it there myself"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he made no reply—when he was brought into the private room he had some other letters in his hand, which he had not delivered—I asked him why he had not delivered each letter as I looked them out separately; that applied to all but the letter addressed to Woodford; that was not in his district, it was addressed to Master James Carter, Grove House, Woodford-green, Essex; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said to him, "Here is a letter addressed to Woodford-green, how do you account for its possession?"—he said, "I found it amongst my letters, I found both letters amongst my letters, and intended to have written upon them and sent or taken them back to the office"—I said, "But when you set your letters in, you must have seen these letters amongst them"—the prisoner replied that he did not set his letters in—setting them in means arranging them in order for delivery—I asked him, "Who did set the letters in?"—he replied, "Cheatham"—he is a letter carrier employed in the North Eastern office; the prisoner's walk was the Abbey-street walk, Bethnal-green, he had, nothing whatever to do with the Essex letters; if a letter was mis-sorted he had no right to take it out of the office at all—I opened the letter addressed to James Carter before the Magistrate; it contained two sixpences, they could be felt through the letter—I have not opened the other letter—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here opened the letter</hi>) there are two coins here, a half-sovereign, and an American coin—I have not examined them—the post-mark is on the letter addressed to Carter, the date is 19th May, posted in the Eastern district on 28th, it would be dated on 29th; if it were posted late at night it would bear the stamp of the following morning—you could feel the money through both letters from the outside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers at the General Post<lb/>Office. On 28th May, I addressed this letter to Mr. J. Easton, which has been produced by Gardner—I saw him enclose the money in the letter, he fastened it and gave it to me—I posted the letter at the General Poet-Offiee, about 5 o'clock on the morning of 29th, I put it in the letter-box—it would leave the General Post-Office to go to the North Eastern district, about a quarter past 5, the bag would arrive within ten minutes of the time of its despatch—I afterwards went with Gardner to the receiving office, when the prisoner came to have his card signed—when a letter carrier has finished his delivery he has his card signed, that we may know at what time he has finished his delivery—a letter posted at Bow addressed to Woodford-green, Essex, about 7 in the evening of 28th, would come in due course to the Geueral Post-Office, and it would go with the 5 o'clock despatch to the North Eastern district; that was the same despatch as this other letter went by—when the Essex letters get to the North Eastern district, they are put before the letter carriers to sort, and then they go in a cart to the Woodford and Leyton post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the inspector of the North Eastern district office—the prisoner was employed as a letter sorter and letter carrier at that office—many others were employed on the morning of 29th in sorting letters besides the prisoner—I recollect the bag arriving with the letters from the General Post-Office, on that morning at about twenty-five minutes past 5—I think I opened the bag and took out the letters; among them I</p>

               <p>found this letter, addressed to Mr. J. Easton, Forest-place, Leyton, Essex—I knew there would be such a letter—it was not loose in the bag; it was with two or three others—I put it into a bundle with some other letters and placed it before the prisoner; he did not touch the bundle—I cut the string and opened the bundle, and left the letters before him to sort; he sorted the letters—there are two boxes, one called the Hackney box and the other the Loughton box—they are placed before the sorter—the letter addressed to Leyton should have been put by the prisoner into the Loughton box—most likely among the bundle there would be letters for him to deliver on his own walk—he would sort them to another department for the town letters—the Loughton letters were tied up in bundles, put into a bag, sealed up, and sent from the office to Loughton in a mail cart—if letters have been sorted for the town delivery, they are set up by the carriers who have to deliver them—the prisoner's walk on this morning was Abbey-street walk—there were two other letter carriers at the office that morning who had to deliver letters upon that same walk; Cheatham and Gargrave—the letters for the town delivery are sorted for each walk, and the carriers who have to deliver them on a particular walk divide the letters between them—the prisoner left the office on this morning to deliver his letters at twenty-eight minutes after 7—I saw him running through the letters before he tied them up—that is not what we call setting them up: they would have been set up before that, but they all arrange them before they leave the office—Cheatham had set some of them in the first instance, and I expect the prisoner did some himself—when the prisoner had left I looked at the letters for Leyton, which were already tied up—after they are brought to the room they are thrown over to the different towns and villages—I looked to see if the letter for Mr. Easton was there; it was not there—I then made a communication to Mr. Gardner.</p>

On the night of 24th April, I walked into the Green Man public-house—the prisoner and the deceased were there, they were sparring together—only the prisoner was sparring—he was sparring near Dixon—Dixon stood leaning his back against the partition; he did nothing; but he said to the prisoner "You can't fight, you never could"—the prisoner asked him to fight—Dixon said, "You never could fight"—they had a little bit of a bustle in the house and then went out—the prisoner struck at Dixon, missed his blow and fell backwards—he then got up and hit him in the bowels, and they both went down together—I am sure of that—he hit him with his fist, he did not kick him—this was on the footpath—they only fought one round—I did not take any notice of how they were as to liquor—after they had had the one round, I saw Dixon walk into the Green Man again—he walked in and sat down there—I went in after him and asked him if he was hurt; he did not make me any answer—he appeared to be hurt—he put his two arms like this, over his bowels—I did not take notice whether the prisoner was the worse for liquor—he did not seem so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I was called to the deceased on 26th April—I found him lying dead on his bed—I made a post-mortem examination—in my judgment the cause of death was inflammation of the bowels, from the contents of the bowel having poured into the abdominal cavity; it was the ilium that was ruptured—it was produced by external violence, there being no ulceration of the bowels to cause a rupture—there was no morbid appearance to account for it—it might be produced by a blow, any external violence sharply applied would do it—he appeared much more healthy than I expected to have found him, having known him some years.</p>

I was a little excited with speaking about this great fight between Sayers and the American; we were both excited with liquor; we got as far as to holding one another; we got to words and to blows, and I believe we got outside and hit one another; we had one round out there, but it was furthest from my intention to have words with him if he had not began; we were both partly the worse for liquor; this was on Tuesday. I worked all day on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, not knowing that any accident had taken place at all, and coming home on Saturday night at 4 o'clock I went into the same house again to get half a pint of ale, and the policeman was there, and apprehended me on the charge of killing this man. I passed and repassed the place night and morning, and I was not aware that there was anything the matter.</p>

On the night of 30th April, or the morning of 1st May, I was on duty in the Exhibition-road, Kensington, about quarter past 12 o'clock—I saw a number of persons there, I think about thirty—I saw the prisoner; he was in his shirt sleeves—I also saw another man in his shirt sleeves with him—the deceased was sitting down against the fence, and there were two, three, or four persons about him, or there might be more—I had previously passed them, and they were then trying to get him home—when I found him sitting down near the fence, I made some inquiry, put him in a cab, and took him to Dr. Christian and then to the station, where Dr. Christian's assistant came to see him; the deceased was then dead; I think he died before I got him to the station—in conse<lb/>quence of information, I afterwards went to No. 8, New-road, Chelsea, that same day—I found the prisoner there in bed—I told him he must consider himself in custody for killing one Thomas Weller—he said, "Have I killed him?"—as I was taking him to the station, he said the fight was not his own seeking, the deceased had been bothering him for several days; he had met him on the Saturday night previous and he wanted to fight then, but he, the prisoner, would not fight, and the deceased was determined to have it out on this night, and they went to the Exhibition-road to fight—after the charge was made against him at the station he said it was not his own fight, it was the deceased's own seeking—he said the quarrel had occurred at the Queen and Prince Albert public-house, Knightsbridge, on the Saturday night previous—I took the body of the deceased to the Chelsea workhouse.</p>

I am watchman to Mr. Freak, a builder—on the 30th April, about 12 o'clock, I was at the comer of Princes Gate—I heard a noise down the road and went to see what it was—I saw the prisoner and the deceased fighting; the prisoner was stripped to his shirt, the deceased had got his waistcoat on; but his coat was off—I should say there were nine or ten persons present—I told them they had better give over; they did not, they continued fighting—it was exactly four minutes past 12 when the last blow was struck; at the last round they met each other, and the deceased fell and the prisoner fell upon him; to the best of my belief the last blow was struck under the ear of the deceased, but I cannot posi<lb/>tively swear—I saw the prisoner strike him somewhere about the face; after the deceased fell he laid there till he was picked up; he never moved—he was taken up by two men and taken about 200 yards down the road, and they placed him in a sitting position against the fence.</p>

I am comptroller and secretary to the savings-bank in St. Martin's-place—I produce a deposit account from which it appears that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was deposited in our savings-bank in April, 1843, in the name of Joseph Henry Manley, a minor—according to the course of business, if any<lb/>body comes to receive interest or principal, it is necessary that he should he identified—in the case of a minor, when an account is opened we take the signature of the parent or guardian, who is always required to identify the parties when they come to take out the money; whether it be principal or interest—on 2d June I saw both the prisoners at my office—the female prisoner said she came to withdraw the interest on the account—it amounted to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I inquired of her whether the male prisoner was her son, she said he was—as he did not appear to be a minor, I inquired what his age was—he said it was either 23 or 24; I forget which—I said in that case he would be master of his own account, and I struck out the word "minor"—the female said she did not want to take the principal, only the interest—I then sent them into the other office to the chief cashier, to receive the money, and to make his signature in our books, in order that we might not have to refer to the mother oil any future occasion—the last time any interest was paid upon this account was on 4th December, 1854—the female prisoner had originally placed the money in the name of her son—there were six children, and she brought all the six children to put in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—it was money standing in the name of her husband, and she took out administration to his effects, and received 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing of the male prisoner, we relied entirely on the female to identify him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief cashier of the savings-bank in St. Martin's-place—On the morning of 2d June the two prisoners were brought into my office by Mr. Boodle—the name of Joseph Henry Manley was called out by me, and the male prisoner answered—I wrote this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and laid it before the prisoner—I told him to write his name on this line, and he signed it, "Jophis Henry Manley"—seeing that he had spelt the name wrongly I asked him to sign his name again, which he did, spelling both "Joseph" and "Henry" wrong—the female prisoner was alongside of himall that time—a conversation then took place between the prisoners—one of them said that on the last occasion of a re-payment the male prisoner signed his name, and the other said he did not, but which said which I cannot say—the female prisoner then said that the re-payment was made at a certain part of the office where I was quite certain it was not, from our regulations—I then requested them to go into Mr. Boodle's private office, and told him I thought we had not the right man in this case—he requested the female to leave the room, and then asked the male prisoner if he was the son of the female prisoner—he said, "Oh! it is all right; it isthe woman's money; I have done it before."</p>

On 4th June, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was on the premises of Mr. Vonder Heyde, a whole<lb/>sale tobacconist in Thames-street—I saw the prisoner there—he was in Mr. Vonder Heyde's employment—he took a parcel from underneath the counter—he gave it to a boy to take to a public-house next door, to be left till called for—I was in the shop at this time, in plain clothes; I could hear what was said—I saw the prisoner go out of the warehouse about 7 o'clock, or a little after—I was at the public-house door then—he went into the public-house and got the parcel—directly he saw me he walked iu at the private bar of the public-house—in there I asked him what he had got in that parcel—he said, "A pound and a half of tobacco"—I asked him whether he had got an invoice for it—he said, "No"—I told him that I was a detective officer—I asked him whether it was entered in the book—he said, "No"—I asked him whether Mr. Vonder Heyde was aware that he took the tobacco—he said, "Yes"—I asked him where he was going to take it to—he said to a friend of his named Scrivener at Mile-end—he said it was for a friend of Mr. Scrivener's, that he was in the habit of supplying his friend with tobacco and charging him wholesale price for it—he wanted me to accompany him to Mile-end; I declined to go—I took him to the station, where he was searched—on him were found twelve cigars and a case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, four coins, and a fusee box—I went to his lodgings; I found there this tobacco, and this snuff-box—there is a pound and a half of the tobacco.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier of 44, Fleet-street—on 21st May, about half-past 5 o'clock, the prisoners came together to my shop—Kelly asked for some pocket handkerchiefs—I got a pile of ten or twelve pieces, and placed them not before them, but near them on the counter—I opened seven or eight pieces and threw them on the counter—Kelly opened a piece on the top of those which I had opened, and complained that it felt stiff and harsh, and was very much pressed—she asked if I had nothing better—Rose was about three feet from her, and had a child suckling—I told Kelly we had handkerchiefs hemmed and washed, and she could tell better what they were—she asked me to lot her see them, and while I partly turned round to get the paper down, I saw a move of Kelly's arm, and when I turned round I missed a piece of light coloured silk-handkerchief; the only light piece that I had left before them—I took no notice of that, but showed her the others—she took no notice of them, but said she would have one off a piece which was opened, and I cut one off the piece—she gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for it, and I had to give her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—before I gave her change I cleared the other handkerchiefs from the counter, and I said, "I miss a piece of light coloured handkerchief, one of you must have got it, which is it?"—Kelly rose from her seat and said she was surprised at the charge—I reached over the counter and looked over in hopes of seeing the piece, but there was none—Kelly was then stand<lb/>ing away from the counter—I told them I was positive I had lost it, and I said, "One of you must have it"—they both declared their innocence, and said I might search them—I said, "I can't do that, but I will send for a policeman"—I said to one of my assistants. "Go fetch a policeman"—Kelly was then standing; I said, "You had better sit down," and she took her seat again—the policeman arrived, and Kelly again rose from her seat and said, "I have not got them, you may search me"—I wanted to re<lb/>cognise what pattern it was I missed, and I stepped to the other counter where I had lain the other to see which pattern it was—the policeman came towards me away from the prisoners, he spoke to me, and in the mean<lb/>time Kose had got up from her seat and took the seat where Kelly had been sitting—the chair must have been moved about six feet away—on turning round Rose was sitting down, and I pointed to the officer and said, "There is the piece of handkerchief I have lost"—it was then on Rose's dress aud rolled up; it was partly on her dress and partly against the counter—it had before been spread out three-quarters of a yard long—the policeman took the handkerchief, and I gave the prisoners in charge—this is the piece of handkerchief—it cost me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I said that it was his former wife who he had married in Scotland—he seemed very much confused, and said, "It is too true, and I suppose I must submit"—he said to his second wife that I was going to take him away on a charge of bigamy, that he had married another woman in Scotland some years pre<lb/>vious to his knowing her, and he wished her, the second wife, to forgive him—I took him to the station and he gave his proper name, Robert Brown.</p>

               <p>given in tihe letter. I did not think then that she was dead, but thought they would not correspond with a mined and penniless man. I afterwards heard from two of my fellow townsmen that she was dead, and afterwards married my present wife. I intreat you to believe that I had no guilty knowledge: fifteen year elapsed between the first and the second marriage. I had no motive or inducement to break the law, as Elizabeth Darby had no money or property, she being only a domestic servant; neither could it be for the purpose of possessing her person, for I had already lived with her, as my wife, previous to marriage: my only aim in doing so arose from her sense of the disgraceful way in which we were living. I have been five weeks in prison and have five children who have no bread winner but myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first become acquainted with Mr. Richardson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about August last year—it was not on the occa<lb/>sion of his calling upon me to ask if I would support Colonel Hicks as a candidate for the office of Governor of Whitecross-street—the first time I saw Mr. Richardson was in reference to the formation of the London Rifle Brigade; that would be about August or the latter end of July—I can't charge my memory exactly; it was some time in last summer—he called upon me suggesting that I should become Colonel of the brigade—he was, no doubt, the first to suggest to me my joining the brigade, he and Colonel Hicks—he was instrumental in getting up the brigade; I will not say he was mainly instrumental, but he was instrumental; he and Colonel Hicks were the two parties that called on me in the first instance—as to getting it up, I think I got it up as much as anybody, I think I did the majority of the work—I was, no doubt, very much assisted at the outset by Mr. Richardson and Colonel Hicks, and by the public—I had known nothing at all of him previous to that—after I joined the brigade I was Vice-President of the Council; I was made Vice-President at a public meeting—there was a reso<lb/>lution to that effect—Richardson was present at that meeting—I do not feel that he made me Vice-President; there was a public meeting called at the Guildhall: at that public meeting certain resolutions were passed, among others that the Lord Mayor, for the time being, should be President, and that I should be Vice-President, and certain gentlemen were named to be on the Council; and that was the origin of the London Rifle Brigade—I am not aware that there was any resolution appointing Richardson to be Secretary: you will find his appointment in the minutes of the Council—there was a special minute appointing him acting Secretary <hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi> with a commission of five per cent, on monies collected, which commission was to be arranged and de<lb/>termined by the Finance Committee, of which I was chairman—the five per cent, commission was to be upon sums collected by Mr. Richardson—there were large sums collected by individual exertions—that was to be his mode of payment; whether he was entitled upon particular sums, was to be de<lb/>termined by the Council, and there was a special minute to that effect—this is the minute first appointing him Secretary (<hi rend="italic">referring to the minute book</hi>), it is under the date of 3d August—(<hi rend="italic">Reads</hi>:) "A discussion ensued as to the office of Secretary—Mr. Richardson was requested to act as Secretary <hi rend="italic">pro tem.</hi>—"It was unanimously resolved that Mr. Richardson be empowered to collect donations and subscriptions for this brigade, and that he be allowed a commis<lb/>sion of five percent on all monies he has obtained or may obtain, and that should any question arise in reference to his commission account it be referred to the Finance Committee"—This is the resolution appointing me to the Finance Committee—"It was unanimously resolved that the next meeting of the Council take place at the Mansion House, on Wednesday next, at three o'clock precisely"—the date of this is 6th July, and then at the next meeting of the Council, "That the Finance Committee consist of Sir Francis Doyle, Bart., Mr. Alderman Carter, and Mr. Alderman Rose"—I dare say there is a resolution appointing trustees; I will endeavour to find</p>

               <p>it—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Giffard stated that there was no resolution nominating trustees, as such</hi>)—I know there was a resolution appointing trustees for the Crystal Palace agreement, and I had an idea there was one for that purpose—as an active member of the brigade, if there had been a resolution appointing trustees I should have known it, but these matters are very Voluminous, and I should not like to charge my memory without referring to the books; as Mr. Giffard informs me he has, and that there is no such resolution, of course that will save me the trouble of informing my mind of it—this little book (<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced by Mr. Gibbons</hi>) contains the original rules of the brigade—I believe it was published by our authority, but I should explain that those rules have been very much altered, and the authorised rules were only passed on the 16th of last month, but originally these rules were given out to the brigade—I do not know of my own knowledge that the prisoner is a mem<lb/>ber of the brigade besides being Secretary; he may be, but I do not know it—I took upon myself the duty of auditing the accounts—there are 1,500 members—I cannot charge my memory about the feet whether the prisoner paid his three guinea subscription as an honorary member, it may be so, I do not know it (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>); this paper indicates that he has paid his three guineas, and that he was a member of the corps; this is the first time I knew of the fact—this paper is evidence of the fact that he was a volunteer as well as myself—I never saw a docu<lb/>ment of that kind before in connexion with any other member of the brigade; I see it is signed by the Lord Mayor—I was chairman of the Finance Committee—I undertook, as my duty, to audit the accounts; I audited them personally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you audit them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had Mr. Richardson in the office and I had this book—I can give you the date when I first audited them—the first signature of mine here is 21st September—I cannot tell who was present then, I have no means of refreshing my memory, except that I was there because I find my signature: I have only that to guide me, I cannot charge my memory—the next occasion that I can speak to by reference to this book is 14th November—I can't say that that was the second occasion upon which I audited the accounts, it is the second occasion that I can speak positively to as to date—there would be a weekly audit, but this has my signature—I cannot tell who was present then, I only know I was there—I cannot say who was present on the next occa<lb/>sion, I can only say that I made the audit, because here is my signature, and here is my memorandum of the digest of the account in the book—it was very seldom that anybody else attended, I mostly had to do it all myself—Mr. Richardson and Jeffreys were always present, I am very clear about that—Richardson was at his desk, and Jeffreys, who was a clerk brought into the office by Richardson, was called in with this cash-book, the banker's book, and the vouchers, and upon that I made my audit, such as it was—I did not go through the accounts with Jeffreys, but with Richardson, Jeffreys being the man that wrote the papers under the direction of Richardson—Richardson took the part of explaining the accounts and producing the vouchers—the actual carrying of the books was done by Jeffreys, but the explanation was done by Richardson—the whole of this book is in Jeffreys' handwriting: all the entries are made by him—I am not speaking of all the audits—the first audit is in Richardson's handwriting, signed by me: that is to say the materials of the audit are put in and signed by me; all the audits after that are in my own handwriting completely, in red ink, showing the details of the explanation of the account—none of these</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The original entries in the book that you had to audit are all in Jeffreys' handwriting; is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Jeffreys being a clerk put there by Richardson without any authority from the Council—he was paid by the Council, but he was engaged by Richardson and employed by him—there is no minute in the book appointing him—when I made the audit, in order that everybody might understand the book by looking at it, I put a sort of digest at the end of each audit in red ink—in the first instance that was done by Jeffreys and signed by Richardson—that was the one of 14th November, but I did it ever afterwards, and initialed it—there is no handwriting of Richardson's after 14th November, in the original entry nor in the digest.</p>

Silver, I put in red ink a digest of the audit, as an explanation of the account: the first of those was made by Jeffreys and signed by the prisoner, and all the rest were made by me and signed by me—my recollection of the first audit is, that I said, "No one can understand it in this way, you had better put an explanation in red ink, so that any one coming here may understand how the balance stands."</p>

               <p>ticked the other—very likely Jeffreys read out the items, but I looked to Richardson for the explanations—Richardson has read over the items to me, I cannot charge my memory with any distinct time, but I have no hesita<lb/>tion in saying that on several occasious he did as I have described Jeffreys to have done, ticked the items—I cannot identify any one particular time, but I have no hesitation in stating generally that Richardson always represented these sums as a true statement of the disbursements of the cash in his custody, and that Jeffreys was merely acting as an amanuensis—Richardson collected the money and paid it in to the bank, and he gave me this as an account of what he had received and collected; it was always brought before me as chairman of the Finance Committee, as the account of the monies collected and disbursed—other persons collected money, but it all went through Richardson's hands, and appears in the books—the money was all given by the persons collecting it into Richardson's hands, to pay into the bank—the money was always given to Richardson, on all occasions—money paid in the office would be given to Jeffreys—Silver's accounts were paid to him—if Richardson was out, money would be paid to whoever was there—no doubt Jeffreys has taken money on several occasions and Mr. Clearson also—he is a gentleman employed there by the Council some months ago to assist in the work of the office, and who is now acting as Secretary—during the time Richardson was there, there were a great many sums of money received, large and small—I can tell you exactly how much was received while he was there—it was 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was one sum of 100 guineas, a donation from the Corporation; I do not know whether he paid that in—that was the largest sum he received—the bulk of the sums were from 5 to 10 guineas, here they are (<hi rend="italic">reading over a variety of sums varying from I guinea to</hi> 20)—the prisoner was engaged in collecting subscriptions, as well as in the office—generally his mode of operation was to have one or two of the Council with him to go round to the leading firms—they introduced the subject and he acted as Secretary, and when the donations were given he took them home and paid them into the bank.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Besides that, I suppose, he did the puffing, wrote to the newspapers and all that sort of thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He put in the advertisements no doubt—he prepared the reports for the newspapers (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I dare say I may have seen this before—one of our grouuds of complaint against Mr. Richardson was that he was in the habit of putting very incorrect reports in the papers, that he put in things which did not actually take place; perhaps that may be one of them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>) I believe this is one that he prepared and sent out—all these things were not done under the sauction of the Council; he did a great many things that he had no sanction for at all—there was no special sanction for that paper that I know of; there was a general sanction for that sort of thing implied, not expressed—I think the first occasion of any complaint about his reporting was about 14th or 15th October—business had been before the Council and one mem<lb/>ber of the Council was in a minority, the remainder unanimously on the, other side, and the views of the one member were put into the report, and the decision of the Council and the bulk of the report was omitted—of course that was matter of complaint, and after that the reports were ordered to be revised; at least, I do not know whether it was after that, but at one period a minute was passed that some one was to be responsible for the reports—There was a petty cash-book kept—I was in the habit of drawing cheques for petty cash—the petty cash-book was kept in Jeffreys' handwriting, but the money was paid to Richardson to disburse; he was responsible for the money, and we looked to him for a true-account of it—he</p>

               <p>was arrested on Monday, 5th March—the warrant was applied for the same day I believe—he had sent in his resignation some weeks before that—on 20th January a committee met to inquire into his duties and emolu<lb/>ments, and after that they brought up a report, and on that report his resignation was accepted.</p>

               <p>was then moved by Mr. Alderman Allen, seconded by Mr. Alderman Rose, "that the Council empowers the Finance Committee to employ an accountant to examine the accounts at an expense of not more than twenty guineas, and report"—That sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was never paid to Mr. Richardson, because his accounts were wrong—he claimed 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as his commission—there was not another account of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for cab hire; this report recommends it, but that report was not adopted the first I heard of that claim was when the report was brought up—I did not know anything about it till then, I was not allowed to be one of the committee—I was present when the resolution was passed recommending his commission to be paid—I never heard that his claim included 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for cab hire as well as 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for commission—he never made a claim to the Council for cab hire, he may have made it to the com<lb/>mittee that met at the Mansion-house—I never heard of his claim of five guineas for professional services until I saw the report—he never could have made the claim for cab hire to me, because I have been through the petty cash, and found large sums charged for cab hire every day—the committee recommended the payment, but, as I have said, that recommendation was not adopted—this is the minute referring to it—(<hi rend="italic">Reads</hi>:) "Mr. Alderman Wire moved that the report brought up be received and agreed to, and that Mr. Richardson be appointed Secretary to the Council of this brigade on the terms and conditions named in this report—Mr. Richardson was requested to withdraw, and on his return was informed that further consideration of the subject would take place next Tuesday"—then on the Tuesday, the 17th Jan.—"a special meeting of the council was directed to be called for Friday next, at 1 o'clock, upon the office of Secretary; no other business to be dis<lb/>cussed" then the minute of the meeting of the 20th I have already read—his resignation was all this time in the hands of the Lord Mayor—it was sent in before the report was sent in, and it was formally accepted on 20th January.</p>

                  </hi>. I arrived by the Cork steamer at the Dublin wharf on Sunday morning, 29th April—I am the wife of the last witness—before leaving Ireland I packed up my things—I packed up my husband's tools; these are some of his tools; I put them in the same box where the money was—it was a red painted box—I brought that box with me, and it was put on the truck—when I saw my husband I saw Fitzgerald; I made a bargain about taking the things—he got a truck, and he and two men put all the things on the truck—I made a bargain with Fitzgerald for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take them to 7, Berwick-street—I offered him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and after he got the things on the truck, he wanted another 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I agreed to give it him—they were taken towards Tower-hill; I saw it till they turned at a corner on Tower-hill, and I lost sight of the truck—the last time I saw it Fitzgerald was with it—I don't know anything of the other two men—I have never seen that red painted box since—there were three boxes and three bundles and 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property altogether—I went to Berwick-street and stayed there about half an hour and then came back again—I saw Fitzgerald again about 5 o'clock in a public-house in Whitechapel, I asked him what he had done with my things, he said he had left them with the two men—I kept him till a constable came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Wentworth-street, and am a boot and shoe<lb/>maker—on Sunday, 29th April, I lived at 26, Flower and Dean-street—on that afternoon I saw the prisoner Besborough; he came and beckoned me out, and I followed him—he went to a house situated on the left-hand side of</p>

               <p>Lower Keate-street, the last house on the left-hand side coming from Brick-lane—when he got there he took me up stairs to a back-room, and showed me these shoemakers' tools—he asked me if I would buy them—I told him they were no use to me—they were no value—at that time another man came in whom he called <hi rend="italic">Jem Joe</hi>, and he said, "Here is a lot of cuttings" (bits of leather)—I asked him what he wanted for the lot together—the other party said. "Fifteen shillings"—I told him I would not give one third of that—he asked what I would give, and I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—Besborough said, "They are very cheap for the money"—they did not take the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then—I asked <hi rend="italic">Jem Joe</hi> how he came by these things, and he said they were left there for rent; the man had been away three weeks—I then left and went away, and when I got two or three doors off, <hi rend="italic">Jem Joe</hi> came and said I should have them—he and Besborough stood at the door together—I put two half-crowns into <hi rend="italic">Jem Joe's</hi> hand, and he gave a half-crown to Besborough.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald's Defence.</hi> For above 18 years I have been getting a living by hard work and jobbing at the wharves. I never was charged with any dishonesty. On that Sunday morning when the steam packet arrived, the prosecutor went to the wharf and tried to get in; but he was refused, no stranger being allowed, and be being much in liquor, for he had been drinking with two men whom he had employed, both strangers to me. As he could not get on the wharf, one of the two men said, if fee knew the name of the party be would go in. The prosecutor gave him the name and address, and this man then went on board the ateam packet and found the woman, and she gave him charge of the goods, and he brought them out in the street and asked me to fetch a hand-truck. When I came back the man that had charge of the goods and his mate loaded the truok, I then asked the men where the goods were going, they said to Oxford-street, near Soho, which is a long way from the wharf, aud they were to get 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I then efused to go, as that would not pay three men and truok hire; I told them to go and get a truck for themselves, as I bad left sixpence deposit on that truok; one of the men then handed me a sixpence, saying that they did not want me to go with them, and that they would take back the truck safe; they began to drag the truck along, and the prosecutor and his friend with them. I did not like to let the track go with two strangers, and I followed them to Tower-hill. I saw a policeman and I asked him to stop the truck, but he took no notice of what I said, and the two men dragged the truck along Tower-hill and the prosecutor and his friend with them. I went no further with them but returned back to the neighbourhood of the wharf, where I stopped till the afternoon. I then went to inquire of the owner if the truck had been brought back, he said, "No," and there was some one there asking about the goods, and we went to the station-house and reported the loss. If I had had any fear or known anything of the goods, I might have gone miles away, but I went seeking the truck and could not find or hear of it. On the Sunday evening I was taken, and when at the station-house, all the property I had in thd world was M. I am quite innocent of the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Middlesex Hos<lb/>pital; about a quarter past 12 in the morning of the 2d May, the prosecutrix was brought there—she was partly in an insensible state—I examined her person and found a punctured wound just above the left breast, about two inches and a half deep; it had penetrated her clothes—it might have been produced by a knife—from the direction it took it was not a dangerous wound, if it had taken another direction it would have been a very serious wound—I should think there must have been considerable force used.</p>

I am unmarried, and live with my mother at 12, West-street, Golden-square; that is next door to the house in which the prisoner and her husband have been living—he carried on the business of a tailor and trimming maker—on Sunday evening, 22d April, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was standing at my door; as near as I can remember it was about a quarter to 9 o'clock—while there I perceived a smell of fire—in consequence of that I went inside the passage of my own house—I found that it did not proceed from any part of my house, and I then went out to the street-door again—I still smelt the fire—while I was standing at my door the second time, I saw the prisoner come out at her private door—there is a shop-door and a private door to their house—smoke next attracted my attention; it came from the private door as it was shut—as the woman was coming out I saw smoke—I did not see the smoke before the door was completely closed by her; I saw her close the door and go out—the door was just closed and Mr. Bennett had passed when I saw the smoke—she had only just passed me, and I looked up and saw the smoke coming up from the private door—as the door closed to the smoke went from it and went up to the top of the house—I went and looked down the area of their house and observed flames—I could see the kitchen window from the area—there were blinds in it; they were down—I do not know how far the prisoner could have got from the house when I saw the flames in the kitchen—she could not have got very far—there was not a minute between my seeing the smoke and looking down the area and seeing the flames—I looked at once, and then I looked round to see if she was gone, and I could see nothing of her—the blinds of</p>

I am one of the fire brigade stationed at the engine house, at Golden-square—just before 9 o'clock, on Sunday evening 22d April, in consequence of information that there was a fire in West-street, I proceeded there with the men and engines—I found a policeman at the door—as soon as I had the engines ready for work, I had an axe and broke the shop door open—as soon as that was broken open I gave directions to one of the men to take the branch, and, the water being all ready, to put out the fire—he put out the worst of it in about five or ten minutes—that wag behind and under the counter, and round the shelves at the back part—when I went in I saw the fire raging in those places—we were called at fiye minutes to 9, and I should think we were round at the door in about seven minutes—it would be about two or three minutes past 9 when I entered the shop—the water was ready directly—I have been thirty-five years last February in daily experience of fires, and in my judgment and experience, the fire must have been burning for half an hour, certain—I gave orders for a man to go down into the basement, and I went down afterwards—I wag called for the kitchen—after the worst of the fire was out I sent a man down below to use the hand-pump, and to take the bundles down and put them into water, and put them back again—I subsequently went down into the kitchen after the fire had subsided, and made an examination—there bad been a three leaf clothes-horse in front of the fire with tilings on it, and a basket on a box on the right hand side of the fire had been destroyed—there were the remains of it; it was burnt to charcoal—the basket may have been removed by my man who went down—I then found out that there had been two separate fires—the clothes-horse was not destroyed, one leaf of it was a good deal charred, and the top part of the box on which the basket was, was burnt—I cannot tell you what size the basket had been, as only the charcoal of it was left—no portion of the ceiling was destroyed except by dis<lb/>colouration.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110079"/>
               <p>feet further, that would make it five feet—the counter nearest the fireplace was on fire; it was well burnt through, but the body of it would be two feet further from the fireplace—the body of the fire extended perhaps about a foot and a half to the right—that would not quite take the middle of the counter in—there would be only heat at this end, but it was burnt more towards the other end—in my judgment the fire originated near the bottom, and not at either end, it was under the counter—the materials that I found under the counter were partly consumed; they were the remains of cloth and cuttings and woollen stuff—there were shelves behind the counter round the shop, and stock upon them—the fire went round the shop—there was a basket under the counter which contained some part of his stock, but I did not examine it closely enough to know—one side of it was burnt, and part of each side was consumed down to the bottom—the contents of it were partially burnt, and likewise the ends—it was more long than round, it looked like a small hamper—I should say that the fire in the shop had been in existence the longest—I should say the fire in the kitchen com<lb/>menced after the shop had been burning some time—one was confined and the other was not—the fire under the counter was confined, and would take a long time to burn the boarding two-thirds through, to what the one in the kitchen would, that was exposed openly in the room—from the kitchen there are steps leading up stairs—I examined the state of those steps outside; they were not at all affected by the fire—I found no person in the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Tell me the reason why you say that one was longer than the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the front of the counter and the underneath part was burnt so much through the wood-work, which being confined, must take a long time—the fire in the kitchen had not burnt out, our men had put it out, it would have put itself out—the counter was burnt underneath and in front—I do not know whether it is made of mahogany or deal—I should think it may be about three quarters of an inch thick in front, and the counter itself about an inch, but I did not examine it minutely—it was a common shop counter—I did not measure it—I only stepped the size of the place—I think the shop is twelve feet by nine, and I should suppose the counter might be eight or nine feet—one end of it goes in a direction across the room and very nearly to the window, but there is a show board in the window—I did not observe some greasy measuring tapes about—the half-burnt curtains are there now; they are not here that I am aware of—there is all the stock in the shop as it was found—there are some woollen or cloth cuttings—I visited the premises about half-past 10 last night, but I did not go into the shop—I did not notice a clothes line in the kitchen—it might be hanging from the window for what I know—I observed that there had been a subsidence in the house, and there was a crevice between the top of the basement of the window and the flooring of the shop—there was just an opening in the kitchen between the front of the window-frame and the ceiling—it is at the front part of the side, and goes to the top—I do not suppose that if one of these greasy measuring tapes had been hanging down, it would have conducted the fire up, because there was plaster; though there was an opening a little to the right—I must see where the flame travels—the crevice may be about six feet from where the basket was; not the basket in the kitchen—I have not measured—I did not see any scraps of paper about the floor, I saw a trace of tinder—unless I know how a room is before a fire, I cannot tell what hag brought it from one end of the room to the other, but the papers were not</p>

               <p>so littered about as that; and it depends altogether upon whether the tapes are lying or hanging—if they are hanging they would be destroyed, but there must be a strong heat at the top of them—when you have the tapes hanging in this position they would burn well—if they were lying on the floor I should expect to find some remains, but it would depend upon how it dropped down—I think the crevice was very likely to be about three quarters of an inch wide—it goes all along the window from the side of the window-frame, and is open here and there—(<hi rend="italic">Explaining it to the Court by pointing to one of the windows</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and have carried on business in Adam-street for the last twenty-two or twenty-three years—I examined the house where the prisoner lived, where toe fire took place—there is a most easy and immediate means of communication for a flame between the two rooms—under the lining of the head of the kitchen window is a large fissure or crack, occasioned by the vibration of the house towards the street, which is very uncommon in houses; that fissure extends very nearly the entire length of the window—I saw that there had been a fire there; the communica<lb/>tion had evidently gone that way, its passage was marked—the upper portion of the frame was charred, immediately up to this crack—cobwebs, some of which remain on the opposite corner, are entirely removed from this por<lb/>tion of the frame, cleaned away—I then probed the crack to see where it led to, and found it led immediately to the under side of the floor board of the shop; I then went to the shop floor and there discovered a clear and large opening to the extent of many inches in length, and three-eighths of in inch in width—from different parts of the ceiling, but especially immediately over this opening, were hanging various articles partly consumed, those immediately over the opening were a bundle of one or two dozen tailor's measuring tapes, the under part of them was more or less burnt away, and had evidently come in contact with fire, in the situation in which they still remain—I think the burning of the cotton blind would be most likely to produce the result I saw, because the door would immediately create a draught to the fireplace, and it would naturally find that opening and ascend by it—the shop door communicating with the passage there would be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110087"/>
               <p>a large chamber of air—the fire being created under the floor, and this being a communication existing, the natural tendency of flame would be to find its way through the opening to the shop—I do not care about exhausting the air or even diminishing it if there is a passage of'air; the fire being under<lb/>neath and an opening above, it would naturally find its way—if you hold a candle to a hole leading from a lower room to an upper one, the flame will find its way through the hole, which would at once do the office of a little chimney.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you made the examination of these premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on Monday or Tuesday last—I first became acquainted with the fact that a fire had occurred at that place about five minutes before—I never saw the prisoner's husband till this moment—I have rather directed my attention to the prevention of fires in buildings—I have never made investigations in cases of fire supposed to be wilful—this is my first essay in that branch of my profession—it was not by the prisoner's husband that I was taken to see the premises—I walked—there was a solicitor who I happened to know, and who I met five minutes before—I was not informed that an inquest had been held till that moment, it might have been mentioned on the way to the place—I heard that an enquiry had been made, I did not know whether at the police-court or where—I went for the purpose of making an examination, and being possibly examined myself afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you think as a scientific gentleman, possibly to become a scientific witness hereafter, that it would be proper to solicit the fire brigade people to be present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought nothing about it—I did not solicit the presence of any third or independent party, not with the knowledge that the man was a fireman—a man was there, but I did not know he was a fireman till after I left the house—I have not seen that person here to-day—having made these investigations I arrived at the conclusion that I have stated here to-day—I did not then suggest that it would be a fair and proper thing thai those who had investigated the matter should be called to look at this great big fissure, to see whether it was in the same condition as when they saw it after the fire—I saw that it was an old fissure, one of some years' existence, that was perfectly clear—that is the fissure that runs along by the window curtain—at the time I saw the fissure, I saw the part of the counter where the fire had been raging in the shop—I did not see that the fire was confined for the most part to the centre of the counter, and underneath it—I saw it in no particular part—the shop generally was more or less charred with fire in every portion—the under portion of the fissure may have been three fourths of an inch wide—the large portion, immediately over which these articles were hanging partially consumed, was in front of what we should call the story post—the front window is here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the plan</hi>)—it is very near the door—it is on the entrance side of the counter—it is a perfectly parellel opening, supposing this to be the story post, it had moved away three-eighths of an inch in the width of the story post.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you say that it was on the public side of the counter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and close up to the face of the shop—it was a place that anybody coming into the shop might have stepped over—it ought to have been seen by the witnesses who have been examined to-day—it was just by the side of the door, anybody might see it, or thrust a stick down; it is on your left as you enter, one or two feet from you—I have been in Court to-day, and heard the fireman describe that the bulk and body of the fire was raging under the counter, and so to speak, on the proprietor's side of it, and other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110088"/>
               <p>places also, but I have heard do one deny that it was all over the shop, although it raged there principally—as an architect and surveyor I should have more prudence than to enlarge the opening—I did not take away, or cause to be taken away, any of the ceiling in order to examine the entire portion of the boards themselves—the upper portion being consumed, as you have heard, I considered it unnecessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment would it have been proper to widen the hole? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; nor did I trace what the operation of the fire would be—I saw the certain means of introduction from one room to the other, and my mission was ended—that was a hole which had doubtless existed for years—it had been the work of time since the house was built, or at any rate since it was floored—it is a common occurrence from the vibration—if the ceiling had been plastered in the last eight or ten years, probably it would have been filled up—a fireman was there, he assisted me in making these discoveries, but I did not know he was a fireman; he might have heard my observations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe the fire in the shop originated from the fire below? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My object was to see the possibility of the means of communi<lb/>cation, but with regard to the transit of the fire, I am not able to guess—I immediately arrived at the conclusion that the fire in the shop above originated in the room below, and that opinion is not now altered—I swear that in my judgment the fire in the shop above originated in the kitchen below, but if it was put to me that the tapes were not hanging there at the time, it would create a doubt; but presuming the things to exist then as they were left by the fire, that is my opinion—I express my opinion chiefly as to the mode of transit of the fire—I do not know what was behind the counter, or suspended over the ceiling, and I do not know the variety of draughts in the shop; these are matters upon which one has no doubt whatever, and it is my opinion that the fire in the shop originated in the kitchen below, but I do not say that it is founded upon any absolute or certain judgment—the hole above is opposite to the other; you might go at this hour and push up a small walking-stick—they are not exactly opposite, but a surveyor's rod or rule would pass from one to the other, or a small walking-stick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the fire originated in the shop below, the flame must have come through one fissure in the ceiling and then through the other fissure and burnt something in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not say, because the fissure might be filled with paper or combustible matter, which would be a vehicle of the flame, and which would no longer exist; but without that I consider that through those twelve inches which I suppose the flame would have to travel it could have travelled without any aid from combustible matter—I do not know whether the edges of the fissure in the shop were charred; the floor was so dark and covered with remains I did not examine them to see whether they were charred from fire, or from the embers about—I did not take the trouble to look whether the edges were charred, and I do not know whether in the present position that would be discoverable—it is possible that the flame would have gone through the fissure without considerably charring the edges, and so as to set fire to the tapes over it—I cannot tell how long the tapes were; they must have burned half their length—my theory is that the flame might have got through the crack, set fire to the tapes, and gone out without much charring the edges—on the lower edges the fire was clearly traceable, quite up to the fissure, and it was perfectly clean there and not like the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Stratford—on that Sunday night I was with Carter sitting on the same seat in a phaeton—I saw the prisoner come down the yard, he came and touched me on the knee, and said I should get pulled out if I sat there; I said, no I should not, I was not doing any harm—I did not see him move anything in the yard.</p>

Q.</hi> How many persons were in the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I and Carter, nobody else, that I saw, but the prisoner—I was close to Carter—when the prisoner spoke to me it was sufficiently loud for Carter to hear him—Carter sat more in the dark. <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS KINCHENDEN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 53). I am stationed at West Ham—on Sunday night, 27th May, Carter came to me while I was on duty in the Broadway—I went round to a place leading to the Romford-road—I saw the prisoner standing against the churchyard railings, he was in the act of drawing his arm through the railings—I said to him "You must go back with me to the Swan public-house and see the ostler"—he trembled very much, but he went back, and while I was trying to find the landlord and the ostler he ran away—I ran after him—he jumped over a garden wall and I lost him—I went back to where I had seen him—I got over the church-yard railings, and found there two brass taps and this ball, inside the railing—they were so near that a person standing outside could have placed them there—when I saw the prisoner there he was stooping down and drawing his hand out—I saw the prisoner again on the following night after he was taken in custody.</p>

I marked these five coats and three books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I marked some of them, and copied the marks off some of them—there were two other costs that I marked afterwards—there were five coats air in one parcel—I marked them all, about 6th April—I marked the books a little later—I missed them on 21st April; and the coats on 27th and 28th—I missed the whole—on 23d April I instructed Westbrook the officer to keep a watch on the house—the prisoner was given into custody on 18th May—I went the same day with Westbrook to search the prisoner's house—I there found three books and three coats—the prisoner had no authority to take those off the premises.</p>

I saw her go into the shop, and come out with something—she looked in at the window before she went in—I did not see whether Buchanan was there—she looked in at the window, and then went in—she had not anything with her then—she came out with a bundle which looked like a pledge parcel—it might contain one or two coats, nothing more—she took it to Buchanan's house; the house to which I subsequently went—I saw that done also on the 5th and the 16th of May—that was the last time—the same thing was done on each occasion—she remained outside sometimes a quarter of an hour before she went in—I cannot exactly say, because I saw her so many times, and when she did not go to his house, I did not take so much notice—I took him in custody on the 18th; I searched his house with Mr. Sharpe, and found the coats and books which have been spoken to—I produce a coat which I received from Mr. Hill—I found twenty-nine duplicates on the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Hart beer-shop, Blackheath—last Thursday evening, 7th June, the prisoners were there—there were other persons in the room; four civilians—the prisoners were wearing their belts—they appeared sober—four pots of fourpenny ale were called for—they drank it and gave some of it away—after they had been there about an hour, they had a cane-bottom seat which I thought they were going to break—that was about quarter or ten minutes to 10—I took it away for fear they should break it, and oue of them collared me and said, "You b----you shall not have it"—it was a seat to hold about three persons—I do not know whether it was either of the prisoners who collared me, but there were ten or eleven soldiers—when I say collared I mean seised by the throat—they all came round me—it was a soldier who caught me by the throat—Rogan jumped on the table and said something in Irish which I did not understand—they then all took off their belts and put them in their hands, muttered among themselves, and went outside the door, and one came back and broke a window—I shut up the shutters fearing there would be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and all came back and knocked at the door and the shutters, and one said, "Come on lads, let us have the b----out"—I did not go outside—that ia all I know of it—I believe it was McTaddon who broke the win<lb/>dow, but I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair dresser at Blackheath—on Thurs<lb/>day evening last, about half-past 10, I heard a noise and went outside my door—I saw a number of soldiers making a furious noise and flourishing their belts about—I only saw two policemen—I crossed over and stood as a looker on, perhaps ten minutes, during which time the language and the noise was frightful—they then gradually, by the persuasion of one of their party who tried to get them away, worked their way up on to Blackheath—I followed them there and then returned—I saw King, Rogan, and McTaddon there—McTaddon struck me with a belt on the head—I had seven or eight cuts on the top of my head from one and the other, but from him principally—I saw belts used—they came down the hill some few minutes afterwards with a most furious yell—I saw the shop shutters being shut up—I saw nothing that occurred previous to closing the shutters.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you quite sure you were hit on the head by McTaddon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the lamps were out—it was dark but we were close together—there was a great deal of pushing about—I had never seen him before—when I saw him again he was in custody; I knew him directly I saw him, and said, "That is the man who struck me"—King also struck me—I recognise those three, McTaddon, Rogan, and Connoway—I had a special constable's staff and struck some of them—I was called on by the police to interfere or I should not have done so—I only know by hearsay that they belong to the Donegal militia—they called out, "We will show them what the Donegal men can do"—I concluded that they were Irish by their brogue, but there was not time to think—from the time I first saw them going up the hill to the time they returned ten minutes did not elapse; it is not more than fifty yards to the top of the hill.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110099"/>
               <p>dozen militia-men—the first thing one of them did was "to break a window—I saw all the prisoners there—Rogan called to them to fall in, and they immediately fell in and marched down the street in a very furious manner, cal<lb/>ling out, "We will kill the b----English;" and striking at the shutters and everything that came near them—I collected some civilians together, and called upon them to assist me and prevent them doing further injury—Smith was one of them—we made a rush at them, overpowered them, and secured the first five, all except Houghay—I got struck several times with a belt on the face, head, and arm, but we managed to take these five to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Palin of Cross-street, Charlton—on Saturday evening, 27th April, my eon Thomas brought the prisoner home with him; he was a stranger to me—he came again on Sunday about 11, and stopped and dined—my son showed him two concertinas which were there—he left with my son after dinner, and came back by himself about 6 o'clock, and said that he wanted one of the concertinas, the highest noted one—I was up stairs, heard all he said, and came down—my youngest son said "Do you know which it is?"—he said, "Get them out and I will tell you"—Edward said, "Did my brother <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> tell you where to get it"—he said, "Oh yes, it is all right between your brother <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> and me, I am going to have one and my mate is going to have the other"—he went away with it, and in about ten minutes came for the second concertina—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> said he would not sell it; did my son <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> say you were to have it?"—he said, "Yes, it is all right; my first lieutenant is at the corner by the public-house; he is going to give me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the concertina, and I will give Tom 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and keep 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for selling it"—I said, "Very well," and let him have it, believing his statement—my son came home about an hour afterwards and I mentioned what had taken place to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Lewis, Cowan and Co. soap makers of Barnes, Surrey—Eddingt on has been in the habit of selling bones to me for the last four years—Bromley has been in my employ at various times, and had been taken into my employ within three or four days of this first transaction, 4th April—we have employed Carney some years; I believe he and Bromley are brothers-in-law—from something which took place on 5th April, I watched from the roof of the building—it is large building with a slate roof; you can see from the roof to the ground—it is about twenty feet high—the carts which delivered bones were brought to deliver them at the weighing-machine below which I could see from the roof—I commanded a view of the whole—I was watching, on 5th April, between 5 and 6 in the afternoon, when Eddington came with a cart of bones—Carney and a man named Biggs were weighing them—Biggs is a man who was in our employment, and left some weeks afterwards, and I have not heard of him since—he did not give us notioe to leave, nor did we give him notice—I do not know where he is; he left four or five days previous to 27th April—Mr. Parsons, the foreman, was also there—Carney and Biggs had to lift the bones on to the weighing-machine, and remove them after they had been weighed into baskets—Carney called out the weight to Mr. Payne, who en<lb/>tered it in a book; Eddington also checked the weight—on the whole of the bones being weighed and delivered, Eddington and Payne compare the weight, and on their agreeing Mr. White the cashier pays—Mr. Payne gives an order, either a leaf of his book, or a counterpart, which he tears out—that is Mr. White's authority to pay Eddington; it is a Voucher upon which the money is received—Eddington in this instance made his memorandum on the side of the building, where there was a piece of iron, with chalk—four baskets are employed—the cart is drawn within the building, conveniently near to the weighing-machine—two baskets are put on to the scale-board, and while they are being weighed, two others are being filled—it was the duty of Bromley and Carney to carry away the baskets of bones from the weighing-machine—on this occasion I observed that one basket was removed from the scale-board to the heap when two should have been removed—instead of moving the second they left it on the machine, and another full basket was put on—before the first basket was removed its weight was called out and booked—another full basket was then added to it, and that was weighed again, as if two baskets had been put on, so that the weight of one basket was called out twice—I saw that done five times, so that we were charged with five baskets</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110102"/>
               <p>more than we received—the weight of two baskets on the scale was called out on each occasion, and put down against me—after I had seen two baskets done that way, I called Mr. White, our cashier, on to the roof, and he came and saw the remaining three—the next occasion was the 13th, when I was in the same position, and saw the same process carried on—Eddington came with a load of bones about the same time—Carney and Biggs were at work, and I think Payne helped them, as he was anxious to get away—he had not helped before—I only saw one basket weighed a second time on that occasion—Biggs was receiving the baskets—on the 20th, Biggs, Carney, Eddington, and Payne were there—I saw one basket left on a second time, and when Mr. Payne came to check the weight, he said, "This basket has been weighed before, I remember it quite well"—the man said, "No, it has not"—but Payne quite was certain, and caused the basket to be removed, so that on that occasion we were not defrauded at all—on the 27th I went to the same spot—the three prisoners were present—Eddington came with his cart about the usual time—I saw that two baskets were left on, as on the previous occasion, the only difference in the process being this, that Mr. Payne stood here, and the basket was there—Bromley came to take the second basket; he put it so, and brought a new basket and put it so, and then took two marrow-bones, from one, and put them to the other, so as to disturb the top, and we were defrauded on that occasion of two baskets of bones—Eddington was assisting filling the baskets—he was standing by, and could see on each occasion what was occurring; he must have known it—he had a different number of baskets—he should have had two empty baskets, or two full ones, but he only parted with one full basket—the custom is to fill two at a time—it was Bromley that moved the baskets in that way—on the baskets being removed, they were taken to a distant heap—these were marrow-bones, and each basket was worth about 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are supposed to hold a hundred<lb/>weight, but they hold rather more—on the last occasion I came down from the roof, and as Eddington drove away with Bromley and several more, I went after them with Sergeant Smith, and came up with them at public-house about 200 yards off—I said, "There is something wrong in your bones, Mr. Eddington, and I wish you to come back"—he came, and we re-weighed the bones in his presence—I had put his bones into a distinct heap by themselves, to re-weigh them; all the marrow-bones that had been delivered—we found 2cwt. 27lbs. short—he said, "There is evidently some mistake; have any been taken up stairs?" Mr. Payne said, "No"—I went up stairs, merely to meet the remark, and there were none there—we had taken care previously that there should be no more bones in the place but what he brought—another customer was bringing in some bones at the time—we caused those to be re weighed also, in Eddington's presence, and found that there was no excess, but some few pounds deficient—those were marrow-bones—I then gave Eddington in custody.</p>

               <p>what was going on down below—I saw Eddington unloading his cart assisted by Carney, Biggs, and Payne—Eddington was sorting the bones from the cart, and Carney and Biggs were placing them on the scale—after weighing one of the baskets of marrow-bones was left on the scale and weighed a second time when another had been brought and put to it, and the weight called out again—Mr. Payne was standing at the tail of the cart—Eddington checked it with him—we paid for the weight that had been called that day—on 5th April I was called by Mr. Phineas Cowan, went on to the roof, watched with him, and saw the same men and the same thing go on as before—Mr. Cowan had been on the roof some little time—I saw three baskets weighed twice over—Eddington was assisting in filling them, and Payne was checking the weight as it was called out, and talking to Eddington at the tail of the cart—on the 27th I had had some money marked for the purpose of paying Eddington, as was previously arranged—he came there again, and after he had gone with his team I went to him and requested him to lend me what money he had—he left me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about three-quarters of an hour after they had finished loading, he brought a voucher from Mr. Payne for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for me to pay; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I paid him seven sove<lb/>reigns, one half-sovereign, six half-crowns, six shillings, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and a penny-piece—they were all marked except the penny—some of that money was afterwards brought to me by Lockyer and Smith, and I recognised it.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—on that Thursday evening my wife gave me a half-crown—I went after the prisoner and the other man; they were something like 150 yards from my house—I followed them and brought them back; I asked them if they were aware it was a bad half-crown that they had given to my wife—the other man said; "I know I gave you a light half-crown, but I did not know it was bad"—he said it was paid him by his master for wages on Saturday, and he had had it in his possession ever since—a policeman came in, and the prisoner and the other man were both searched at the bar in my house—there was no bad money found on them—there was good money found on both of them—one of them said he lived in the Grange in Wandsworth—the other said his name was Thompson—I said I was not satisfied, and I gave them io custody; the other man escaped while I went to put my boots on—there are two doors to my house, and he got out—the policeman went after him but he got away—while he was gone I took charge of the prisoner—on the following morning I found a shilling wrapped up in paper, precisely on the spot where the prisoner was searched—I gave that shilling to the constable, and the half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Jonathan Crocker and another, 86, Watling-street—I know Window by seeing him—I know Nash, he was in the habit of coming to our warehouse to fetch goods to calender—this piece is the property of my employers—no piece similar to this was ever sold in this state—Nash was in the habit of coming for property for his employers—these samples and patterns are such as we have—I went with the policeman to Window's house—he told me he bought the pieces of a man named Nash who worked for Baker, Upper Clapton, and that he paid him for them—I am quite sure this piece is the property of my employers—we never sold this or any piece in this state.</p>
